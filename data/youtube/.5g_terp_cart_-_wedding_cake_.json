{"0_OpxGziMYc": "oh gee shout to Ronnie ray and his grandma I love you guys [Music] [Music] [Music] this is for educational purposes only don't watch this video that's for over 18 don't smoke marijuana less your own my personal information alright know what's up guys running right back at you so I'm this video coming at you guys with another cart revealed video you guys seem to like these videos somewhere down below in the comments if you guys do it won't make any more but I think you guys been liking them so if you guys like to see my last video my last part review I did a pineapple express by the Brian Salette and I thought you guys I had a few different flavors in that video this video were actually doing the brown uh I mean not the parent but doing the same brand select but we're doing a wedding cake before I get further into this video I should have edited it edited into the beginning should have put it in the beginning in this video but if I didn't um so yeah I don't watch this video last week 18 or over 21 whatever the legal ages in your state or you have your medical card like I do Justina say that's just to cover my ass I can't get this channel deleted that would suck and uh I will probably cry so this video will do 1 select premium babes or the dad premium bait cartridges parts there we go so it's less premium vape aren't you just down here wedding cake you see it's tested at what 92.5 pretty much to half a gram car wedding cake hybrids pretty much 0% to a CBD you see make back up a little bit I feel like normally close up in your face um I gotta from Sky dispensary it was forty bucks for the UH half gram which is kind of expensive and the only reason I really got this well I mean it's really high quality so it's worth it to be honest but I like the a bit more like out of a Reagan [ __ ] and tends to be honest but pens are still nice life on the go at work or whatever the [ __ ] you know but um don't smoke at work that's bad but you know what I'm saying no and these are fire though but they're kind of expensive forty bucks for a half gram they're dope though because I'm like on the back of them if you haven't seen them it says all that so it you can pause it if you want but it says like what it tastes like what you're gonna feel it's supposed to taste sweet like vanilla kinda earthy it's gonna make you feel relaxed happy you know you're for euphoric [ __ ] I don't know why I'm struggling to say words right now it has a pretty much 4 milligrams of THC per serving and this vape or the card contains a 462 milligrams of THC so I'm guessing that's why it's only 92.5 the other what 7.5% is the missing but it's a 48 milligrams of THC I don't know but I said I was tested and all that [ __ ] you can see it again there it is for you guys one more time this is why I like the cards because it has all this information on them and then just the sides a simple plain and has the warning like it has to have you know I mean all that [ __ ] down here it just says what it's tested out again I'm right here just saying pretty much the ingredients no extra chemicals added just three penis Bob Loblaw I mean just a basic package and it's pretty dope though I like it a lot this is what I thought I found interesting it says home this was not this is pretty much on author cards at least the ones in Arizona I don't really cuz I know some of the packages are different but this one said um the suggested servant is one three second draw so like you hit it for three seconds you know what I mean and you're supposed to be able to get a 125 hits out of this half gram card so that's why the store even said um four milligrams per serving so like in that three second hit you're supposed to get four milligrams so yeah wedding cake hybrid I guess we talked enough about the packaging let's just hop into this so let's open this up the one thing that I normally don't like about the car that's like the packaging is like the front of it and all the detailing is good when you get inside of it you really can't you first open it like it literally looks like there's nothing in there you know I mean you gotta like last time doing something wrong I don't know shake that [ __ ] [ __ ] oh yeah once you get out um it's [ __ ] fire here's the part um keep in mind when I put my hand behind it because the lights I'm using it's gonna the the oriole is like really more it's like a lot more yellow on person but when I put my hand behind it it gives it kind of little more orange tint but it's still gonna look fire like you're gonna see but just keep that in mind that it looks a little bit more orange because my hands behind it so that it's branded selector right there on it that's the oil pretty thick oils you can see that it's moving moving moving moving it's moving like really slow but I mean that just mean kinda like with the Pens I like a lot of different [ __ ] that could be a bunch of different reasons that doesn't really mean that is far for certain but that's a good sign you know I mean but I already know the car as far as I know because I know this brand I've had my million times as far I'm just giving you guys a little tip um the consistency of your oil is if it's thick it's a good sign but that's not the only way I left you or doors like with you because I know there's a lot of fake hearts going around so there's like a little tip for you guys so what I'm going to be smoking this out of it so did you see my other video is just a select heart it's actually the same brand as the card at the des ID card this is the battery this is the card for so that's the same thing in Arizona they have crazy deals all the time because I have my medical card so I'm like I said they got by to get one for you in the cards they had they had buy a car get this for free before and I think this was like $30 if I'm correct I forget I I don't [ __ ] know but I got this for free and it's pretty dope it's like a little carrying case so it comes with the battery to charge you know that was flat for you to put your car's right there and then there was like a little card right here that says his life didn't got the whole three set 33 second hit bought like three second hit serving thing over the plug that was but yeah this is pretty [ __ ] dope I like this case a lot is in the best if you guys like these um court reviews time went down below in the comments like I said because I want to invest in a better battery if you guys like them because I really don't want to buy a better battery if I don't plan on making more of these videos because I don't smoke cards like literally on the regular too often so um I don't really need a better battery oh that's not I'm gonna make more of these videos so if you guys want more of these videos somewhere down below and I'll get a better bit a better battery so I can actually get like the full effect of different parts you know what I mean like the flavor hi all that all that [ __ ] you know I mean so um let's just hop into this now though so here's the Select battery you guys probably seen it if you seen my last videos if you haven't I don't know if you have or not so it just says select just regular stick battery and screw it in so we're gonna pop off a little silicone sheet screw this in and even though this is like a simple stick battery I love the way this looks like it has like that um classy like like fancy fancy look to it but it's still like like dope I don't know how to explain it you know what I mean like it looks kind of classy it's not gonna get all like you would see like a [ __ ] a businessman hitting this you know what I mean like it looked looks dope when you have like the same brand car on the select pen a bit sick that's my personal opinion again you guys can tell me what you guys think down below in the comments what did the packaging for this so it's supposed to taste sweet like vanilla and kind of earthy supposed to make me feel relaxed happy and your for your fork this is kinda exactly what I [ __ ] want right now so oh yeah let's get it alright so it's not into this look take the first set and I can tell you my first thoughts and opinions about how it tastes I already know it's gonna be fired but no no stop into it Vennela I taste the earthiness and I really taste sweetness right that's what I said right sweet yeah sweet but now our earthy I mean I get that earthy vibe not really but never sweet but definitely like I cannot I can I mean I smoked before I made this video um so I mean I was already high but I can already tell the difference I mean I only had one what was that like I mean I was bigger than their servants I don't know seven milligrams of THC so if anything it tastes more like um you know like vanilla extract like the [ __ ] you put in like food or like milkshake sometimes and [ __ ] like that vanilla extract it tastes more like that and [ __ ] like like I was thinking like vanilla ice cream or like you know any but no like would now live another but it doesn't know I don't get that icy earth and like maybe like well vanilla extract but it definitely does not taste sweet to me at all I don't know if there's any make sense how something can taste earthy and sweet at the same time at least to me tell me if that makes sense I don't know earthy and sweet doesn't seem like it really mixes personally I don't think that sounds like it does tell me what you guys think I don't [ __ ] know like I said I get like a hint of the vanilla I guess but it's more of like a vanilla extract then I'm like a pure vanilla flavor you know what I mean but it's definitely making me relaxed it's definitely um like making me calm and happy I mean like you see it I mean if you guys couldn't tell mine xiety was kind of bad in the beginning in this video but I'm kind of more relaxed now chill I'm just talking to you guys so that's definitely like effect that worked um you've worked yeah I guess I'm feeling a little year for you I don't know so yeah I guess the that the feelings it's supposed to give you gets the five out of five because I guess I feel all those mines I yeah I mean I guess that [ __ ] really did help with all of those I'm not gonna lie the only thing the taste it didn't taste bad so I'm not gonna give it a bad rating on the taste but from the packaging I wouldn't say it tasted too sweet and but now that earthy doesn't I don't know but that's just my personal opinion so just the packaging I'm gonna get that like a three out of five of their description of the flavor but the actual flavor so if I'll give like a 4.5 out of 5 because it has like a earthy taste it's not the best flavor but it's not the worst as far but yeah the high 5 out of 5 the look of the car the oil everything else gets a 5 um so the overall overall score of this car I'll give this card a [ __ ] a four and a half out of five alone it would be a five the only reason like I don't give it a five is because they're [ __ ] forty bucks for a half gram which is [ __ ] really really expensive I would rather wait rather just buy a [ __ ] I can get almost two grams of wax for that price so I'd rather just buy a [ __ ] wax and dad than buy one of these two grams for a half gram yet for sure so if there were a little bit cheaper thought that would get a five but just because they're 40 bucks for a half gram four point five out of five if you guys ever tried the brand select tell me down below in the comments what you guys think of them tell me your favorite strains your favorite flavor ease Oh a few guys before indica sativa z-- if you guys have any recommendations for me to try and yeah just anything you guys want me to do any video suggestions any of

down below in the comments when you guys think of it alright if you guys ever tried this flavor wedding cake let me know what down below in the comments what you think of it like I said it's far just

got to pick up a couple parts get wedding cake and I'm also about to grab our train Hayes or something like that but I'm gonna go grab two carts and then on my door review like usual although swaggy this way Corin C&I are some people like super cautious steel stick another wine but it's not as bad as when we go ahead last night he is why it shouldn't be much of a late a wait they got it like a little thing going on right now when you just you order online and then you get a time where you come pick it up at so I'm here at my time right now to pick it up I got the cards this is Ronald like I said wedding cake I'll just do some b-roll but another one ghost train hey that's what I got ghost train Hades I know something but I think welcome got like 81 percent to eighty seven percent I got both of them it was overall pleasant experience with the city Canada so give it like two thumbs up pretty simple I know this really fight doesn't matter to other people in other states it should like that because they're dispensaries aren't like that they don't operate like it's a banking [ __ ] but out here in [ __ ] Illinois act like the Spencer is our bank and you know there's like a security door behind a security door behind another security door what is good YouTube and we're back like I said I just got back from Windy City cannabis right now I got so this is what I miss using to smoke this is not a really cheap doesn't cost much at all pay my five bucks for it like I said ended up getting two carts I got like I said got wedding cake and the guy goes try and I used about 500 milligram how finally just short of what I usually do but this joint called and they don't costing me 65 on top of that I ended up paying my 75 attacks in other words so and I know what in other words robbery bro this is it right here waiting cake do some b-roll [Music] [Music] again this is Verano now use this sticks hit this [ __ ] that's that join us is it right here or on tone beep anyway this little thing screwed a [ __ ] in here reason why I got this one in particular could this convene I could just stick this in my pocket I'll take it with me looks to go it's smaller but yeah hey slow bro it's a smooth pen I just probably last me a month I use mine tickling too however they have much for you as far as like a player for flavor program which I taste this [ __ ] one more time I can't really taste much out of this I'm not really getting like a cake taste oh no matter like look up and let you guys know like whether that actually works I don't really taste nothing cake wise as far as like wedding cake but uh I do feel something is usually pretty instinct with cars it's just like this literally just like smoking flour which has been my experience still early just like smoking flour so yeah I just be starting to feel some already that first day I took what was pretty was pretty damn massive but yeah and that man I'm gonna let you guys know I like I said hey buddy taste it tastes just a bit sweet but I outside of that any taste nothing I'm for real but eighty percent THC it is a hybrid I saw an indica and sativa and yeah other than that miniature boy man I appreciate you guys supporting the content two channels still steadily growing steadily growing and I'm just nothing but appreciated appreciate it to you guys and I've been in my experience that Windy City cannabis I give it two thumbs up as far as like I had like a bad experience I went to security guard but outside of everybody was cool most people was cool just like one little bit it didn't really blow it I still recommend though they're cheaper than the ones are that's gonna say that cuz they have yeah overall great experience I give this to thumbs up with them filling it for sure outside that man should I pick although I'm out under that this pan yo and I feel like my face is melting off right now", "8yWpvcl5SUY": "welcome to community canvas reviews today i'm going to be reviewing a white label live resin cartridge um i had a bezel i think it was or bevel one of the two um bezel there we go i had a bezel distillate cartridge in and i just kind of got bored of it honestly because the terps are not very strong part of it being um they're not cannabis derived terpenes so live resin should spice that up um the live resin that i got is actually less terpy than the uh or it has less terpenes total we'll see what it tastes like anyways but less total terpenes than um uh cured resin surprisingly but either way we'll try it out it's wedding cake which is an indica this is cultivated by green queen farms and it comes in at 84.05 total cannabinoids um and 5.39 total terpenes um yeah so i'll read the terpenes and show you what it looks like but first let me flip the camera around for you [Music] uh [Music] all right let's try this out step one take off the sticker all right um first that's the thing about some good live reds and this um just some i don't know yeah some just good live resin cartridges i can smell that one no leakage whatsoever perfect seal that just smells nicely very sweet and almost like perfumey that's some interesting elements there so it's got a pretty basic um oh yeah that's it's got painting in there a bit smells kind of piney slash perfumey mostly but the leading terpenes and are the basic um are pretty standard beta cardio filling at two point zero four two percent uh limiting at one point five percent humiliate at zero point six percent um beta mir seen at 0.5 alpha pinene at 0.18 cedrine at 1.7 or 0.17 um alpha vista bologna at zero one point zero point one six and finch all at 0.127 so they always have a very detailed um terp list right there but usually a lot of the ones at the end are in pretty low amounts i don't think i can ever really taste them that already smells like it's gonna be way better than the other one was so um got two uh little silicone caps and the branding on this is c cell c240 620 but yeah proper c cell so that's always good um so first thing it's very very clear and light that happens with some white label um i think part of them being just like they they get stuff from different cultivators a whole lot just depends on who cultivated it what the starting material was like i think and white label actually as far as i know white label means like whenever there's um a producer doing white label extracts it means that they're doing extracts for other growers stuff instead of their own stuff so i think they've just made a name of that and that's just like their process but that's usually what that means so um i answered on reddit recently somebody posted a live resin cartridge by white label that was also very clear and wondering if it was real and also they had someone tell them that it was delta eight but they also said it looks like it has delta eight terpenes in it which if you know much about cannabinoids that's not even how that works so um but they came on reddit to verify it and i posted some cured resin and live resin that looked similar and that's just how white label is sometimes i don't know if it's crc i know they seriously well i don't know that but i'm pretty sure they crc some of their dabs so maybe they do their cards as well um i've never had a card that was remotely bad they always put out really good stuff and it's priced a little higher than some of the other stuff i get so i don't get it as often but part of that is it's higher quality too so i don't think they do it badly so all right so here's wedding cake yeah that smells it's just like a general sweet smell it's um i feel like there's like a very even smell of like the pinene and it's like limonene and something else that i don't know which i actually want to say is one of these terpenes in a lower amount and i definitely smell pining at 0.184 so i think i'm smelling one of these other ones either alpha cedric and alpha visceral or pinchol um i'm pretty sure finch all taste i've had finching which i assume is pretty similar just in this last buddies card i had and that was very like like so i don't think it's that probably i've had uh visible alone i think that's pretty sweet and i don't know about cedrine let's see about taste and smell okay upon hitting it you just get a very a much more pronounced and very standard like weed taste um i say that like it means a lot um a very just like nice balance between uh earthy and herbal and like um vaguely like musky taste to it uh not really musky someone says like the other two though um yeah it just tastes like weed usually does for most streams and don't stand out anyways uh that's how i remember wedding cake to be too i've had wedding cake from a couple different producers never a live resin so that's kind of cool but i've had select elites and that's just distillate with their terpenes and tasted pretty similar yeah so um it's not a a real standout strain to me um things like that are like mandarin cookies and like or tropicana cookies was a really good one or blueberry muffin um things like that usually stand out more to me than like wedding cake where sometimes you have strains that really do taste a little bit like what they're named and then you have stuff like wedding cake where i feel like there's maybe more behind the name or they just thought oh that's a good name for it or something like that um sounds pristine or primo or something like that very good very good but doesn't taste quite like wedding cake and the terpenes don't really stand out to me yeah those terps linger very nicely um very present unlike the non-cannabis drive terpenes that were in the last one that's why i switched it out though um i'll have the other one as a reserve in case i run out or can't get any more or something but wow this is nice and the effect on it very nice and full body too um a really good live rise and that's a good thing about the stream too is it um it's just well-rounded very well-rounded so sometimes something being well-rounded enough can make me be interested in it a little more if it doesn't stand out because sometimes that's what i'm looking for like right now for example and the perks of having a proper c cell at that vapor production all right so that's hitting pretty nice i'm getting some aftertaste again but i think it's some of those terpenes or maybe just all the mixing together but it's nothing really strong it's just so so much of like so little it's hard to describe but mostly just like um i'm getting some herbal tastes and some earthy taste like i said and i'm also getting like a weird i almost want to describe it as like how talcum powder smells that's a weird freaking thing but like it's like a very like reminds me of like a rocky taste or something i haven't tasted rocks so i don't know but that's what i imagine rocks to taste like i don't know if that's uh it's not a bad thing too it's very interesting i have to wonder what um alpha cedrine is like the effect is very nice and terps are just they stand out very nicely as they should with some live resin so yeah i think i'm starting to repeat myself a bit so i'm going to close it out here with some smoke rings at least one of those was a ring i'm pretty sure alright thanks for watching uh like and subscribe if you want and stay tuned and um yeah i'm a lot more interested in the cured resin this one's kind of a placeholder but the in the cured resin is a josh d strain which i've done a little bit of reading about because my name is josh as well so i thought that was interesting enough and he has some pretty good uh good-looking stuff and it's a josh d strain extracted by white label and it has more terpenes more cannabinoids more thc cbd um all of it really just seems like a better cartridge honestly it was cheaper i probably should have just got two cured resin cartridges um but yeah stay tuned for that one that'll come around in the next day or two so thanks for watching like and subscribe and stay tuned for more", "8AOPeuZwq8w": "[Music] what up what up everybody it's your boy deuce once again today before I start this video I just want to say thank you to everyone who is still continuing to watch the channel be sure to keep spreading the love you know tell a friend to tell a friend like I said before wiser Minds television the channel will only get better for everybody who's sticking with me and still watching I'd like to welcome you guys to my wiser Minds familywize your mind swag game yeah y'all my brainiacs man I'm real thankful to everybody who's been rockin with me so I just thought I'd get that out the way before I start today in this video it's gonna be another segment of Kronik chronicles but I'm gonna be reviewing another vape cartridge um this as you can see if you can't see this is a full gram cartridge not the half gram this is by heavy hitters let's not really focus in too well but this is about heavy hitters this is a hybrid not sure if you can see it still okay I tried and didn't work but yeah this is a hybrid strain and I'm gonna try using this battery that I have here my blue battery um it's cool because now like the club everything that you guys get it's all childproof so you don't have to pay for the bags and stuff like you did at the beginning of January and this one here you just the same as the Select cartridges they have like a little thing you push in on the side this one you just push in the little back part there you go and now it lets you you know open it but if you don't you're not gonna be able to pop this top off well yeah man late I know that let me know um this which you can also look on the back it tells you the percentages and everything I'll read them off to you guys because I'm not getting this to focus too well THC as you know that's what gets you high that is weighing in at eighty four point two percent and it does have a little CBD also thus for more it's more of the medicine i'ma try to pop this top off oh it's pretty easy it's like you unfold the top and then pop it up and this one comes with a little block at the top oh you can use this as a mouthpiece so I'm gonna do that because usually like when you put on your lip chap and stuff like that when you go to hit these like you can get it all over the silver part and the cleaner just looks like a little foggy and you don't you you want to have like a clean little P little technical you know a pin but yeah man this is the cartridge as the look have you hit her symbol there sorry you guys can't see I'll try to get better at focusing in on things but I know they let me know this is a cross between Girl Scout cookies and some Oh Oh Girl Scout I believe is Girl Scout cookies and cherry pie but matter of fact I got my phone so I could go in and actually see for sure but yeah they they know that like I'm at the club I'm a I'm a heavy indica type guy and I do mess with the sativas in hybrids but mainly indicas and they let me know always like what what a new strain I always ask about new strains I ask about new things and they just let me know that this was crossed with you know something pretty good earlier once they told me what it was crossing with I'm like oh yeah you you saw me already plus I've heard like I said of wedding cake before in this stream but umm if you guys need any information like you can go anywhere type in on Google um and find out about different strains but I like to use Leafly it gives you like a lot of information pictures everything let you know how this train is gonna make you feel everything oh here's wedding cake alright so it has 4.6 stars out of 5 198 reviews and oh this this strain is also known as pee cookies all right so it's cross like I said is Girl Scout cookies and cherry pie so this is fire some fire I'm pretty excited to go ahead and get this warmed up if you guys are watching this video and you got something um go ahead and spark up with pin blunt drink bong boughs whatever go ahead man if you're 18 up 18 and up and spark up with me y'all cheers let's see what this does [Music] I'm very very big his like I told you guys before in the Select review these pins I love them because they give you a whoa they give you a big hit and the reason like I said I smoke backwards and sometimes I like that you know that that hit that kind of cave your chest in like you know because sometimes I don't know I don't I don't I like coughing when I slow they say you're not smoking if you're not choking and a lot of people be like oh you you a sucker you a nerd for choking on the Wii but Brooke come on now let let me enjoy myself and medicate you feel me like come on brah that's how everybody be like when you be doing really all this man got the baby lungs shut up Rob can you fill me up living out here I'm doing me but leave me alone let me be but anyway man yeah I feel like with these pigs with this specific one here heavy it I know I noticed you see I'm still coughing off of that just that hit I noticed this makes me kind of feel later on like after I smoke it for a while it makes me feel like I took a DAB or something in a lot of people like that about depends I I mean I do I just like experiencing different things with the Pens on like always let my body get used to the same thing I like to try to you know like I said experience new things meaning why not but ya may not let it taste of this um it has some a similar taste um of it was a pink pushpin that I got it wasn't pink cookies like they said in that description so you know it was different it might have been crossed with the same thing or something but our you know it could have been in the same family not sure exactly what it was crossed with but it does have a similar taste not sure if it's just their oil but but the oil in the cartridge does taste really good like it doesn't have that wick taste doesn't have that burnt taste none of that like this just tastes straight like flour it tastes like medicine and man I'm telling you this is the best thing for when you want to go the half grams now they're going for about like I said in the last video you could walk out what about $35 depending on how the tax is in your area the tax here right now is horrible but um I walk out sometimes paying about $40 honestly for a cartridge but the cartridges last you a long time I like to medicate a lot but at the same time I don't I don't try to try to outdo myself like everyone does just just to be like oh I'm the highest like you feel me i medicate to a certain extent once I feel like I'm fine I'm fine I don't try to overdo it and do too much cuz you know I even got you know some people that I used to hang with like a lot of people I used to hang well always used to be like oh brother you can spark up another spark another and don't get me wrong it's nothing wrong with token up you feel me if but if I got something to do and I got to be on the move I'm not trying to be just stupid stupid lit to where I can't dang near function I don't want people to think like oh he just smokes just to just to smoke cuz I really smoked to Medicare I'm not trying to complain and do too much but I got a lot of problems with bones that I've broken and things you know that ain't right so I like to medicate and I don't like taking the medicine that they give give me the pain pills the narcos and all that when I was young I experienced experience might have my experiences with those and man I don't like it a lot of the medicines have a lot of side effects I'm I've gained a lot of weight taking different medicines and I just feel like hey the flour is the right thing for me like it helps it's been helping all this time and now it's legal so I'm glad like that my family is kind of more like open about it and is like adapt into it because I first like when they found out about me smoking before you know they were they then was curious they just really didn't want me to get nothing that was laced oh really which you could understand that I mean everyone everyone's parents our elders will feel like that they don't want you to you know go down the wrong path period so I understand now but it is it's cool to see how things have changed it's just you still have to know what you're getting because a lot of people are putting a lot of additives and things that you don't need like just let the medicine be we do not need all the additives and things like you know that's killing you why but anyway man like I really really cannabis is for me cannabis is for me and I feel like everyone that I connect with I mean we do connect through cannabis like that that's how others feel also I'm not the only one who feels like that it's just I've had my like I said my experiences with the drinking when I was young I don't like drinking like the drinking brings day you know it brings the devil out of me you know I get real rowdy real real sick and yeah man I'm like that I end up blacking out stuff like that edibles my word saved that for another video but edibles is also my thing in moderation I'm depending on you know the the milligram of milligram count or how many milligrams are any thing I have to switch the battery just because I'm not sure if this one is dying but um it stop stop heating up what I like to do I wasn't doing it at first but I like to hit the button and hit it for about five seconds and let it heat up so you know you get that good hit and you don't gotta just you know keep holding it for a long time and in hitting it because sometimes it you know this this part of the battery will heat up and you don't want it to overheat they say like once you do take a hit let it um let it let it breathe for a minute just to you know kind of cool back down you don't want these batteries overheating it or anything because you don't have to just go waste your money and get another one or you either you just wasted your money on the cartridge you're gonna be that type of person like oh [ __ ] that I don't even want to go and get one cuz I know that's how I am a lot of the time I'd be like [ __ ] told you can walk this no more I know I probably won't you'll see some videos of me smoking um but I won't be smoking too much because those videos I have to set an age restriction and I'll age restriction and I want everybody to be able to look at the videos you know I don't want it to be restricted to anyone so you probably see me vaping more doing vape reviews and things like that more than burning up the flower but I mean you're still gonna see me reviewing flower just because you know why would it not but yeah it's just gonna be a variety you'll see me like more on camera smoking my opinion just because you know that's not you know it's not a against YouTube some restrictions and things are there guidelines well yeah man continue to like comment continue to subscribe if you

or you would like to see any more vlogs any other type of content be sure to let me know my social media you know will be in the description and also at the end of the video yeah man um I thank you guys once again for tuning in to another segment of Kronik Chronicles thank you for tuning into wise your minds television wish your boy news I'm signing out [Music] [Music] you", "sU8lInunbZU": "yo yo yo guys what is going on we were back for a third video in a row told you guys I'm back I'm not going anywhere who should I keep grinding this out first things first again thank you guys we had a thousand four hundred and something subscribers or something like that so I'm crazy still working out sponsorship stuff like that some dumb stuff but uh ya know it's all in the works it's all the works uh yeah other than that I just want to say thank you guys you guys are awesome but yeah so it's for today's car I have two different ones I don't know which one I wanna give to you guys or review for you guys this one cuz it's late at night so we'll do the end because so we could sleep on right so this one right here there's a sticker on it but it says key relief um there's a couple states that actually have this dispensary Arizona I think Wisconsin somewhere back east I think they're pretty popular back east yeah there's like four or five in Arizona for cure leaves and this is their in-house carts so I think they think normally they run 25 or $30 a piece no I'm sorry they're $30 a piece for these parts they're half gram $30 right and today they were running a deal not gonna show you this one oh no that's this one I want to show you that one so I got two of them for the price of one so I got two for 30 years or one for 15 basically that being said let's go ahead and I mean let me read this out real quick oh I didn't even tell you guys the strain this one the strain is called rainbow Jones I've never heard of that scream if you guys have let me know this is coming at d 9 t HC % is eighty two point five six so not super high the THC percent isn't posted on here or THC a percent I'm sorry well other than that I guess let's pop or open and start reviewing it mmm comes without you know your standard little boxes with your little corner in them she can keep the carton it comes in this little tube too I've noticed that a lot more courts are coming in Dube to do basically for whatever reason I don't mind it though it's nice it's never bad to have a couple extra Dube tube saying you know I mean so my first impression it's kind of sticky on the outside so I don't know if it's leaking or not I hope not could just be the metal and stuff just like the finishes but sup it's actually really nice looking card guys right here so on the front there you got the little leaf logo right that's the airs and then you got that key relief writing frame wow that's it this is a really gorgeous looking card not even gonna lie I don't think I've ever been turned on by a car but this one comes with your standard little rubber stopper on the bottom I don't have any nails tell my nails so it's just dancing alright so you guys go see the wax like like a good weed to be reviewing it's not focusing of course cuz I have a phone but you know no bubble though not the biggest fan of it not the biggest fan the other one has that too all half-korean cards have them usually full grams are a little bit better but yeah this oil looks gorgeous though super thick it's not running no bubbles except for that one gorgeous like gold color to it so it's go ahead and pop it on the good old booze battery I don't know where my only one is and it won't charge for some reasons so we're just gonna stick it with this one alright guys first hit of the night guys Cheers okay well okay okay so the only flavor you get out of that excuse me hydration break wow man I don't really get yourself going man well that was a great hit um oh so first impressions off that first one big fan I highly recommend it already but we'll keep going with the review you know if you want to stick it out and you know keep looking hmm then he said hydration brakeman oh well some yeah this car is pretty dang nice this is an indica so hopefully slumped me out a little bit I'm gonna go watch a horror movie or something after this chill relax that's distress that trip hi his funky some toasty nose you already muggy let me gonna let me know what you guys favorite uh like food or snack and beverage so give me like one food item edible item and one beverage right to eat and drink when you're stoned or just smoking or hot boxing or just any situation what your high right what are your go to edible items that are non marijuana you [ __ ] drug addicts yeah I was talking about edibles no no so now marijuana have food or drinks not marijuana world there's THC drinks you know yeah a little zoink you guys let's do it all Cheers it's a great hit from the thin by the way that is a solid asset real well for $30 for two of them I'm not usually guys $30 for two of them is not a bad deal at oh wow I think okay except for like first time patient deals and like that that one video I did were it was like I got four cards for like 24 dollars or something like that besides those like really crazy deals like the wild wild ones like that one for for 424 so it came out six bucks a card this is the cheapest I've ever got a card like a real dispensary card because $15 for a half gram some of you guys live it up in like Michigan and [ __ ] isn't Michigan I don't remember who just legalize weed for the like me I cannot figure it out at all but um I heard somebody told me like half gram carts there we're going for like 60 55 $60 or some [ __ ] like that dude I love marijuana but I cannot spend that much on weed so getting carts that are 15 dollars for a half gram so probably like 30 $40 for a full gram would be insane and so many people would have some more access to it and hopefully one day we can get that figured out maybe I mean concentrate like dabs and stuff that's not that bad I mean flour is pretty pricey you can get yeah it depends depends on your tears but you know there's a lot of variables of course but I don't know I hope one day they forgot a way to maybe if it becomes federally legal they'll be able to lower the prices because they're a little high yeah um I also want to know if you're still here what is your favorite brand of Kart or like if you don't have like a favorite brand like what's your favorite strain like across across the board for all the brands um I don't have favorite strain to be honest I make these reviews and I review these cards just to tell you how they are and then I just completely forget so that's something alright let's do number three oh that reminded me of my girlfriend Leslie you should kept doing this to me I don't know why anyway guys I am I'm really I um if you live in any state that has a key relief dispensary that's uh oh so that's these guys right here hey they're key relief I'm just so [ __ ] stupid that's your logo that doesn't even say their name I am so sorry and I gotta grab my iPod so rate purely great store they're running pretty great deals um you get 20 area for every twenty dollars you spend you had a dollar back so that's pretty cool so I got eight dollars off for these things I spent like [ __ ] 26 bucks for two close what's can't go wrong all right well fair shot ask you your [ __ ] dope you're better than all the other people Logan see you on the next one deuces", "ll3hfYj9Bco": "don't really have a plan as to how i'm going to turn a sheet cake into wedding cake but i thought it would be a fun crazy idea i accidentally dropped this one on the floor when i went to buy it at the grocery store and they were like oh no no don't worry i'll get you a new one i was like no no it's okay they were very confused as to why it was okay that i had an all damaged and smudged birthday cake but i figure i'm gonna scrape off the icing anyway so why throw it out my goal is at the end of this to have a really stunning wedding cake like an expensive wedding cake oh it's all yellow there's like barely any white oh my god i don't know if we're gonna use much of this icing because it's all colored i might have to just use extra white icing but i was thinking wedding cakes are like the most extravagant cake there is like if you're gonna like they always are the most expensive the most extravagant i thought what is the least extravagant and that's like a slab birthday cake at a grocery store so can you take one and turn it into the other so this is the only bit of white icing the rest is colored which i'm surprised i thought there was only like a little bit of colored icing in these things apparently a lot of it is and i don't know who leveled these cakes because like look at this corner look at how much lower it is from this corner my thought is i'm gonna try to cut out six inch rounds and eight inch rounds if i can get that out of it this is supposed to be a nine by 13. this is eight inches so clearly that's not nine inches i was hoping that i can get that out of it corner to corner but i can't this is definitely becoming a bigger challenge but you know what it's okay i'm not afraid of a little bit of a challenge it's gonna be fine okay that works definitely a lot smaller than i wanted it to go but hey maybe this is better because before if i cut it out of the corner i'd have these droopy cornered edges because all of their edges are very droopy whereas this it's gonna be a lot straighter i don't have that much experience making wedding cakes i've made a few i know a little bit about making wedding cakes but like this is probably the third wedding cake i've ever made oh no no stop it stop it and sure that one doesn't do it hopefully i'm cutting straight i feel like i was going on an angle there oh my god it's going to be the worst if i go to stack these and they're like the cake scraps i'm thinking about making like little parfaits with them i feel like this is a craft project but with cake can you feed me i don't want to get my hands no i'm not gonna feed you but i don't wanna get my hands sticky oh no you got to come in frame [Music] [Laughter] this is not my job they take a bite they go there you go i'm trying to make a cake why is this the only tier where it ripped off i got that cake and that cake to make a tear and then i've got this cake and this cake so i've got this small cake board because when you tear cake you need to have the structure in it so that way it doesn't fall apart and get all droopy on you so i'm gonna put this one on here so i can start crumb coating it and fill it on this one because in between these two layers i want to do like a really yummy filling in each cake that's gonna have a different flavor i'll decorate this one on its final cake board i'm gonna use a big one because it's gonna be easier when i go to smooth out the cake even though it seems like super large and extra and to make sure the fillings don't squeeze out of it i've got all this extra icing i took off the cake that i can create this moat to kind of hold it all in i'm just really hoping that these cakes don't slide around because i got like a custard and strawberry filling like custard is very soft almost like pudding so i can see it wanting to slide and the other layer i'm doing a lemon curd with fresh raspberries so both of them were going to be like slippery icing so everything's just like not gonna wanna hold the structure which typically you need a wedding cake too i really think that those flavors are gonna work and it's gonna add to the cake there's not much i could do with the flavors because obviously it's just like vanilla cake and vanilla icing but at least that's gonna add that like i don't know i find like fresh fruit and cakes help amp up the flavors and then the cream and everything just because wedding cakes always have i don't know i feel like more special special flavors than just vanilla i'm still using the icing that came with the cake the ice cream off trying to crumb coat it trying to fill it trying to do as much as i can with that i was hoping i could ice this entire cake with that icing but like they were mighty skimpy on that icing this no longer looks like a grocery store cake right we've got a pretty nice tall i like the height because like wedding cakes always have height to them i'm so thankful that i awkwardly ask the cashier if they sell extra icing on the side because they do and this whole tab was like 11 bucks and i'd be completely screwed right now because this would end up being a naked wedding cake because i did not have enough icing not at all enough to like fill it enough to crumb coat it but i need more to ice it so i'm gonna do the top tier this like kind of pink with like a little purple undertone to it and then the bottom tier i want to do like a dark navy gain dark colors is so hard you have to add so much food coloring so i'm gonna see how dark i can go really feeling these colors i think they're gonna look nice together i just didn't want to do well actually not i did kevin didn't want to do the classic wedding color which is just like white with flowers he's like that's too easy let's try to do like a trendy modern different wedding cake yeah like so boring it's just like a classic wedding cake but it does make this more of like a dramatic difference from like the white slab cake so that's what we're doing now i just need to try to like perfectly ice them before i tear them i haven't tiered a cake in years i want to say years i don't remember the last time i teared a cake i think i made a video of tearing a cake and that's probably the last time i tear because i don't make tiered cakes my goal is just to ice the cake perfectly smooth or as smooth as i can get it without going crazy [Music] these are like bubble tea straws and this is what you can use to your cake you can also use dowels and i'm not going to use a lot because the cake is really light so i think i'm only going to use three and you just have to stick them down into the cake cut it level and now since that cake has a cake board underneath that that little silver one that i did once i've tiered it the weight is gonna be on the tea straws and on the cake board and not on the cake itself not on this cake so it's not gonna like collapse kevin this is your fault this is your fault i was like see how unlevel this one is usually i cut all three at the same time the same height he's like yep you've had problems getting level that way you usually cut them too sharp but then they're all the same height i don't want to do this at all i hate tearing cakes for these reasons usually when you do it's fondant you can kind of if you put your hand on it it's no big deal or even buttercream to put your hand on you can kind of smooth it back out if i touch this when i go to tear it my whole hand print is just gonna be smushed into the cake and it's gonna be impossible to repair i'm gonna drop it i'm gonna drop it kevin why am i so nervous i feel like i've built it up i've built it up too much kevin don't make noises kevin it's a little off scattered i think i need to fix the centeredness of it but like not bad who tears the cake with whipped icing this little envelope was sixty dollars for gold leaf i have never worked with gold leaf before but i thought it would look stunning with this cake so we're gonna figure this out together because i have no idea how to work with it but it's just super expensive i had no idea is that costly i think you just was like sticking on the cake i seen some people do it with like paint brushes i've seen other people just like you know they just kind of like dab it onto the cake dab dab dab dab dab maybe i should test this on just like buttercream on the table before i start like smashing against my cake oh see that kind of worked first time doing gold leaf and i'm already a master i love it it's so pretty okay i'm obsessed with the gold leaf and apparently there's like two dollars we're like add it up there's about two dollars of the gold leaf on there so that's not too bad and i bought the orchid and these roses to be able to do flowers on it i'm really sad that we're going to chop the work it up and i feel like it's going to be really pretty and then i'll just rebloom with fresh flowers any time that i've worked with them you have to be careful because obviously it's a plant and usually when they grow stuff like this they use pesticides and you don't want to just stick them right into the cake so what i've learned is you're supposed to snip them nice and short and then cover it in this floral tape and that's going to help protect it it's not that sticky but it's like as you pinch it tight it sticks to itself see pretty and you just get to stick them into the cake so i'm going to do the rest of these and then put them all onto the cake [Music] hi there i just sent over a picture of a cake i wanted quoted yep it's that one okay awesome thank you so much i appreciate it okay bye 450. my grocery store cake is worth 450. oh god it's so beautiful please like and subscribe because this was a lot of work and without further ado here's the grocery store wedding cake you", "ubx_A3NmzNM": "Bammer TV welcome back to Bamber TV weed reviews where we review the best strains around today we have another really awesome hybrid it known as wedding cake so can't wait to talk about that today but if you guys want to check out some of our other weed reviews we do have a playlist with all of our reviews and you can find that in the description and on the screen right now Dave I got to ask you though wedding cake so wedding cake is also known as pink cookies and it is a cross between cherry pie and Girl Scout cookie and it's known for having a sweet aroma and having a very nice flavor profile with some peppery and piney notes in there as well it's also remarkably high in THC testing in the high 20s very consistently alright and right away wedding cake is exactly what I look for in weeds it's very dense so when you grind it up you're gonna be surprised on the yield the smell is also very sweet-smelling but not none of the berry notes that you would find in other sweet strains wedding cake for me is just something that I love smoking and for Dave and I we actually chose a steamroller so steam roller kind of a cross between a bong in a bowl and definitely gives you that giant hit and very flavorful as well to go along with the amazing flavor and aroma of this weed it is remarkably medicinal it's fantastic if you have stress and depression and if you need a little bit of mood enhancement in your day this is gonna be the strain for you all right Dave so a strain that is both dense flavorful the aroma is there I'm assuming this is gonna be on the higher end of the spectrum but Dave I gotta ask you today Bama rating for wedding cake we really hit all the high points on this weed I really enjoy the fact that it doesn't give you too much cottonmouth and it really doesn't make your eyes too dry and all of that in company together with the flavor and the density I really have to give this a 4.5 out of 5 which makes it tied for first place on our channel alright guys so there you go if you're looking for a flavorful hybrid I think wedding cake is a pretty good choice from us guys if you want to check out some of our other reviews we do have a we'd review playlist on the description let us know how we're doing here on Bammer TV and for everything else weed and weed related keep it here on Bammer TV

(laughter) - And what color am I wearing? - White.\n- And why do people where white sometimes? - I don't know. - Why would they wear that, Logan? - Marriage thing? - Oh, there you go. - They made a cake that's\njust like our wedding cake. - What? - Close your eyes. - I think we have to close our eyes.\n- Oh, us too? - Close your eyes.\n- OK. - Oh!\n- Oh my freaking gosh. - No, don't touch it. - Oh my God. - That's pretty good.\n- Yeah. (laughter) - [Dad] It's a close resemblance - [Mom] Yes. - Do you remember your wedding? - I do. - You tell me. - It raining, and it was on the beach. - At Hawaii. - You're right. - I remember the wedding book. - Oh look, that looks like the same cake. - [Mom] I know exactly. - Wow. - So, we had to feed 250\npeople at this wedding. So, there's four layers, and there's two, there's a, what they call,\na bride and a groom cake. Isn't that neat? This cake does not feed 250 people. This cake had two. - There was only like maybe, what, 12 people at our wedding. - But it was awesome\n- Really? - Yes. - How many people do you\nwant to be in your wedding. - 100 and million. - Wow.\n- 'cause you're popular, huh? - Yeah. - Let's eat.\n- Yes, let's eat. - Do you take the knife? - Why, I think we both do, I don't know. - OK, guys, come on.

Oh, I get the first slice. - And I think we actually\nused our fingers, and we fed it to each other. We had to link our arms, and feed it. And there's a picture,\nif you'd like to see. There it is. (laughing) - That's hygenic. - Did we feed to each other? - We might have, but sometimes people smash into their faces, until like, I could smash it into daddy's face. - I knew better than to do that. - OK, feed it to each other. Yay, you guys are brothers. Do you wanna see how it's really done. - The stuff that brides where. - A veil? I didn't wear a veil, I had two braids. - Wow, that's beautiful. - What are you doing, mom? - Just seeing what you\nlook like in a veil. - Did you dance at your wedding? - We did, daddy and I... - We had to take lessons. - Yeah we had to take lessons, because daddy and I don't\nknow how to dance slow. - The lady that gave us dance lessons, she had pet ferrets. - All over her apartment. - It was because we\ndon't know how to dance. Like, at all. - They just taught us how to dance, that's all\n- How to just do a slow dance. - You remember?\n- No. - No, I don't think so. - You wanna try? - Yeah, OK. - You know what I'm doing right now? - What?\n- I'm picturing those ferrets, lookin' at me. - So why did you decide to marry my mom? - When two people fall in love, they get married and wanna start a family. - Why would they do that? - So they can have kids like you. - You were a surprise. Just saying. (Laughing) - Why'd you wanna marry mom? Long story? - I had a coworker, and he had\nsaid he had a single friend, and he asked if I wanted to\nmaybe go on a date with her. - And the day before we\nwere supposed to go out, daddy got nervous and thought\nit was not a good idea. So he sent a text and he\nsaid I don't wanna go out, and she had never got the text, I sent it to the wrong person, so had I sent that text, mom and daddy, probably never would have met. - And then you wouldn't be here. - Say what? - [Interviewer] One text. - Was it hard to commit? - I think obviously it wasn't that hard if we decided to get\nmarried after a month. - Wait, a month after you met? - He proposed? - A month and change. - That is really really weird\n- Now don't do, what we do. - What?\n- Nothing. - Are you guys, like more in love? - Of course.\n- Of course. - Why do you keep looking at me? Go to him. - Great question. - I fall more and more in\nlove with you everyday. You're a good daddy, and a husband. - Oh. - Have you ever thought\nabout getting married? - No.\n- I've heard that you did ask someone in school. - You want me to tell them\nthe jokes that I told you to tell the girls? - Yes.\n- You say, hey girl are you tired? 'cause you've been running\naround in my mind all day. Say, hey girl. - You don't say that to people, Frank. - How old are you gonna\nbe when you get married? - Maybe 10. - I don't think so. - How old were you guys? - 27.\n- I was 26. - How old do I have to be when I get married?\n- Well legally, you can get married when you're 18. - OK, then I'm gonna do it when she's 18. - Caylan, how about you, when\nare you gonna get married? Who are you gonna marry? - Never, and never. - Yeah he doesn't like girls. - Would you be OK if I never got married. - Of course.\n- I just want you to be happy. - I'd like to give a toast. Cheers to sending text to wrong numbers. - Cheers. - One more thing before, we take this. - Do it, do it! - Oh nice.", "G7TlxsAHCYM": "hi it's ashley from sweet dreams bake shop and welcome to my a thousand subscribers video [Applause] thanks so much to all of you guys for subscribing to me and i actually think that when this video comes out i'll have around 1500 subscribers so i think i'm a little late to the party but better late than never right now that i'm monetized as well i can start making you guys videos and doing more different types of bakery videos that i've really been wanting to do so as you saw in the title today i am going to be comparing two cakes now what i did was i showed them a picture of my sugar sheet cake that i completed a while ago it's this one right here you can see it's kind of difficult to do this technique it's a little bit new as well so that's why i chose this cake because it does take a lot of technique and it's also not really really easy to do and if you mess it up it can be really really difficult to fix so that's why i decided to go with this cake it was also one of those cakes that was really impressive even though it was only a single tier so i thought this would be really fun to order and i also personally like eating buttercream as opposed to fondant so that's why i chose this specific cake to make so i know that the trend is usually comparing one star bakeries to five star bakeries but i found it incredibly difficult to find a one-star bakery and a five-star bakery i found that everything kind of hovered around the three to four and a half star bakery mark so i found it really difficult to pinpoint that so i decided to go with a highly rated storefront bakery and a no review home baking business so a lot of home baking businesses don't have reviews on their page so i just kind of went with the first home bakery that was close to my house that i found and i ordered from them before we get into actually opening these up i want to tell you guys my little ordeal when i was trying to order this particular cake from bakeries i got rejected eight times by eight different bakeries i have actually been ordering these cakes for about three to four weeks i want to say as soon as i kind of was starting to cross over that a thousand subscriber threshold i knew that i wanted to do this video so i started researching and looking into different bakeries that i've always wanted to try and always wanted to buy cakes from but just never did because i didn't really have a reason to buy cakes from there so i asked all of these bakeries whose work i just thought was absolutely amazing and some people whose work that i hadn't really seen before and i kid you not i got rejected many many times and i think the reason for that is because sugar sheet technique is quite a new technique and honestly i actually thought it was kind of good that i got rejected by these bakeries some of them were quite honest and said that they didn't feel like they knew how to do it up to the par of the rest of the cakes that they put out so i thought that was great and i said this to you guys before don't really try out new things brand new brand new because it can be really really challenging to do something under pressure uh if you've never done it before so let's see how these bakeries handled my sugar sheet technique so right off the bat this is the home bakery business that i purchased from i love the packaging normally when i give my cakes away they're not this well packaged so i i gotta find out where she got her packaging from because it's absolutely wonderful and i have to say transporting this on the way home was super super easy i also love that she included a candle on top of this as well so the instructions that i gave both cake places is i said i want you to recreate this cake exactly can you do that and i showed them this picture so the home bakery was really really good with communication and they basically said yes we can recreate that but i'm going to have to replace those cherries with strawberries because obviously cherries are not in season right now so that was good i really liked that they told me right up front that i would not be receiving cherries so right away before any deposits or anything was put down that's what they told me so i really really appreciated that the next thing was that they said they were going to make it as similar as possible to the picture so i really like that wording too because it's not like they just agreed to make the cake exactly as is in the picture which a lot of bakeries don't like to do so some bakeries are like yeah i can make it exactly like that but a lot of bakeries choose to say i can make something similar to that and i think that's really really good wording because that saves you in case the cake doesn't look exactly like the picture the other thing i really really love and i think it's a beautiful touch is this ombre candle that is on top as well um i didn't really say what this was for i didn't specify what it was for but i did say to put a thousand subscribers on the cakes so it'll be really exciting to see how they decided to do that so i'm going to unbox these this is a really clever box i think i might save this box and reuse it for my own cakes all right let's take a look at this [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so [Music] so right off the bat i can say that this whole portion here and the shape of the sugar sheet is really quite close to what i asked for now the problem here is that i didn't say that i wanted the sugar sheet technique when i ordered this i just said that i wanted it exactly like the picture and in my picture you can see my sugar sheet is quite sparkly and this actually uses wafer paper so what you see ending up happening here is all of this puckering and this is very common of wafer paper because as we know as soon as that wafer paper gets wet it starts to crinkle like this but sugar sheet actually stays nice and sparkly and clean the whole way through so that's one thing that i really noticed with this cake the other thing is this was a sugar heart and so as we know again with wafer paper it's starting to bend and it's not really a heart shape anymore so you never really want to use wafer paper when you're trying to make sugar decor and the sugar decor is actually a lot easier to make than the sheet itself because the sheet issue is that everything has to stand up and in order to get that sugar sheet to temp and really make sure that you've done that well it is a bit of a skill but when you're making sugar sheet like appliques they're really easy because you just take a cookie cutter you punch it out you let it dry forever and ever and then it will it will be a solidified shape so i think if this baker didn't want to do the sugar sheet then i feel like maybe a fondant heart would have been a better choice because at least then it would be heart shaped now of course i'm a baker ordering a cake so i know what different mediums are used but your average person that's ordering a cake might not know that it was an actual sugar sheet that was used but the things that they will know is they will know that they asked for something that had that shiny exterior and this is not shiny and this heart is not really that nice shiny heart that they might have been looking for if they were to order a cake exactly like the one that i made previously but the swoops on top are really gorgeous there's lots of strawberries on here so that looks really beautiful i also think that this buttercream edging is like very very clean and i really really appreciate how clean that buttercream swipe is i really love that and i also think that this portion here is really well done where we have um all of those rock candies on there that looks really great too and the ombre effect is very very close to what i had done and you know like i said before we have one major kind of cake and cookie supply shop and so i think that we probably use the same brands um in terms of what is used for this airbrushing machine and so that's why the airbrush color is like basically the same airbrush color um and i really love that the marbling and all that kind of stuff so i think that in terms of replication this does a pretty good job because it looks pretty similar to the cake that i asked for the only thing that was a bit disappointing was the heart wafer paper um because this part here is you can fake and and that can kind of look like the picture but this here is very very folded and it doesn't it doesn't look like the picture in my opinion i really like the spanner here too now if you are going to use wafer paper as a banner it is a little bit of a risk sometimes because you don't know how that wafer paper is going to react i was also told to put this in my fridge and i also suggest that you don't put wafer paper in the fridge if it's something that is standing up like this because if there's any moisture in your customers fridge then that moisture is definitely going to cause this all to crinkle and ripple i do appreciate though that the bakery used a really nice thick cake drum this is going to ensure that the cake doesn't have any bending whatsoever and that it stays nice and solid let's get out my second cake again the creative boxing i have never done this usually i leave just a side open but this is like good because where we live it rings a lot my story with this cake is i did have to reach out to the bakery a few times to see if they could make this cake and i did try more than once to order the cake from this bakery their turnaround times were a little bit long and it just seemed like they weren't getting back to me but the reason that i really really wanted to try this bakery is because i tried cakes from this bakery before and they were absolutely amazing in taste so i really really wanted to try it out and see what their custom cakes were like so when i originally bought this cake i brought it into the car and i was really pleased to see that sugar sheet technique was used and it was actually sugar or sprinkles that were used on the side of the cake as opposed to wafer paper but when i got into the car that sugar sheet started to melt and flop into the cake and i had a fear before i went to go pick up the cakes that this may happen to one or both of the cakes because sugar sheet technique is very very finicky and it is more susceptible to weather and humidity so i kind of had a fear that that might happen but i wasn't sure if it would or not so unfortunately that did happen with this cake but i said i would come back and pick it up later and see if that technique would work if the bakery just had a little bit more time so let's see what happened so unfortunately this is what happened to the cake [Applause] [Music] [Applause] i feel so bad that this has happened to the cake i honestly when i just opened it just now i was expecting it to be standing um the cake decorator briefly showed it to me when she opened up the box and then closed it so and it was standing so i thought that when i opened it up that it would be standing uh honestly the owners of this bakery were like the sweetest people i have talked to and they clearly wanted this to work out um and i'm glad that it was just for me just for uh me to see what this cake was like because i think that this would be a really tough situation to possibly deal with if it was for a more major event than you know me just sitting in front of my camera so let's take a look at the other aspects before we get to the sugar sheet portion so now with this bakery i did ask for the exact same cake just like the exact same directions and requests that i asked for for this cake and in response they said that they could make the cake exactly like it basically you know both cakes kind of went the same way in terms of communication this cake did ask for a deposit this cake they did not ask me for a deposit of any sort so as i could see all this ombre effect and things that i um had done on my cake are somewhat there um there's there's some of this happening which is exactly what i did with my cake if i'm looking at the sides here and this rock candy portion this is a lot closer because i actually use rock candy here it seems like they used um they used sugar to create the rocks themselves then here on the top they used gold quinns which is not what i use and i do believe i did use the gold pearls like on this cake but i also believe that i used gold splatter as well and both of the cakes did not have gold splatter on um on the top now looking at this heart this heart is a little bit more of a heart um and it is holding its shape slightly better but i can see just from holding this heart i can see that it's flimsy still so when i had my heart on top it was rock solid um like a hard candy whereas this is is very very bendable and um and it's pliable so that has me a little bit worried and i think that's why this sugar sheet is not working out so this sugar sheet here oh these pieces that have fallen such a sad time um yeah again very very pliable it's also incredibly thick this thickness kind of works like how fond it works so if you've ever seen my tutorials before i've talked about how if you're putting like a detail like let's say you wanted to put a fondant heart on top of a cupcake then you would make that fondant just a little bit thicker so that it can stand up on its own faster but and i think that's maybe the method that was used for this because they thought maybe okay if it's thicker it can stand up on its own faster which it can but in terms of long term it's not going to get hard through and through and because my sugar sheet is so tall like i'd say my sugar sheet was more like this height it it's never gonna work because you're gonna get that um that thickness it takes a long time for this thickness to be worked through now looking at this as well it's just taking a guess that this sugar sheet was built up with sugar that was maybe dyed um rather than sprinkles itself it's hard to tell that is a complete guess but i think that's why i'm not getting that super shiny quality on the outside here but yeah it's just so so pliable the other thing is the gold that was used is a bit of a different quality than the gold that was used here the gold that was used here really really looks close to the truly badly plastics gold that i use um and this looks more like a yellowy gold so it's just a little bit different than what i use again not a big deal but i would have liked this to be standing oh okay and then the other thing is this piping is a lot closer to the piping that i did in my picture so i piped that using the same tip she obviously used a 1m and this is also a 1m as well but this one was more of a star squeeze and this one was more of a swirl like the way that was on my cake in terms of the 1 000 subscribers they both chose to do it in different ways this one was done with a chocolate plaque which i think is a very delicious way to do things and this was done with that wafer paper all right let's get into the pricing of these cakes so for this cake i paid 75 canadian and for this cake i was originally quoted 80 for this cake but then when i went to go pay for it it only came out to like 63 with tax included and everything so let me know in the comments down below what you think of these two cakes all right now we're gonna get into the tasting portion okay let's give it a taste it smells pretty coffeey to me it kind of looks like maybe they've um flavored this with espresso powder the one thing i'm a little bit worried about is what the pink is i i'm hoping it's just vanilla buttercream but we'll see quite moist and that's great to me that just tastes exactly like what i would expect a nice beautiful mocha coffee cake um and quite moist the crumb is is quite delicious and it's pretty light and fluffy too so i really really like that i want to use the candle that they gave me do you sing something for when you get a thousand subscribers happy the happy subscriber count to me just kidding i'm not gonna put you through that all right guys let's get cutting into this now my original cake had a cherry compote in it so for this one i actually ordered it to have a strawberry filling whatever that may be sorry guys my camera ran out of battery so i'm going to show you this again well for you it's the first time but for me it's the second time um so i finally got that piece of cake out of there and it seems like there's a strawberry jam as well as some sort of fresh strawberries in there too and this is so so moist and i can see this a little bit more clearly in this cake i can't really see it so much in this cake but i think there is some sugar syrup that was poured in here which is why it's so moist i can just see it kind of in the crumb a little bit and this actually tastes really really similar to my strawberry cakes that i make too so i i like it it's great um i love the recipe it's awesome so let's go ahead and break down what i think about both these cakes firstly in terms of the communication of both bakeries so i think that the home baker kind of wins it here because they responded to me within about 12 to 24 hours for every single message and question that i ever had they also made sure to say that they weren't going to replicate it exactly but that they were going to try and do it as close as possible in terms of replication it's hard to say which one i would choose because this one did make sure that they used the sugar sheet technique this one used wafer paper instead of the sugar sheet so it's hard to say which one is better in terms of replication but if i really really had to choose i think i would choose this cake just because they did copy the gold pearls that i did and i also did the swoop on top just like i had and in terms of looking at this just at a glance this one more so has that ombre effect as well as the same gold that i used and if it's not the same gold it looks very very similar the rock editions were also very very close to what i had going on as well now in terms of value for each cake this one being at 75 dollars and this one sitting around that 63 mark i would have to give it to this bakery this bakery's cake is actually a little bit larger than this bakery's cake and this bakery did attempt to do the sugar sheet technique which would in turn be more expensive whereas this bakery chose to do wafer paper which is a lot cheaper and a lot easier and in terms of taste i think they both nailed it they both taste absolutely wonderful and they're both really really delicious in terms of customer service i think they both also did really really well i love the way that both bakeries treated me and they were very very kind and clearly have a passion for what they do let me know down in the comments below guys which cake was your favorite which cake do you think nailed it in terms of replicating my cake that i had thanks so much for watching guys don't forget to like share and subscribe so you can be part of the sweetie fam right now i'm uploading daily so

but of this type it's the largest we've ever had and as far as I know it's probably one of the largest in the country Kenosha County Sheriff David beth says the THC vape cartridge operation was being run out of a house and paddock Lake and a condo in Bristol Beth says they seized THC products with a street value of 1.5 million dollars focus was on making money sheriff Beth says two brothers 20 year old Tyler Huff Heinz and 23 year old Jacob hoppings are both facing multiple charges for illegal drug violations that's just the tip of the iceberg in this operation search warrant served at the

wedding cake with every possible cake flavor in it Perfect for the bride who wants it all...literally Now as some of you may know - besides being engaged, betrothed, and affianced I am also a bit of a mixing fiend, having previously mixed together many of my makeup products, hundreds of lipsticks, nail polishes and candles. So naturally, given our nuptials this fall We wanted to see if we could do a wedding themed franken-experiment. And a few months ago, one of you guys sent to me a tweet that got the hamster wheels in my mind a-whirring \"A Franken cake,\" you say? I was intrigued. Now, a question you might have at this point is just what does it mean to make a cake with every possible flavor? Well the expected answer and how we usually do our Franken videos would be that we would mix every batter Together into one mixture and then make a single cake but following the trajectory of our pseudo science videos getting increasingly crazy and notably large- and also borrowing some inspiration from the reality TV classic, Cake Boss, we felt like we had to bake something a little more grand so we decided that for our Franken wedding cake every single flavor should get its own layer and thus the idea of a many tiered Giant cake-zilla was born. It's time for some bad culinary science, y'all! Except this time there won't be lipstick in the cake unless we Accidentally drop in some of our ColourPop Franken lipsticks, which are back in stock now at colourpop.com We've got our six colors and our full collection kits all back just in time to add a little batty cheer to your holiday Season perfect for anyone who wants some nightmare with their Christmas. Yes, it's still October in my heart No. All right! Now as for how we're gonna make this thing, one thing to keep in mind is that we're not great bakers Let alone bakers of cake monstrosity, so we're not gonna bet on this getting to our actual wedding in fact We do have a backup cake purchased but we are gonna try our best to make this bad boy as legit as possible So we've recruited our friend and baking expert Rosanna Pansino to help consult us on how on earth to make a giant cake, without it destroying itself and also us All right, so we are here at Ro's house, Ro's been briefed, you know Like the idea of the vibe. Can you help me? I hope so? I thought about it a lot in theory How one would assemble this cake? So it would be structurally sound and you could get a lot of variety. Both of those things sound good. I think structurally, Sound is something that is weighing on my mind a little bit I feel like it could easily end up like what are those ladies called the goth fairy? Godmothers from Sleeping Beauty and their cake just kind of like falls over I see that I see that happening for me now wedding cakes are traditionally made in like a tiered structure where each tier gets smaller as you go up for stability now a tier is for cake layers put together and you ice them and that's a tier and Conventionally if each layer is 1 inch tall with frosting in between them. Now. How many tiers can you make a cake? - That's the question. \n- Whoo Now obviously we want to make a cake with as many layers as possible to fit as many flavors as possible but there are a couple of things to keep in mind one is that they only make circular cake pans so big and so small So we're going to be limited by like literally what is purchasable the other? Limitation is the size of our ovens the ovens in our house are kind of small. So we're planning on renting Industrial ovens for the big boys, but even they have their limits So it seems that our largest pan size is gonna have to be 18 inches wide and the smallest 4 Technically goes to a three inch but I would stop at a four inch because a three inch cake is... A 'lil baby! - It's basically a cupcake \n- and if the size of the pans increase two inches at a time, we'll have eight tiers in total So basically we are gonna be able to have 32 different flavors Which is obviously not every flavor imaginable, but when it comes to conventional wedding cake flavors - It's a good chunk of them. \n- I got you a list of different flavors that you could pair together Thank you Now in terms of which flavors we're gonna use we have two main objectives to have as diverse of a cake as Possible looks wise and taste wise and also to pick cake types that could support layers Above and below it which unfortunately rules out like mousses, souffles Tiramisus, or flans. Great cakes, but not very stackable. To highlight the different flavors as well, we're also gonna be making corresponding frostings to go in between the layers - Whoa \n- So you have like the true Frank and cake experience and once we decorate it like a wedding cake we're gonna be tasting the cake as tiers as well as figuring out a way to taste all 32 flavors at once do you think That sounds too crazy. It's definitely an intimidating undertaking Okay, but I think after talking with ro we at least have somewhere to start? All right so after having ordered an ungodly amount of cake pans grabbing all of our ingredients and prepping some stuff We are ready for our bake-a- thon so basically today we are all hands on deck which means that I'm gonna be mixing and baking Tyler is going to be mixing and baking that's you Tyler - Oh, yeah\n- and then our team member MaiLinh who has been helping us plan. This project is also going to be baking - So we're gonna be mixing and baking many cakes at the same time \n- You sound like a frog. \n- Sorry. We recently went to Vegas for our bachelor Bachelorette party so my voice may be shot - May? \n- Is. \n- Okay. There you go. \n- We've rented ovens. We've rented fridge and freezers. We went to Costco - We got like more eggs than anyone ever. It's a it's a production.\n-  We're an unlicensed bakery. \n- We are super unlicensed The ovens preheated. Now some of the cakes were gonna be making from scratch but because of the sheer quantity of cakes we have to make there is some cake mix around and by some I mean a lot. Also, as we go We're gonna be adding in the extra batter into a sort of slop Cup I guess for lack of better term and we're gonna make a true Franken cupcake out of our extra batter - Yeah \n- to put on the top of our giant Franken wedding cake and that's how we're gonna taste all the flavors at once All right. Is it time should we start as for the main cake flavors, We're obviously gonna be including some of the more basic - Cake mixes like the chocolates, vanillas and funfetties of the world \n- Woohoo! Party! and we've decided to use them primarily in the bigger layers at the bottom. We do have a large - Man overboard \n- New plan! Bottom layer, plastic flavor - Now these bottom layers are gonna take a lot of ingredients \n- Open the eggs. We need the eggs bring the eggs in here! So thankfully we have this automatic mixer to do some of the heavy lifting on these big bowls of batter - All right, once everything's incorporated. I'll make it go fast. \n- You don't need to make it go too fast I like to make it go fast. And once the batters are ready We're gonna take the big ones like these down to the garage where our industrial ovens are - Oh my god, it's hot in here \n- and pour them into their appropriate pans - Which we've pre-greased and parchment papered. And then we'll put them into the oven. \n- My hands are like really really sweaty So in addition to the sort of chocolate and vanilla category, we have some other bigger layers I feel like one of the mice in Cinderella trying to build her dress. Also, with just straight-up box mix but they're a little more fun kind of with flavors like lemon, strawberry, - Pumpkin spice and good old just spice. \n- Which Spice Girl are you Ty? \n- I think I'm baby spice. \n- Oh, yeah - Which one am I? \n- I don't know. Depends what day it is And these of course are also gonna get poured into their giant pans - Oh my god guys, its Neapolitan ice cream \n- as well as stuck into the oven to the oven - Alright, watch yourself Saffy \n- To the club to the oven. Whoa - Which I think Tyler might be scared of \n- It looks like the furnace from home alone. It's got like a face. \"WELCOME TO HELL\" We also have some fun straight-up cake mixes in smaller pan sizes as well like angels food cake Salted caramel. Butter yellow. Cookies and cream. And red velvet. - Well, I'm talking about the cake flavor red velvet \n- Look how red - this is actually I didn't know it was that red\n- but Tyler's talking about the k-pop group \n- now that is truly some red flavor and the smaller cakes in general are gonna be going in our upstairs non rental ovens These two cakes next to each other give you strong McDonald's vibes - It's like the burger patty and like what's left of Ronald McDonald \n- that makes me not want to eat it. Now our cake mixes are Mostly Betty Crocker, but we do have these two British mixes from King Arthur Flour - This is kind of like the Great British Bake Off from hell. \n- Yeah - Mary Barry wants you to bake a giant cake \n- A franken-cake! - You fools! \n- and these are like slightly more difficult mixes or at least different recipes. \n-Hello Why are you what this is? This is the recipe! Tyler just put water in and then put eggs in. Put the mix in, Ty! - It says whisk together water eggs and oil add cake mix. Stir until smooth.\n- Okay. Alright fine. I believe you. It just looks very... \n- It's a British box - They drive on the other side of the road. Okay makes sense. \n- Editor's note It turns out this company is actually based in Vermont But at the time we really thought they were British besides those We also have like a large amount of cake flavors that we're making by taking plain mixes and then adding extra ingredients - Into them like cinnamon. Peanut butter. \n-That's definitely not enough. \n-That's not enough?! \n- No. \n- Oh wow \n- and peppermint extract - Oh that smells strong. That smells like the ladies locker room at a spa \n- And we're kind of just adding these in to taste - Oh, that's good. You don't need more peppermint in that \n- You can taste it? - Give it another hit. \n- Yeah, that's what I was thinking. \n- Some of these are gonna need food coloring. While others will just get their color from there extra ingredients Yeah, that looks artsy Maybe people do have matcha for their wedding cake because then you could say we're the perfect matcha We are also gonna be making cake flavors by replacing the water in the box mix recipe with different liquids like orange juice Coconut cream hot chocolate and coffee. Oh, that's what I need right now. Just a lil sniff. - Oh that was Folgers to the face \n- As well as lime juice and champagne. \n- Are you gonna shoot that off in here? - Full disclosure, I am not very good at this. \n- Oh! - Wow that was actually pretty explosive! \n- That was good! \n- I'm glad that everyone pointed me in the right direction And we're hoping that these more unique flavors like the pink champagne and the matcha - Cosmo and Wanda ain't slick! \n- will give us some serious Visual impact in the cross-section and then our final few layers are all going to be made from scratch like butterscotch Hazelnut almond. Pineapple. And Bananas Foster Okay, so many hours, boxes and ingredients later We've mixed up 32 separate batters and we've gotten them all in the oven This is taking my total cake baked number from like four to like 36 - Now cakes have also been coming out of ovens. We're not just leaving them in there. \n- Okay. \n- You got it down. You got it - Booyah! \n- and the ones coming out of our industrial ovens are looking pretty promising. Oh and then once they've cooled off enough. We're putting them in the fridge I feel like there's probably somebody outside casing our house right now and they're like, you know You understand they have like a lot of cakes - Now the upstairs oven is a little bit of a different story. \n- Oh my god Oh My god, oh my god. It's crazy over here. Oh my god. It's going crazy over here - In general? I don't think it's a great oven. \n- This is this is real. This is real This is a real problem But specifically the duo of butter yellow and mint tried to take the house down Well, it smells minty fresh - It does \n- something about the butter yellow caused it to - Overflow into the mint causing then the mint to overflow into the oven \n- the Ring of Fire Now they are baked and the house is still standing, but that ones on our list Why are you the way that you are ,cake? So now that our cakes are all baked we can move on to our - Slop cup. Which we've been adding our extra batter to all day. \n- It looks like Rachel Green's truffle \n- The trifle? \n- Yeah Ladyfingers cream then beef sauteed with peas and onions - Another round of ladyfingers \n- and we've actually filled up three full buckets as we've been baking. \n-Oh, it looks weird. \n-Oh, yeah - It looks like bacon \n- A little meaty \n- To go into our Franken cupcake batter. \n- Whoa! That was pretty gloopy. I'm not gonna lie. Oh, that one looks very appetizing actually. All right, let's blend these biatches So it actually doesn't look as - Unappetizing as I thought it would \n- No \n- I feel like most of our cakes were brown But that like red velvet cake really just asserted its dominance and made it red - It smells kind of minty \n- You did dose it with that peppermint, Saf. \n- Yeah, I mean I smell mint and like - Weirdly, maybe banana \n- and then once we've scooped it all into the cupcake pan. We'll take it down to the oven Hopefully the last thing to go into the oven ever Hopefully the last thing I ever put into an oven I'm like that baby - You know the baby I'm talking about \n- So it's about 30 minutes later and our cupcakes are ready They look awesome, It almost looks like a Venus flytrap with a tongue or like a little bit like demagorgon-y But we'll deal with these dudes later for now They go in the fridge but to finish off our night we have to level all of the cakes that we've baked and cooled so that they're all exactly one inch tall and Also flat. And our plan is to use both cake levelers, which are these kind of cheese wire type situations - Yes\n- as well as knives for the cakes that are either too crumbly or too large for the Levellers And after we level them we're gonna pop the cakes out of their pans and then wrap them label them and put them into the freezer So they're easier to handle when we're building which we're gonna do tomorrow. All right So here we are on our cake building day So we're gonna start off by building each tier individually using our corresponding frosting flavors between each layer Which we've pre-made by mixing the appropriate ingredients into a vanilla or chocolate Buttercream base. And in addition to putting our frosting into piping bags We're also going to be using this fancy dancy cake turntable So I can just squeeze that bag and the cake will move underneath me. All right, let's do this So I'm gonna start with these 6-inch layer and the one that's gonna be on the bottom is orange chocolate Rosanna had recommended that we put cake boards at the bottom of all of our tiers for stability - So I'm gonna add some vanilla frosting to the bottom of the cake and then just stick it on there \n- Just as Vanilla Ice - Was a glue to the music industry in the 90s. \n- What the? Who? \n- Vanilla icing will be a glue for this? - And after that, I'm gonna put the orange frosting on top of our orange chocolate cake. \n- Oh, it's coming out Ty - and we want the frosting to be pretty thick and even \n- oh, - I'm figuring it out. \n- So it can support the layers above \n- this is actually looking kind of decent And then we just start stacking our layers. All right - Next up is banana \n- The only dynamic to be aware of is that with a four layer tier There are only like three inner frosting locations So one of the layers is gonna be flying solo like our banana cake Which is gonna have chocolate cappuccino frosting on top to go with the chocolate cappuccino cake I'm already interested by this flavor combination - Yeah\n- and then we have matcha cake and frosting to round out the tier So when we spec'd out the cake We tried to like sort of distribute the flavors and colors for maximum visual diversity as well as flavor Surprise, I guess I would say and I think that this tier is definitely gonna be hitting a lot of different taste buds - It's like your coffee and your fruit in the morning. \n- Yeah, actually, that's right So we'll see if that strategy comes back to bite us when we taste it But for now, let's move on to the 8-inch cake Which is sort of like a spicy almost Valentine's Day-ish tier because we have chocolate cinnamon - Unleash the power! \n- Red velvet, devil's food and pink champagne in it. - Boo-ya\n- Rock and roll man. Cake, frosting and rock and roll. Those are my three vices man All right. So that is the 8-inch tier down, now we're going for ten. Now for this tier We have salted caramel, our spawn of Satan butter yellow cake, our British But not British eggnog one and some coconut on top I feel like this one kind of looks like a filet-o-fish or like a crispy chicken sandwich - Yeah\n- Besides that we actually don't have much in terms of a theme for this tier But it looks and sounds - Pretty tasty \n- That looks like the kind of cake you want to take out to a nice seafood dinner. \n- You don't even like seafood - I want to date this cake cause I'm trying to say \n- That's so rude. This is our wedding cake. All right What is this Who am I what's happening? This is the ten inch this is the 10 inch tier now We're on to the 12. So this tier is kind of like a mash-up combination of flavors You might find in a tropical climate because you have coffee beans with the mocha cak.\n- Oh, shiz. Yeah, I'm good - And that's a thick one.\n-  It's a thick one. Mr. Grinch. Cacao beans with the hot chocolate cake We're trying to minimize Stabbing in this video Minimize stabbing maximize flavor. Followed by a lime layer and then like a mint mojito on top This looks like a pile of toothpaste but I feel like it might taste good because it smells awesome. All right, high five I tricked him into that one So now we're on to our 14-inch tier and we are starting off with spice This tier is kind of like the Professor Utonium from Powerpuff Girls section mainly because there's a lot of spice going on on Sugar spice everything nice. These are the three ingredients to create the perfect little girl We're just missing a little Chemical X. But we do have some vanilla and some German chocolate to make up for it - How is German chocolate cake different from other a chocolate cake? \n- It has an umlaut. \n-Ah, it's chook-let It's cook. Now. I'm not gonna pretend like I've been killing it with the piping overall I'm just not like good at this and I'm getting exposed but I think my forearms are getting kind of tired - So Tyler has been helping me out with it. \n- Your hands are wild right now \n- High-five I know I got you with that earlier, but you are not getting me with that now - We've also entered the territory with these cakes. We're just moving them at all is a two-person job \n- The paper's slippery - All right, watch out for the frosting bucket. \n- Watch out for the clothing So next up we have the 16-inch layers, which I'm deeming flavors You might inject into a donut. With some richer notes like a butterscotch and Nutella and then some fruity notes like lemon frosting Which I guess we may have let saw a little too long. Oh my god. Keep going. Keep going Whoa, this is a runaway lemon. What the hell screw banana time. It's lemon time. Whoa And on top of that we have lemon cake, strawberry icing - Which is not quite as crazy as the lemon one and strawberry cake. She got hit by a giant cake! But with that one put away - It's time for the biggest boy, the 18 inch-er \n- Slide slide slide slide slide \n- You sound like Ross \n- Pivot! Pivot! Now this tier has a peanut butter cake on the bottom that has started to get a little crumbly so we're gonna be very careful and we're gonna adhere it to the cake board cracks down and then hopefully if we just kind of Move on as if nothing's happened We'll be all good. A peanut butter frosting that Tyler is going to be squeezing because he's been getting pretty good at it - I'm like entering a headspace with this. \n- Are you entering a zone? \n- Yes. \n- Is it Auto Zone? \n- Yes And then chocolate, carrot cake, and funfetti frosting and cake on top Did that work? - Uh, it's on \n- and I'm gonna say the theme of this tier is that they're all just giant. \n- All the way up - All the way up \n- Will it fit? Will it fit? Yes. Yes yes yes yes. Yeah! \n- My hands got buttery Yeah! So with all of our other tiers built and put away we're going all the way to the tippy top for the four inchers - Oh my god, it's so cute. \n-Yeah\n- It's a baby shark \n- In this tier, we have cookies and cream,  pineapple cake and frosting Hazelnut almond cake and then cherry icing Which is supposed to pair with our angels food cake layer - We saved it for the top because it is very delicate and weak so we're gonna see what happened \n- Don't breathe on it - Well, sorry \n- Now with all of our tiers built it's time to frost the outside of each one individually before stacking them on top of each other and basically what we're doing is first applying a crumb coat of our frosting which is sort of like an Initial thin layer then putting them back into the freezer before adding like an exterior Final layer of frosting we have enough vanilla frosting in life. We have like a paint buckets worth - So like I hope that's enough \n- I don't know how much that is - 35 pounds?! \n- and I think I've been kind of figuring it out. \n- Okay. Does that look crazy or does it look artful? - It's kind of like rustic looking \n- That's like a wedding vibe, right? Like the barn vibe - This is the stucco facade that no one on house hunters wants \n- They want crown molding though And then once they're done, they go into the fridge for storage the only one that seems to be Presenting a problem is the tiny cake because I'm afraid that if I use my big metal scraper on it It'll just like fall over. So I've been using a piping bag But unfortunately, the frosting is kind of drooping off of it who knew that it would be the four-inch one That would be my downfall. So my new plan is to just go at it with my hands - Like what if I built it a fortress of frosting and then squished it inside? \n- We'll call it the fortress of solitude. \n- Yes I'm going to caress the frosting onto the cake. All right guys, it's time for a rebrand. We're not selling lipsticks anymore We're selling hand massaged frosting. That's my new merch item And once the frosting is on, we can try to shape it by shaving off the excess - Okay\n- That's not bad \n- and then use the metal tools to you know, make it look artsy - It looks like a bandaged head. \n- I was gonna say looking the Invisible Man\n- Okay So with that, we are done building and frosting all of our tiers So the only thing that's left to do is to put them all on top of each other and build our final cake Which we're gonna do tomorrow because we spent all day doing this so Good night again and see you in the morning, which is right now Now, how we stack the tiers is Actually pretty important because as Ro let us know no matter how much good - Baking we've done if we don't have the right support the cake might not survive \n- Now for structure - Let's talk structure \n- As we mentioned We have a cake board at the bottom of each tier which sneakily has like a little circle cut out at the center So what we're gonna do is use a Big Mama dowel or big stick - This is probably the most dangerous part \n- and essentially thread all the layers on to it We're also going to be using complementary smaller dowels in each individual tier - Which we're going to be measuring to the height of our tiers chopping. \n- Whoa! - I mean business \n- and then sticking in \n- and the reason you do that is because when you stack on the other layer on top the Dowels will support the cake board so that your cakes don't just kind of like squish into each other Yeah They don't end up like stacking cakes and what we found on the Internet is that you should use the diameter of the cake Divided by 2 number of dowels in each respective tier. I have like a large wad of frosting right here How did I get there? - I don't even know it's like very early on in the day. And now we do this seven more times. \n- Whoa!!! It's a minty surprise - It seems like it should get easier as you keep going because the cakes get smaller \n- ha ha ha ha ha sharkbait ooh ha ha but handling like a tower of cakes is kind of terrifying - Especially when the top layer will just not cooperate. \n- It's not heavy enough. So gravity's not like doing that much work right now Oh, no, this is your final boss, Saf I'm like lliterally screwing the top on I should have known it would come to this All right, I think that's on. It looks like a man It looks like the Michelin Man but a cone and together. It's coming in at an impressive 47 inches tall which means that the frosting is accounting for a full 15 inches of height - In fact, that might be the most impressive part. \n- It looks like the Burj Khalifa - I mean, it's basically the Burj Khalifa of cakes. \n- So it's the Burj Cake -lifa. Yeah - Nailed it in the corner. \n- Not terrible. Not the worst we still have our cupcake that needs to go on top and also some - Decorations that we bought but this is pretty close to its final form \n- Update: The top three cakes are leaning pretty heavily to the left So, um, it is living up to its inspo of the leaning sleeping beauty cake we're gonna try and make a little shim out of cake board and put it right here because it's this layer that's Like leaning them all over that actually is doing something Put a flower there. Yeah While we were stacking them we tried to put our cakes on as evenly as possible - But they're still wanting to lean. \n- All right. Now, it's this way. \n-What if we shim right here? \n- Right in the front? \n- Yeah It's like we're feeding a monster - It seems like the shims are helping but I still think we'd better add our finishing touches a fast \n- Ty you film The whole time in case it falls we need every camera on it - So we're gonna stick our Franken cupcake on top as well as a little custom cat bat cake topper. \n- He's roosting - He's looking pretty good Safiya. \n- We also ran sacked a local Joann's So we have some spooky flowers ribbons and buttons that we can stick on there as well. Oh Oh, yeah. Oh my god. It's cute as hell and with our extra decorations It's kind of giving off a sweet but ghoulish vibe, which I'm liking a lot It is even with our shims sort of continuing to lean This general direction right now. I think with all of these sort of like spooky decorations It's sort of Tim burton-esque. It is looming over The ground \n- Now we're getting pretty close to actually tasting our Franken cake and we've been coordinating with Rosanna to have her come over so we can reveal our Creation to her and she can try it with us However, we're all pretty terrified that this cake is gonna fall over before she gets here So I'm just gonna hold it just to be safe. I'm literally just babysitting this cake right now \n- 11 minutes - Ro says \n- I think this cake has made us its bitch. \n- Okay guys, Rosanna is here. \n- Hey Ro - Welcome to our clean house. \n- Oh my gosh. I'm so excited - Also nervous \n- Rosanna, I'm nervous. I'm holding this cake for dear life. \n-We've done everything we need to do with this thing So it's time to see what she thinks as our baking guru. This is our extreme h ouse makeover thing. We're...move that bus This is amazing, I see the cake plates and this is - Are you holding it together? \n- At this point, yes. My hand is really crampy, but it's here and you're here - So I'm happy. But I think to actually slice it. We're gonna have to disassemble it. \n- Yeah, yeah we're moments away from disaster Now, people actually do this with normal tiered cakes. Like you have to take it apart to eat it - So I think it's in our best interest to deconstruct it now \n- Look at all the support Nice  you guys - We did our best  \n- If you didn't do support you wouldn't even a got to here \n- And once the cake is completely and safely disassembled we can actually cut some slices out of them and try them - You do have to use some muscle to cut these bad boys \n- I'm shaking I'm literally shaking \n- Her hand is shaking. Yeah - Don't scare me like that! \n- But the cross sections of the slices are coming out looking pretty bomb dot com \n- Yeah! beautiful - That looks so good \n- Except for the poor angels food cake, which seems to have gotten squished I think the angel food may have just absorbed frosting So with all of our slices sliced, it's taste test time. Taste the rainbow if you will. Now Ro actually doesn't know what's in any of these cakes - No\n- So I'm interested to see what you think - the layers taste like \n- So we're gonna taste all of our tiers before we try our franken cupcake. \n- Look at this - Starting with our 18 inch hearty traditional tier. \n- Oh my god. That's amazing. It's really good - That's so good, what the hell?! \n- It's really good. \n- What do you taste? \n- I can see this is like some funfetti. \n- Don't look - Any flavors coming out at you? \n- The aftertaste is chocolate for me - I taste peanut butter, carrot only \n- Really \n- It was peanut butter. That's that's a peanut butter cake at the bottom - that's why it's so messed up because I put too much peanut butter in there \n- Regardless if this one tastes more like - \n- Chocolate or like peanut butter- It's pretty good and Tyler agrees. \n- That is awesome. You went ham with the peanut butter and Overall, a lot of the sections of the Franken cake do actually taste really good in particular the - 14-inch spice and everything nice tear is a real winner. \n- Oh my god Those are amazing - That one's so good. \n- It's kind of just like a cocktail of holiday goodness. \n- Oh, it just tastes like Christmas - It's like you just shotgun a gingerbread house. \n- Oh, yeah \n- And despite all of the headaches. It's caused me The four-inch tier is also quite nice. - That was pretty good. \n- The flavors aren't a hundred percent on the same power level as each other But what you can taste, tastes pretty good I think what I tasted was the cookies and cream and the cherry frosting actually Now, as for the rest of the tiers - There are a couple that are not bad but flavor-wise are a little uneven like our 16 inch pastry filler tear. \n- Whoa - Strawberries! Oh lemon, or is that lemon? It's not strawberry. No, it's strawberry. Lemon? \n- I agree with Ro Whoa strawberry then lemon then nothing - The 10 inch chicken sandwich looking tier is also a bit questionable. \n- Oh my what's that? \n- Okay, it's not terrible - It's weird \n- With the primary taste ending up being the caramel cake and the eggnog frosting Caramel, lots of caramel. Eggnog! - She's right. \n- Ro has had a moment of clarity. \n- She's right. \n- What?? \n- Yeah Yeah Yes. Yes star Baker What what star baker The other tier that is confusing is the six-inch fruit coffee and matcha in the morning cake Actually, it's growing on me. I actually kind of like the combo I think it started off kind of good then it got kind of bad and now it's okay - But I'm not sure that Ro likes it. \n- I was like - Orange Oh what's happening? \n- But since Tyler's on my side \n- The matcha is not bad I would actually say that was my favorite part of it I think we're out voting Ro two to one and putting it in the middle category instead of sliding it down to our third category the cacophonous flavor combinations - Unfortunately our flavors found in a tropical climate tier ended up being kind of strange \n-that one - Tastes the most like a mashup cake of all of them so far\n- Okay - You broke Ro \n- Now I don't think it tastes like orange juice and toothpaste but I might just have a high mint - tolerance.I do not hate it nearly as much as Ro does. \n- I hate it.  \n- Because Tyler hates it too. Maybe that's why I liked it -Now, this cake is not alone in this category \n- Saf is nopnig out right now \n- As the 8 inch - lusty tier is also not great. -The cinnamon is the primary cause of Ro's undoing \n- The aftertaste is so - Cinnamony and so like huh? But underratedly, I think the champagne flavor is the one taking it to Funkytown - So the overall taste is like a spicy jello shot. \n- I'm gonna call this cake the choker But hopefully the Franken-cupcake can wash that away. Now Ro actually doesn't know that it's a Franken-flavor So, let's see if she can give us an unbiased taste. What does it taste like? All right, Saf do you want to tell Ro? - It's impossible to guess \n- What it actually is is all of these batters mixed together. \n- Oh, shut up. \n- Yeah -Yeah, it's the Franken cupcake \n- Oh my god, it didn't actually taste bad \n- After trying it myself I think that Ro is right. It's definitely not bad. To me, it tasted like Vanilla, cinnamon, and lemon. But like a little deeper - not too sweet. And Tyler is actually a pretty big fan - Little bit of matcha \n- There is like a depth to the flavor. \n- I think it's matcha Why am I saying that like I know what I'm talking about - Yeah, Ro and I know  \n- it does \n- Just as a final test We also mashed up pieces of our cake into a single spoonful or Franken bite, which Tyler tried and seemed to like I'm sensing nutmeg. Nutmeg mint - Maybe a little lemon. \n- So there you have it. It tastes like something and a hint of lemon So with a pretty definite sugar crash inbound, that is our Franken wedding cake Now I'm guessing this video is not going to end up being short, but regardless it won't actually reflect Just how many hours this cake actually took to make. I think all in it probably took about 72 waking hours of egg cracking and hand mixing Frosting and moving things in and out of industrial freezers - Did anyone see that? \n- But in the end, I think we came out with one heck of a cake I'm not sure this thing is gonna make a cameo at our wedding. Mostly because our hands have been all up in it I can't promise you I haven't touched every part of this cake So it probably wouldn't be kosher to give it to our guests But we now have frozen Franken cake and frankly ingredients for years So there will be many future sugar crashes to be had by us and our hard-working team at the hands of our creation Once again a huge. Thank you to Ro our baking sensei without whom this Franken cake would have become a Russian nesting doll and also a huge Thank you to Tyler for agreeing to get all of our cake smashing impulses out now and not on our wedding day - Alright, we're not doing that again \n- No? \n- Thank you guys so much for watching if you like that video Make sure to smash that like button and if you want to see more videos like this Make sure to smash that subscribe button.

friends are married I did it she did get married I did a cake Day present you had a really nice what do you think yesterday yeah hers was a beautiful wedding cakes are pretty surprisingly difficult they usually have to be decorated beautifully they have to taste good and I also have to like represent your love baking I feel like really tests the limits of a person's like friendship and I just think it would be a fun opportunity for all of us because when are we ever gonna get a chance to make such an intricate and high-stakes cake so we have an excellent Baker Graham surgical she is incredible she's gonna be our mentor and yeah let's make a wedding cake hello it was like you guys to just get to get you pumped up just take a look in the box there's something that should be inspiring to just fun is it is not [Music] Freddie do you think I'll do like a box thing we just add angular one I'm sure I don't but I don't really do anything in the kitchen I'm just not a kitchen person but I love do you think I love to cook but I don't know much about baking and baking his scientific and you know and so I try to make the lemon poppy seed cake and half of it was uncooked I bought a bunch tin and everything it's a sign yeah so let's go bake some cakes my name is Jen Fujikawa and I create geeky recipes for the Internet one of the most popular recipes that I've ever made what these Star Wars wampa arm cake and so it was a red velvet cake that was a jelly roll cake filled with jam and it looked very realistic today I'm gonna make a simple vanilla cake and when that cake is done that cake can be used as a base for the ladies to practice some of their skills on I think what I love about baking most is that it makes people happy I like making recipes from scratch because I feel like you can put a lot of yourself and I love your love and time into the bake team one is Freddy and Devon and they'll be making a red velvet cake team two is Kristen and Chantal and they're going to be making an or Chadha cake so we found out we're making red velvet and we kind of came up with a vision should we have food plans so we really like the naked cake which is like a trend we want to do maybe a little bit of piping around the layers and that sounds good so I've kind of drafted up a little mock-up and what I like it Anna give me the sugar so we're making your recipe that's in Jaffa Cake right yes can you tell us a little bit about what that means the Mexican or Chadha is what we drink in LA and it's a rice based milk with a little bit of cinnamon here's a way or thank you gave me some gold leaf we were also thinking maybe we'd want to pipe in some frosting flowers we don't really know how hard that is or what that even would look like I think flowers is good it's a little complicated and you kind of have a lot going on with the gold so you could try maybe making fondant flowers I'm so excited for this the real cake so am I an artist no but am i incredibly attached to this drawing yes so for the gold leaf I didn't know exactly what that meant so I just wrote gold in cursive and then this is our London flowers yeah that's the only type of flower I know how to draw we can make him look just like that if you like we don't have and we're gonna start over here with team red velvet and we're gonna learn how to stack your naked cake and then do some piping so start your naked cake you want to trim the top so when you bake a cake it has a little bit of a dome so you have a very long straighted knife right there I would go a little bit deeper a little bit deeper yeah so you guys wanted to put some fondant roses on top of these cakes yes so the best way to do it is you can just grab this pre-made fondant it's like play-doh but it's okay if you eat it this time sure and so you want to kind of roll it flat and thin into a very long rectangle you're gonna take this tool and you're just gonna cut out one of those so this is way easier for us and it's what you do is just loosely roll it and when you keep going and get all the way you get a rose a pan and then you kind of pull the edges down and now we're gonna pipe frosting and we're just gonna pipe the line around the outside edge so you're kind of building a damn squeeze from the top squeeze from Italian I don't do this with my toothpaste either it's giving me like vintage vibes this is so grama bull oh okay let's see yeah made her she's quite sturdy and they don't have to be perfect cuz flowers aren't perfect flowers charm is true that's my favorite thing about baking so far you can cover up your mistakes with frosting fully life was that way cover up an X with frosting believe me I've tried and then over here for the fondant cake now you guys can start decorating with all the roses that you've made so then do I just stick it on yeah just kind of shape it on there for your life just shove it in there smack her and I'm like a pageant mom for this flower you will be on a cake win first plate I think I've been rolling a little piece of cake in my finger there about 30 minutes what should we name him no it's like no right it looks at a booger so any advice Jen before we go into tomorrow keep practicing and then sort of do it with confidence so if you just go for it I think you'll come out with a better result Thank You Chad don't hold that fondue you think you'll be proud of us when we bring your recipes so I absolutely oh good complete faith in you I mean is there like a certain part that's like trickier even though makes me where no I think if you just read through the recipe all the way through and then just follow the steps you should be fine I'll be right over there honestly one thing she said that I would not have done is read it all the way through before starting no I wouldn't so that's a very valuable tip and it's one that we should have known well chocolate cake with no doubt that buttercream I'm already skimming the medium bowl was together the cake flour cocoa powder secret ingredient [Music] Eat Pray Love is there nicer people yes people or to bowl Bluffs choose your fighter can I just do this yeah some reason I like cutting butter it's kind of like if you were to cut a lipstick open yes but [Music] so smooth alright so now we got some red dye but it doesn't tell us how much we probably can just sort of eyeball it it's like how deeply ready do we want our red velvet's blue I think we should be blood red yeah the color of love this is the last time this is gonna look yellow hell yeah I feel so accomplished wow that's a really good recipe again yeah the recipe yeah Thank You Jen thank you for sharing your recipes delicious but I wasn't gonna have any enough links for both your like raw edge don't do it in the hummus the time is kind of here to pour the babies out it is satisfying just let this dump in there we're gonna make someone's wedding house extra special so here's the problem I realized while we were making the second batch of batter that I definitely left baking powder out of our first batch of batter which is bad because it means the cake won't rise so we're gonna try to take this batter and put it back in the mixer and add the baking powder and works all right so our baby cakes are ready for a little heat I feel like we're giving her cheeks to a child protective hate protective services takes away [Music] it's so hard not to just slice into one and try it ya know I think today went really well there are a couple of mishaps but I think we saved it so I think we did it okay so I don't think you can tell that they had their little incident baking the base cakes is fairly easy but my expectations for tomorrow is it's gonna be a little more complicated [Music] so Chantal actually had an important meeting that she could not miss at this time I am officially subbing in on Kristen's team before you guys get started I'm gonna show you how to slice your cake so that you can stack them so I'm gonna take this little one which is the top tier of the or Chadha cake and you just take your knife and go across the middle again turning the cake the horchata cake to be a demonstration they don't only have two more to do themselves and you already did that one ya know to be fair fighting she's gonna Ken's gonna do to your camps and I'll do yours all right I'm gonna cut this cake do it happening actually seems like it's going pretty well Chris do bad things are going well that's how things go bad clothes so you guys are gonna frost to like you're practicing this in a peanut butter and jelly Devon this is professional wedding cake so you gotta get my schmear game Oh that's you this is when you use your drawers and you don't want them to pop up placement this is the architecture part of the paper where I feel like an architecture of young look at whatever we were talking to pastries together it always sounds like we're talking to a child or dog mm-hmm so guys we're about to add our final layer it's happening should we get a drumroll and we're gonna do it together there we go yeah you can hold this around the edge and spin it and it'll pain it up for you really easy I mean this cake does look rustic yeah as a thing is a beautiful yeah it's it's a little bit rough around the edges but I think that's sort of in style right now that's we're decorating our cake with fruit so you can kind of cut it into a little heart by making a triangle the white heart look like your cards and you could put them up against this like that okay we did it we made like six baseball teams worth of flowers [Music] Kristen we try our beginning cash days yep which would certain others too many I'm like I don't even know which one exactly go for it I'm sure I feel like was playing really high stakes game get here first and cut out these little hearts we can put them as a little bouquet on the top as like a centerpiece all right it's done right going in the fridge to put the extra four and you were so mad thinking I ate one [Music] okay so we made it we brought our teeth down to the bus seat cafeteria we've invited some friends to come try our cakes and to judge our cakes based on presentation and taste I'm sweating I'm nervous shall we open it up you guys yeah sugar hi Peggy visually I think both cakes were presented really well I will say though with the red velvet cake it could have been a little bit more red my only issue with this cake was there's not enough contrast and the flowers were store-bought I'm Nikki I got married four months ago so I'm very experienced with wedding cake shopping someone's obviously very up to trend here and it keeps it very tricky everyone has one eye how to make a cake of my way but also like classic romance and elegance I've never faced so we've got two very opposite styles here all of our friends have judged based on presentations visuals now all that's left is to cut like a horrible Ouija board and make out I do [Music] he looks so delicious good all right [Applause] [Music] it's pretty solid yeah it reminds me of just like spring or summer time little bitter actually both there might be a little too much cocoa powder if it were me I would like it to be a little deeper red and more chocolate flavor the horchata cake is a little dense and the frosting is really sweet its base cinnamony talked about horchata winner-winner chata for lunch i'm judging these based off of a wedding perspective this is red velvet pretty light and refreshing horchata flavor now I'm torn okay because aesthetically this was my vibe taste wise though damn this is so good wow I was not prepared for the the amount of a game these judges brought today yeah that was okay they got I love like they said yeah and then they rotated I wanted to scream you ask you with a bunch of time you guys did great for a first time considering you guys didn't know how to use mixing bowls and you know what you've improved a lot in a couple days a couple of hours so the votes were tallied by our first date you the technique is a tight point five and following up and spread velvet and with 105 congratulations Jen because both you guys are what yeah the recipes are winners thank you today was hard it was so hard they're so tired environment and elements is very important when you're making a cake environment matters when you're making a wedding cake it's for someone biggest day of their life so the decoration has to be on point but if you make mistakes just slap some frosting on it it's hard putting so much like a heart and soul into something and you don't know what it's gonna turn out until the very very end these are very labor-intensive thinking it's very hard anyone that can bake well the service huge amount of props it's so much more than just following recipe yeah its science its architecture it's every it's skill it's a design it's like every subject I think you guys did a great job I mean it's not easy especially for the first time oh you guys did really good nice of you sippy so what do you think Jen could we combine both of these cakes into one giant cake ball making wedding cakes ladies taste it I do [Music] you [Music]", "eIM4U4fYwKQ": "i am so excited we found two cakes that have blue icing because i think that's gonna work in our favor for this to that episode three um we're making a winter wedding cake i'm super stoked for it and thank you so much to skillshare for sponsoring this video i have a really big announcement so like stay tuned until later and find out what it is why do they always cover everything in sprinkles there's so many sprinkles i'm gonna have to like carefully take off all of them but at least the blue icing i'll be able to reuse see since we're gonna do like a wintery wonderland kind of christmas cake but like in a very modern way i can use all the blue icings we didn't want to go like that red and green root and we really didn't want to go just like that basic white cake with flowers on it went to something different and fun and bold so oh yeah um subscribe if you guys have not subscribed already um hit the subscribe button we make fun content here and i never tell people to subscribe and i've been getting a hard time by youtube i'm being like not telling you guys to subscribe so got all the sprinkles off and i'm just realizing that all my white icing can go in with my blue icing because it's all gonna be blue icing in the end anyways why is my arm just like hanging here i notice i cook like that too like i'm like flipping pancakes so my hands just like up like this in the air i'm brushing my teeth like it's like my hand just doesn't know what to do with itself down here feels off so it's just like hello so i've got crumb coating icing finalizing and then this is just sprinkles i'm not gonna be able to use it but i can use it for something else maybe cake templates these i just are like parchment paper circles that i put at the bottom of my cake pan but i'm using it as a template this is an eight and a six inch round but i have to cut it down a bit i want these cakes to be as big as they can be and not have too much waste but i want to make two round cakes i can tear them together but i have to be able to cut both cakes out of these i need four layers out of this this one looks a bit smaller than this one kind of a measuring tape this one is seven and a half and then like this one at its smallest point like it's only seven grocery store bakers are gonna come for you again that's gonna need to come down more i need to cut a bit off of each of them so on a scale of one to ten how frustrated with the grocery store bakers are you right now i am not frustrated guys you guys are awesome okay last time none of this cake went to waste i think kevin ate half of it while we were doing this and then the other half i chopped into like little containers so whenever i'm tearing a cake i need like a cake board in between i've noticed that like a lot of people i don't think know how to tear cakes properly i think people just stick a cake on top of another cake and think it's okay and you have to add structure in otherwise your cake is gonna fall apart and it's gonna like collapse on itself and that's because one of the cakes that we ordered from one of the bakeries for a review video did collapse in on itself like the next day i woke up and the cake was everywhere that's because there's not like prop the and the funny thing is they teared it but like they didn't tear it properly um so i'm gonna start i'm looking for this cake board to be like the same size as the cake and then i'm gonna ice the first tier the top tier on this and decorate it on top of that and then get a yummy layer of filling in the middle i do not want to just leave these cakes as is as just like a vanilla cake with vanilla icing because this is a wedding cake i want to level up the flavors but because it's kind of like a winter christmas themed cake i want to have those kinds of fillings the top tier i wanted to do like a candy cane cream filling so i'm going to crush up some candy canes and sprinkle those all and fold it into the filling itself so it's going to have those like chunks and crunches of candy cane which i think is going to be so yummy and for the bottom tier i wanted to do like a hot chocolate flavored one so i'm gonna be folding an actual hot chocolate powder into my icing and then layer that in i think like sprinkles some like little mini marshmallows on top because that's what you expect when you get like a hot chocolate that's good like 10 10 recommend like just mix some you know how i got like caramel hot chocolate mix and just mix in some icing now to hold my fillings in i'm just gonna do a little moat on the outside and then i can just like scoop this yummy filling in and i feel like i made way too much filling it's okay because they're both super yummy and then our bottom tier we're gonna do the hot cocoa one i'm very proud of this building and like i know i'm aware that many marshmallows don't exactly scream wedding but since i'm going with the hot cocoa flavor i feel like you can't have the hot cocoa without marshmallows so i'm gonna add them in now i'm gonna use the icing that already had some like crumbs in it to crumb coat the whole cake but so far like i'm feeling optimistic like we've done one of these so i've got some more confidence in last time and i feel like the flavors are really good and on theme for what i was going for so normally with cakes once you're done crumb coating them you chill them but i did a test with this icing like last week to see if it did chill and harden up and it doesn't when it goes in the fridge it gets rubbery which is weird so i'm feeling the vibe of having it like a white cake and then having maybe like two or three different shades of blue but since this icing already had all of the blue in it from the decorations i feel like i'm just gonna see what this one looks like so i feel like this blue is just a little bit too like almost like sky blue like a little bit too bubbly and i want more moody blues i'm thinking if i add some black in today it's just gonna dull it like i'm just looking for more of like a dull color which is weird because i usually think like people are looking for vibrant colors but winter is so cold and i want like a cake to feel very like kind of cold looking something is wrong with this icing the more i mix it like that it looks like spongy almost it's like really thick it's hardly mixing like i don't know if you can see the difference there but if you watch me try to like glide my spatula through like it's just it barely moves whereas this one it just so easily this glides through so this is like fresh icing that hasn't been put on a cake and this is the one that came off the cake that i tried to like mix and add color into and when we're talking about when this icing goes in the fridge it gets to be that like sticky rubberiness i think that's what this is i'm just left with this like sticky mess that i can't use like i can't put this on a cake because this color is supposed to go on top of white and if i try to do even like a little test here it won't go on top because it's because it's so thick and dense and like way more icing okay i've added like a lot of water and i mean a lot of water i mean like probably a quarter cup of water to try to soften it and it's soft like i feel like the sponginess came out of it and it's soft it's just the weight of it is so heavy because i feel like it's so dense i think i can still ice with it i just don't think i can mix it with the other icing as much like i have to be careful but i think i can glide my spatula through so i think i'll be able to smooth it out because i'd really rather not go to the store right now i'm really never anticipating the icing coloring being the difficult part of the video but before i get into decorating the cake i want to thank skillshare for sponsoring this video and fill you guys in on my secret project that i've been working on for months i'm launching my first ever online class through skillshare and i seriously can't tell you guys how excited i am and how much hard work went into this class to make it perfect for you we

box down below will get a free trial of skillshare's premium membership where you can explore your creativity and get inspired let's decorate some cakes you messed up you guys can hear me i'm guessing for that whole section yeah we didn't turn it out no we yeah we i'm icing a cake i might see a cake i don't know what you're doing let's fill you in what you missed i iced a cake that that's about as far as we got this bottom tier i want to design just with i'm planning to ice it in this color blue and now i want to put like other colors kind of blotched on top of it and then i'm going to really blend it through because i wanted these colors in it but not chunky looking but the top tier the top tier i want that to be kind of chunky looking i've never does like i've never done this technique before so we're just kind of trying something here but i think this should give me the look i'm going for that's all you missed just blend yes okay this is what i wanted i'm super happy with that okay feeling good this one i just want to ice in white icing i'm thinking that that'll help me control the blotches that are going on because then i can have kind of a neutral undertone and then have big bold pops of color i don't know if i like this i feel like it's like maybe it'll come together right now it's like not not the vision like i think i need to blend it more i think i'm just gonna add on colors in blotches and just hope that i get more of that blotchy effect and less of a blended effect i think that's what i'm gonna do so what i was saying earlier in the video with like that other cake not working because they had teared it improperly what i was talking about is they put two dowels in when you put two dowels in a cake the weight of the cake yes it's being supported by the dowels but it can still tip this way or tip this way you want the weight kind of evenly distributed compared to a table like a table with three legs or two legs yes then it's more tippy full what if your cake is not the exact same height all the way around impossible how is that impossible did you see how on level those grocery store bakers made it oh no he did okay okay okay okay don't drop it why are they like the same size stop it oh i think you should have oh why is it so far you didn't tell me they're like the same size oh my god you're supposed to like guide me i'm not taking this off and scraping it down to change the size that's not happening so i'm going to try to scrape icing off of this one to make it smaller and add more icing onto this one to make it bigger and while i do that i'm going to try to add more whites into the top tier and more blues into the dark shades into the bottom tier to try to make them more of a contrast i am not happy that i'm scraping back cakes that i just iced you know what hopefully it'll look better i feel like it's better at least i can see like an edge here but it was also an hour of me just like putting icing on and taking it off i feel like i'm still not totally feeling the vibe of it it needs a lot more on it i want to do gold except i don't want to do gold leaf i want to do kind of like a gold splatter and i haven't done ever a gold spotter i've done splatter cakes but i don't i don't know what i'm doing with this but i want like streaks and like flicks and chunks of gold with these dust and stuff like that i always use alcohol usually vodka because then the vodka or alcohol evaporates and it just leaves the color i want to try and see what's gonna look like before i do it all over the cake and then like ruin the cake what do we think of that i think if when i go farther away it did more dots think when i'm close when i'm close right i like it okay um i like it oh i see it on the plant it's all over the place why weren't we using this yes okay i think we're there now question do we leave the board rustic and artistic or do we like clean it up yeah why don't we move on to the flowers and then we can like circle back to the board i'm aware that this looks like a lot but i wanted options and i'm seeing this is like i know that the needles are not the look i was going for but i didn't want flowers like i didn't want this to be covered in flowers i really just wanted that like greenery look and i got these to look like you know those little red balls like cranberries and i didn't want like bold flowers i just want to kind of like almost like a doll muted flower i thought these ones look kind of frosted so i'm gonna get those ready to put into the cake whenever i'm putting flowers or anything greenery like fresh like that into the cake i always just use floral tape and that helps protect the flower from going into the cake flowers like this they usually have pesticides in them from when they are grown and we do not want that going into the cake and then you can just stick that right into the cake [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] it's sunday i tried calling like 10 bakeries to quote my cake and everyone is closed the only one person i talked to said that my cake was very messy and they could make it more better um so i'm going to call more people tomorrow and put the final phrase here of what they think is worth and if i'm officially offended let me know in the comments section if you guys also hate it or think it's messy and thank you again so much to skillshare for sponsoring this video guys go check out my class i am so excited about it and the first thousand people to click the link down the description box will get a free trial of skillshare's premium membership love you oh awesome this is the last video of like 2020 so i will see you next year and bring on 2021 hopefully it's better [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you", "lC-3Pvg6EVA": "what's up guys hoping a man about cake I'm your host Joshua John Russell and this summer I was fortunate enough to make the wedding cake for Mercedes and Tommy from the Shahs of Sunset so today I'm gonna recreate the cake in a smaller version so you can see how I did it I'm gonna build a 3-tiered vanilla cake filled with vanilla buttercream and fresh berries and finish with lots of gold piping let's do it [Music] and in five four Skoda I'm gonna start by breaking down a 10 inch vanilla cake did you guys watch the episode yeah how does it end as in three episodes I did how did I do you did wonderful thanks I had a weird mohawk at the time I just wondered when your first UFC fight was alright I'm gonna clean up all my crumbs I'm never gonna fill this with vanilla buttercream and fresh berries oh okay before we fill this I just realized that I baked from size it's supposed to be an eight so I'm going to trim this is a ten I'm gonna trim them down [Music] to eat nervous when when they had the cameras on you I wasn't nervous at all why not because there's 15 cameras around me so much garbage cake like cake fries eat different okay now we're gonna fill it [Music] all right first trip to the cooler then we'll cut besides crumb coat and final coat [Applause] [Music] [Music] when you get this guy in the cooler get it nice and cold I'll tighten it up and then we'll panel it on it yeah paneling so Josh would be carefully show a clip from the show of the KQ man you should yeah absolutely all right yeah you want to do a fancy toss to it here's a clip from the show [Music] [Applause] would you guys think I hope you like the cake let me know below and let me know what TV show you think I should collaborate next all right I got my top panel I'm gonna grab the cake and I'm just going to trim the sides but I'm gonna use this little guide here so I don't mess up a little bit my buttercream but I do is I kind of stick it on there like that and I can button up run my blade across it so how long did it take you to make the shah's cake it took me a solid week yeah it was a it was a really fun experience and they were lovely people and I would do it again in a heartbeat everything was beautiful and wide and it's a lot like Brandon's wedding because it hasn't they had one of those tables wasn't what's the table called men's clothes so free yeah they had right back they had grapes and like all kinds of food the food symbolizes prosperity how's it working great I have a fancy wolf dog he's about 50 huge 300 bucks Dario has his own Instagram but diet does have it was to grab ya up Dario the wolf dog please follow hat yeah yeah and the sauce cake was a seven tiered cake it was seven tiers seven real tiers of cake mm-hm it's all okay but I got feedback from one of the people at the wedding and they said it was delicious all right I'm gonna get this back in the cooler and roll out my side panels so I'm gonna roll us out the same way I have it in the log but I'm gonna roll it out long so I can wrap it around two of the sides your favorite part Brennan no great on the end been around since we've had the panel and so long no it's been great did you think about it at all while you were gonna definitely never thought about paneling once where were you again Brandon ocean's 11 legit where were you I was on paternity leave you don't have a baby no this is my wedding I don't think you know what paternity really means let's roll this guy up [Music] okay I mean it's back in the cooler and then we'll roll out on the panel yeah super nice okay the cake is all paneled and so now we're going to pipe so on NJ's wedding cake I piped this really ornate sort of like looks like crown molding around the bottom tiers so I'm gonna do this same idea but it's gonna be a little bit different but I'm gonna start with this tip which is a it's like a small star tip but you guys know how to pipe we're gonna pipe and then pipe on top in the pipe again and kind of widen it out and so once it's all piped I let it dry and we'll paint it gold then we'll go back with some white female [Music] so my royal has been drawing for about an hour and it's firm to the touch and now we can paint it so I'm gonna do this with a little bit of gold dust and some confectioners glaze and a paintbrush lots of paint brushes I like options so we'll just hydrate the powder give it a good stir that is beautiful hey Joshua yo you want to answer some viewer questions and comments sure all right first one is from oops sorry I'm gonna mess this

old-school wedding cake with my new school spin I'm gonna be able to five tiered vegan carrot cake with big and cream cheese frosting and finish it which pillars little figurines stairs and even a fountain it's gonna be so retro you guys ready [Music] we're gonna start by breaking down an 8-inch vegan carrot cake by the way if you want this recipe I have a new show on blueprint about baking swaps and this is a vegan episode that we did I'm like digging carrot cake with digging cream cheese and you can get your free trial to blueprint right down there your the recipes in the show what do we do on that show James and do a big in carrot cake we do a dairy-free cheese cake that was really good with cereal crust and then we made a colorful Kim oh that was that we were a rainbow cake that was all natural it's a really fun show you guys to check it out all right let's clear my crumbs and we'll fill this guy with vegan cream cheese frosting so that's be good yes so it's made with vegan cream cheese and vegan butter substitute and vanilla and powdered sugar I just gave her the whole recipe there it is you guys should check it out how do you get vegan cheese it's made with almond milk or almond usually with nuts they also have cream cheese flavorings to which I've tried in like butter cream that has the butter substitute that works pretty good too where the almonds milked responsibly they were they were raised responsibly and North responsibly yes free-range almonds always alright first trip to the cooler and we turn the size come coat hey don't throw that away don't throw it away okay we're gonna want to eat that oh this is hard to do with this coat off that's right guys there's no more garbage picker he's not kidding just house tall the garbage cake [Music] are you guys quiet humming what's aggressive humming humming always all right now we're gonna do some piping on the cake I'm gonna do it in this teal buttercream because why not it matches my outfit here you guys have seen me pipe I like to do a sort of modern style piping we're gonna go old school and just on the ruffles like my shirt so I have a few different tips we're gonna switch up the first thing I have is just the round tip I'm gonna mark my cake first so it's symmetrical all the way around so I'm just gonna make a little dot here and then spin it around come straight across do another dot and then I'll split it all up evenly do you normally again I don't I do dairy free and gluten free lifestyle why do you have so many vegan recipes I had a friend who wanted to make a cake wanted me to make cake for his girlfriend she was vegan and I didn't have a recipe so his mom gave me there her chocolate cake recipe that she used I tweaked it a little bit it turned out to be really really delicious and so I just started using it as my base okay now I'm gonna switch to this tip so this is what you would normally make a rose with it also makes ruffles so I'm actually gonna start with the fat side at the very top and then I'm just gonna wiggle my way down to make these little ruffles [Music] all right now I'm switching to my round tip and we're gonna pipe some graduated dots underneath my ruffle I'm gonna start with the biggest dot under each one now I'm gonna switch to a white buttercream and I have a star tip on here a small star tip and we're gonna do some Scrolls on top of the top of the ruffles now I'm gonna switch the teal to a star tip and make some little rosettes where all of my ruffles meet and then for the last touch one little Center in white that is some retro piping so now I've never used one of these fountains we're gonna test it out and make some teal water let's see if we can get it to bubble so this is our kickstand normally these things are white I painted it black this is one of those cakes that I grew up seeing at church weddings where basically the reception is in the reception hall and like your grandmom ate your cake wait wait wait what you were thinking like old-school southern wedding yeah why is this what the Italians done yeah I was thinking like old-school a godfather Italian they have those too I'm sure they had these weddings daddy's when he thinks wedding cakes are like huge in the 70s and 80s I guess they still are popular keeping the others I know that's why I ordered that suit for you it's like hey do you see what a monkey I am I just put it on and started to go hey what's up guys look I'm going okay I didn't question it yeah none of us makes any sense when we get drinks uh my calculator okay anyways I got to put this concert together and it said it came with instructions mind and not so we're gonna just wing it this looks right I'm gonna make you a cake you can okay this will go in the middle I'm totally gonna put one of those in my yard and our use only sorry that's a little these things work together why and then there's a thing here and that's gonna be a one that maybe I'll have to like prop it up okay we'll get there they go together though okay now I have to make my tea old water I don't know how much water it takes because they didn't come with an instruction they weren't in there it should get for buying things on eBay where's it supposed to be actual punch well I guess it would be a really tiny cup what is that a punch bowl for ants you know when I was little and I would see these cakes I used to get so excited and then by the time I graduate from culinary school this was so out of style so I'm just gonna make one of the show that that's pretty teal right that's pretty good it's really cool I have some sparklies 2jj sparkles secret oh yes more of those yeah make it good and chunky that should work well is it chunky it looks like ocean water from Sonic all right I'm just

reviews all of them from one star I hope it doesn't ruin my wedding day your favorite one star rated Fiverr designer he's back considering that this is gonna be my second wedding I want to do something completely crazy so this is the sketch basically there we use last time I had a dream about this cake so it's gonna be so bad if it doesn't work you might be thinking a wedding cake with only two layers but I had a vision I think the top layer is going to be so tall and it's going to look incredible I'm thinking of turning the whole top of the cake into a birdcage I know a birdcage isn't the most romantic thing for a wedding cake but I really really think this is going to work so just just let me do my best here all right so let me zoom in in here so I think I want my bird cage to be like in brown and the reason why I wanted to be in brown is because I still want this to look like a wedding cake I think it's going to make it look more like organic or something yeah this is going to be a little bit tacky but honestly every Kurt wedding cake needs to be at least like 11% tacky I want the top of the cake to be a heart and I'm hoping that they make this out of chocolate like that would be incredible we're putting Vegas in getting married in Vegas all we need is an Elvis performer maybe let me add a little more detail here in the heart let's start building our cage so I'm thinking they're like like thickness this is gonna be the front of the cage if anything fails I do have a career on Fiverr okay I hope they still understand this is not an actual cage and it's supposed to be made of cake because like they could just send an empty cake so kind of like how I did on the top I think I'm going to add just the details just to make this look more like poop met these on the corners I'm just going to like half a heart so this it does look it looks like a Las Vegas okay no this is gonna work I believe in it I believe in my vision so this is gonna probably sound a little bit crazy but instead of having like a bride and the groom I think we should have two birds it's inclusive anyone can be a bird it's honestly really difficult to draw bird so this bird is gonna be a bit lower there we go this is our second bird I'm just gonna do the outlines of the birds otherwise if just they're not gonna understand what this whole thing is and honestly same what I want to do is I want to choose the color for the cake and I think the ideal caller to make this super wedding like would be like a very light blue this toys really satisfied to use this like watercolor still keeping the theme of the very light colors this is gonna be great well I love what this is looking like an Easter nightmare but make sure gets a little bit darker in the center yeah I feel like that's still fast all right my choice is so color are questionable yes well it is what I'm doing you might have seen this coming but my idea is basically that this is going to be grass so this is going to be grass it still kind of looks like a wedding cake right okay so this is the last thing you want to add to this cake and I think that this is going to truly make this like the best cake ever I get really confident in this so I kind of want like a strong dark green I am going to basically draw just some greens not bad let's make sure it comes from the back as well otherwise the back of the cake is gonna be really boring and no I have not lost my mind this is going to make sense who knew I was gonna become a cake designer honestly not me look at us now what I thought I think at least one person is going to order this cake as an actual wedding cake I think that's going to happen am i delusional yes these are supposed to be flowers I'm not sure if I'm doing the best job of doing them my flowers may need a little bit of work I'm actually surprised because I really do think my vision it's getting really close to what I saw in my head wow we really said flowers that's like a lot I like it I really do I think it's gonna be great I honestly like it so we're gonna do the yellow bits on the flowers just to make sure they know these are flowers I wouldn't be too disappointed if they chose to do it in different colors but like oops I don't know if they're gonna get this is supposed to be a wedding cake they're gonna be like it's a weird bachelor party a bachelor party when when you have posters of Jesus growing up in your bedrooms so this is basically oh my god I'm gonna zoom out and we're gonna see the full effect so this is going to be my second wedding cake that I'm gonna order from a one and a five-star bakery that's like a law going on maybe if we do a different color for the background this is going to stand out I really said designer and no one really said I do and that is it I like it I didn't want to do something as safe and plain as last time and put just the bride and the groom this is what we're gonna go with I feel like this is as exciting as we can be for a wedding cake and hopefully they're gonna do this in pastel colors we're gonna send this with one and a five-star bakery and next time we see you guys I'm gonna have the cakes in my house and we're going to react to them welcome to my second wedding day I hope my grandma's proud we're gonna go straight into it I've done four or five videos with cake so you guys know our works the cake is here I can't actually look to my right otherwise I will see it I have not seen it I will talk about this at the end of the video because I know there's been a drama with a cake situation I get help with these videos so I really haven't seen it so we're gonna bring the firestore cake and then we'll talk about that at the end so this is my wedding cake from a five-star bakery should we get rid of the box already a lot of duct tape is he ready is it turned again already so this is wedding cake from the 5-star bakery that we designed Wow oh my god the birds they've got eyes that's a lot of work like this is a lot more detail than I was like expecting it's also a little bit darker it's a lot of brown I thought the bottom would be like huge and then this would be tiny but like it's a birdcage like it's a life-size birdcage it's really good it's like really good I've literally got nothing bad to say like the way they've done this I will obviously zoom in and show you the details the grass oh my god the grass is insane also all of us when we can finally go outside the flowers are literally insane but this is so so nice I'm so interested how they've done days like it's so smooth I've literally never seen a cake that looks so shiny and smooth it looks like it's made of plastic like we'll say give you guys a zoom in on this I don't know if you guys are going to agree with me but in my opinion it looks better than what I made I'm really curious to see what's gonna happen with them one star while the birds really said pixel we can definitely say that it's a really busy cake right but what they've done was an incredible job so that it spray from every angle like you can even look at it from the back if I needed a word to describe this cake is like super super polished they did the little hard I don't know if you guys will be able to see them the brown part looks like wood and this looks like Italian painting or something I don't know it's like it's nice have you seen the texture of that grass like how if they done that it looks like it's like wet and it's going to melt like the whole thing is super super solid the birds they look a little bit pixelated when you zoom in what kind of witchcraft is this the flowers are so thin if it was wind in here they'd be like moving turns out not like the more you look the more you find like interesting things to look at but I think one of the real stars of the cake is the way it's so smooth it's perfect why does the universe hate me a real five-star cake in my opinion like that's literally the way I would put it so this to my right is the one star rated wedding cake and I just want to say that I've never ordered from this bakery before he had exactly three reviews all of them from one star I hope it doesn't ruin my wedding day holy fungal infection vacuum no be sanitary I'm gonna need even more antibacterial than I was thinking this looks like I made it it's so bad how much is this cost this cost a hundred and ten pounds a hundred and ten pounds a hundred and ten pounds it doesn't even hold still they don't even know how to frost a cake imagine this is your wedding day and then then someone says let's play the wedding song and then someone comes in it does smell kinda nice wait let me get this away this cake costs almost a hundred and twenty pounds while the other one costs two hundred fifty so like they don't even know what to do frosting have you seen that cuz I have and that's dr. Oetker there's a hair on my cake Wow they don't even know how to do the support of the cake I'm the one who's gonna need support after this mental support oh my god the birds in the front they look like sardines they printed a photo from the National Geographic look at the birds normally I'm like you know wow these look like a org no this is not look like a lot of work I didn't realize this was the blindfolded cake challenge but I guess here it is I wish it was blindfolded myself and loved all they tried to do that little green bit that I added and then they realized well this is not mean to connect so they just gave up you know when the cake is so bad right that he almost starts to look like kind of fancy like people could have paid a lot of money for this and you came to see it it's rustic Wow I mean do we even want to zoom in on this we're gonna find out once we cut into it but I also have a feeling there Betty Crocker's got an appearance in here a guest star the cake does smell nice I gotta give it to them I've always loved Betty Crocker you may be wondering did they do that hard detail on top oh yes they did you can just grab it that's the heart on top they couldn't even make it stand I hope the criminal didn't make this because I could run a fingerprint scan in here but like I mean this is just oh my god like I literally can't stop looking at it the one thing they did right was they kind of did the little sticks I mean I did ask for that this one doesn't the sticks are not visible Oh turns out I just improved the cake please forgive me for goes all the way down wait how is this possible how is the whole thing made of cake oh this is so beautiful I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I don't even know how they did that that looks like actual wood which is this edible yeah it is it's made of sugar the birds are edible the wedding cake really said full of you in Twitter how is this possible I guess this can now be possible like this is a whole slice pause the video and let me know do you think this is going to slice as a whole cake without breaking or do you think it's going to break some of you guys are gonna win some of you are about to lose but we're gonna find that is an insane amount of work and scale how is it possible this is this is incredible okay we're gonna remove this heart because this is really not doing much here there's like a little turd on top of the cake this is on top of the cake so I'm gonna try to slice this that is great as well like so I'm gonna try oh my god oh my god I really saw this happening but then it still happened it smells really nice but that is what the slice of cake looks like I know we made a lot of jokes but it does smell incredible and I would be lying to you if I didn't say that I don't want to eat it because they do we love a family reunion this literally looks like a really weird family reunion this is like that cute couple of love is blind versus Jessica so we're gonna start by trying the Victoria sponge which is the five-star one it's very dense but it's just vanilla cake with vanilla frosting just simple I guess it is for a wedding somewhere people go for it's definitely homemade visually it does look perfect like the layers and everything you'd think that it's more like a premade like mix I think this is homemade it's really good it's really dense if you like a dense cake it's almost like a scone but they do like it on this side we're gonna try green frosting with chocolate cake it doesn't taste like chocolate at all it's like I'm really confused because I feel like this might not be chocolate cake it might be carrot cake or like red velvet I honestly can't tell it tastes like pumpkin spice a little bit so he could be carrot cake it's like that's gonna be like my final guest it is quite good I mean I do like it but it does taste like like rye bread well I really did enjoy that but this is just different it just tastes like I really just taste expensive and then in terms of looks I mean are we even this is the most beautiful cake we've ever had it's literally insane this is the winner the Sarris the winter times through his office I hope you guys enjoyed that I know surprisingly a lot of people who are planning their weddings watch these videos and they find it helpful for like whether you should trust like a low rated bakery or not or for cake ideas because the mind of a mastermind no even joking I would love to do another one I love making wedding cakes so if you want to hire me I'll put my fiver down in the description before you go I would really appreciate if you guys could subscribe to my youtube channel if you haven't done it yet I feel like it's so annoying that I have to say this in every video but obviously when you guys subscribe it makes it possible to make these videos and especially when like these cakes are like quite expensive so it does help if you guys sometimes you guys ask me what's the better way to support my channel and it's literally to subscribe to my channel and put my notifications on which is free and now before I go and this is the last thing I want to talk about there's been drama on my previous cake video I ordered these viral realistic cakes apparently a lot of people cuz I've been getting a lot of DMS and screenshots they think I've switched the cakes like I switched the one star and the five star I never addressed this kind of stuff cuz I don't have to sit here and explain cuz I've got nothing to hide however it bothered me a little bit because I put a lot of effort into my content and like one of my favorite things is that to get an actual genuine reaction on camera because I'm not an actor I'm like a real person so when I order these cakes I genuinely do not see them I actually have to have people help me picking up the cakes putting the cakes next to me and just making sure the camera works like this is something that I'm really careful so I you literally don't even take a peek on any of the cake and on that specific video I got someone to help me pick them up and they actually arrived in different dice so they were putting two completely different locations so we double triple checked so it just happens that some of these bakers sometimes they've they've got a bad day I mean we all have a bad day in which things don't come out the best that's called Monday to Friday in my case I'm really proud of the concepts of videos that I come up with I think we come up with a lot of original stuff that sometimes ends up becoming like trans on YouTube like I feel like this happened to me maybe three four times so I'm proud of the I'm proud of my creative ideas single time you guys see one of the comments saying that please link them to this specific part of the video I guess I just don't want people to think that I don't take my creative and my video ideas seriously because I do and I would no lie to you guys so that is the tea that there is no tea I like we double triple check guys I'm good in another kink video coming up soon which is not a wedding cake but loves to do this again so let me know and I will see you guys on my next video and hopefully there's no drive with this delivery guys and I will see you on my next video bye bye", "ly3ytr_Sbok": "hi everyone welcome back to Rachel's enchanting cakes asked promised a brand new tutorial this time featuring two brand-new molds from marvelous moles on the base here I have used the garden gate on lay mold and show you everything in detail in this tutorial and you will find all of these molds in the description below this YouTube video to that official website the second tier I have used both the garden gauge and the fluted thin press mold in order to create a heart you can see that repeated on that beautiful top tier with both the fluted sin pressed and also the garden gate on way very very easy to use but so so effective I do think you're gonna enjoy this one guys thank you all for your amazing support I do have some more new content coming very soon and I hope have helped you again today happy baking guys and I will back soon with more new completely free content start by rolling out 1.5 kilogram of black fondant and place it directly over your 10 inch round 8 inch deep cake for the purpose of this tutorial I am using a cake doughnut which is already been covered in cooled down boiled water negotiate the plates and cut off all excess fondant and then smooth out and so you get the perfect smooth finish on your cake for the garden-gate pattern I need to get my modeling paste to the right thickness for this I am using a pasta machine so start by rolling out your modeling paste is relatively thin you then want to place this through the pasta machine first of all on number 1 which is the thickest setting then I place it through twice on number 2 and finally I place it through the pasta machine on number 3 start by dusting down the garden-gate circle only with some icing sugar you will find a link to this product on their official website in the description below this YouTube video once you have done this is simply placed over your modeling paste and use your fingers to push it into the actual online and taking your rolling pin simply go over this you will have the correct thickness because you've used a pasta machine and the parts that you do not need will come away these finally using my Dresden tool I take away all the parts that are on the inside that we do not want as part of the pattern so to add this beautiful pattern to my cake I actually steam mind you can add a small amount of edible glue directly to the modeling paste these panels are designed to simply fit together on even sized cakes but what I absolutely love about this one even though the design is only 4 inches deep as you can see here then still work on deeper cakes so on this 8-inch cake I am able to double up the design when I say even sized pate they are designed to fit your orange six inch 10 inch 12 inch cakes etc goes on very very easily and I then simply paint it with Regency gold and a small amount of alcohol and this is the finished result for the second tier I have rolled out one kilogram of fondant in total I have covered the cake domain which is an 8 inch deep 18th round cake delay with some cooled down bottled water simply drape your fondant directly over the caterer me I find this much easier by using the rolling pin to support the fondant start by cutting off any excess just to prevent your fondant from actually ripping especially if you're used using a sharp edged cake domain you then want to take your time negotiating the pleats and juicing some cakes smoothers simply smooth this out using fake hall's Regency gold simply add two parts of this dust to a small part to one part alcohol you want to milk white texture in order to airbrush the cake domain simply apply your edible paint directly to an airbrush and go over the cake to me several times I find it best to go over it once place it in an oven with the oven light on allow the paint to set and then keep going over it until you have got rid of any white patches for the centre roll out some black fondant so it's exactly 5 millimeters thick for this I use spaces taking the new flutes impress mold by marvelous molds I think you place on an indentation and put away the excess fondant using a piece of cotton you want to now take the sim pressed mold and place it directly over your fondant either use a rolling pin I roll over the back of the mold first and then over the front just to pick up all of those will look like indentations this mold will then stand peel away with ease I have added some water to the inside of my cake delay and I simply add one panel at a time the part that overlaps I then trim off with a sharp knife I add the panels to the base first and then this gets flipped upside down and I repeat this process for the rest of the cake domani all you need to do now is cover up the rim so I have covered this with very small hearts using a heart plunger cutter book just look that beautiful detail inside the actual cake domain using the garden gate on way just like we did with the base - you start by adding some edible glue to the black fondant you now want to add this directly to a piece of white fondant that is five millimeters thick that has been used with the fluted thin press in order to get it the correct size now simply peel this away in an add this directly to the fluted sim press mold apply some pressure directly on that and this beautiful pattern will end up coming through if you use your rolling pin just to get it all even when you actually pull this away look or what it leaves behind simply cut out a heart shape and then I choose to paint mine gold and this is what goes in the center as soon as the edible paint has completely set I simply apply this directly to the center of the cage only and very carefully using some edible glue in order to cover my top tier which is a six inch round eight inch deep domain I am using the wrapping round method so I've rolled out a very long piece of black fondant I have covered my domain with some water and then you simply roll it over this is physically possible with a K I have done it before but you must make sure that your cake is completely refrigerated and all the fillings and the crumb coat is completely set once you have done this you simply then cover the top of the cake or in my case the cake domain with a thin amount of black fondant and we are ready to decorate I'm covering this tier with the fluted thin press or I start by rolling my fondant in between five millimetres space using my sim press mold as a guide I now place this over the fondant then using a pizza cutter I cut away where the indentations are I chose to grease my sim press mold with a small amount of Trix vegetable fat as I find the fondant comes away north alot easier simply place the fondant inside and then using a rolling pin gently roll over to pick up on the detail for an 8-inch deep six inch round cake you will need six of these panels in total and they will meet flawlessly from where they start to finish so just like I did with the based Here I am steaming the cake and then just applying each panel these are a lot easier to add because you can physically pick them up and you're not relying on them to actually come out of the mold make sure your plane of steam if you don't have a steam you can use edible glue I then just put a heart shape out of the center whilst the fondant is still soft I then simply repeated what I did for the middle TF making a heart using both the garden-gate on my and the fluted sim press I apply this directly to the cake domain where I've cut the heart shape away and then I start to paint the sections that are yellow with gold the final finishing touch is just to add a few black hearts using a simple heart plunger cutter just to cover up where the indentations and the lines actually up if this was a real cake I'm never to explain to you how I would suck it for a wedding so here I have my decorated cake drop and I have placed an indentation on that so I have a 10-inch round diameter just so I know where to place the cake now if this was a real cake instead of a cake dummy I would have left it in the fridge so that everything all the fondant would go ugly and hard all of the fillings inside would go lovely and hard and it would have been on a cake board I would then physically be able to lift it from that baking paper and place it directly onto my cake drum which would be covered with buttercream not water just so it's a bit more sticky but obviously I'm working the past styrene dummy and you'd be able to do it without risking damaging that fondant yes the cake will sweat it is only condensation this is completely normal and you would do this the morning of the wedding you would then need to dowel this based here not because of the cake do Mabel because of the tear that would be cake that will be going on the top no matter what this heart-shaped cake do you would not be cake it would always be a cake domain in order to support everything that is above it and to not collapse so down this tear place on a small amount of water this time because remember is a cake domain so the cake do we will physically stick to the fondant on your real cake and then this just wants to be placed into a box and put to one side so you're now at the venue you have taken the first two tiers that you have added together already at home in the box and now you just need to add the top tier at the venue but remember this is old cake it's top-heavy it's very very tall so this is the safest way to do it again this would be on a cake card or cake board you would place it directly on top with a small amount of buttercream and then you just need to add a couple of those beautiful hearts", "orHaNgcDEDE": "i really don't have a plan for this we are doing great guys real great but we're not making this a fail video we are going to make it a success video hey guys kaley bakes cakes here and today we are doing the long awaited part two of the store-bought cake and turning it into a wedding cake i really didn't want to do this second part but you guys really wanted to see it so i'm doing it for you it better be good because i spent too much money on these store-bought cakes so we are going to make sure that they turn out the way that they should this time i have learned a lot from the last time and i have a better game plan of what to do this time i bought a crap on a cake for this so let's just do it so here i have two half sheet cakes and it's a lot of cake so it gives me a lot of stuff to work with i'm basically just going to take off all of this excess frosting and then what i learned from the last one is that one i needed a lot more cake for it to be considered like a wedding cake and then two i should not have been using cake pans to be cutting out the sizes so i have uh cake boards that i'm gonna place on the tops of the cakes and i'm gonna cut straight down not at an angle and cut out the cake rounds now both of these cakes are different flavors this one is vanilla and then this one is a marble cake so i'm thinking what i'm going to do is get the same flavor essentially out of all three tiers i'm getting it i'm going to make three tiers the base one being eight inch then the middle one's a six inch and then the top one's gonna be a four inch and just making sure that they're all the same flavor whenever i stack them on top of each other because like last time the cakes were really short i'm gonna go ahead and scrape off this excess frosting okay i'm gonna need a bigger bowl so it was actually really difficult to find these and when i was walking away with two full half sheet cakes from the grocery store people were one looking at me like she crazy at the same time two people were probably thinking like where are you going with that that you need to feed that many people little do they know it's just for me so okay we are done with the first one and now we can go ahead and cut out the cake layers i'm using a smaller serrated knife to do this and learning from last time i'm going to cut straight down into this cake instead of at an angle don't ask me why i did that so i'm just going to go around here in a kind of sawing motion we were able to actually cut three layers of the vanilla cake of the six inch out of this half sheet so pretty happy with that let's try the cake on its own just the cake see like that's fine it's nice and light it honestly doesn't really have much flavor and i'm gonna see how many we can get out of this cake here i'm hoping maybe we can get three but we'll see [Music] now that i have all of the cake layers all cut out i'm now going to sandwich them together i have my vanilla swiss buttercream here if you want a video for that let me know in the comments below and i'm just gonna sandwich these with my own buttercream a dollop of my vanilla buttercream second one on okay got that done and now i'm just gonna put the top tier on wow and i'm just gonna do a crumb coat a light crumb coat around the sides okay i am honestly so glad that this is turning out okay this time but i may be speaking too soon so i'm just gonna let this chill and then we'll put the final outside frosting on the cakes okay it's been a long while but i'm back i have glasses on and i didn't film this part but i frosted all of the cakes because i figured that's not anything out of the ordinary so i frosted them they all look really nice and pristine and now we're going to stack them you tell me i mean i don't think this looks like a grocery store about cake so i'm pretty dang excited hey guys so it is now the next day i let the cake chill overnight and now we can go ahead and decorate it i wanted to do some detailing on this cake i didn't want to just keep it like this i kind of wanted to judge it up some more so i'm doing kind of like a scalloped look here if this is a number four piping tip i'm just kind of making wide use so i'm gonna kind of do that but i'm gonna do it all over the cake here [Music] and then this one i think i'm gonna just put little polka dots just throughout the cake [Music] i just finished decorating the cake i'm pretty happy with it now we can go ahead and add on the flowers i'm going to try and do like a spread on the middle part of the cake and kind of go out of diagonal here and then i have a little cake topper as well because i knew it was going to work this time so let's go ahead and decorate this cake and here is the finished product i'm so happy with it i'm so glad that this one turned out a million times better than the one that i did last time if you watched all the way to the end comment below let me know that you did and i don't know let me know what you think about this i think for you know buying everything just from the grocery store the cake itself the flowers you know i think it looks pretty dang good for being a less than 100 cake if you like this video like it comment below what i should do next and i will see you guys in the next one [Music]", "kQHrGw6me7o": "- Hi, I'm Sally from\nSally's Baking Addiction and today I'm showing you\nexactly how I made this homemade two tiered wedding cake. On the bottom is a nine\ninch cake with cake dals for support. On top is this six inch cake. This size is simple, fats\nfree and completely doable for the home baker. I have the cake and frosting\nrecipes on my website as well as flavor ideas, a\ncomplete list of supplies, make ahead tips and detailed\nassembly instructions. You can find it all on my blog\nsallysbakingaddiction.com. I already baked and\ncooled the cake layers. Now let's level them off so\nthey are completely flat on top. Feel free to discard the portion of cake that you leveled off or save for a trifle or an ice cream topping. (upbeat music) Both cake tiers need a crumb coat which is a thin layer of\nfrosting around the edges. The crumb coat prevents\nthe outer layer of frosting from catching any crumbs. Let's work on the bottom\ntier the larger cake first. Cake boards and a cake\nturner make decorating and assembling much easier. (upbeat music) Till the bottom tier in the\nrefrigerator as you crumb coat the top tier. (upbeat music) Till the top tier in the refrigerator as you work on the\ndecorative layer of frosting on the bottom tier. (upbeat music) I like to use this small icing spatula to make a rubble design\non the outer edges. This is totally optional. (upbeat music) Now let's add cake dal so the\ntop tier has extra support. You'll need to cut the cake\ndal so they are the same height as the bottom tier. After that place the bottom\ntier on your cake stand or serving plate. (upbeat music) Now we'll place the decorated\ntop tier with the cake board underneath it on the bottom tier. The cake board adds extra support and allows you to cut into the top tier without removing it from the bottom tier. (upbeat music) Add some artificial or buttercream flowers and some final piping detail if desired. (upbeat music) Thank you so much for watching.

will be delivered to real wedding I would like to take to this wedding couple anj so being so kind to let me to share all those information with you I like to start from something irrelevant but there is a similarity to it when you go to movie theaters you know that it's not real this is made by actors like actresses and then directors studios and all those stuff but once the movie start you get into it and you believe in what's happening so you like or dislike what's happening you like or dislike the people in there etc so why it's happened because we don't see the things that which is happening behind the scene you must ask you to me now what's the relation between ready clicks and movies what is to do together because wedding kicks also has behind the scenes section so this video today will be about that part we have to deal especially this size wedding cake which is about 5 tier and all together I'm guessing about when we end up about 60 kilo maybe 50 50 60 kilo it's not it's not possible to calculate exactly how much going to be the weight of this really click before it's finished you don't even have the scale to put it on and find out you just have to feel it how heavy is it alright so in this cake with this size there's things to be dealed the weight as I said has to be considered and the construction what we're putting inside we need clickers to be good enough to deal with that very so doesn't have any disaster assembling another issue because sometimes we do decorations on the each part of the cake separately and we join them together later on sometimes we do the decorations all in once on the cake but this case is a bit different so how we deal with that that we don't damage the cake while we're putting together and then the other issue of course transportation you may not have the same size of the of the track so you will have a possibility of limited height and then how to deal with this even the cake is so large and you can put it in different parts and join together in the event place so this is already another thing when you look at this drawing I make this drawing a couple of weeks ago when a customer approached me they come up with the certain ideas they want to have for example the they can they can express the colors what they're looking for they get expressed it the the flowers etcetera and then general concept and everything for example I always ask the customer how high you want to cake first because when we go into details that this is important to start from the decides that this far I have indication of customer they looking for something that size and I start drawing that putting that one point here one point up there and draw everything inside their customer doesn't come always the final design so we have to add our on our own ideas combining with the customer the ideas to come up with a final design so this has come out like that and also what you see over here there's different components see that the cake is completely covered with the piping here there's a cake here gold-plated there is another one with the clothing design there's another with the initials on a gold-plated the oval plaque and then did sort of finish with the matching piping surround and then there is roses in bouquets there is a butterflies there is also gazebo and sitting on the cake so all those things is not my issue today for this tutorial my tutorial today is about how to deal with all those things how to put it together how to arrange it everything so all those little bits and pieces comes together to achieving the final product final result so this will be a bit of like a step by step method so I'm going to make very small short short steps that show you one by one and also I would like to invite you to take note while you're watching this week because it is important what you do first what I do after I said it all the time and also that if you have intention to do this kind of winning cliques and give a lot of attention to inside of the cake like how to build this construction that cake doesn't drunk so all those things will be talking about love it's combination of them it shows our responsibility I always relate that being a cake decorator dealing with someone's most important event it's like very similar to like flying the commercial airline so you have a couple of hundred of you behind that you you you you have the obligation you have to make sure that you landing in the next place and the wedding cake decorators are also important for us is responsibility same as that we had a couple of hundred people in the event that make sure that they're all happy at the end of the wedding because if something happened to wedding it said it's not going to remember there's a nice wedding it will remember is it the wedding with the disaster because the cake was not there so that's why it's important this tutorial is like going into details of those kind of responsible eggs I'm going to start now constructing your deck so all the parts are ready so there's nothing to actually produce here this is important in this tutorial how to combine together how to arrange things together what's the thinking behind so this is what we're going to talk about today starting from the very base of the cake I actually use a table top because it's very nice and strong and then I have also a bit of grip underneath so it would be very secure to go for this one if you don't have the table top of course you have to use at least 20 millimetres wood and cover with the desired material on top and also I have a plastic sheet which is telephone sheet on top I'm not very well this telephone sheet before everything is finished so it's protecting anything drop on it or anything like a stain or something so the first thing is I like to place this cake on top of here but if I place the wait on top of this cake in the room temperature after all it will be correct on the side here and then it's a lot of pressure imagine this is only the second tier and there will be more tiers on target so I want to build this cake step by step by using these PVC pipes these PVC pipes stay in the middle and then take the weight so how I do that there's a hole in the middle of this board exact and I place this click also in the middle of this port so but a couple of millimeters difference it will get this Center roast which is this long threaded long treaded road it may be just not in the middle if it goes if it goes to limit on the side on the side here there will be more pressure here and then not enough here so it takes to stay almost in the middle so to measure that I like to first of all if before them that I like to explain you how high is this so when I place this one here is see that is lower than the kick because there is a void underneath the cake extra board underneath so what I do I place my my wooden stick in the middle and then make sure that don't go any more and I put a little mark over here with a pencil and then take it out and exactly clean up and after that I measure that exactly the height I have to be exact or a little bit lower but not more than that because if it's too much will be the top click will be turned around so I did that for this and for that I'm exactly the height of the the cake excepting the board underneath so let's place this one in the middle how we do that first of all we have to find out what's the central that is the that's here 42 and 21 it's around there put this one here first okay yes and then over here shop 21 that's about there so that's supposed to be the center of the cake I'm going to push this one down all the way down I have to meet with the center hole of this part I am straight here turn around a bit make sure spread on the other direction trip let's see yes go through that means this is the point of the deck places in the middle that's in the middle not in the middle push a little bit like this right so that means the cake is this PVC pipe has to be placed inside the cake exactly this location so that's a bit of not mess we will create so just take your blade and then go millimeter outside and cut this already a little bit room temperature droid phone done if I push this one now like that nothing will happen it will go inside but what will happen is they create some crease also maybe not important because the calicut coming on top but I just want to make sure that everything is nice and neat so I will push this one in and don't worry about the cake stays inside okay right here and I can take this off now all right that's a little bit more than a kick but it doesn't matter because we can always if there's a little gap around here we will always cover with something else anyway okay now second thing I like to do a what exactly same thing in here I have a board underneath also at home so I want to make sure that you remind the middle or not don't touch too much on the gold 137 and 537 is actually 37 is 15 18 and 1/2 3 to 7 is 18 and off so I'm yeah they turn off it's not there I have to go slightly this way okay let's ease in the middle or not yes it is okay now Piscean here is it in the middle check it up there this actually that's it's pretty good all right let's give it a couple of Hamor all right this cake is now ready to carry the weight this is also you to carry the weight so what we do now place this cake over here if I go with my hands on right now and then place it over here what's been happening when I'm removing my hands underneath all those icings will be crack the gold will drop off everything will happen so that's why I will call some help and then my closest help is my wife and I will ask her to help me now we're going to place this cake on top of here and then I have four pallet knives it's a biggest one sighs truce so I need to have this fall part all of them underneath and balance it together and then place it the cake over here so may I introduce you my wife Joe she has a big muscle she exercised every day thanks for helping me honey so please take the 2 2 palette knife and then with me putting inside here it has to be Criss crossing so we have to balance our our positioning everywhere think about 3 o'clock 6 o'clock 9 o'clock 12 o'clock no you are - yeah you have to be more today exactly ok now can you do that so we're going to place it in the middle but don't remove the pallet knife because I'm going to go later on I'm going to check the centralizing everything slowly lift it up are we okay thank you I mean if we break this one no it's probably I don't know it's gonna happen okay limit in immediately go to your place twist you okay leave the pallet knife there please thank you a little bit clerk spot doesn't really matter you can fix it every time thanks a lot okay so before I I remove that pallet knives what I like to do I want to I want to just check just check that is it in the middle can I go inside all the way down and then meeting the hole underneath so that's why what I like to do this is not long enough so I'm going to go with this one take this out take this one out and try to push everything in and then we're going to meet the default okay the pallet knife is holding what I like to do I have a problem in this now here so I'm going to try with this one that's the fish a knife sharpener it's got very sharp end ok one of them is still holding yes go true ok so let's check it not there yet yes we are down so now I can remove my palette knives slight damage on the corner but this doesn't really big matter because I'm going to fix this anyway later on with some decorations done so next thing now is to place you of course the next year on top of it next thing I like to do I'm going to place my washer and the nut underneath you know that there's so much this much of of this rod coming right underneath I'm going to place this one in and then don't worry about the top yet so once you complete everything with this then we're going to tighten up the top one and we will have everything secured properly so you would maybe ask me why I didn't do this one earlier because to lift this cake on this height bring back to here it will be quite challenging very risky job that's why I want to put two of them together and push this one in together and also why can't we do the third one and then after that do this one because to find that one two three holds at the same time maybe is a bit too difficult that's why is the two is just optimum then the third one I'm going to put and place it in like this here so let's get this one in here now quite the big weight involve here that is good yeah okay now going to put it back and place the object on turntable let me check I put some stuff on the legs underneath so to make sure that is there's a finger space let's go so these two kick now on top of each other when I look at it there's a little bit of cracks around here because of the palette knives and everything so this is always fixable with a limit of royal icing a bit of like soft and up the fondant can always pitch it up there also another thing is if you see that the corner that which is really drastic is not really possible to good good job preparing because we have this all those flowers and butterflies and everything coming on so you select that particular corner to cover it with another decorations right there will be no problem at the end I think I can handle myself the number three so this is the quilted level this cakes are actually produced in the cupboard with the fondant at least the day before because you need to have a really firm the right fondant with the kind of firm take also inside so I left it into the room temperature but at least 19 degrees so we have a condition here can go for 19 degrees and if you not have that kind of condition you have to put in the fridge and you have to deal with the moisture a bit on the surface so I have to grab it like this I have extra board on it of course and there is a hole in the middle of the book so I have to remove that they're not see that one go down go like this it doesn't matter because it then we will squeeze it anyway so clean hands lift up and then fight this one there is a lake in here okay slowly okay need a bit of cleaning I'll grab my dry brush and brush everything off and they're ready for the next level now we came to the fourth level till now with all those trail layers we will not I did not really worry about what is the front what's not the front etc but is you see that in the fourth layer there's a frontal look there is a decorations in the front then this must be the front of the clicking so I'll take the opportunity that the before I place the fort one I will go Iran and then select the right place various the front of the kick so when I turning like that I will have no problem at all on this level because can be any site in the front when we look at the first level which is the piping one it's also there is no problem at all except some top parts but top parts are not really important because we're going to put some ribbons and cords and everything around to spawn a no problem at all now when I look at the golden part because gold is such a very thin coating any small little crack will be appeared so when I turning around unfortunately then it's only one spot here there's a livid crack we can fix it we can just record with the gold and if you just put a bit of like a fund on it or something but I'm not going to bother to do that so I will choose that little crack at the place that which I'm going to put roses and butterflies later on so this is the 45 degrees here that is the plot this is the spot that roses maybe it's more fluently like this here and that is the front of the cake so I'm going to put one little indication here it shows that it is the front of the cake and I will not miss it all right so that means I have to get now this cake on top and I know which direction to put on all right now let's get this one done but I can't get my fingers underneath it's impossible so I like to make it upside down and place the stick on the on the on this starting blocks like this that I can put my fingers underneath now take a deep breath and turn this one in once like this just dropping in there but don't rub too much otherwise you will have your own disaster okay now does this happen like that I think I forgot to emphasize every cake underneath there is a three millimeter wood covered laminated with white cut board underneath and on the top so this there is no cake touching to the wood and then there's also pre hole in the middle so I can go through this this displace so I will place that little legs on right here like that it's a styrofoam you can put something else if you like no problem just like this and places on from Foxley in the middle and then hopefully nothing drops stop breathing like this that's good alright so now I can I can grab it so this is my this is my front I'm going to turn this one like that okay clean hands I'm grabbing the cake from these fingers underneath but these two fingers on the side no damage perfect now next thing is this one this is not long enough this is a little bit shorter so what will cause that problem that cake will be sinking because the the topic we're not going to stop on the surface it's going to stop more down so I have to cut hold on I think this is okay because there is a cut board underneath the cake they should be okay let me measure that again how much just go inside here take it out it's perfect 100% I forgot that there's a wood underneath that's why I was confused a bit so places in the middle I just push what sit perfect alright now we have to make bit of housecleaning which is it that's good that's the front look like alright now I have to get the fifth level of the cake here on the table and I explain you more things about it one more layer left which is the fifth layer at this stage we have to start thinking about the transportation because lake is getting higher on here my transportation facility is only 70 centimeter and when I measure this from from the level lower level from the table to the top of the this long tread it's about 65 C budget just much but if I put one more layer of course it's going to be not possible but at the same time I have the kind of like obligation to show you exactly how the cake is decorated completely so I want to do that that's why I keep my base separate so if I put this one over here on top like this alright I can actually take my nut which is this one and then completely squeeze it down tight really tighten up and then I will have so that this loose this stretch is Drew's now it will be completely tighten up here and the cake will be all in one piece so it will be compact together the only problem is if I use my nut and then tighten up nicely the wood which is underneath this cup or shades it's only three millimeters it's not going to be strong enough so that's why I put a metal washer inside between the cardboard and the would I hide inside that if you want to have more information about this how to build all those all those construction everything I have a video called internal support for high kicks so you can just look at it have some more information about that now what's happening I like to keep this everything together put together and decorate together but I want to set right again so for the transportation so that's why I'm not going to glue anything together so let's get this one done what I'm saying if there's a metal bar here which is I don't want to keep the cake touching even that is saving up but I don't want to do that one so what I like to do first I'm going to put my the metal washer is on top officially and pull it up and then get this one tight enough first I'm not going to use any more PVC pipe around this this cake because there's no more much more weight coming on just the topper they're not going to be heavy enough to create problems so I just tighten up nicely and I'm not really squeezing too much this is already good enough right so a doorman is said all the PVC pipes inside the cake is touching each other there's no more pressure on the case now all right like we have to clean again okay no again I have the last layer this one is the fruitcake I can keep it a quite firm here it doesn't really doesn't matter the temperature and also a customer wants to keep it for for anniversary or something I can we lift up over here now to put it in but if I do that I will get the cake inside kit that's why I like to protect it what I do is it take a strobe four slash this is just the right size I think it's a bit little bit bigger than the intent you're just right I cut this off look like this it's already good alright so I'm going to put this cake on top and then why not and also what's happening underneath the cake there's a book there's a board with a big hole I mean it's one yet that hole is good enough to take this pass through this nut so I'm going to do this one now I will put it back again I'm going to clean my hands on now at this stage we have look at it if there's a frontal kick here like this this the the logo edges yet we selected if there is any imperfection on the other side planning that putting roses and decorations on to cover in the same time when we have the chance when put this one on like that all the way in here and then we can take it out again so this is already just nice and also look at it if the cakes some of the kids like sons a little bit higher and then the other one is to go some balances so if you have the cake and this side higher other one this side higher so you have to turn around to get this right but as far as I can see over here there's no problem I will leave it as it is the next thing is we're going to put two guys over on top of the cake but I'm not going to glue it as I said I will put all the depressions on it but I will make sure that I can separate the gazebo also this cake for transportation all the heavy liftings are now finished what's left with the lifting is tomorrow we have to lift everything together so obviously and honestly I can't do that myself even with my wife together so I called some friends and we will be for all together to lift up bring it to the transportation vehicle and go straight to the venue it's about 25 kilometers luckily so it will be no problem at all okay now what's left here I like to place my gazebo on the top of the cake and then also work on some coverage so I like to cover all those gaps between two cakes every time they me cake comes on top the other one they will be get around so we use different methods to close that like maybe some time ribbon some kind cord some time piping so I will do different things on each level I will make a white ribbon here and I hope to also white ribbon here and then I will do a gold coat here and also gold coat here and gold ribbon also here so you will see that soon I like to show you something quite interesting as you see on the plane I will put butterflies there on the cake like a painting around the cake so there is two butterflies comes on top of the gazebo here I did some work but sulfa little problem so there's a hard surface here on the gazebo and then what applies also hard so to join them together in just a little one dot it's not going to be really secure way to join it together just dot the dot so what I do I put two just let me show you here you see here a little dots so this one I made it in about two three seconds just roll a little ball of pasta action and stick over here with the egg white and some bit of a royal icing around and let it dry completely so that before the pasta guys get too dry I actually take one of the butterfly just push it in this corner I get the exact indentation from the lower part of the butterfly so later on debility butterfly or here it will be no problem at all so by doing this about two seconds work it will solve a lot of problems and while we're joining the butterflies on these edges okay now I like to put it on so that is the front of the castle book and this is the front side of this cake so I'm just going to lift up here slowly carefully so it completely dry so the problem as long as you're not knocks on that will be nothing happened so I just place it here make sure that is in the middle I think it's pretty straight like this is our want okay all right I will leave it like this don't later on we will separate it okay now let me just show you how do I close that I have different kind of ribbons yet one of them is the white ribbon it's a cloth ribbon always cut off the first quick first circle because can be dusty or dirty so just go around okay I'm going to use well I seem to do that so just at the back of the cake got off relaxing here and a dot another dot on top and then glue it together this is only for temporary because I'm going to roll again I just use that just a little small dot so that's all the cover that gap second one also with white ribbon that's pretty apparent I just use a little bit more realizing it that's a problem yeah it has to be go underneath so what I'd like to do I'm not going to use this one I'm going to just go coach around here so by using gold code your code is something that which is could be quite annoying because at the end is just like this all the vehicles coming out so I have to secure that with a bit of sticky tape just go on with it and I cut from the middle all right don't go around when the court meet at the at the end just put your sticky tape in the middle of this cutting eventually cut the spot so put it on top of each other and then cut exactly from the spot so that all those risk of does it come out bit of revising here halfway through and the other side sit so I'm going to dot here I can cover it all so good so that's all you're good enough there's a lot of decorations on this cake so you don't have to be ready to kind see about that next one again the gold cord that's also part out now when it comes to that point that where the gold surface I'm going to use first to go driven like that yet to make it much more cleaner better stop from that hip that's the back you know that's the back all right that's it there's I think nothing else in it as a ribbons or a cord or whatever that's already clean enough I'm sure you realize that I put a little bit of red icing around here to fix that little cracks that cake pressurized that cake a little bit too much I think I cut this PVC with tulip and it could be little bit higher it will be better all right so far so good I think what we should do now we have to start with the putting gold Rogers here so I'm using a morality because white the white it's not going to be seen much all right just what I do is like I'm not going to go too much on the edge here it's one two three four five so I see the fibers Israel icing is not drying I don't increase the number maybe six or seven that's good that's good that's good for and five okay next one I make six one two three four five and six so this is the best how dry is the room how cold is the room and then how much is the string of your realizing that how could we get dry so that you have to measure if you want to make it fluently without the need disturbance without interruption you have to count that how many you need to do and it's six I continue with the six item six is good so I'm sure you don't want to watch me the whole cake I finish with drudges so I'm going to stop shooting up and get back to you when this whole thing is finished my next step is placing the roses on the clicker as you may remember that on the plane we have three locations one is the as you see over here coming down and the second one is is here coming down and then the third one or so here and it starts from the large one a little bit smaller and then the smallest one here so normally what people do that they this kind of cascade of roses it's another way of doing it like you wire everything and together into one one sort of bouquet and then you place the whole lot in once on the cake it's a tradition that because people take it out and keep it and maybe just frame them whatever but I'm not going to do that because of two reasons first of all too much time consuming and then people doesn't want to pay that time so another thing is like I don't like to use too much wires on the cake so that's why but at the same time I like to create the kind of variety of sizes of the roses it looks much better so that's why I asked my wife to do all the roses for me Joe and then she make two wired roses on two large - lush bouquet and then one more wire rose on the top it should be morally enough everything else is the normal phone down roses that you have another video to watch and learn how to do those roses so ivory roses with a green but it's very light green so it's actually we did the ivory and we add just the dot of green and just to change the tone a little bit I don't want to appear any green on the case this is not going to make any sense so instead of doing this wiring book case we're going to glue all the roses just with chocolate on the surface of the cake and create that kind of feeling that is actually is a kind of like a spread that you've been done all together so I'm going to use white chocolate and I'm going to use also a bit of color that's a liquid air so when I spray it on the spot that but I'm using chocolate it immediately said and I continue with my work I will advise you something if you have roses bookcase like this arrange them all on the surface like that so as you see that I know exactly how many I'm going to use and then I don't have to look at again what I have to use so it's already I will organize that make this bouquet on the surface and transform this one by one on the cake it's both a lot of easier method that to the deep veins that are going on the cake and start doing it one by one so this is my second okay and this is my third bouquet so as you've seen that I have done one because I always study first before I show you something if I have any problem I will solve it before further I will show you so there is no problem at the moment I'm going to do the second one in front of you let's get these roses here first this side - double cam gonna need and that's the spot that I like to do that just here Ted array so at the end of today I want to create that s kind of looking with a flow of the roses so I start from this corner I want to have one wild rose here right here the roses are wired and then also we put a strip white plastic tape around the fit so it doesn't go anything in the cake I'm going to put next one here that looks good I'm actually just dipping that roses into the chocolate here every time I want to put one rose I place it first I see that positioning this is a bit too large I'm going to put this one here and also that roses got the platform underneath you have to select the right right place like this I did generously but I'm not dipping too many times only once clean dip and then just make sure that there's not dripping and then just go back here and then push a little bit on the surface a little bit and after that use that one here that's right now you have to go one by one so next thing is I like to put 1 big drawers here there it is white chocolate it's a very good glue especially using ivory roses on the white surface I mean you won't use that dark chocolate in this area isn't it so this doesn't make sense so one by one you place the rose and see if the size is correct or not and then continue I think this one can go here no too big this one now too big grab something smaller here like this all right very good I want to make this flow here right right here so I'm going to continue with some other roses there's one beautiful I'm going to continue a bit more here definitely can come this one did I want you to realize that I'm putting roses in the way that it actually all the stems of the Roses is meeting somewhere behind the kick so it's just like this is here and then not everyone the same direction it goes here and there and there in the index so this one goes display this one goes this way it's like if you put the stick in the middle of the road it goes like an explosion around all right it's coming up nicely now I like to see one more time what else I can do here I just want to put one more of this I mark this this makes about don't forget we will have still leaves coming it you can cover all those gaps we do these after that that's good alright one more here this one I'm applying quite a bit of fortune on the road so that's why better to do these roses a few days before nice and nice and sort of firm that you can apply force you can push it that flows okay one more here alright now I like to put this ones so this is single single single petal just roll around and then makes it like a the sharp edge here it makes you lots of beauty at the end of the bouquet good all right a little bit more here just a couple of small ones then pretty much you're going to end up this okay or it looks beautiful and I like to put now a couple of leaves leaves again that you just look at em TRS without is too many not everywhere Jeff to reseat Gray's nice Mitchie your mom beautiful so let's start with another one yet so because this cake going to stay till here this one removed so I'm going to make a bouquet here but I'm not going to touch to the match to the gazebo because because it will also be separated so I'm just going to start from here and do one small bouquet over here pretty much they're all the bouquets and flower is the same so we place the one large flower in the middle or two large flow in the middle and after that you fill up the other interiors by looking at the directions of the flower going into like your according to the meeting at the bottom somewhere that is like an explosion look like so I think I can put one more rows over here just to finish off that edge that's it as I said I shouldn't connect anything with the gazebo that's a ways to be free I think is still ok no problem so now is the time for long waited butterflies to place them I'm going to stick now to butterfly on the top on the gazebo on top of these platforms that I prepared before and then after that I'm going to put two here two here and two here so of course my height is not not taller so I just go over there look great hope for the other one fall off on the on the cake so it will be very funny anyway so what I do is because the chocolate has give me instantaneous contact and glue and standing in the one spot I'm going to go with a dot of chocolate and after that I'm going to just as well the wrong with the royal icing that you don't see it roll out men dress and drives everything much more stronger just $1 choke with you alright I'd like to take this one just grab from the strong corners that doesn't really you don't touch any of this lace designs all that like this not holding I have to pull a bit more chocolate stay stay good just threw it off yes coolness States so I let I don't touch anymore I just like to drop this a little bit I'm going to put the next one here now when I'm gluing this I was a bit of struggle because I didn't do the chocolate before so the best way is not it's better idea just to put a little chocolate over here first and just put it very very thin just smear it there all right and let it this one set and then next time take it in the hand whatever you want the glue and also put the little chocolate here wherever you want to glue just about here okay also let it set just a few minutes okay once this one said this one said the third amount of chopped in between these two sets operate it will good in no time that's good it's telling now I will give about few seconds that don't disturb anymore then after that I'm going to start welding around the edges with the rising when it's dry will be completely dry and completely secure no problem I can start from this one actually with their RC where is my realizing here okay the other butterflies would be no problem because I always stick to join the indicate no problem at all I'm going to leave this one like this I'm not going to take anything away so make sure that it is now nice and solid good next couple is here next couple have to go in between the roses so I have to just find the right spot I think there is a gap over here in between three rows I can pass this one on I want to have the two butterflies looking each other so this one look downwards this is a fruitcake it just goes through the all the fruits would be quite solid that's good I don't want to push too much next one has to go in between here so flow that that that kind of thing butterflies will be in direction so I just do it like this beautiful that really works on so look at the difference now the cake is now coming more elebrate next to if I look at the cake from this direction this is the front of the cake so I have to imagine they worried about the flies coming up I want have one right here and then one right underneath here so this is the right location here so that's why I want to put this one actually downwards like this like this have to find a way to do it here yes don't push from the wings because otherwise we'll be ready so you have to push it I think is a too long because it's like touching somewhere inside take it out again and cut off a little bit don't snap it because snap will be vibrate - butterfly will break just to break it just slightly push here and break it that is compressed paper actually this kick ball stays let's go that's right and the next one is here any temptation here like this that's better all the way can touch to the roses wonderful you want marker okay I have to look at now the cake altogether stained like this like that and then after that like that so that is scan of here's one here's one just right here that I have to go inside it let me see that one here do I want to get here yes okay next one touch the front has to be here there tear is broken I can put it back on top just a little one okay so far that butterflies in place we have one more surprise attachment left I make some spikes but I like to have this like a addition to the flow a little bit so I did similar to the butterfly antennas but much more larger so I want to add this one for a last addition to the to the flock and then just inside enhance it for a last step okay these are the spikes that I'm talking about the I done this couple of hours ago out of pastillage so you cannot make it out of fondant or out of relaxing because you need to really strike that we just row the passengers from thick to thin and then also cut starts from thick to thin and then it's actually like just a squarish and you bend it while the process is too short so I thought is a good finishing touch represents the the wing wind of the sort of blend of the wings of the butterfly so it's just I think it's elegant so I did already couple of them I would at the last view in front of you just dip the end bit little bit of in chocolate and then of course you have to first position and see where you want to put so I decided to put this one around here just right here just like this finish last one I like to put here in the front that here see okay the only challenge left is the delivery tomorrow obviously I can't lift up myself even with my strong wife so we will be four to lift I hope this whole behind-the-scene experience was educational for you and will add some comfort to your next big project that's all for today guys god bless you all stay cool and happy till to the next video bye for now you", "u7o2LmHcETQ": "welcome back to the Chelsea's kitchen today is a very special day because I am making my wedding cake I have all my ingredients ready to go and I am making my cake a few days in advance because a lot of my friends and family are coming in from out of town and I want to have everything taken care of before they get here so it's totally fine to make cakes in advance you make your layers and your frosting advance or you can assembly you're taking advance as well it all just comes down to whatever your needs are for the big day so I'm gonna go ahead and get started by making seven batches of funfetti cake to make my life a little bit easier I'm using a commercial KitchenAid here I actually bought it solely for my wedding I've been meaning to get one for awhile because I make so much cake and it was about time that I stepped up and got one so they're definitely spendy but they're fantastic for making really big batches of batter or frosting and it worked so well for my wedding cake so this is an 8 quart Bowl and I found I was able to make about 3 batches of my funfetti cake in it so this worked out really well made my life a lot easier and once the batter was ready to go I carefully poured it into my cake pans so for my larger cake pans the 12 inch and the 10 inch I made sure to use flour nails by flipping them upside down and putting them in the middle of the fan some of my batter missed there don't worry about that um but it helps the layers bake more quickly and evenly so I really recommend doing that with your larger layers it's really hard to know how many batches a batter you need and I actually have a really detailed blog post that goes through the math behind it so if you're curious or you want to know how I do that you can click on the link in the upper right corner once all my cake layers were baked it was time to begin the frosting so as you can see I went through so much butter I ended up using about 7 batches of frosting but it can really vary based on how you're decorating the cake how much frosting you're putting between each tier and things like that so you can always kind of have an estimate but it can vary based on you know if you're making a semi-naked cake or if you really love frosting like me and you put a ton on the sides so just keep that in mind when you're prepping your frosting for a cake once mine was all ready to go i leveled all of my cakes using a serrated knife which was quite a feat I also trimmed away some of the caramelization just to make it easier to frost and smooth and then it was time to begin to assemble the cake so this takes a while to do and since all of my cakes are sitting out waiting to be frosted they're exposed to the air to make sure that they stay nice and moist I added simple syrup to every layer because you really want that moisture to be there when people bite in on the day of your wedding so I added generous layers of frosting between my cake layers and of course some more rainbow sprinkles and this was my biggest bottom tier it was 12 inches across which doesn't seem that big but man it was heavy it also used up so much frosting once I was happy with my crumb coat I popped it into the fridge to chill and let that firm up while I began to work on my other three tiers so for this cake I made it with 12 inch 10 inch 8 inch and 6 inch tiers and this worked really well for the design I wanted to do with the cake because I wanted to have my flowers kind of diagonal across it so I didn't need a really big gap between my tiers to put my flowers however it's important to consider that when you're thinking about the size of tiers that you want and it's also important to think about how many people you have to feed it can be hard to figure that out and get the right size for your event but if you need a guide for that I have a really great chart that walks through all of it in different sized cakes you can make so if you want to check that out you can click the link in the upper right corner so once I crumb coated my cakes and then added that second layer of frosting you can see I'm inserting bubble tea straws into the cakes and they're all built on their own cardboard rounds so the bubble tea straws are gonna help the cake support its weight so it won't collapse in on itself I'm also putting a bubble tea straw in the center of each of my tears just to make it easier to slide on once I assemble the cake with a central dowel so there is a reason for all the madness and I promise that bubble tea straws are way stronger than you think I don't add any supports at the top tier just because it doesn't need it so once all of my tears were nice and smooth it was time to add that central dowel so I actually sharpened my central dowel to have a little bit of a point using sandpaper which is wild but you can see the tiers light on so much more easily than if it's flat I removed the bubble tea straws from the center of each tier before I slid them on having that gap already open made it so much easier to stack these I used a bit of extra frosting to cover up the cardboard rounds and any gaps between the tiers to give the cake a really nice and cohesive look I used a small offset spatula to smooth out that frosting and then it was time to work on our flowers so I used a bit of floral tape to wrap the stems of each flower that I wanted to add to my cake and this just helps prevent any of the fluids from the stems from leaching into your cake which can give it a bitter taste I'm also using clear bubble tea straws to add my flowers to my cake and they're really wonderful because they create kind of a pocket that the stems perfectly fit into it keeps them in place it protects the stems from coming in contact with your cake and helps you create the perfect look that you're after so as you can see I went with a lot of whites and greens for my cake because my wedding was in Central Park and that was look that I was after so I was so happy with how my cake turned out I added these flowers the morning of my wedding and successfully dropped it off at the venue before I got ready I have a really long blog post talking about all the details about my wedding cake if you want to know more so you can click the link in the upper right corner if you have any other questions that I didn't cover thanks so much for watching I hope you guys enjoyed this video and hopefully I'll see you guys again soon", "WdC2K8O3FjU": "now we are going to assemble a wedding cake and this is one of the most difficult parts of building of putting together a wedding cake and it's also one of the most important if you do everything 100% right but you don't get this part right nothing else matters nothing is worse than being worried that a cake is going to fall at a wedding after you've delivered it so I'm going to show you the best way to put it together we have our fondant ed board here and the tools I need this is a dowel I bought at a local hardware store I've got a little sanding block and this is actually a miter box for doll houses and a little miniature saw these are both also exacto products the miter box will butt up on the edge of a table here so that we can saw our dowel rods to be the exact right size some people use straws I don't find that they're nearly strong enough especially for bigger cakes so the first I'm going to do is attach my bottom tier to the fondant board and I'm going to use a hot glue gun for that you can feel a little strange but remember it's just going to be touching foam core on the bottom and we want to make sure that that base is super secure so I'm using a nice big dollop of hot glue very careful with hot glue it's just like working with hot sugar it's not something you can just wipe off so I will tuck this in and just drop it right down since my cake is cold I can manhandle it a little bit push it around so it fits in nicely Govan will come back and cover up those scenes and a little bit but first we want to stack our cake so step one is to determine the depth of our cake tier and I'm going to use our dowel for that Dale's been washed and this is a feels a little dramatic but I'm gonna do it by plunging the dowel right into the cake and I will figure out the width of where to stick that down based on the tier that's going on top of it so I know that because this tier is only this big if I do a dowel outside of that area not only will it not support the tier above it it's going to stick out and be ugly so I'm going to eyeball measure it so that's how far apart the tier is I'm going to Center it on the cake it's going in and I'm going to go in about an inch to make sure that it's perfectly supported and not at all visible all right so plunge it all the way down press pretty hard with a pencil I'm just going to mark how tall that is try not to poke my eye out right now I can move this away for a moment while I cut my dowels now the tea that's going on top of it it's not super big so I don't need a ton of dowels I can't get away with five for this one so this goes into the center I'm lining up my little pencil notch with the marks and I'm using pressure similar to nail filing I'm not pressing too hard if you press too hard this gets really really difficult just white pressure there is our first dowel I'm going to mark it with a little X so that's our master dowel line it up with your next guy mark a little notch and I will do this four more times okay so I have five dowels all the same size there we go very nice so if my cake tier is a little bit off-kilter offs not terribly straight on top having all of these the exact same size will ensure that whatever tier I put above it will be perfectly straight so that if I'm doing a seven tier cake by having them all be ensured to be perfectly straight I'm going to avoid having a tippy tippy cake here we have a sanding block and that's just going to help me take the edge off our little mini dowels and I'm just spinning it around so I get a nice nice perfect edge alright our five dolls are ready to go I'll move this guy towards me here's our original dowel it should fit perfect and that's exactly what we want perfectly flush with the top of the cake now to figure out where to put the other dowels I'm going to take this dowel in measure the depth at which it's at and before I plunge them all into the cake it'll leave little marks for where I think they should go and that way before I put them in if it looks like I've got a kind of crazy shape or a large area that's not covered I can change it alright so we've got a nice little five everything is pretty equidistant just go ahead and plunge these guys in you it's a good indicator for how even the top of your cake was if any of these guys stick out all right so nice and flush I'm going to take a little bit of the buttercream and when it chills it's all going to stick together you can use royal icing as well if you'll be transporting it in say San Francisco where it's going to be really hilly you want to make sure it's stuck there we go so I'm just centering this it's good to walk away three or four feet look at your cake make sure it's totally centered but here we have it I'll just chill this and then we will come back and decorate it and that is how you assemble a wedding cake", "sXCcvPorJ9Q": "Welcome to SORTEDfood and\nwelcome to FridgeCam. Sometimes, we like to copy\nall of the formats that are on television at once. This is Step Up to the Plate. One of two trained chefs\nand one of three normal guys will be picked at\nrandom to work together to create an attention-grabbing,\nhead-turning dish. There will be\nprerequisites, time limits-- One minute remaining. --mystery ingredients, all\ntied together by a shameless, internetty challenge. But who will it be today? [MUSIC PLAYING] James, go on, mate. You're nearest it. Pick a chef. Both chefs. Both ch-- Does that mean we\nhave a day off? There's always a twist. Both normals. Both normals. So it's all in. Teamwork, isn't it? This is so cryptic. Go straight to the plate. [LAUGHTER] Straight to the plate. Right, ready? 2, 1. We're up. We're good. James. I am literally-- And I've got a hand. Open! Quick! #WeddingOfTheYear. Today, you will all be\ntaking part in the Step Up to the Plate challenge. Your task is bigger than\never before as you will be creating a wedding cake-- No. No! --for the royal couple, Prince\nHarry and Meghan Markle. You must research\ntheir favorite flavors and incorporate\nthese into the cake. It has to look good\nand taste even better. You have a whopping\nfour and a half hours-- Oh. --from once you've\nselected your ingredients. That is actually not very long. Four and a half hours? That's not long\nfor a wedding cake. I mean, I made\nyour wedding cake, and it took me eight and a half. No. [MUSIC PLAYING] The overworked and\nunderpaid production team have prepared an abundance of\ninspirational produce and tools to aid our precious\nYouTube stars in this really hard challenge. Can I start off by saying,\nthis is not our strong suit, and I think we should\nidentify our weaknesses before we move forward. We can't decorate cakes. No. So I like the look of\nthe fruit because you can chop stuff up and\ndump it on the top, and it still looks quite good. So tradition says, the top tier\nshould always be a fruit cake. Given who we're\nmaking for, I think we should have a carrot top. [SNORTS] You've\ngot to have tiers. It's a wedding cake. A different cake on\na different tier. Because one could be\na no-bake cheesecake, which just needs chilling. Oh, sorry. He's the man. That makes more sense. This guy. And one can be a sponge. I like the idea of one\nlayer being a cheesecake. Banana. When Meghan made the\ntease announcement of them getting together-- Yeah. --they did-- she did it\nwith bananas, didn't she? Prince Harry and Meghan want\nwedding cake made from banana. And like a banoffee cheesecake. I mean, what about American\nand British coming together? Oh, smart. Well, a Victoria sponge is the\nsame as a pound cake, really. So that's-- We're nearly three\nminutes into this video, and there's been no cooking. So let's just say, some\ndecisions were made. [MUSIC PLAYING] Bottom layer of\ncake is a nice cross between a classic Victoria\nsponge and the American pound cake. Basically, 4 ounces of butter,\nsugar, and flour with 2 eggs. [DING] Except I've timesed it\nby three for each layer. A cake that size with\na diameter that size needs to go in an oven about\n170, 180 degrees Celsius, until it's golden cooked through\nand the skewer comes out clean. So Ebbers has\nstarted on the cake. We sent James out shopping. Hello, mate. I was phoning because\nwe need biscuits. Barry has drawn this\ndiagram, and now, I'm going to explain\nour logic behind it. So our base layer, the\nfoundation is the royal family. It's a Victoria sponge\ncake with plum jam. We're going to give\nit a biscuit crumb and put fresh fruits on the top. Our middle layer is\na banoffee cheesecake with honeycomb shards. Our top is a carrot top\nwith apple roses on the top. I went to McVitie's. Right, so far, I have\nmade a delicious plum jam with plums, a bit of\nsugar, and lemon juice. Then, cooked that\nfor about 15 minutes till it turns into a\nlovely, little mush. Lol. I've been given carrot peeling\nand chopping for a reason, and I know it. The carrot top is going to\nbe a classic carrot cake. Lots of grated carrot with\nbrown sugar, oil, egg, flour, bicarb. But we're going in with\ntwo lots of dried fruit, softened in orange juice,\nmixed spice, and to make it extra gingery,\ngrated root ginger. The boy's next task is to-- [DOORBELL RINGS] Sorry. I think that's my\nAmazon delivery. My plan from the start was\nto get Ben to do the cakes. [OOHING] So what I've done is\nto do a cheesecake, made a base with\ndigestive biscuits-- Why me? --and butter. And I have made\nthe filling, which is cheese, cream cheese,\ndouble cream, maple syrup, icing sugar, and\nchocolate chips. Yummy. And I've had Barry\ndo the banana stuff. Um, I'm having some trouble. You've forgotten how\nto peel a banana. Well, I don't eat bananas,\nso I never open bananas. And I'm suddenly going,\nthis doesn't feel right. Hey, everyone, I'm teaching\nBarry how to peel a banana. Frying bananas in butter\nstill doesn't do it for you, banana-wise. I can tell by your face. You're like this. Fried bananas in brown butter,\nand some dulce de leche, and a splash of rum. And light it. [BLEEP] Whoa! Gets me every time! Maybe take the\nsilicon spoon out. Ah! spoon! [LAUGHTER] Honestly, I forgot it\nwas going to happen. Do I have eyebrows still? You OK? Really hot. [MUSIC PLAYING] Oh, no, you put too\nmuch rum in that. Oh, and when you're\nfinished with this hob, you can turn it off. Oh, please! Two cakes in the oven. A jam done. Caramelized bananas. Cheesecake ready to construct. One hour gone. Three and a half to go. I am making our buttercream. So we're going for an\nAmerican buttercream because Meghan\nMarkle is American. We have powdered sugar. We have butter, unsalted. Vanilla extract\nhas just gone in. And we've got some milk. I'm just going to stir\nthem all together till they look butter creamy. Now, that sounds like something\nI could do with little effort before I started. It turns out, it's exhausting. And I made a stupid\ndecision not to use a mixer. And the worst thing of\nall is that I've probably got to do it again. I'm knackered! Oops. Oh, no. Are you OK? I have sugared myself! And it's been drawn to\neveryone's attention. Oh, no. Let me just get that for you. A bit lower. A bit higher. A bit higher. A bit. Perfect. [LAUGHS] This is weird. We're so close. The plan here is to not go for\nanything too fiddly and fancy because we just can't do it. So instead, rustic. We're talking about\nbiscuit crumbs, and in this case,\nhoneycomb shards. So sugar, golden\nsyrup, whisk in bicarb. Leave to cool. Mix it in-- [DING] --like that. Yeah. Mm, yeah. Oh, that's going to be so good. Yeah. Oh, yeah. I'm putting this in\nthe freezer over there. I know what you're thinking. Yes, he's cute. But the reality is, he'll\ntake you out for sushi, rooftop cocktails\nat the Wolseley, hold your hand as you\nwalk along the Thames, have a fondle in the Uber home,\nbut will he call you back? No. Shall I just-- should I blitz\na bunch of biscuits and we can look at the colors? Exactly. All right. I'm building sandcastles, James! Biggest part in, out. Clean. [MUSIC PLAYING] As is always the case\nwith carrot cake, it generally tends\nto burn a bit on top before it's cooked through. If it's this big, tinfoil top. I do feel like we\ngot to the point where it's a lot of waiting. Still doing buttercream,\nbut this time I'm using the machine. [MUSIC PLAYING] We're going to try and\nmake these beautiful apple roses to stick on top\nof our carrot cake. And to do that, you have to cut\nyour apple very, very thinly and then soak that in\nwarm, melted butter. That will then basically\nsoften the apples. Then, we can fold them or\nwrap them around each other to create roses. In order to put the weight of a\ncheesecake onto a soft sponge, we need support. So what I've accurately\ndone with the teaspoon is measured our pliths. [LAUGHTER] [DING] Good jam, Baz. Decision here was a bold one. We're not putting\ncream in the middle. I know that WI would\nprobably hate that, but there's plenty\ngoing on the outside, so it's not going in the middle. WI stands for Women's Institute,\nand Ben is the first person since 1982 to mention them. And he's the figurehead of\nthis online content channel. The for-sale sign\ngoes up on Tuesday. Get it in the fridge. Get it in the fridge. How's it looking? How's it looking? How's it looking? Carrot cake, nice. [MUSIC PLAYING] Oh, man. This is going to be mental. You know the other\nadvantage of ombre? No straight line. [MUSIC PLAYING] Ah! [MUSIC PLAYING] [THUD] [BLEEP] Ben, my heart\nliterally just went-- It's held its form! Oh, oh, oh. Mike. Don't be a tease. Fat change of that\nhappening, Mike. I can't see what you're doing,\nbut you're doing a great job. Thanks, mate. So this cheesecake\nis quite crumbly. And I'm nervous. It makes me nervous. So we're just going to\nsort of go with this. If it's particularly brittle\nnow and you try and transfer, it's going to fall apart. Do you want to slide it now? Mostly I just want to run\naway from this video now. Well, that's not\ngoing to help, is it? Should we just try it? Should we just try it? Let's just try it. Bring it down. Bring it down. OK. Foo, foo, foo, foo. Ready? Ready, ready, ready,\nready, ready, ready, ready? 3, 2-- oh. Oh, man. There was a flop at the end. This is the epitome of panic. Can you reach? OK. You got this. Yeah, I got finger-- my fingers! La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la,\nla, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. After 4 hours and\n15 grueling minutes, Barry, Ben, Mike,\nand the loverat begin stacking their\nthree-tiered, three-flavored, bespoke, royal wedding cake. And it looks suboptimal. I don't know what\nyou were expecting. You threw biscuit crumbs at\nit in five different colors. There is a strict no-animal\npolicy in the SORTED kitchen, except for Ben's high\nhorse, who occasionally makes an appearance. You guys just don't understand. With little time remaining,\nit's toss it in glitter time. One minute. One minute. [MUSIC PLAYING] And 5, 4-- [INAUDIBLE], mate. --3-- Just stop. Just stop.\n--2-- Just stop. We're done. --1. Dear Prince Harry and\nsoon-to-be Princess Meghan, here at SORTED, we\nput our heads together to offer up our\nwedding gift to you. They say love is\nblind, and it's what's inside that really counts. So please, please, remember\nthat as we present to you our three-layered,\ntriple-flavored, bespoke wedding cake. Both monarchy and\nrelationships are built on strong foundations. Our bottom layer is a\nregal Victoria sponge, sandwiching a royal\npurple plum jam. At the heart of your\ncake, we play homage to your shared\nlove of the banana with our banoffee cheesecake. And the crowning\ntier, a carrot top. Moist carrot, walnut, and ginger\ncake because, let's face it, we're four basic bitches,\nand a ginger joke is the best we could do here. And by the way, Hazza\ntop job on the Vegas stag do. Big Willy knows how to go\nmassive on the Mezcal We wish you both all the\nhappiness in the world. Love, SORTED. It's a good job we made two. I think, you know what? I think the ombre effect\nhas kind of worked. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, hey! Nearly. Oh, look at that. OK. So let's go bottom first. The buttercream is good. The jam is great. Banoffee cheesecake. That is so decent. That is so decent. All right. Yes, that piece. Yes. Oh, I thought you were trying\nto push it off the table. Thanks.\nThat piece. [CHUCKLES] Cheesecake as a wedding\ntier makes no sense at all-- No. --until you taste it. I think that's the\ngood bit about it is that I still forgot that\nit was a cheesecake until I ate it. And then carrot top\nwith fresh ginger. Each of them. Fantastic. I couldn't be prouder\nof the flavors that we've put together. I think it works bang on. I agree. I think the textures\nwork beautifully, too. I've got such mixed feelings. Like, I'm kind of proud. Yeah. Because it tastes unbelievable. I kind of hate it a little bit. Yeah, I know what you mean. And I kind of like\nit a little bit. I don't know anyone who's ever\nmade a wedding cake like that in four and a half hours. No. Like, wedding cakes take days. It makes you realize how\ntalented these people are who just focus on wedding cakes. Well, I think it's\nclear what we think. But why don't you comment\ndown below your thoughts? Hey, here's a good idea. Oh, no.\nWhy don't you suggest-- Oh, no. --who we should step\nup to the plate-- Oh, OK. --in [INAUDIBLE] next. No more cake. Let us know. No. To be fair, that is the\nbest-looking sandcastle I've ever seen. [LAUGHTER] Now, the end result might\nnot have been exactly what we were looking for. But for the amount of effort\nthat went into it and time, it's got to be worth\na like, isn't it? Absolutely worth a like. Nothing more to say. Have a lovely week. Harry, Meghan, we\nknow you watch. Have a lovely wedding day. Goodbye. Congratulations!", "_YPu5Lc0Uc0": "- Today I'll be showing you\nhow to make this delicious and might I say pretty\nLemon Elderflower Cake. Can you guess why I was\ninspired to make it? Okay, let's get started. Starting off this delicious\nlemon elderflower cake by sifting all the dry\ningredients together in the bowl of my standing mixer. 2 1/4 cups of cake flour, one heaping teaspoon of baking powder, a teaspoon of kosher salt. Don't forget that quarter and\na cup of granulated sugar. If you wanna reduce the sugar in this feel free you could probably take it down to 2/3 of a cup and be fine. In fact, you could also decrease the sugar and increase the elderflower syrup as that is quite sweet. Sift those together. You can really see how\nfine that cake flour is, as it's flying all over the place. I always get questions about\nsubstitutions from people and let me tell you you\ncould use all purpose flour it will be okay, everyone we'll live and if you can't find sour cream, use yogurt instead that's totally fine. Just use whole milk\nplain and you'll be fine. Add it on to our standing\nmixer and satisfied. Away you. Okay, now for the wet ingredients. People always ask me what do\nyou do with the egg yolks? The answer is anything you want, but today we're gonna make\na lemon curd with them and that curd is gonna be\nin the filling of the cake. Delicious, fresh, perfect for summer. Make sure those eggs\nare at room temperature. Don't use cold eggs people. Egg whites in one bowl,\negg yolks in the other. If you get a little piece\nof yolk in the bowl, it's totally fine, don't worry about it. Clean hands is always\nthe best way to separate egg yolks and egg whites\nin case you're wondering. And tell how fresh eggs are because the whites are more gelatinous and they hold together better. These eggs are fresh. Later on we'll be\nstraining these egg yolks just to get rid of the little membrane and using them for our curd . It's gonna be delicious. If you're wondering you\ncan totally make the cake a day ahead make the\nlemon curd a day ahead and have it set perfectly in the fridge and then decorate the cake all at once. Even the Swiss meringue buttercream can be made ahead of time. Set those yolks aside now\nwe're gonna add in our milk. One quarter cup of room\ntemperature sour cream. Adding in two tablespoons\nof my elderflower syrup, heaping tablespoons. It smells delicious. If you can't get your hot little hands on some elderflower syrup, mine came from Amazon. I don't know which supermarkets carry it. You could go ahead and\nuse some Saint Germain also made out of elderflowers and then create a simple syrup with that. I would cook it down a\nbit for some less alcohol unless you play that way. And then just add that either\ninto the cake ingredients or spoon it over the top of\nthe already baked lemon cake. And just skip this. I'm adding in the zest of\none lemon into my mixture. Juicing my lemons, I want\nabout a third of a cup. Never use pre-made lemon juice that is not acceptable\nand it'll ruin your cake unlike anything else. Let's measure this out and add\nit into our wet ingredients. Perfect, now give it a whisk. Just gonna add a little dash in. Set that aside and now it's time to cream our butter along\nwith the dry ingredients. When you add your butter\ninto the dry ingredients, also known as the reverse creaming method, you're coding all of that\nflour in delicious fat, which is inhibiting the\ngluten and creating a more kicky, fluffy delicious cake, less bready. 3/4 of a cup of room temperature unsalted butter into that mix. I'm gonna add a few dobs mix on low. (roaring sound)\nContinue adding. Okay, let's take a look, I wanna show you the crump. So ending up with a beautiful\ncrummy mixture like this. It's gonna be amazing once\nwe add our wet mixture in. I'm going to prepare\nmy three six inch pans by buttering and flowering them Just get some cold butter,\nrub it along the edges, add some flour, kick around. Transfer the flour to the next pan. That looks perfect. And continue kicking it around. I'm adding on my cake strips now if you wanna see how to make\nyour own or how these work go ahead and click up over here somewhere for my \"How to get flat\ncake layers\" video. Alright, now that my pans are prepared, it's time to finish off that cake butter. I'm adding half of the liquid\nand then beating it together for maybe a minute and a half and then adding the rest in\nand beating for another minute. On low.\n(roaring sound) Now there's the cake butter. Let's get the ball down. Mix for a minute. (roaring) Transfer the batter and after I do that I'll show you how to measure and make sure you have pretty exact layers if you don't have a kitchen scale at home. If you don't have a kitchen scale, go ahead and use a skewer and kind of like checking\nthe oil in a car. Just check the depth. Those are pretty much about right into the oven at 350\nfor probably 35 minutes, we'll see exactly in the titles below. While the cake's in the oven we're gonna make our lemon\ncurd using those six egg yolks. So the first step is to\nstrain them into a medium pot. And cutting up a stick of\nbutter or one half of a cup that's chilled it has to\ncold, into small cubes. We'll be whisking this\ninto the curd at the end after it's reached that\nmagical 170 degrees Fahrenheit. Now I need a third of a cup of lemon juice fresh again, so two medium\nsize lemons should be enough but we'll see. Measure about a third of a cup. I'm using a French whisk for this and if you didn't know a\nFrench whisk is just narrower so it can really hit\nthe corners of the pot and you won't get any bad parts. Very useful. And now start adding a\ncup of granulated sugar. See it turning a beautiful\nlight lemon color. I really love this, it's so cheerful. So today we're making a lemon curd but you don't have to restrict\nyourself to that one fruit. You can make an orange\ncurd, a strawberry curd, raspberry blackberry, blueberry, basically anything you want. Using this same method. Third have a cup of the juice\nalong with the six egg yolks and one cup of sugar, really simple. All right, we're gonna\nadd our lemon juice in and then give it a whisk. Drizzling that lemon juice. We're just gonna curd over low heat until it reaches 170 degrees. Make sure you keep whisking\nbecause if you don't, you'll have a bad yoke part on the bottom and nobody wants that. Once it hits 170 you'll\nnotice a change in consistency and you can dip a wooden spoon in, see if it holds the curd run your finger down it and you should see that\nfinger mark left intact. Now it's time to add in your\nhalf cup of cube chilled butter into that beautiful yellow curd, whisk it in and we can\ntransfer it to cool. My lemon curd is all done. Look at this amazingness, I\nlove that color it's beautiful. It does however need to sit\nin the fridge for a while. So let's pour that into a\nbowl and leave it to chill. That is like a little bit of\nsunshine, it is delicious. We're gonna cover this up and refrigerate. So it's time to show you how you can tell when your cake is done. If you look closely, you can see it's pulling away from the pan and of course might stick a\nskewer and it comes out clean. And if I touch it , it\nhas a little spring to it. Now it's done. We leave it in the pan too\ncool for like four minutes and then we can invert it onto a wire rack to cool completely. They cool down for four minutes and now we're gonna\ninvert onto our wire rack. Look at these flat beautiful layers. It smells so good. I wish I could try it out but we're going to cool down while we work on our buttercream. To make our elderflowers\nSwiss meringue buttercream, we're gonnna start off by separating our egg whites and egg yolks make sure your eggs are room temperature. I have mine sitting in a warm water bath because they're straight out of the fridge and I needed to make them\nroom temperature real quick. Normally I say it\ndoesn't matter if you get a little bit of yolks in\nyour whites in the batter. This time it does matter\na lot, so be very careful and add in a pinch of salt and one and a half cups\nof granulated sugar. Give this a good whisk. If you feel this right now\nyou're gonna see, so grainy, you can feel every little piece of sugar. When we're done with this, it's been whisked over the bain-marie you'll find out that it's gonna\nbe smooth, warm and perfect. You can use a thermometer but using your fingers\nis a pretty good gesture. We're gonna do all this whisking on top of a pot of simmering water because we wanna gently heat our eggs, not heat them so that they turn into a nasty egg white omelet situation. Just make sure you're gonna\nwhisk whisk whisk over the heat. Of course the bowl should\nnot touch the water. It's the steam that's gently heating it. If you have a little helper, this is a perfect time for\nthem to come and assist. You'll notice that it becomes much wider and more kind of like a fin merengue. By the time we're done with this. We're whisking this until\nit gets to 160 by the way, right now it's at 100\ndegrees, so few minutes more. Alright, so we just hit 160. Thank you thermometer. And if I feel with my hands, it's hot. Well, it's warm, hot and\nit's super gooey and smooth. Perfect. Now we're gonna transfer\nit to our standing mixer with a whisk attachment and whip it up. Whip it up until it is a\nbeautiful silky merengue that's room temperature, just\nlike Italian butter cream you can't put the butter in until the meringue is at room temperature. I'm putting my hot egg white mixture in and I'm gonna use a spatula just to make sure I get it all out. Don't waste it. We're starting off with this the thick, delicious gooey\nand we're gonna end up with a silky beautiful meringue. I also want to point out you\nshould definitely make sure that your bowl and\nwhisk are totally clean. Any doubts just rub a lemon on them a cut lemon of course,\nand then wipe it down or even use some vinegar just to make sure there's no fat(mumble) We're gonna mix this\non medium, medium high until it's nice and whipped up. You're gonna see that\nafter just a few minutes, your merengue is gonna be\nsilky beautiful and strong. However, it's still a bit too warm you feel with your finger needs to be totally room\ntemperature not warm . If it's warm your butter will melt and it'll become kind of a bit of a mess, not the end of the world that\njust means that you'll have to keep whipping it up until the butter solidifies up and you get\nthe right consistency. Or if it's really warm, I often just pop it into the freezer and leave it there for\nfive minutes to chill out, and then give it a whip and it's fine. I mean, I say often but that\nonly happens to me every once in a while and I'm\nrunning a little bit too fast. If you're in a hurry, by the way, you can totally pack your bowl\nwith some like frozen peas or ice packs and it chills\nit down really quick. Close that back up. We're gonna whip on low until\nwe reach room temperature and just don't hurry it. Take some time. Go look some flowers. Everything's at room temperature and we're gonna add our butter in. Instead of cutting mine into cubes, I'm just going to take little slices off and kind of toss them in there. Works fine. Right here in one and\nthree quarters of a cup unsalted butter at room temperature. Mind you room temperature, not\ncool, not a little bit hard but not runny either. Just tossing handfuls of\nbutter into this ball, don't worry about it. It's a cake. So taking a look right now you can see the consistency\nstarting to change. It's not soupy, but it's not\nas kind of firm as you want. So make sure you scrape the bowl down. Close that back up and continue to whip. While we whip though I'm gonna add in a tablespoon\nof my elderflower syrup. I might add a little bit\nmore, but I wouldn't add less. (roaring) Definitely gonna add a\nsecond tablespoon in it. I'm adding a third tablespoon in it. What can I say? I always recommend giving a\nfinal whip to your butter cream before you apply it. Especially for a meringue\nbased buttercream they really lose\nconsistency kind of quickly. So right before you put in\na piping bag or smear it on, just give it a final whip. You could even just use\nyour spatula and whip it up or put a paddle attachment on it. We're going to set this aside and now it's time for\nsome roses and flowers. To decorate this cake, you could totally top it\nwith a beautiful peonies which are in season now. Some roses, whatever flowers you'd like beautiful, easy and has a\nnice rustic quality to it. However, I am gonna do\nsome buttercream flowers because I like everything\non a cake to be edible. I don't people have to pick\nthings off but that's just me. To do that, I could use\nSwiss meringue buttercream but I'm gonna be honest\nwith you and tell you that those flowers can\nget really droopy fast especially in warmer weather. Because while meringue butter cream is silky and amazing and sent from heaven, it doesn't do well in heat and it's just not a\nreally stiff buttercream. So we're gonna make a small\nbatch of American buttercream which is much sweeter, but great for those decorative elements. If you wanted a heat proof, beautiful substance to make flowers with, go ahead and whip up some of that Korean white bean paste frosting. I've tried it. It was pretty time intensive but there's other ways to do it too. And it tastes like beans but it's perfect visually while making American buttercream. So once a quarter of a\ncup of room temperature unsalted butter into our mixing bowl fitted with a paddle attachment. Cream the butter for a few\nminutes on like medium low. (roaring) My butter is all creamy. We're gonna remove the paddle attachment. Now we're gonna sift our sugar. You always sift sugar when you're piping anything delicate like a flower because any lump in here\nwill stick in the small, thin parts of your piping\ntip and ruin everything. You can't use the\nbuttercream if that happens, you'll have to use it for a crammer code or some non-decorative situation. Very important. I'm adding in about a\npound, pound and a half. This has to be a very thick buttercream for my style of rose. So it'd be sweet but we're\nnot eating a lot of it. It's just a couple of flowers. It's always a good idea to add your sugar in a couple batches so that it's more manageable in the mixer. Sift it out or mix on low. Okay, look at this situation, having added half the sugar\nand you can see this is really buttery and delicious. But so weak add some more sugar in. When I'm making butter cream for flowers, my first and foremost\nconcern is consistency. So add more or less sugar in\nto get the right consistency Tea towel back on and mix again. Okay, don't let go the tea towel that's important. Glad that was on or it\ncould have made a mess. Hold it. Alright, so I want you to see that now buttercream is a very\ndifferent consistency. It looks kinda crazy, but\nwhen you smooth it out, you can see it's totally\nsmooth, nice and dense. So this point you can\nadd in your flavoring I'm adding in a teaspoon of rose water because I think it's nice\nfor the roses to smell and tastes like roses. (roaring) Your butter cream is now ready\nto separate into batches, add coloring to and pipe. Now taking a larger batch of butter cream and we're gonna mix in some\nsoft pink food coloring. Soft pink is the only pink that I use when I'm making roses because\nit's so much more realistic. That hot supermarket bakery\npink that you can get out of normal sets, is just too much . Even if you use a little\nbit, still too much. When you're making realistic flowers, it always helps to have a gradient so you fill one half of the\npiping bag with one shade the other half with another\nshade or even a white and then when you pipe it out, it gives it more depth and realism. The rest of it will leave white for now we will be piping some\nwhite flowers as well and we're gonna color a little bit of it with some muncher powder for our leaves. I'm gonna try doing a classic rose with a 127 tip for my first flower. Smear the butter cream\nonto your work surface. Pat on your square of parchment paper and let's get started. Taking some of my thick butter cream better place it on there and\nmake a little mound out of it using my 127 tip and I'm gonna make a little\nspiral to start off with. Once your spiral is complete, you can start making little\narcs that'll overlap. There we go. That's a perfectly nice\nflower and when we finish, we'll be using our scissors\nto cut the flower off and place it onto the\ncake and we'll do a spiral a little bit looser this time. If your rose looks a little bit wonky, feel free to take off one of the petals or use a toothpick to kind of\nmanipulate it as you see fit. It doesn't have to be perfect\nright out of the piping tip. You can totally move it around here there. Okay, now it's time to decorate that cake. We're gonna start off with\na ring of butter cream on the first layer but make\nyour ring thicker than I did 'cause this was a problem. Also put a lot of butter\ncream in the center then add your lemon curd. Okay, now you can add your second layer on just stirring up the butter cream, fill it up with the curd and add your final layer on top of that. You might wanna pop this into\nthe fridge now at this point if it becomes unstable. Now cover the cake completely\nwith your beautiful and delicious elderflowers\nSwiss meringue buttercream. Use a bent scraper to smooth the side and an opposite spatula to smooth the top. So to finish the smoothing,\nyou're gonna work on your edge by using an offset spatula\nto bring in the edge on top. As you turn the cake. Do that a couple of\ntimes don't overwork it. And then pop it into the\nfridge to chill for a while. You're gonna add a little\ncresent of butter cream on top. Just for flowers can adhere to that and also be lifted up a bit because we always love\na little bit of height. Place the flowers onto your\ncrescent of buttercream add a couple in the front or\non the back if you want to. Now use a 68 tip to pipe some leaves and give a little bit of visual interest. It's kind of optional because I actually loved\nthe way this cake looked with just the white butter cream and the very very pale pink flowers. But I think the leaves\ngave you a little bit of definition and interest. Okay, I'll admit I was a\nlittle skeptical at first about the whole lemon\nelderflower situation. Clearly I just made it\nbecause of the royal wedding, but I'm so glad I did\nbecause it's delicious. Elderflower is like slightly citrusy, very floral, delicate lemon. Clearly, you know that tastes like. Together they're a match made in heaven. I'll be eating this and\nthat and that and that. If you have any questions? Leave them in the comments below.

wedding cake we're gonna start with the cakes already baked I'm going to show you how to slice them fill them ice them how to put dowel rods in the cake to support the structure and how to build a tiered cake and you can use this for any size or any shaped cake that you desire so I'm gonna begin I have two 10-inch cakes already baked and we have charts on our website at global sugar com on how many cups of batter you need to to make each size cake generally a good rule of thumb for the average type of cake is between 1/2 and 2/3 full of batter so if you're not sure exactly how much batter you need for your pan all you have to do is pour water in the pan and up to just a little over 1/2 halfway maybe two-thirds at the most and then dump the water out and measure it and that will tell you how many cups of batter you need for that particular cake pan it's not hard to figure out at all we do sell cake mixes and a regular Allen Tate will select Deluxe cake mix makes about 4 cups of batter so you can figure out how many cake mixes you need as well so to begin after my cake is baked and I even inverted it and I've let it cool on a rack I put them back in the pan and I do this because these are 2 inch pans and I want my final cake on these bottom tiers these first two tiers I want them to be 4 inches high so by cutting these flat I'm going to get 2 layers that will make one tier that is 4 inches high for the top two tiers on this cake I wanted them 5 inches high so I would have baked 3 cakes cut the tops off them and on one of them I would have sliced the cake in half and I would have added that extra 1/2 layer to give another of cake use a nice long serrated knife or like a slicing knife and just go right along the very top of the pan and I like to turn the pan rather than cut straight across if you cut straight across sometimes it can wave a little bit or you it doesn't quite always get it as even as you want and then once you cut all the way around you can just remove the extra cake and I'm gonna do the same on this one I'm just letting that knife rest right across the top of the pan there we go and let's see I've got a sheet pan here I'm just gonna put this extra cake in the pan okay the next step is to put the cake on some sort of a board in between every single cake there is either a cardboard circle or I really like using these foam boards these are quarter inch foam boards which are much sturdier they have a plastic top on them so they're grease proof and there and they work really really well in a tiered cake so you can either use the cardboard or the foam my choice is usually the foam piece you'll notice that I have a set of foam dummies set up back here that's the exact same size as this wedding cake mm-hmm I'll be using the foam dummies a lot and throughout the process of this wedding cake to show you exactly how things are done and if you're a beginner in cake decorating having a set of foam dummies to practice on before you actually make the wedding cake is very very very helpful and you'll see why as we go along hmm so I have a 10 inch cake and a 10 inch circle and I'm just gonna put that on top of the cake and invert that right over and put it on my turntable now the reason I'm putting it on a 10 inch circle is when I stack these cakes I don't want the cake circle sticking out I want it to be flush with my icing coming down the sides of the cake now one of the things that I forgot to do that I that I generally do before I put the cardboard circle on I will take a little bit of buttercream and this will help to stick that circle to the cake so it doesn't slide so that's one important part you really should do okay now I'm ready now in order to ice this cake if I do it now I'm going to have icing down the side of my turntable so I'm actually going to put the entire thing on a little bit larger cake cake circle and that will give me room to work so I'm going to Center that on there and the first thing I'm going to do is put a very very light layer of buttercream there are many different ways you can fill a nice a cake this is just one way even though I'm going to use a lemon filling in this cake I still like to put a nice thin layer of buttercream and what that does is it seals the cake so that the filling isn't absorbed by the cake and when you cut the cake a day or two days later you still have a nice layer filling in there any fruit filling is water-based and the cake will gradually absorb that and it sort of disappears into the cake and you get it shows like you that you have less and less filling as every day goes by so that's the beginning now I'm gonna take some fondant now this is a buttercream wedding cake but this is one place where I will use some fondant one of the problems with buttercream wedding cakes is after you ice them about eight or ten hours later sometimes the next day you'll start seeing a little bulge right around the middle of the cake and anybody who's made wedding cakes with buttercream icing will tell you that this happens all the time part of it is that the cake is settling overnight and the air that's trapped in all the layers of the cake slowly pushes out and it pushes that buttercream out so we have a little solution to this and I'll give you an alternative to this as well so I'm just rolling this fondant into a little bit of a rope and I'm going to put this all the way around the outside edge it doesn't need to be very thick this is just going to prevent the filling from squishing out and from the buttercream bulging out so I just want inside the cake now if you want to be if you want a true buttercream wedding cake and you don't want to deal with the fun that at all you can take some of your buttercream icing in a small bowl and keep adding some powdered sugar to it until it becomes so stiff that you can actually put it on the board and you can roll it and and you actually will get to that consistency so you actually could use the buttercream and just thicken it a lot with powdered sugar and then roll it out the same way I did the fondant but you can now buy fondant in a little 8 ounce package so it's it's easy and it's quick I've got some luscious lemon cake filling this is one of the alan Tatro brands and it's all ready to go this doesn't need to be refrigerated so this is perfectly safe to make your wedding cake and leave it out there we have quite a variety we have raspberry strawberry blueberry lemon we have icing fillings like a German chocolate icing cream cheese icing and we also have a chart on our website buy these fillings telling you how much filling you need for each size tier so now I'm ready to put the second layer on this is probably one of the handiest little tools I have this is made by phat daddy-o's this is a cake lifter when you're working with an even larger cake like this like if I were icing my 14 or a 16 inch cake use a pizza peel if you have won us a an aluminum pizza peel not a wooden one but they're usually about 14 or 16 inches in diameter or square and they're great for lifting a large cake so I'm gonna put that right under flip the cake out and then just lay that right on top and just Center that and now I'm ready to ice this cake mmm the first thing I'm going to do is ice the top of the cake I've used some of the Allen Tatro buttercream and this is flavored with our Bridal blend mmm and when you buy the buttercream or if you want to make your own the recipe is on our website make sure that you put it in the mixer before you you use it if you've made it ahead of time or if you're purchasing the icing and whip it on a very low speed for about five or six minutes at least it will get super creamy and soft and easy to work with so I do the top first and then I'm using what they call a quick ice tube by Wilton I think it's a tube 789 and I put this in a number an 18-inch pastry bag or you can use a disposable bag as well basically yet what I'm going to do is I'm going to pipe the icing on the side of this cake I'm going to start at the bottom and just go right around the cake you can see how quick and easy this is and the nicest part is you don't get any crumbs you're covering the cake all in one movement and the top don't be afraid to put too much butter cream on your cake the first time it's much easier to take some off than to be trying to smooth the sides of the cake and your digging into the cake and pulling up crumbs and then you have to keep adding layer and layer of buttercream on the top of it to try to fix the mistake so always start with more buttercream than you need I'm just going to bring the top in first and then I'm gonna use a bowl of hot water I've just heated up in the microwave let me grab that so this is just warm water and I'm using an ax T Co this is a dough cutter or a side scraper I like it because it lays flat this way and when I put this on the side of the cake I can lie it flat on this larger cake board that's one of the reasons I wanted a larger cake board and I can smooth the sides so I'm just going to dip that in the warm water you don't have to dry it off and I'm going to do this in a couple movements I'm not going to do it all at once because I'm taking off a fair amount of icing okay I don't have to clean the buttercream off I really I just want this to be wet a little bit and that looks pretty good we're gonna be smoothing this using the paper towel or paper method so that's all I have to do on the side but now I want to get the top so I'm going to do the same thing I'm just gonna dip that in the water come in from the outside edge toward the middle never go from the middle out when you look at the wedding cake there's only about an inch and a half that shows on each one on the edge so you don't have to worry about the center it's just the outside edge if I have a lot of cake to do or if I'm going to be icing several cakes at one time I'll usually use a pan of hot water that I can just put back on the stove for a minute or two or if you have a microwave right next to you you can just hole up put the bowl back in to reheat it and that's all I'm gonna do at this point the icing is straight it's quite smooth I could almost decorate it the way it is but I'm gonna let this dry now just taking off any little extra icing I'm going to let this dry especially because I dipped my spatula in water I can see a little bit of water on the icing so I'm gonna give this about five or ten minutes to dry and then we're going to come back and I'm gonna use the paper towel and computer paper regular copy paper to show you the two different things you can use to get a super super smooth finish on buttercream and then we'll go on to stacking the cake we'll be right back I've let this icing set now and dry for about 10 minutes now this is all going to depend on the humidity in your environment and in your kitchen where I live it's rather dry so it's not a problem if you can just touch the the side of it and it doesn't stick to your finger you know it's ready so there are two things you can use to smooth this further at this point you can use the vive brand paper towels or whatever brand you have in your your area or your country that doesn't have a pattern on them if it has a quilted pattern you're gonna have a quilted cake so if you want to find a paper towel without that pattern if you can't find it good old computer copy paper works just as well so I begin with the top I just lay this on the top and I'm using a fondant smoother if you don't have a fondant smoother you can use your hand and I'll show you that and I'm just going to lightly press and I'm working from the outside in remember just like icing the cake I don't want to push that icing out over the edge and you can see that start smoothing if you don't have one of those just use your hand just push down a little bit try not to leave any finger marks you don't want to push too hard you can see all the little areas I'm not going to worry about the top too much because most of its not going to show so now when you get to the side just to show you that you can use either product I'm going to put a piece of computer paper on here and I'm going to use the fondant smoother and just lightly go up and down and back and forth and then pull that away and you can see how that starts smoothing out the cake was not very rough to begin with but if you're a beginner and you don't have a lot of experience icing a cake you're gonna find that this will really hide a lot of mistakes you made when you are icing the cake this really isn't taking much at all this is a good spot this is where I pulled the the scraper away from the cake so let's see what it does to that area can you get a good shot of that okay and then we'll see just how smooth we can make that you can see it's it pretty well disappears you're gonna see a little bit of the seam but the unevenness is now gone there that looks pretty good and that's really all I want to do just to show you again you can use either one either the paper towel or the paper and it doesn't stick to the buttercream and you don't have to use this for a wedding cake you can use this for a birthday cake or any cake you're making if you want a really nice buttercream finish that's a great way to do it so now we do all the cakes the same get them all smooth and of course they've dried a little bit and then we're gonna go on and we're going to stack the cake we'll be right back and show you how to put it all together the cakes have all been iced they've all been smooth you'll notice some are smoother than others I purposely didn't smooth my bottom tier because I'm gonna be piping on a decoration all around the tier so it doesn't matter how smooth the bottom is it's going to be covered I did make sure that the top edge here was smooth but that's all I really worried about so I'm going to grab one of my my dummy parts here this is a cake circle which is the same size as this third tier I'm going to lay it right on top of the buttercream icing now I just showed you how to smooth the icing using a paper towel or a piece of computer paper and this is a crusting buttercream so it's dry enough that I can put something on it and it's not going to stick to it and that's one of the beauties of working with a with a crusting buttercream so I'm putting this this is the same size tier as my next tier and I'm going to Center it on there and then use a little scribing tool or toothpick and just go around the outside edge and just put a little mark in there you'll probably not see this on camera but it's enough for me to know exactly where my next tier needs to be placed now I have five places that I want to put a dowel rod in I need to create an internal support so that this cake doesn't tip over and that if I need to travel with it or bring it to a reception hall it's not going to fall over on me so inside this circle I'm going to put five Polly dowels and these are a plastic doll rod that are reinforced and I know that I'm going to be putting them in these five places I've just chosen four and then one in the middle and what you do is put your dowel rod up against the side of the cake and use a pen and Mark where the top of your cake is or you can simply measure and figure out exactly how high you need that to be and then using a pair of heavy kitchen scissors or even better yet a pair of pruning snips that you would use on it like small trees or brushes works even better and then just cut and measure your $5 odds and then it's a very easy matter of just pushing that dowel rod right in the cake and I want them to go just below the level of the buttercream I don't want them to stick up at all and I know I have a fifth one so now we've supported the that we're gonna support the second tier with these five dowels and if you remember when I iced the cake under this larger plate there is a plate the same size as this cake so that is going to sit flat on here I'm going to use this large spatula again and I'm gonna get right under that cake and I'm gonna lift it up and I'm gonna align it right where I left my marks and then pull that out and you'll be able to lightly move the cake a little bit if you need to readjust it so now all the weight from this cake is laying on the on the board you just show you here all the weight of this cake is sitting on this board and that board is sitting on the supports that I put in the cake so there's no weight on this bottom tier it's all being transferred to the dowel rods and going right down to that bottom board now I'm gonna repeat the exact same thing I would then take my next my next cake size put that on top scribe all around it put in four on the cake this size probably for no more than five dollar odds and then put my next tier on and then repeat that before you put your top tier on and that way all the weight from the very top of the cake goes through every set of pillars onto the board below through the pillars through the board and then down to the base and then you have a perfectly straight cake that's not going to lean back and forth no matter how warm it gets outside or if you want to transport it'll be nice and solid okay so I've stacked my my cake I have dowel rods in the bottom tier this in tier and the third tier and they're all supporting from the top down one of the popular things that you're seeing some decorators do now is taking a very long dowel rod like a quarter inch dowel rod and going down the center of the cake and basically pounding this in through the boards right to the bottom I feel that that is completely unnecessary in my opinion I don't think it does anything for the cake if you have this completely supported with dowel rods this cake is not going to tilt in either direction it's going to stay as sturdy and straight as can be and I have made six seven and eight tier wedding cakes like this and they have never ever fallen over so I really don't see the need to put a single dowel rod that dowel rod going straight through is not going to prevent your cake from moving from one side to the other unless it were actually screwed to the bottom board almost like a pipe that was in place so that's my opinion on on that method one last thing a four-tier cake or a three-tier cake can be rather heavy hmm I highly recommend for your bottom board that you use a half-inch wooden board and then what I do is I cover them with like the Wilton fancy foil or some sort of a white foil covering and then place your cake on that you can use a foam board if you're not planning on traveling very far with the cake or with lifting it from the edges if the cake is small enough where you can get your hand under and lift it you don't need as strong a board but certainly for a four tiered cake that I was going to be transporting I would want a very sturdy wooden board that I can grab on the edges and I'm not going to worry about that bending at all and these are available on our website as well these are known as masonite cake boards okay so the basic tools you need again for the the cake is you need some sort of a large spatula to lift the cakes and put them on you need the quick icer if you don't want to add the frosting on the side with a spatula so a nice big 18-inch pastry bag and the quick icer your filling a little bit of fondant to make the the dam on each cake and then something to smooth the cake either the paper towels the Viva brand paper towels which have no pattern in them or the computer paper and then a bowl of hot water in your spatula and that's about all you need one last thing I didn't mention this is a four inch cake and so is this one so I used the metal at eco scraper for the 5 inch or if I had a six inch cake I would need a larger scraper and this is a scraper and a side smoother made by fat daddy-o's that can easily do a six or seven inch cake and that's what I used on the larger tiers and those are also available on our website the last things you need are the dowel rods hmm these are the half inch Polly dowel rods those are really great for the bottom tiers when you get up to smaller tiers or if you're doing a smaller cake you can actually use the quarter inch these are a buttercream color and these are cut and put in the cake the exact same way and we'll be using these again later on when we add flowers to our cake I hope you've enjoyed the second part of the video on how to actually slice fill ice and construct a wedding cake use the same technique whether using a round cake a heart-shaped cake a square cake any configuration you want the technique is all the same in putting the cake together thanks for watching and remember everything is available at global sugar art comm have a great day you [Music]", "W9yT5A-ESro": "hi everyone and welcome back to the next video in this video i'm going to be taking two grocery store cakes and turning them into a wedding cake so both of these cakes are from a local grocery store and they're both chocolate cakes with vanilla frosting um but the white cake does have a bavarian cream in the middle so i thought would add a little more flavor to this grocery store cake these cakes just came from the store so they're about room temperature which i thought would make them easier to disassemble and both cost about 20 once i got the cakes out of their boxes i decided to work on the purple cake first i thought that would take more time i first assessed to see if i could save anything i thought i could save the roses i'm going to pull the roses off and put them on a sheet pan and pop those flowers in the freezer until i get to the decoration stage [Music] next i decided to pull up the purple frosting to save it for the decoration stage to do this i'm just using an offset spatula to kind of scrape just underneath the purple buttercream to remove it from the cake sometimes it would lift off pieces of cake like this example here and because i want to use this for the outside layer of the cake for decoration any cake i had i made sure i removed this way i ensured that all of my purple frosting that i had for my cake was nice and smooth and great for decorating [Music] now it's time to scrape off the white buttercream to be left with a bare naked cake if i were to do this challenge again i would definitely leave at least the top layer of frosting on because that would have acted as the middle layer of the cake i would also leave the frosting on because as i mentioned before with purple icing a lot of the cake was coming off with the frosting which means i couldn't use this for decoration i could only use this to fill the cake and to do a crumb coat [Music] now that my cake has been stripped there it's time for me to do the same thing with the white cake i didn't save any of the frosting for decoration for the white cake i just put it all in the same bowl once i stripped my cakes and decided to measure them because as i've learned from watching other people 9x13 cakes aren't actually 9x13 cakes once they're stripped of frosting my cakes measured 7 by 11 inches which i use these measurements to then create my template for my stacked cake for my bottom tier i decided on a square six and a half inch cake and for my top tier i decided on a four and a half inch round tape so just use a template here parchment and a circle cutter to cut out my layers [Music] [Laughter] [Music] with all my layers cut and resting in the fridge or freezer i'm gonna work on my frosting so this is all the white frosting i could save and scrape off the cake i'm just going to mix it together to get a nice smooth consistency as you'll see there's a lot of cake crumbs in this frosting which i mentioned earlier in the video which is why i'm not going to use it for decoration i'm just going to use it to fill and crumb coat my cakes [Music] and now i'm just going to stack my layers and give them a bit of a trim so that way they're both the same size now that they're both the same size i'm just going to peel them apart and then i'm going to fill the middle and restock them to make this easier i'm going to move my sponges onto my turntable i started out by putting on some buttercream using an offset spatula but i found that consistency of the buttercream was a little bit too stiff and a little bit too tacky and was pulling the cake up with it and not really wanting to stick with this i switched to a piping bag and things went much smoother [Music] i then do the same process with my small tears so i stacked my cakes made sure the circles lined up and then i'm gonna unstack them and fill my cake [Music] onto the crumb coat so for this i'm just gonna pipe some buttercream along the sides of my cake and smooth it out with a spatula this is probably the hardest part of the whole process um for two reasons really so one i have never made a square cake before and so i knew it was gonna take a lot of time to get those edges and corners nice and sharp but i think really the biggest problem i had was the consistency of the buttercream i would describe this buttercream as tacky kind of gluey really thick and really hard to spread and honestly i kept pulling off pieces of cake as i tried to spread my buttercream and so i think if i were to do this again i would have left as much buttercream on the cake as i possibly could to reduce the amount of buttercream i had to add back onto the cake [Music] [Music] my [Music] [Music] with my square cake kind of decent i'm on to my top tier which honestly this tier was even worse as you can see the frosting was peeling right off and it was not sticking to any of the cake [Music] after making essentially no progress i decided to pop it in the freezer and just to see if freezing it for half an hour would make a difference it really didn't so now it's time to move on to the bottom tier and here i'm actually covering this tier in american buttercream so i was very skeptical that the frosting came off the store-bought cakes would actually be enough so i did make one batch of buttercream using three sticks of butter and about um eight or so cups of powdered sugar as you can see this consistency is much easier to work with so i can cover these cakes a lot quicker if you're also thinking about turning a store-bought cake into a fancy cake i highly highly highly suggest making your own buttercream because you can control the consistency i found the store-bought buttercream to be overly tacky and overly thick and really hard to smooth onto the cake as you just saw with this american buttercream i made it the consistency that i am used to and i'm confident with which helped me really get those nice sharp corners and nice flat top onto the top tier and boy did this tiny tier need a lot of work i transferred to a cake board that was about five and a half inches or so so i could try to get an even layer of buttercream all around the side and have a nice straight and non-crooked cake by now i'm definitely regretting doing this challenge and at this point i'm just trying to get it done [Music] i wanted to add a pop of color to my cake so here i am adding the purple icing that i saved from the beginning to make a watercolor design i'm doing this by adding dabs of purple and then using my bench scraper to kind of drag it through the white and it's going to keep doing this until i find a consistency and a color scheme that i can live with at this point [Music] in the home stretcher it's time to stack and pop my flowers on my cake to add structure i cut four bubble tea straws and suck them in my square tier and i'm just going to put the small circle tier on top my cake look at this point straight enough and good enough which means i'm going to add my flowers this is just a 5 bouquet from the same grocery store and my flowers are prepped with a little bit of cling film to keep them from reaching into the cake i'm using a little bit of buttercream to attach my flowers to my cake and also pushing the stems into the cake for more security i wanted the center of my cake to be the corner so i put those flowers in first and then to create balance i put flowers on the top left corner and the bottom right corner i then went and added some gold glitter to really jazz up my cake and i also went back and added those buttercream flowers that i'd say from the beginning i just forgot to film it and here we have the final product would i call this a resounding success no however i will call it a win because this was my first ever square cake and i think those corners were pretty dang good in the end this cake cost me around sixty dollars so it's twenty dollars each for the cake five dollars for the flowers about three dollars for the straws and about six or seven dollars for me to make buttercream so based on all this information i probably wouldn't do this challenge again i think i could make a cheaper cake and a better cake if i made it completely from scratch here you can see the inside so you can see just how uneven those layers are and how much i really struggled to make this cake look good and when it came time to eat it it just tasted like a store-bought cake which definitely reminds me of my childhood but i think i can make a better cake now that i have experimented with other cake recipes and found recipes that i really love but i would love to hear from you let me know in the comments below if you think this cake is a cake fail or a cake win if you like this video you guys know what to do and if this video inspires you to try this challenge for yourself make sure you tag me at baking and broadway and i'll see you guys in the next video", "JczVPnT5C74": "hi thank you for joining me today this time I'm going to decorate a two tier wedding cake with a beach theme this cake is a very ripe choice for anybody who produces or who receives this cake looking for something simple with an elegant statement I'm going to use few basic elements to achieve that result I'm going to make a special texture on this cake that leg is actually completely finished called it with the rolling fondant but because we like to bring this send a look element to the cake I like to give an extra texture on this cake with additional royal icing I'm going to color this relaxing with a little bit touch of instant coffee the coffee gives a perfect ivory tone - white icing you can also try to mix some brown and yellow color mixture but coffee really a perfect like not too orangish not too brownish it gives a perfect ivory tone to my opinion then I'm going to do some little seashells starfishes if I do this starfish I'm going to use a very simple tool like this pen and there's nothing inside there is no inside part so I'm going to use this little little part here to give some textures to the starfish and I'm going to note the starfishes by hand without any mold without any cutter then I'm going to do some seashells which is look like that then I'm going to talk to you about a couple of different methods then we can also do without anything to achieve the t-shirt or we can use also silicon most we talk about this later then I'm going to use some generous way of sugar corals which the recipe you can find in the recipe section then I'm going to use some of these almond rushes for like beach stone pebbles then everything going to be very quickly finished and one more thing I'm going to use also raffia instead of a normal satin ribbon because just a satin ribbon is not going to mesh to that particular rough texture which is going to give some unwanted sort of like a position that the ribbons is not going to sit properly on the edge of the cake so roughly will be a good finishing touch to that point first I like to produce my die which is the instant coffee I put a little bit of just a few drop of water here it melts very quickly but you have to make sure that really melts because if there's a small little pieces goes and icing the moisture is not good enough to melt that coffee so testily noted now if we really really make sure that melts everything it's not very quickly so you can just actually check behind it behind the spoon here alright what the rest is follow up then I'll take not too much just a few spoon of royal icing because I'm going to make very very thin coating just this much should be more than enough I always put a little bit of vinegar and a royal icing because vinegar makes it especially rested realizing it loses the creaminess a little bit so when I mix it just a few turn like this it become creamy again because of this little bit of vinegar so I just put just a few drops of this don't put too much at the beginning because you can always put a little bit more later on instead of putting too much at the beginning you cannot go back see the coffee really gives a good stain for the ivory tone there's the other product called Baker's caramel so the Baker's putting inside the brown bread to make the bread a little bit more brownish a bit more rubbish so I also use this one sometimes but coffee is really good it gives a really sweet nice elegant pirate on tow a little bit more one last time that's it I'm quite happy with this one so I place my case on a turntable because masking is always need to turn the cake around so turntable will help you to make it quite easier so I just go like that very very thin and don't worry about how it is going to be done because we're going to soon up again by hand later on very quick let me just tell you about how to hold a palette knife see there's a handle in Pilot life if you hold it like this is very uncomfortable because it's not controlled like like driving a car without any control so if I hold it like this in the middle and I put my finger here so and make this motion left and right so if I Drive like this I do it like that if I Drive like this I do it like that so it's always scraping always in the right position it's happening really quickly but you see that I'm always doing this like this like this like this like this but very quickly what I try to do I never want to have the icing on top of the pilot knife always underneath it gives it nice and I mean at the moment it's not really important because I'm not really muscular in there to achieve a really nice texture I'm just going to have it like a very rough texture so that's why I'm not really careful with that but basically in principle don't get the icing on top yet Oh much there that's it but it's on the site what I'm going to do I'm going to spray a little bit of water on top just a little bit water because I start from here I finished there this may be a little bit dry in the meantime just a slightly water and go for it with a hat everywhere try to even up this icing over it around the cake if you like to have a small texture just a very fine rough but very fine rough texture you have to put a little bit less than that so I don't might now have a little bit more the the mountains and rivers on it's a bit more higher and lower okay once I'm sure that everywhere the icing is evenly distributed then I do this motion just go by hand like that see in no time that you have an even texture on the cake everywhere the same it's really match to the concept that beach team concept that's it I'm done so we go to the next step now I'm going to start now all the parts I'm going to start with something that I need to rest it on table a lot longer than the other pieces so I need to have the dryness at the end when I'm assembling kick that's why I do this piece first this will be then the branches or you can call this tweak or something like extension towards the decorations or whatever so I just take my little pasta - nothing not much just a little bit like that maybe a table tennis ball size and this pasta is ready i recondition in the macro register just a few seconds in the microwave do that sausage shape and roll this but make sure that this part is thinner than this this is around sort of like a can be 1 cm 8 millimeter but this one should be that goes all the way to 0 all right then how do I do I just take a knife I don't need this starting from the thicker cut and then go thinner and thinner at the end end up in 0 so I just do like three of them three or four of them different sizes should be enough I do this one very often many of my cakes and very useful so I take this one like this you see it is you see that it's like a very take the tin very nicely and just give a little bit of like touch around here and think about somebody you don't like it and then do this you know like just squeeze it like this and then I just put it over here but when you're squeezing make sure that you're not really damaging you're not really breaking up see if you realize it that what I do is I'm going to open my fingers I'm not squeezing I just I'm just doing like this I give it a bit to like like spacing between and squeeze it like this it create that the abstract look to the branch that's it I'm ready with this one it's going to stay for a while till I finish all the other parts it's going to be dry enough to put it on the cake at the end let's talk about t-shirts now seashells is very often used in cake decorating because the beach theme or ocean team or this kind of like subjects are very often used and then anything about this kind of thing first thing comes in your mind of course decisions and of course it is variety of methods to do that first of all you can just buy a silicone mold like this just cut just roll your a gum paste or pastillage cut and roll around piece place it inside push this in take it out your t-shirt is ready but I'm not going to be too much to worry about now because nothing to make tutorial how to push pasteurize into the silicone mold and make a seizure so the next thing that I like to tell you I find years ago two pieces of this Tupperware lids so this exactly the same thing and then I thought that if I put this together like this as you see that from the camera like that here it just pushes like give me exactly right texture around here so sometimes we come across these kind of things then you think about it they can you can use it it should be a plastic it should be like clean item that you can use it for the food and I'm using this one over the years so I'm going to show you again how I do it but of course this is also not the point here because you may not have this same thing I like to show you how to make a mold out of the pasta - without relying to purchase something or ask someone to give you some model cutter or whatever okay what I do I have only a little cutter here probably about 50 mil right 50 or 55 mm so what I do I take a pasta gosh it's always good to have an idea what to do if you don't have any sorts of molds or cutters or something like that and produce something that on your own and you can still achieve the result so pops the - neat little bit like this and make it quite flat like that flat to the shape that look bigger than that this mod all right and then carefully this is a plastic piece it's actually used in the corners of the the wall sheets when they when they join together in constructions they put this on the corner to cover that edge so it's another plastic piece that I'm using for a tool that modeling tool that very often so put one line in the middle like this and then another line like that the line like that so just bring the lines into one spot like that I'm actually producing a pusher mold that I can use to produce my seashells later on when it's dry so I just push this one down you don't have to do that but just that gives a better texture here and you just cut it down like that all right so I need to have just like this I need the second piece to put on top if I take this one now like this put my cutter on top and I put another parcel on top what I do I will destroy that shape because it's still soft so that's right I have to give some time to that let it dry it's better to wait till tomorrow give it overnight but I just did this piece a couple of hours ago it's still it's hard enough to get the other piece done so what I do I put my cutter inside here like this and then get another soft pastillage give a good neat I need to have a bit of starch so I just put a little bit of starch here enter this piece and push this in so I'm pushing my passage on top of the dry one so my mold is finished so what I can do now after this one dry I cut the pasta - or gum paste whatsoever roll it 13 cut round pieces put them here and then push this one together just like you do with silicon lock you get your own mode your own seashell to glue together so I'm not gonna use this one now because this is not hard enough so I'm going to use this one to show you how to do it just think about you using this same thing and then I also have some pretty dry one before I'm going to use them for this cake today I will do a few seashells now with my couple rare lids gosh okay just like this is about maybe just a millimeter thickness so I take my 50 mil cutter and then cut one few pieces of that let me just make four and actually what I do make it six then I can show you the true piece for this one that's the stitch what I do is I put them onto each other so if I do that the cluster species doesn't get dry quickly so I can work one by one just put them like this and then grab one by one yeah put it here just hold it on the edge put this on top just push slightly on the edge take it up look at this my perfect seashell with taco rail it and I have this little plastic folder here put it in there I'm sure you will find something similar in your environment here like this push with a bit done anymore okay what'd I do now I'm going to use my my homemade mold which is it's dried little bit now and just I just did about two minutes ago three minutes ago look at that it just fits nicely so what I do put it here like this make sure that you put putting in the right right spot that this pressure did still soft all right place it yet it will still do the job okay one more time okay now I have this pieces here I'd done it before so they're not that soft so how I do that I just take a clean smile for a bit normally what I can do I can take you just a bit of royal icing and glue them together and place it yet but if I do that I have to wait till tomorrow just to distress so I'm going to slip the white chocolate now yet just the good because I'm going to continue with my cakes right away now both side touch a little bit and place it here and weariness drives I'm going to sit with the royal icing so you don't see the chocolate anymore so I'm going to continue with everything together finish them all six off I'm going to show you now how to make a starfish without any mold without any cutter just using a pen without inside part I'm going to use this little hole to make the starfish the textures on it so I have here a conditioned lastly - which is just warmed up in the microwave for a few seconds using a little bit of olive oil spray on the table so that things doesn't stick on the table I give a good neat - faster - and do this and portion them into reasonable sizes like this little bit of oil spray in the hinge turn to a bowl-shaped then flatten a little bit and give five edges just nor flee to create the star then after that each section you pull it out by just pinching in different directions see pastillage is good material to that because it's standing it doesn't really shake him down okay then where do I place this on there on the base here and give some indentations with this pen tip from Center and then I just give a little bit of movement like this don't make it like because starfish is a live creature so it is got slightly gives it a bit of a moment in you right continue with all the five if you ask me the question can I cut this passage first with the star cutter yes you can but I assume that now we don't have any cutters so I'm going to show you without relying something else than your hands make sure that the tips are really sharp that makes it interesting there's another way of doing these corners properly you can take something like this it's like a square plastic piece you can also take a piece of cardboard and fold it into corner like that and pushing like this this also gives it nice edge and my starfish are almost ready it tests the rest for a while to get a little bit dry that I mean I can lift up like this now it's no problem because possibly that's using that possibility but just wait for another ten minutes to before you put on the cake now I'm going to remove the plastic lining which is protects the well wet coated wooden board underneath so now because we're not going to work messy anymore I can remove this one because later on could be a little bit difficult to pull all underneath the decorations so I just specially me doing this lining we don't stick anything underneath underneath the board so I can just remove the edge first without any problem and cut just a little slit here and start tearing off it will only tear from the point where the cake is the end of the cake it will just tear from this point so you will not even see it I place the cake on the turntable from now on and still intend to do because I need to turn the cake cake way off in different directions so I have here a rough guess which is natural rocker I just select about four or five pieces for each HTF and just make sure that all this long enough so I just simply all in like this go around the cake is almost almost dry it's already good enough to give a one not like that and then place your finger here give a second not doesn't have to be too tight but once we make the second knot we can actually pull quite strong because it's not going to pressurize to keep any more talk like this so it just goes left and right just started good enough do the same thing with the top nail so this is also about five pieces this time I have to make sure is that not in the same same location that's it said on the second note you can't pull it because it's not going to pressurize to kick anymore so I will just drop first with a bit I'm going to shop later on again on the right place so then we don't have to have this long pieces around after decoration finish I maybe just a little bit more to make it right from now on we're going to add all the decorations on everything what I need to decorate this beach themed wedding cake it's there so I have my two-tier cake which is the 20 cm and 25 cm both tiers are 75 millimeter height and I have my couple of seashells here and some of them I didn't I didn't stick it because I like to use it maybe a flat not really opening up like this I am here our our special microwave sugar Collins which is actually nothing else than a piece of parsley - with additional of some icing sugar please look at this recipe section to find out how to do this and I have my spikes or whatever you call that tweak or branches I will only use one of them but I prefer to produce couple of them because because they are naturally producing different direction different shapes I like to select the best one to fit it on top then I have five pieces of starfish it may be just four or six doesn't matter and I have my almond sugar dredges to use it as Pebble Beach pebbles and I have also a little bit of white royal icing to glow everything I would also suggest that if you have to use this cake when you're doing it quickly you may also use some white chocolate to go this is more to have the north security so first thing what I do I will put some of this microwave coral pieces on top but I like to turn the stick out to myself that I can see the composition is right so all right I think I like to go generously because there's nothing to harm do that so like to turn it like this because it will be more drastic looking here then I have my second piece on top I like to position this such a way that I get a bit of height just like this all right now I like to put a medium-sized little coral on each level but not exactly on the same direction maybe a little bit left little bit right so I'm just going to put one here maybe one right here something's wrong on that so I like to create like it's not coming everything in one line going to create like one in the middle a little bit left little bit right so to create a bit more natural-looking and the next thing is I like to put one of this crunch on top just resting here I like to have this extension to get the really finishing spiky bit I know it's touching here just put it there a little bit up here and resting on it it's that okay now the question is where do I put things now I have my sea shell is you see inside a little bit you can see they're quite chocolates I just put my realizing inside it and close the top you don't see it anymore and I like to use some relaxing here behind to glue it so I think is the best spot to start with second one I try to use different positions and of course this one here one day I will put one here I have this quite often one that will match the bottom level that's it now like to put some additional ones but I like to place first to starfish then the next she'll define it so I like to select the best starfish for the top which is this one generously here and resting here I see all the top profile from the front that's it that one here then the next one probably this direction but maybe here just right underneath nothing wrong if you use that one or - spike - pocket in right one here that put one more here in the front that's it so if I turn the drum so you can look it from the front camera that's already it's already a flow there but it's not 100% completed so that there is some part here that's not really a bit empty something missing there and also I have a chance now to put a little bit more so I have here another shell I can extend the bottom part a little bit more here maybe this way it doesn't see inside so I don't put anything inside but this and I have also a couple of shelves which is not open so I can placed a little bit there maybe one on this side yeah I think there's nothing nothing necessary to put more load on it so I will put a couple of more cobblestones which is the almond drudges and finished off nicely one here location is quite important one here one Gloria so if you realize that I'm not just check everything on it sorry to do still use a little bit of like a thinking and composition you know just composing that that arrangement according to the feeling no I'll put one of the judges inside the show looks like a pair there's one more here possible to put in alright what else so I think I can put one more here one more at the bottom here as far as I'm concerned I think the composition is finished I don't have to load more things on it so I turn around that you can see better from the front camera this is the way how we do it as a simple beach themed wedding cake I hope you like it now is your turn don't forget to share your pictures and comments or questions if you have with us thank you for the time you spent with the anyway today I look forward to have you joining us again on the next tutorial you", "xuhFw0jGxNE": "welcome back to the Chelsea's kitchen today I'm gonna walk you guys through a test wedding cake that I made that has all the features of what I'm looking for in my wedding dress so I made each tier a special flavor for both me and Stephen and the largest bottom tier was made with a double chocolate frosting and a chocolate ganache so I piped a thick ring of frosting around the perimeter to keep the dark frosting contained and then I added a chocolate ganache drizzle over the top of that I repeated that with my second layer and each of these tiers is made with three layers of my favorite vanilla layered cake once the layers were stacked I added on a thin crumb coat and chilled the cake in the freezer for about five minutes until it was firm to the touch I then added a very thick second layer of frosting just to make sure that I got the sides really straight and level I then used my bench scraper to make sure the sides were nice and smooth and I inserted four dowels into this base tier to make sure that it can support the weight of the tiers that are going to go on top of it the second tier is a cookie butter flavored tier so I filled the center with some cookie butter frosting and of course added a very generous drizzle of cookie butter on top of that I repeated this process with both of my layers and then followed the same steps that I did with my bottom tier we haven't finalized the flavors that we want to pick for each tier yet but this one is definitely a top contender the top tier is a salted caramel tier so it's filled with a salted caramel frosting a drizzle of caramel and a sprinkle of sea salt this tier is tiny these are four inch cake layers I made this cake pretty small just because it is a test cake so the tiers are 8 inch 6 inch and 4 inch so I wanted to decorate this cake with everything that I'm looking for in my wedding dress so of course I had to make some edible leaf both the mold that I'm using and the powder that I used to make the edible lace I got on Amazon and the links to both are included in the video description below so I followed the instructions to T and I really made sure that the lace mixture was wedged into every bit of my mold and then bake them at 250 degrees for about 16 minutes once the lace is fully baked to be sure to let it cool for at least two hours this will make it so much easier to remove from the mold initially I didn't do that and I ended up ripping all of my lace so be sure that you're patient and let it cool fully so the box of edible lace that I got came with two packages I made one which ended up making four sheets of lace at the end of the day you really only need one because your top tier only uses half of one and your bottom tier uses about one and a half because I made my layers in advance my frosting had crusted on the layers so I added a thin strip of buttercream to help make sure the lace stayed in place if you want to see a full tutorial on how to stack a tiered cake click the link in the upper right corner if you have any space between your tears once they're stacked or if your cardboard rounds are showing at the base of your tears you can always pipe a border around them to cover that up in addition to lace I wanted some floral accents so I had to add on some fresh flowers to this cake and then came the really fun part actually trying on dresses so I ended up going to bridal garden NYC which is located in Flatiron and I had the best time I tried on a ton of different dresses and I wanted something that was a little bit different so there are a few different colors and cuts here since we're getting married in Central Park in the summer I really wanted a short dress or something that I was comfortable in and I ended up finding the perfect dress so I'm not gonna share it with you guys because I want it to be a big surprise on our wedding day but I had a great experience at bridal Garden NYC and we were able to celebrate once I found it I also had a little celebration in my kitchen once I finished the cake and I wanted to cut him to show you guys all the different tiers that we made if you guys enjoyed this video be sure to click the like

socially\ndistanced from Joel McHale, which is how I like it (laughs), and we're about to get our baking on. I'd like to think I'm\nfar enough away this time to avoid any flour or icing that may fly in my direction. - Kelly.\n- Right? - Can they see our butts, are they just watching our butts? - No, they see this part! You just want them to\nsee your butt (laughing). - But I feel like they're\njust looking at our butts! - Hopefully this goes better\nand less than the last time. (laughing) You know, you said it so I looked directly at your butt! (laughing) - Yeah, sorry I interrupted.\n- And they probably caught that on camera, it's weird. Okay, our next guest is a master at teaching us great cooking skills. You know her from \"Cake by Courtney,\" let's welcome, Courtney Rich everybody! (clapping) And it's great to see you again! - Hi you guys, thanks for having me! - Oh my gosh, your\nkitchen looks so perfect. Oh, so what are we making today? - All right, we're gonna make\nour own little wedding cake, or it could be a birthday cake, but this is a really simple way to make your own cake\nif you've got an event or maybe it's a wedding that things have changed a little bit, but there's no decorating. It is just like, no\nbuttercream decorating here, we're just gonna do a naked cake. So I know you're both pros 'cause Kelly we've made cake together a couple times. Joel, you've made cake before.\n- Pro is a strong word. (Kelly laughs)\n- Yep. I'm great. - [Kelly] Yep, I'm amazing.\n(audience laughs) - I actually, before I ever got on TV, I was like a prep cook at a bakery. - Were you really?\n- Mhm, mhm. - Is that a lie?\n- Yes! (all laughing) - God, you're good! - Of course he was!\n- What's first? - All right you guys, grab your first cake layer,\n- Okay. - And we're gonna put\nit right on top of our cake board.\n- Got it! - Done!\n- (laughs) Done. (audience laughs) - That's it? - Done! Easy, okay,\n- Who do we undress? - We're doing this, this\nis a cookie butter cake. There's cookie butter cookies in here, grab your white chocolate. - [Joel and Kelly] Okay. - [Courtney] And we're gonna pipe a rim. - Okay.\n- So, oh, just the rim? - Okay.\n- Oh, shoot. (laughs) - [Courtney] Just the rim.\n(Kelly laughs) You want the creamy white on the outside. - [Joel] Jeez. - Okay.\n- Beautiful! - (laughs) I love this. - Hold on, hold on, hold on, this is, I gotta do this right. - Okay, oh, and then\nyou grab the other one and you do the... Oh my God! (laughs)\n- Oh no, no, no, it's gonna go right over to that one. - He's nailing it. - Oh, yeah!\n- Everyone has their own special technique.\n- That's what this is. - [Joel] There we go. - So what's next?\n- Okay. - That's one way to do it Joel. I feel that's creative, I love it! Okay but Kelly, if you wanna do it this way with me--\n- She talked to you like a pre-school teacher!\n- Let's take our cookie butter filling\nand put it in the center. - Okay, in the center center?\n- In the center. - Okay.\n- Yep! - All the way around, okay. Okay, but--\n- Like, I'm almost there. This is...\n- Like, I mean it's so hard! (audience laughing)\n- I did it Kelly. - I mean it's so... Is yours difficult? - Yeah, no, to stay in\nplace is really hard. - Get outta there! Just...\n- Okay. - It's a little cold.\nYour set's really cold. My kitchen is nice and hot right now. - My set is getting warmer\n'cause it's like they-- - [Joel] Kelly what do you think? - It's coming out and it\nlooks not good, it's fine. - I think I got it.\n- What are you doing? Oh my God, yours-- - Kelly, grab your little\nbag of buttercream. - [Kelly] Okay, wait, here we go. - And use that in the center. - Okay, so then we do this again, I'm gonna catch up. - [Courtney] Oh, I'm gonna keep going. - There we go!\n- Ooh! - Oopsy!\n- Yep, you're gonna just repeat those steps. - Oopsy, I'm stressed out.\n- Okay, this is going great. - Oh my God.\n(audience laughs) - When do we get diabetes?\n- No one's fast when they a cake. I mean, that's in five\nminutes right there. (Kelly laughing) - Oh my God...\n- So, we can do this at home. If you want to like, clean up your sides, you can take a little spatula and just kind of press against the edges with the spatula.\n- Yep! - When I make a cake and\nit's supposed to look a little rustic, that's\nlike the best part. - Mine looks rustic.\n- Yeah, mine looks so rustic. - [Courtney] There's no\nright way to do this. - (laughing) Your top! - [Courtney] But Kelly, once you have your last layer on top, we can decorate. - Okay. I'm done! - Now this isn't a very big cake, so we wanna make sure that\nwe kind of go proportionate. I don't want to put like\na big pear on top of this or lots of big things sticking out, because it's a small cake.\n- That would be silly, yeah. - So I'm gonna do figs. I love figs right now. - [Joel] That's a great solution! - Okay, wait, and you--\n- Don't worry too much, I mean, I can't wait to\nsee how you decorate it. - Oh, I think you're\ngonna be very excited. - All right, now what's important too when you're decorating the top of one of these small little cakes, is don't overdo it.\n- Right! - And kind of think of\nyour cake in thirds. - Absolutely.\n- So, I'm gonna kind of come to the back side of this cake, and then gradually kind of fan out. And I grew up doing art classes and we were always told to\nthink of our canvas in thirds. And so that's how I'll do a lot of my cakes when I'm decorating. Get like things in thirds\nand do odd numbers too. - [Joel] Mm! Mhm? - Joel, your cake is amazing! (audience laughing) - Thank you!\n- He is talented. - Kelly, how are you?\n- Wait, I'm gonna put, you haven't put icing on\nbut I wanna put icing on. - That's perfect, that is so beautiful! - Well done.\n- Look! I put icing on mine! - I love it!\n- It looks great! This is one of those things where the crew is really\nexcited to try this. (all laughing) - Well, and the best part is\nthis cake is so delicious. It's cookie butter filling, the white chocolate buttercream. - Oh my gosh, yes!\n- Oh, you don't have to tell me.\n- So I mean, if it's time to dig\nin, let's eat this too! - You gotta taste yours. Go ahead, I dare you.\n- Oh yeah, great. - [Courtney] I've got my fork. (audience laughing) - [Joel] There we go. - Oh shoot.\n- I'll just try it like that. - Oh my gosh, that's really good! - Great!\n(audience laughing) Yeah!\n- It's really good! - Would you like to try ma'am? Mm! Go ahead!\n- Wait, so Courtney, while he's feeding the audience, you launched a podcast right? What's it about? - Yeah! You know what? It kind of brought me full-circle with my broadcast career that\nI left behind to do cakes, and I'm just sharing a lot\nof just hopefully uplifting and inspiring stories\nfrom everyday people. So it's every Wednesday, it launches on all podcasts platforms. - That's awesome!\n- Yeah. - Well Courtney, thank you so much for helping us improve our cake-making skills.\n- It's a really good podcast. It's very dirty, but it's great. - [Kelly] (laughs) It's great.", "EuKCslZg5rc": "it's the ten motion about wedding number ten oh okay what's up guys this is James and Brandon oh yeah the zombie kick

and I'll be making my Italian coconut cream cake or better known as the Italian wedding cake and this recipe is just absolutely incredible I'm going to make a coconut flavoured cake and a coconut whipped cream frosting soak those layers with more coconut milk and add some toasted coconut on the sides your grains are going to love every single bite of this incredible cake I brought my butter eggs and coconut milk up to room temperature I have 3/4 cup of unsalted butter and to that I'll be adding 1 cup of white granulated sugar and then I'll just grab my hand mixer and mix the butter and the sugar together for a couple minutes until it's light and fluffy next I'll add in two teaspoons of coconut extract and I'll start adding my four eggs one at a time you want to make sure you mix this well after each addition [Music] and once you add in all the eggs just keep mixing for a few minutes until you have a nice and creamy mixture and then add in a 1 cup of coconut milk and now for my dry ingredients I have measured out 2 cups of all-purpose flour and to that all adding a quarter teaspoon of salt and four teaspoons of baking powder and then sift the dry ingredients into the cake batter and then mix the coconut milk and the dry ingredients into the batter just until that flour is incorporated you do not want to over mix I've lined two 8-inch cake pans with parchment paper and then I sprayed the sides with a baking spray and I'm just going to divide this cake batter evenly between the two pans and then I like to take a little spatula and just level off the top of the layers please stay nice and even and I'm going to place them into my preheated oven which I've set to 350 degrees Fahrenheit they're going to bake for about 25 to 28 minutes until they're nice and golden brown on top let them cool completely and then we'll come back to make our coconut whipped cream frosting my cake layers are cooled and now I'm going to get started on my frosting now you'll need 8 ounces of either mascarpone of cream cheese and let it soften at room temperature then I'm going to add in 1/2 a cup of coconut milk fats this is like the fatty part of the coconut milk and add a teaspoon of coconut extract and then mix this all together and mix that for a few minutes until you have a smooth creamy and clump free mixture I'll set that cheese mixture aside for now and into my stand mixer bowl I'll add in two cups of chilled heavy cream and one cup of confectioner's sugar and then whisk this on medium high speed for three to four minutes until you get stiff and fluffy peaks and then add in the cheese mixture and this next step is really important because you don't want to over mix the frosting otherwise it will separate so once you add in that cheese just whisk it on high to medium speed for about 30 seconds and once these layers are cooled I'm going to grab a sharp serrated knife level off the top I like to keep these extras on the side to munch away on and then split the layer in half and before adding my frosting I'm going to soak the layers lightly with some plain coconut milk you can use unsweetened or sweetened but I find the unsweetened works great because the cake layers are pretty sweet and for the cake garnish I toasted a few cups of shredded coconut I'm just going to gently press this into the side of the cake and then to garnish the top I transferred some of the cream into a pastry bag and today I'm using tip number four after tea and I like to tell my cake in the fridge for a couple hours before slicing into it just grab a sharp knife and how stunning is that I love the simplicity of this cake it looks so so beautiful and time to dig in and enjoy the stunning cake there's a very good reason this cake is in my cookbook and that's because this cake is just heavenly it's like a slice of coconut heaven it's so light and fluffy the cake layers are just amazing so so delicate then you add that coconut milk and then the fluffy coconut whipped cream frosting this is like just incredible if you love coconut you're gonna be head over heels in love with this cake for where you can find my cookbook as well as for this full

thought I was special I was really psyched and then I talked to my siblings this morning they're like oh yeah they asked us and take a break up and taste these when we return [Applause] [Music]

worse it's over the you know you're doing okay Christmas day chaotic at your home or is it relaxed it's very good it's very good well you know I have the garbage bags hidden underneath the sofa so all the the remnants papers yeah and then it never happened my mother just uses a bag that we've used for ten years for the same that's actually smart you roll them you bake them for 10 to 12 minutes you really want to watch them because you don't want them to you don't want them to get too dark I like them light and fluffy okay the secret though is to once they bake like this yep you let them cool completely if you roll them in the sugar too soon they will become gummy and Pacey and nobody wants nobody once ago me pasty but honestly if I'm being honest they don't last very long but you take them once they're completely cooled and you just roll them in the powdered sugar just like that and then you put them on the tray mark you need taste choice [Applause] so great to see you guys a Merry Christmas hey Jamie said the board is next we'll be right back [Applause] [Music] you", "C30n3vfcL_s": "wakey-wakey rise and shine what would be putting in our mouths today shut up Ben hello last year Barry told us that he wants to get married and we all laughed and then it turned out he was serious and then he asked us if we'd make the wedding cake for him and we all laugh and it turns out he was serious and then we asked him when can we bake this cake and he said the day before the wedding and we all laughed it turned out he was serious and then he said that he wanted a nine layered three-tiered wedding cake with carrot cake on the top lemon drizzle on the middle and Victoria sponge on the bottom and we all laugh and it turned out he was serious why me how's it going so far Amy who has just shown me the wonderful kitchen said it's pretty good except for one thing temperamental oven so that's good for a nine layered three-tiered cake right so here's the plan batch number one uh Victoria sponge at two lemon drizzle with the syrup a single batch of carrot cake and meringue buttercream probably five times the batch I smell burning and there's nothing in it I know it's lunches are you feeling so funny hey caterers just got to be able to the head chef who's on the phone who's caught up especially say I advised you don't use the ovens on site they will burn I've got ready to put on all you gotta do is make a cake yeah to the rocky road he's in the oranges I know where they are they're not lost just not here they just missed yet to avoid burning your currants you've soaked them in orange juice if you leave your oranges at home then you have to walk on the premises and beg borrow and steal some orange juice from the bar and two clementines from the packed lunch of the florist slowly story I'm here to house the other cakes everything is going well okay no problem sure yeah I'll believe it when I see it Hey I laid out on the roof to carrot cake top tier in the of we're gonna have to keep an eye on it hopefully it doesn't burn in the meantime middle tier lemon drizzle the cloudy lazy like you and me and the sky to make a sailor Mizzou football trouser legs wrap up all the way hey cooked top-tier when done back around lemon drizzle one there is no panic everything's very calm everything's looking really great don't want to think about what's going on in the kitchen I've heard noises ah we need to make another one of those I'm a man of contingency so I have enough ingredients to go again which is who looks at the bottom look I've even got a steady hand Mike lemon drizzle by definition poke holes in it and get a lovely lemon syrup in there syrup made from lemon juice honey and castor sugar there are only two people I have to impress with this cake the person who set the brief the bride Haley and her mother Evers is an 80 cake why the buttercream nine layers they still need buttercream in between them and a little scratching around the outside but we're not just doing vanilla buttercream we're doing vanilla meringue buttercream why it's the best and it's quite special day that needs to set up a little bit before we can use it five hours in and we have nine layers nine layers cooked and cooled now we can Iceland that's all right carrot cake is heavy and that's the top layer so for that to sit on top of this it needs to sit and something's going to support it that's what those little too beautiful half a kilo Jam didn't go very far as it so we have our tears and as per photo Pinterest brief we're kind of scratching up a little bit to smudge it leave a bit of a scratch of buttercream stop touching everything in my body wants to clean this up it's the pump I feel like it needs tidying but as per the brief it's shabby chic tomorrow we'll stack them will put flowers on the berries on I just really hope she likes it I mean don't care about berry but I really hope Amy likes it have you heard about this cake unfortunately I've seen good things but I was thinking Sparta Valentimes have you heard about the cake I've shape a safe high school right it monster creature I'm up screwed up anything yeah Oh if dr. service mention this tonight these rules I was winning that was one of the best cakes I've ever had it's so creamy buttery everywhere was just a layer of new life the carrot cake was really good the victorious part was pretty good the biggest day in my life all guys get better but I can eat I really hate having to phrase him yeah but he did a good job he smashed it it did smash it I was there filming it and it took him eight hours to make that and he had to work with temperamental facilities it was amazing and I think that he deserves a like do you yeah crude as it is I think that you guys should show your appreciation by giving Ben a like on this video only lives for he's actually written about that experience of baking the cake the day before the wedding he's written an article that's on sorted food calm that actually goes into all of the highs and all of the lows is very bra so be prepared make sure you go read that and he's written about also how to include edible flowers in cooking at home yeah without getting poisoned which is you know positive yes for information also make sure you don't miss out on the classic potato salad that we made on YouTube this week comment of the week now this comment is from the inject your doughnuts video from last week and there were multiple comments of the week but there are also multiple comments that were not able to be read out this week in comment of the week because of their crudeness why do you doing it's just because I told you to be quiet you shushed me I did sheesh you yeah but it was just like a an immediate Church not like a forever shush I'm not going to say anything in to you onion shush me okay yeah I know they were sexual in nature and this is a family channel quad and I commented as been saying how did we get through all of that without a single innuendo well Ben everything can be an innuendo if you think long and hard about it I good it took me a second but I've seen what you did there well I think that fridge cam had everything had a sweaty panicky been it had an overarching storyline documenting the highs and lows are preparing a wedding cake the day before a wedding and you as the viewer probably at times thought this isn't going to work out but ultimately there was a positive resolution and it saw the coming together of two of our favorite people in a love that will last forever it's a so pious fridge in an island with others waiting for a punchline", "CXlsFGo2Keo": "Hello, welcome to Leonor's Sweet Creations! Once in a while some people call me and ask why the wedding cake that they've\ndone for the sister or the nephew has collapsed. well every wedding cake or\ntier cakes have a structure inside and that's what I'm going to show you how to\nmake this structure and as well how to make this effect with the cream and now\nto decorate with true flowers. First, I will show you how I've made my Lemon-Mascarpone frosting. For all three cakes I needed six times: 250 gram mascarpone\n125 gram quark or curd cheese 50 grams sugar and lemon extract. Place all ingredients in a bowl and beat them until it gets quite stiff. Cut, fill and\ncover your cakes and place them in the fridge until the frosting sets. Now it's time to prepare and stack our cakes. For that you will need bubble straws or\nwooden dowels. Measure the height of your lower cake by inserting the dowel in\nthat cake right until the bottom. Mark it with an edible pen or a pencil and take it out again so it where that mark is and use this dowel to measure and cut\nfive more dowels with that precise length I always clean my towels with a\nclean humid swab to remove any dirt and the wooden dust from sewing it will\ninsert the six thousand au which will support the upper cake you should\ntherefore mark the size of the upper cake or where it will sit with its\nbaking pan you shouldn't have the dowels too close to the edge of the cake nor\ntoo close to its center every tear is to have a cardboard on the\nbottom that cardboard will sit on top of the dowels and prevent the cake from\nsinking into the lower tier do the same with the middle tier measuring its\nheight as well but this time you will only need to solve for dowels because\nthe cake coming on top is only 15 centimeters or 6 inch diameter with the\nVita frosting hide the end of those dowels finally in order to avoid the\ncake to tilt as well as to stabilize it for transport we'll saw a big dowel the\nsize of the two lower tiers and half of the upper one sharpen one of the ends of\nthat towel turn that side down and insert it very straight precisely in the\nmiddle of the entire cake you will need a hammer so that the dowel goes through\nthe cardboards as well use a piece of a dowel to help pushing that name dowel\nright until the bottom until you feel that it sticks to the cake drum cover\nthe entire cake with a new frosting layer and now I will show you two\noptions for decorating this cake either you smooth the sides of the cake and\nthen while you constantly turn the cake with the tip of a spatula you Mark lines\nall around the sides of the entire cake or you randomly make strokes all over\nthe cake with that spatula to give this other look when you use true flowers you should\nonly use organic flowers which were not sprayed or injected with any poisoning\nchemical moreover you should use flower picks or bubble straws to insert the\nflowers in the cake and avoided some flower fluids to reach the cake and\nchanges its flavor I hope you enjoyed my video and if you have any question or\ndoubt please write me a comment and I will answer your questions I see you\nnext week again bye bye", "7KDXXoIL28Y": "[Music] what's going on guys my name is Jeff Austin is popcorn welcome back to my channel if you've been here already if you're new make sure you subscribe got a lot of different videos on the left and today we're gonna be talking about this little guy this is a live resin cartridge the strain is purple haze and it's from Prime Wellness this is the craziest card I've ever seen you guys it is not like a normal live resin cartridge when I posted this on my snapchat last night there was a lot of confusion from people that didn't know exactly what this is this is a live present our trajactory at this is pure live resin when you look close up to it you can actually see little PACA rocks in there like little diamonds floating around it's basically like the concentrate sugar in a cartridge like nice flavorful intense clouds every time it really tastes like a DAB and it also feels like it's AB you do not need to keep cheeping on this like you do some cartridges it goes a long way since the little rocks in there are so small they should be able to just be consumed right through those coils there might be a little bit left over smoking on my Paquito from cloud products I really like this battery it's a magnetic over ring bottom so you just screw a little overhang into your battery plug it in and you hit it I really just like how small and discreet it is I've had a lot of lab resin cartridges before that say liquid lab resin on it and it's like actually liquid it looks like the same consistency as a normal car but this is totally different this is like something I've never had before when it comes to price it wasn't too bad now when you buy a cartridge no matter what it's gonna be expensive when you're buying it legally to restore there's just a hefty price on in my state cards go for forty to seventy dollars and this one was fifty five so it's actually right in the middle of price I know a lot of people are like shocked at how much I pay for weed sometimes it is extensive but honestly like you have to pay for freedom and I'm an estate that just recently introduced the medical bill so the fact that I'm allowed to legally buy this and consume it like I'll pay the extra money I'm happy to help you'll [ __ ] for those of you who don't know what live resin is it's basically just a concentrate that has an extremely high terpene profile the way that it get to that terpene profile is from the way the plant is cured typically when weed is grown they cut it then they cure it in a room and then let it dry and then they process it with live resin once it's cut they instantly freeze it then that fresh version product gets processed and turned into live resin since the weeds frozen the turkeying profiles are way higher think about freezing a banana if you kept it frozen it wouldn't ripen in the freezer it would stay how it is when you froze it so in that drying and curing process there is some flavor lost in cannabis should still taste good but it just tastes better with live resin because it has all the terpenes yet try different battery freshen unboxing got a break it you know this is the poquito push it's basically the big brother of the poquito definitely larger but what's cool about this one it probably conceals your cartridge so there it's like what is this portable charger what the [ __ ] no it's my cartridge if you can watch my videos for a while you know I love my Terps which is why I'll address is definitely my favorite form of concentrate I just love the flavor you get it really can't be lied resin except if you're talking rosin which is super crazy I've heard of some people doing like rosin karts but they are not cheap and like I wouldn't even consider buying one at the price that they are but these lab resin karts are the [ __ ] move I really like how convenient cartridges are which is why I still buy them but I have to make sure they're high quality ones and I just wish that there was a higher standard for cartridges as a whole like I don't get why it's that rare for me to find sugar and a cartridge like I feel like that should be somewhat easy and common of people to do like ethos incarnate oh yeah the beginners that I didn't order crazy how many people were telling me to like take back this cartridge and like this isn't a normal cartridge and that should be concerned as I'm describing it as a languorous and cartridge I feel like a lot of people just thought it was distillate and honestly guys if your discipline cartridge looks like this do not smoke black resin can have a file you look to it but this look and not like they're two totally different concentrates honestly guys just to warn you no matter what company or buying it from no matter what brand it is if you're buying it this little cartridge it's probably shitty even if it's fire like every company I've ever heard of puts their bottom shelf product in their distillate no matter what it's going to be there trim and they're like worst looking nuts the reason for that is all this tool it looks the same when it process the matter what the butt looks like it's clear and tastes like nothing so then companies add terpenes if you're lucky to the distillate to make it taste better for your enjoyment sometimes they don't even have real turf there's so many random ghetto [ __ ] that's been added into cartridges and that's why all these people are dying because of shitty black-market cartridges like dude these hits are so amazing it tastes so good I hate to be the person to say that even the most top-shelf brands of distillate are shitty but ultimately they are even when I'm smoking into the cartridge I know it's the company's bottom to your product if they added into Italy it just has to be there's no way around it every company has trim every company has dirt product that they have and the company's mentality because they're trying to make money is let's turn it into distillate they like actually hit you in the chest like a bat and you have to really think of breath like and it hits you definitely going through this cart look at a little diamonds whoo if you ever get the opportunity to get ladders and cartridges that actually have some live resin in it go for it there's actually like a lot of liquid ladders and cartridges but this is even better this is like a whole nother step ahead I would love that this became the new standard for cartridges just because it's not only a pleasurable experience for like the casual smoker that likes cartridges but it's also an enjoyable experience for the avid smoker that since all the time because I know a lot of people that just like won't even hit cartridges because they just don't feel like they get them high the people that have known that there was something wrong with these that were just like no I'm not even hitting that because so many people have had shitty cartridges they hand me a cartridge and they're like yeah what do you think and it's just moving faster than a lava lamp and they're just like bro what did what are you doing or you just see the tank big box and they're like no it's legit my boy told me I'm like yeah you hit that over there I'll follow the ambulance for you if you got something out in this video hope you guys are smoking with net let me know what videos you want to see in the future make sure you follow me on snapchat and Instagram and everywhere else to see everything I'm doing I'm only supposed to on snapchat whatever new stuff I get first so especially if you live in PA and you want to see like what new fire stuff is around I'm on it like a [ __ ] so follow me on snapchat pipe underscore porn I'm at popcorn pretty much everywhere else things are about half the car that's impressive pitting about a hit that took I've been cheeping on this all day too I'm gonna be going up to Colorado next week so I'm gonna see how the lab present cartridges are out there pronounced you got a bunch of videos lined up around them out there let me know if there's anything you want to see probably me doing mostly vlogs so keep posting I can't do it I've never really been the big trick guy I'm gonna get to look cool to do babe tricks and I feel like I don't really look cool enough that just feel like a

"[Music] so eating Sandra Lee's here she's gonna show us her white wedding I was good good wine Aaron ah right champagne and grapes yes in with it not something I would put together but it's exactly I had a friend a long long time ago who couldn't afford a big fancy wedding and wedding cakes can cost a fortune thousands of dollars very true this is a wedding cake that you can make for about 20 and it takes in 21 thousand so check it out what that's a regular amount of time to make a cake right but I mean for a wedding cake it's yeah wedding cake so you're gonna do layers you can make as many layers you can make as many layers you can make him any size you want this is a great great you have wedding cupcakes and we already know Wow I bet you guys can start drinking go ahead aim and eating now all right so how do we make this cake okay here we go here this is just white cake mix store-bought white box cake mix what you're gonna put in here is oil okay any kind of oil well I like to use canola remember you don't want it more using egg whites you want to use everything white it's champagne white champagne wedding cake okay there's egg whites no yolks that'll make it yellow okay then you're gonna put in a little bit of water all right but then the rest of it is going to be champagne no expect us again with the champagne does the champagnes gonna make it beautiful and moist and spongy and springy is that because of the bubbles and it's gonna taste amazing just because of the bubbles now if you want to you can use sparkling white grape juice but you know before you could use Prosecco or Prosecco is more affordable than most champagnes so you'll pop that down lock it into place and well the next thing we're gonna talk about making the grapes for my friend's wedding I use champagne grapes which are little teeny tiny grapes but if you can't find that we're gonna use sugared grapes or accosted grapes what you're gonna need is just some egg whites and some grapes normal grapes wash them off and then what I want you to do is take some egg whites and I'm gonna do this I'm gonna demonstrate this on the red because it's easy to see so just come in here and I want you to just kind of based the grapes with the egg oh my gosh I can smell the champagne in this batter I know it can you taste the champagne oh my god no no I mean in the cake can you taste the champagne okay I make beer wedding cake yes if you didn't want champagne absolutely take it out there think about Guinness and spice cake we're left I'm saying it's bubbly because it's the bubbly it's making you could probably put a sprite in there if you let's bring it home family let's bring it all I apologize over to the sugar okay the red grapes what I want you to do after you put the egg whites on them I want you to drizzle on here the sugar now if you just clump the egg whites on here it's not gonna look great so you have to head back back could you just do that with water no they white really kind of is the glue water is just gonna dry out what about modpodge Needham and you wouldn't be edible okay very good there's that and then you wanna you want to let it dry so you can make these as white and sugar if you know on them they're beautiful beautiful so they're just okay yeah they're edible but here's the thing you're making a wedding cake yeah the thing about wedding cakes that I think is so beautiful and fools everybody into paying a lot of money for them is that they always look absolutely perfect and to get that perfect look it's that perfect I'm seeing everything just looks so symmetrical you'll see one tiny even nick in it because I deleted icing in the freezer what yeah yeah and that makes it a little bit soft so I wanted it to be firmer I wanted to set well wait could you please open up that I said pull your hope I think you noticed we had a magical refrigerator freezer exactly Oh put it in the freezer for long so this is store bought ready-made that we then embellish with some flavor you could do vanilla extract if you want you could do champagne extract which you can get this in the craft store it's a thing Wow champagne extract okay man question but how long do you leave in the freezer and at what temperature uh we just had this in well if it gets soft at what temperature at what temp you're right right here's what I like good what I'd like to say to is trying to but it won't get you home three solid it won't freeze solid it won't well yes it will you have to be thoughtful about it about how long about how long you're gonna leave it in there okay now what about putting actual champagne in the icing instead of the extra if you're making it from scratch of course you can do that but this is store bought ready-made runny it'll get a little bit runny and no matter how much you freeze it unless it's frozen solid it will not work okay it's just too wet too moist now we're not gonna finish this whole thing but what we are gonna do is talk about if there's any imperfection right exactly most people are not you know professional cake decorators in getting the icing as always the hard part for me yeah making sure it's all uniform and beautiful and then I just end up having icing all over my fingers and since we already have a green one over there I'm gonna use the red okay and all you do is lay the grapes on just like it's grapes on a coffee table that are those beautiful ones right and you can snip off you can snip off if you want to shoot I'll do it right now the yes please do and so even though they're white we can still eat the grape yeah absolutely yes even though the frostings been in the freezer we can still big and decadent as you want it just depends on what you want to create or as high as you want if you want to tear these apart a little bit and then put them in other places yeah if you have a little kind something want to cover up you can always put your grapes know what our ribbon oh that's beautiful I like that and then you can sugar if it's not triggered enough for the sugar isn't exactly what you wanted and you see a little no but yeah it's beautiful and then you could have the cupcakes for your guests and that would be for with the bride and groom cuts yeah oh and hey I'm here all waiting okay because a lot of time there's a there's a groom's cake right go back to the beer question magnums cake beer a beer cake do a spice cake how great when every that was fantastic and then you just come in here and you can kind of well me let me use the other one when you make the kids cake with sprite yeah ensure that solution or cup and then any kind of ribbon that you want you just kind of spin it around and and decorate the top of it right so this is a very easy way to kind of get a fabulous wedding cake or an avoidable that's or this you have to take off okay no but I bet you could do this with fondant to follow through that I call the fondant so how many days ago was there to - yeah I forget yes that's Gina she never learns words are hard I love that about her words I love that beer", "TX0UsGn0GPc": "Welcome to How To Cook That, I'm Ann\nReardon and today for the Teeny Weeny Challenge - Dasha, Alice, Emily and lots more\nhave asked me to make a miniature wedding cake \ud83c\udf70  To make the vanilla cake\nat first you'll need butter and then some sugar just put that into the bowl\nof your electric mixer and mix it until it's light and fluffy. Put that into a\nbigger bowl ... my stand mixer bowl is a bit too tiny for a big wedding cake. Add in\nthe smallest eggs you've ever seen and whisk that all together. Add in the\npotato starch or you could use cornstarch here and the baking powder ...\nthese little measuring spoons are so cute they're one of my favourite things\nin my mini kitchen ... let me know in the comments what your favorite thing in the\nkitchen is? Then add in the flour and a drop of vanilla and pour in the milk and\nmix that until it's all combined. Dave and I just celebrated our wedding\nanniversary last weekend ... I seriously have the best husband in the world so I\njust want to honor him and thank him for being amazing he is just delightful to\nbe married to  \ud83d\udc95 Now you want to pour your cake mixture into your cake tins and\nlevel that out using your whisk then light your oven ... there's no need to\npreheat it when it's this small it heats up pretty fast. Then add in your cake\ncarefully so you don't drop it and then shut the doors. Do the same thing with a\nsmaller sized round cake ring for our second tier of cake. Then let's run some\nhot water for the dishes ... I always like to clean up between each stage of baking\nand decorating a cake otherwise the mess in the kitchen just gets a bit\noverwhelming and it's a little bit hard and cluttered to work in. It is\ndefinitely a lot easier to clean up in a mini kitchen though than it is in a big\nkitchen when you're making a massive cake. Speaking of cake let's\ncheck that it's smelling like it should be done ... oh wow that looks wonderful! A\nlittle bit bigger and it would have overflowed I think. Now we just need to\nleave that to cool. Run a knife around the edge of the cake ring and then lift\nup the ring  ... perfect look at that. Use a knife to cut each cake into two or three\nlayers and then starting with the bigger cake spreads some strawberry jam (jelly) across\nthe bottom layer then spread on a layer of buttercream.\nNow usually wedding cakes are so big that the weight of the cake holds it\ninto place while you're spreading on your buttercream but this is so tiny\nthat it's sliding on the turntable so I'm having to hold it in place and I'll\njust try and spread that out. The unique challenges of mini baking! Add the next\nlayer on top and spread that with more jam and of course your buttercream and\nthen add the top layer of cake into place. Put some of the buttercream into a\npiping bag and then pipe that around the cake ... I think I needed to use a bit of a\nbigger piping nozzle here but it's a bit hard to tell when they are so teeny tiny small ... oh well it doesn't matter I'll just go around the cake a few more times just to\nmake sure it's covered and we've got some buttercream in all the areas and\nthen you want to do that same thing on the top of the cake going out with the\npiping bag as you spin the cake turntable. Now use your offset spatula to\nsmooth out the top and the sides all the way round so it looks nice and straight\nand if you have any little bit sticking up on the top edges after you've done\nthe sides just gently stroke them in towards the middle. Once you're happy\nwith that place the cake in the fridge so the buttercream can firm up. Roll out\nsome white fondant and if you have a silicon rolling mat they're super\nhelpful for rolling out big pieces of fondant because the fondant doesn't\nstick to it. Place that fondant over the cake ... now I know at first it looks way\ntoo big but fondant is pretty amazing stuff. If you just lift and lower it anywhere that there's a bit that sort of bunched\nup or sticking out it kind of just starts to fit and you just use your\nfingertips to smooth down the sides. Now normally on a normal sized cake you'd\nuse the palm of your hands but that would be way too big in this situation.\nOnce it's smooth all the way around just use your knife to cut away the excess\nfondant. Repeat that with your smaller cake but this time I'm going to use some\nblack fondant. It is such a small cake that the slight curves on the edges make\nit look like it's dome shaped ...to fix that just use two fingers and kind of\npush the fondant together it's a bit like you're pinching it but just really\ngently all the way around the top edge. Take some gold luster dust and a dry\npaintbrush and dust it all over the black fondant so that this tier of cake\nlooks gold. Then use your spatula just get it under there and carefully,\ncarefully lift it up and put it on top of the first tier. Now to make some\nflowers roll five balls of fondant making them progressively smaller and\nthen roll them out flat so that they're slightly overlapping each other. Then\nstarting at the small end roll it up like you're rolling up a scroll of paper.\nThen use the back of your knife to press down in the center and roll it as you do\nso that you can evenly through the center to make two tiny little fondant\nroses. Make lots more of those roses and then add them cascading down the side of\nyour cake. Then take a little bit of food coloring and brush some of the roses to\nmake some of them light pink and some of them a bit of a deeper pink and then use\nyour knife just to add in some little fondant leaves.

I love making cakes for people. I love seeing people happy when they eat something delicious. And I love art as well. Everyone that works at\nthe shop is an artist, and they all have their own special techniques and skills that they do. But to be an artist and to get into this you definitely have to have\nsome kind of baking background. So I do recommend to go to pastry school and learn the fundamentals of baking. This was the best way\nfor me to incorporate art and food together. When is their wedding? (laughs) I think a couple should\nmeet with their baker three to six months in advance. A lot of bakers do book up really fast, so if you're getting married\nduring a really busy time, May or June or October is huge, then I do recommend to come\na lit bit earlier than that. So you have your tasting\nall set, I do recommend to come in with colors, a\nmood board if you have one, and picture of cakes that\nyou've seen that you like. If you have met with your\nflorist that's even better because then if you want\nflorals on your cake, or if you want us to make\nsugar flowers for you then we know the kinds of\nflowers we have to make. But definitely be prepared\nwhen coming in for a tasting, so that you can come out\nwith your dream cake. If you're looking for a\nbaker, I would recommend to take a look at their Instagram page, if they have one, or even their website, just to kinda see their style, and see if your style matches theirs. Definitely check out their cake flavors, that's super important. So check out and see\nif there's any flavors on there that you like. Advice that I would give to a couple that can't decide on a cake flavor is, do two flavors in the cake. We offer two flavors in\ncakes or more flavors, so I would definitely do\na his and hers flavor. That's one way. Another way to choose a flavor is just to maybe choose a universal favorite, such as funfetti or just vanilla vanilla. Just something classic,\nsimple, traditional that you know that everybody will enjoy. Our most popular flavors here are the strawberry shortcake, the red velvet, and the funfetti cake. We do have a fun flavor called \"Gettin' Figgy Wit It\"\nwhich is really awesome. It's a pistachio cake with fig jam and cardamom cream and\nsesame brittle pieces. That one's really unique so we do offer a lot of unique flavors. But usually the traditional\nare the most popular. The best way to save money would be to do a smaller cake out front and a sheet cake in the back. So when choosing a baker check and see if that's an option that they offer, a cake and a sheet cake. Another way to save money is to do a dessert bar or a cupcake tower. Not everybody's gonna eat dessert, and desserts are less\nexpensive than a slice of cake. Another way to save money would be to not have the exact number of servings for all your guests. Not everybody's gonna eat cake, 'cause lets face it, everybody's gonna be drunk at the end of the night. So sometimes people\nforget to eat the cake. And the best way to do it is just to have a dessert table set out\nwith cake slices on there and people can go up there\nand choose cake if they want. And that way you're\nnot serving table-side, and you don't have to\nserve everybody cake. A lot of times people think\nthat faux cakes save money, and sometimes they do if\nyou have a huge wedding. But if you're having a smaller wedding and you wanna faux cake, that's not always gonna save you money,\n'cause it's gonna take the same amount of time for us to make the faux cake as it does the real cake. So I do recommend faux cakes if you have a wedding of, let's\nsay, 200 or more guests and you want something really tall. Also if you want something really tall you can always add styrofoam tiers in between the cake layers\nto give it more height. Questions that couples should ask their baker at their tasting are fees for deliveries or any extra fees outside of cakes, such as delivery, cake stand rental, flower application, extra flavors, if they\ndo more than one flavor, and certain flavors cost more. If you do decide to get your own stand, make sure you share the\npicture of the stand with the baker because\nalotta times the stands are not meant to withhold\nthe weight of a wedding cake. We have seen many a cake\ngo down because of stands that brides get that are\nnot made for wedding cakes. Another question to ask your baker is who places the flowers on the cake. Sometimes the florist\nwill do it at the venue. Sometimes the baker prefers\nto do it at the site, so they would like flowers\nleft for them there. We do flowers at the\nshop or flowers on site, but it's always a good question to ask to find out where the flowers should go. (cheery uptempo music) - No first look. Unplugged. Black attire. Marble.

(cheery music continues)", "BvnPGQSv8EA": "hey guys in this tutorial we're going to create a four tier wedding cake with a safari style theme I'm working on a ten inch round which is the bottom tier it's covered in white paste already and all the steps for this are in the description box below with my airbrush I've added a few drops of black to the blue airbrush color to make it darker and I'm just covering the top and part where down the side then I'm doing the exact same thing with an 8-inch round six inch round and finally a four inch round once all those are done you can empty and clean the gun and then fill it with yellow I've added a tiny drop of orange to it as it can be a little neon looking airbrush all around the bottoms leaving the pale line around the center if you go up and merge them the center will turn green leave these to dry and then start to double the bottom tier I'm using bubble tea straws and have nine for the eight inch cake to sit on next use either ganache melted chocolate or royal icing for your glue carefully stack your eight inch on top and Center it inside the eight inch cake or seven straws on goes the six inch finally five straws for the four inch leave the ganache to firm up then take some black pants or gel I like to use this one it's by Ram bought us and it's a metallic black tip some onto a plate and Walter it down just a little pen to line all around the bottom tier don't worry if it's uneven or shaky it adds to the effect we want a natural ground once that's on we can cover the board if we'd have painted after we might have gotten it on to the past to see a full tutorial on this toilet seat method I'll leave it linked below lots of year are told me it's a game changer since you gave it's a goal then we can airbrush that in the same yellow just point your gun downwards and don't worry it won't affect the Pens trace your choice of animals on to greaseproof paper there are a lots on Google I'd just make up the composition by choosing different sizes such as scaling them down for baby giraffes and having one facing the side on one facing forward just type in giraffe silhouettes and you'll be spoilt for choice to make sure they will fit I cut the paper to the height of the tear and then make sure I trace them nor bigger than that pin this to the cake with acupuncture needles as the bottom black paint is still wet we are going to do the 8 inch trace around your animals in either pencil or a Dresden tool to leave an impression then just fill in the lines with your paint the reason I've painted instead of cutting them out of black paste is that you can get much more detail in the paint such as tiny individual hairs on the tails and more definition on the hooves or faces for the trees stipple and dab the paint on with a larger brush to create a bushy effect on the 6-inch we are tracing deer again two separate images just put side by side and are added in a tree [Music] next up is a wolf that will be howling at the moon have placed them on opposite sides of the tears as I go up to balance the design now the panties dry we can add some elephants as you can see the toiletries are placed either side to balance it or line from here about it a few more animals around the back such as a rhino monkeys under hippo go ahead and add in some rocks uneven terrain flicks of grass bushes and mini trees for the starry sky take some light silver pants and up some to a plate you'll also need a small ball tool dip the ball tool into the pants and dab it all around the blue sky this leaves almost perfect little dots that will vary in size depending on how much panties on it more pants means larger dots and less pants those tiny ones the topper is form core it's lightweight and the couple can keep it I'm drawing around a 5-inch strong for a template and cutting it out with a scalpel this is five millimeters thick foam core which is great for fitting a kebab stick in push the sharp end up inside until it feels secure add another one so it stops it from spinning in the cake to stick the sugar paste on is wise to use piping gel on the open form water doesn't quite do the job water will be fine though for the smooth exterior lay on some white paste smoothy tights and cut off some of the excess flip it over onto a form pad so it doesn't damage the finish and pull up the sides of the sticks of the piping gel trim the overhang flap with a scalpel [Music] with a ball tool marking some moon craters along the top leaving the bottom half smooth to paint on lightly airbrush the top half in sides with black color or dusty if you prefer concentrate on the inside of the craters to deepen them because the moon is all magical and bright add some sugar flour white glitter luster dust [Music] lastly add your animals of choice to the top this bride and groom went with some cute penguins this was the same silhouette flipped and tressed together so it looked like they were holding flippers or wings or whatever penguins have for hands all that's left to do is gently slide the topper in and we're done the painting does take longer than expected but it's great adding all the delicate Tufts of grass for extra detail and interest now all you have to do is keep it away from any splashes of water it's such a striking cake and certainly catches your eye hope you enjoyed this one if you did please hit

baking calm today we're going to make Mexican wedding cakes these are small round shortbread like cookies that contain ground nuts and what makes them really unique is that we roll the still warm cookie in powdered sugar these cookies go by many names besides Mexican wedding cakes they're called butter balls butter not snow dropped snowballs or even Russian tea cakes so we're going to begin by taking two-thirds of a cup about 65 grams of nuts I prefer like a walnut or a pecan and we wanted toast these nuts and I've already I've already done that so what you do is put your nuts on a baking sheet and put them in a 350 degree Fahrenheit which is 180 degrees Celsius oven for about 8 to 10 minutes just until they're brown and you can start to smell the nut and then let them cool completely and then what we're going to do is we need them finely ground now you could do this on a cutting board with a sharp knife but a quicker way is in your food processor if you have one just put the nuts in there and then to prevent them we don't want them if you there is a tendency to over process and then that will make the nuts into a paste which we don't want so to help them not clump together or just take about two tablespoons of your flour from your recipe just put in there and that helps to prevent them turning into a paste and then I'm just going to process this until finally ground okay see they're nicely finely ground you want to make sure they're nice and cool before you do that because warm nuts also have a tendency to turn into a paste fairly quickly so once we have that then with you need two cups of all-purpose flour white all-purpose flour which is about two hundred and sixty grams now we did take two tablespoons out to put in our nuts and then you need just a quarter of a teaspoon of salt and just whisk that together and then if you have a stand mixer like this use your paddle attachment or you could just use a hand mixer for this and what we need is one cup which is 227 grams of butter and this is a shortbread like cookie so you know try to use a lot of the flavor comes from the butter so try to use a good quality butter and have that at your butter at room temperature and then I'm just going to beat this until it's nice creamy and smooth [Music] okay next I'm going to add just a quarter of a cup which is about 30 grams of confectioner sugar you might know that is powdered or icing I don't use a lot of sugar in this cookie dough because we're going to roll the baked cookies in more confectioner sugar I don't like it that's going to be sweet enough for me if you want a sweeter cookie you could opt the sugar to about a half a cup both 60 grams of confectioner's sugar so I'm just going to beat this in until it's like nice and light and fluffy a couple minutes [Music] you just scrape down the sides now I'm just going to beat in one teaspoon of pure vanilla extra I can try to use a pure it's a lot better flavor than the artificial ones [Music] and I'm just going to add our flour mixture in there start this on low speed because you don't want that flour and then up in your face I'm just going to beat that in [Applause] [Music] scrape down the sides here and lastly we'll just add our finely ground nuts you can see it's pretty easy dough to put together I'm just going to beat that in [Music] okay and that's it see pretty easy dough to make short bread dough's are its great thing about them now we are going to chill this because we're going to need a little firm so we can roll it into balls so do is just into Bowl cover that and put an hour I would say pan on your fridge just until we like it's firm enough to roll into small balls so our cookie dough has now been chilled so we're going to roll it into about one inch round balls which is about two and a half centimeters and then put them on a parchment lined baking sheet or you could just butter it or lightly spray it with a cooking spray now you need your oven preheated to 350 degrees Fahrenheit which is about 180 degrees Celsius and when you're rolling the balls you can just use like about a tablespoon around food tablespoon makes about a one-inch ball or you could what I often if you have a scale I often just put on the scale figure out how much a one inch ball weighs and then it's really easy to make these now you want to space them a couple inches about five centimeters apart on your baking sheet okay so you bake these for somewhere between 12 and 15 minutes or what you're looking for is just the edges of the cookies and the bottom of the cookies will be barely tinged with brown hey air cookies are now done as you can see the edges are just barely tinged with brown and the bottoms are just very lightly Brown now we're going to roll them in confectioner sugar you may know that is powdered or icing so what you need to do is take about a cup 120 grams of confectioner's sugar and you want to sift that and you can just sift it into a bowl or I've just done on a piece of parchment paper so you can see what I'm doing here and then while the cookies are still hot we're going to roll them in the sugar so I'm just taking an offset spatula we're going to take like a pancake turner or your bigger spatula and just roll them in the sugar as much you can there and you may have to do this a few times so you can do it now and then let them cool for a bit roll them again and these will store like once they're cooled you can store them in a covered container for several weeks and then what you can do because some of the sugar will dissolve you can reroll them tap that off a bit you can reroll them in sugar again before serving so because some of this obviously when the cookies are very hot like this some of the sugar will dissolve right into the hot cookie so what I usually do is then cool them a bit roll them again another way if you're not you don't like a lot of sugar sometimes I don't I just take a put some of the sugar in a sifter and then just sift it over the top like that that's another way of doing it like so so anyway it's kind of a production line here you can do it either way they kind of just melt-in-your-mouth these cookies so like I said let them cool completely and then store them in a covered container for several weeks so until next time I'm Stephanie Jaworski of joy baking calm

oh hey did aw has given us a very daunting task of doing a cake tasting so excited celebration of our pending nuptials yeah and you have like experience doing this don't should I do I was at one point a host on the Great Canadian baking show advised the Canadian equivalent of the great british baking show i know how to judge okay so here's some of the key ingredients of ingredients of judging a cake i say okay presentation general taste and flavor and also the execution of the bake let's start over here okay I can tell from cutting through this we're dealing with a dense cake he knows what he's doing I also haven't been to the gym in about six years so this could probably explain why this is the right contest for you then so nicely done wow that's an unexpected treat I would feel like the top layer of a cake is the best representation because you get that top layer of icing see I'm not a cake novice I'm going with a nine okay I was gonna say that you're not a five okay but I have very little cake experience so what do we taste I'm gonna say that's a chocolate espresso almond espresso cake chocolate espresso cake baby hey barn - cake number two this has obviously some rose petals on top which i think is a lovely you know and a sort of a rose allure a nod to the to the rose I'm gonna grab this look at the color of this okay I would say this is a rose sponge yep with a Oh two for two for me this is uh this is in the 7.5 range I do love the Rose flavor it's a really unique flavor I was gonna go with the 7 not because I feel like there's gonna be wrong with this cake but I rose as a rose is kind of weird but so I got you why haven't we used this use a knife okay here we go hold on let's look at the presentation it looks like a cake made of crepes live lavender go for it here we go Oh Oh beautiful gorgeous lovely if this is a hazelnut I'm going to scream hmm that is what is that taste an Earl Grey tea yes it is it's a key and a million crepes that is really great how do you know man I love this I'm gonna go with a nine on this bad boy Wow I'm gonna give this a solid eight and a half the execution of this cake from a technical standpoint that is we're seeing an even distribution you know I see you know how good this felt to cut now imagine it on your wedding day well this is the most wedding ring cake that I've seen on the table probably it looks like a coconut topping nicely done oh it looks like there's almost a custard is it varies s T no shade on the cake I don't like lemon but I don't think this is lemon I think it's lime there's why no it's it's a just to me like there's passion no it's a passion fruit yeah I'm gonna give this a seven point seven five I'm giving this a seven and a half the lime and the passion fruit really do a bright thing yeah but it's almost too bright for my taste right that's gonna fall into the just not for me category on a citrus guy if you are into a classic wedding cake this is a beautiful wedding cake okay second-to-last cake here we go some purple is anyone in more of this oh my god you made quick work of that we have a sort of a purple dusting if I were to present this I would call the color violet violet just because I think it sounds more expensive violet with some florets the chocolate ball it's got a chocolate ball on okay here we go look at that yeah that's lavender oh let's get a little more detailed into the texture here I would say for your foodie friends this is a very impressive cake well that's really nice no it has a sophisticated palate I have a child's palate so for me this is way in the opposite direction wow really yeah I am giving this a seven and a half the look of it is beautiful I find the taste really refined I would give this kid a boy but if you want to impress your friends go with this I think it's a very chic look to say I had a lavender cake yeah shows that you go to museums you sound like you've been you travelled places but I'm still he's very much still over here chocolate coffee later okay here we go the final cake I want you to do this cake it feels like there's something in this cake no it's just incredibly moist I'll take the first bite just because why not cuz of course thoughts are you waiting until I yes see this that's a big yes for me oh oh this is more my I think this is my favorite cake so far I'm thinking a either salted caramel yep icing no a dulce de leche I see hmm nope there's no lemon in this olive oil and citrus cake well you can see that's why it's so dense for me this is at least a nine nine five I'm gonna give this a 95 as well it's understated yet robust flavor it's unexpected as it's quite small but packs of very heavy punch does and I think we have a clear winner and I think actually our bookended cakes yep would go great together oh very nice a chocolate for the chocolate lovers yes yeah nice spin of espresso yep and then over here you have a lovely lemon option with an unexpected brown sugar olive oil twist yeah let me say that's more than a lemon cake right there I feel great about all of that this has been an absolute delight for feeding us eww Cheers yes I need another one", "DhbUnn-lfjY": "hi it's ashley from sweet dreams fake shop and i'm sure you clicked on this video because wedding season is now upon us and although we're not having our usual wedding receptions we are still having some smaller gatherings and smaller weddings so the wedding cake still plays a very important role so let's get into it [Music] so for those of you that are a bit more crafty or maybe you're into baking yourself but you're not necessarily an expert baker you might be thinking about making your wedding cake and making your wedding cake is actually not as stressful as you might think it might be so what are the pros of making your wedding cake well of course you are going to be in control of how it looks so you know it's going to look exactly how you want it to look the next pro is obviously that it's going to be way cheaper so what are the cons of diy in your cake well it might not turn out exactly how you want it to turn out and on top of that it is an added stress so if you are doing a lot of other things for your wedding yourself and if you're diying a lot of different elements of your wedding then making sure that you have time for the cake can be a little bit challenging because a cake isn't something that you can make super super in advance especially if your design is a little bit more intricate then you do have to wait until you get a little bit further along closer to your wedding date and i know for myself leading up to my wedding day i was in panic mode and i was doing a lot of different things even with a wedding planner so you want to make sure that you know your limits the next thing you need to consider is your venue are you having an outdoor wedding is it going to be indoors is there going to be air conditioning these are the things that really really matter because if you're having an outdoor wedding and it's going to be quite warm where you are then chances are you don't want to have something like a fully buttercream cake because the buttercream cake does have that ability to start sliding around a little bit or melting off now buttercream for the most part is pretty stabilized but if it's a sweltering hot day there's nothing we can really do to save your cake the other thing that you need to think about as well is do you want this cake on display for the whole night or is it something that you just show for a little small part of your wedding the longer that you want that cake out the more that you need to think about your choices naked cakes not a great choice and the reason for that is because they're sitting out in that open air and they have no protective buttercream covering it's very very thin and very small so chances are once you actually get cutting that cake it's going to be super dry fondant cakes are much much better at protecting your cake so if it's a bit of a warmer venue or if you want to have your cake sitting out for a number of hours then i always suggest that we go with fondant because fondant really helps protect everything really really nicely and your design will hold up a whole lot better [Music] the next thing you need to consider is are you going to even cut your cake are you going to eat your cake are you going to do a cake cutting ceremony what is it that you want to do with your cake not everybody cuts the cake at weddings sometimes people just leave the cake there and it's just kind of a showpiece my favorite way to do a wedding cake is to have everything fake except for the top tier and especially during these times having a fake wedding cake is probably the way to go because you can serve your guests with cupcakes or some other types of desserts and then that top tier is saved just for you and your husband or your wife and that will be the cake that you cut in front of everybody it's also a great keepsake so of course you're going to serve a couple slices maybe to you at the sweetheart table or if you're having a head table you'll serve some to them and then that other half of the cake you can wrap really tightly put it into another container and put it into your freezer for a whole year so that you can have an anniversary cake for that first anniversary outside of this time period i really like the idea of serving my guests cupcakes instead of the actual cake because you're often charged a cape cutting fee at very many different venues i've seen cake cutting fees start at around 50 cents per slice and go all the way up to four dollars a slice so to me that just isn't worth it even if you only have 50 guests four dollars times fifty is still two hundred dollars which is quite a bit just for a serving fee if you're having a more relaxed gathering and you're going to be doing the cake cutting or one of your friends or family members is going to be doing the cake cutting for you that is also a tricky venture because you do have to untie all of the cakes take everything apart and then make sure that you cut things super super evenly so everybody gets a slice which can be a little bit stressful the next thing you need to talk about is your budget so wedding cakes are very expensive in general anytime you veer away from one tiered cakes you're looking upwards of 200 automatically and i would say that in the industry and this is completely my own opinion but in the industry of weddings you're not necessarily charged more just because it's a wedding you're charged more because there does need to be a lot of extra care taken for something that is for somebody's wedding messing up a birthday cake or having a few errors here and there on a birthday cake is probably not as big of a deal as having some errors on a wedding cake that's just the way that i see that i would say the average wedding cake cost is probably around 400 or so and that's not even for something super super elaborate that's probably about a three-tiered cake and maybe messy ice or even naked iced or just a few buttercream decorations here and there now luckily we are in a time period where making wedding cakes look really rustic and kind of a little bit less perfect is super super in which is fantastic because it's easier for the cake decorator to do and it's going to be a lot cheaper for you if you're going into a cake consultation or a wedding cake tasting you need to make sure that you have realistic budgeting if you walk in there and say i don't want to spend more than a hundred dollars then you have to expect that you're getting something really really simple if you're able to up that price from 400 to more like 800 you're probably going to be able to accomplish a lot with your wedding cake that being said with things like pinterest and instagram the cakes that are more fancy and not just sticking florals into a cake are going to be a lot more expensive fun of detailing is going to be more expensive anytime you have sugar flowers that's going to bring the price right up so you just need to have realistic budgeting expectations and expect that yes the decorator is going to probably stay within your budget but it may not be as intricate of work as you might expect and hopefully your cake decorator will be very upfront with you about budgeting [Music] always pay for delivery no matter what the cost is pay for the delivery i know that a 75 delivery fee might seem a little bit over the top which is a fee that i have heard is very very common especially where i live but i am telling you it is a hundred percent worth it and here are my reasons for that number one if your cake is just one tier then you can probably get away with not paying for the delivery fee and having someone pick it up but the chances of wedding cakes being one tier are very small usually they're probably going to be at least two tiers on an average it's going to be three tiers and delivering and picking up a three-tiered cake is very challenging because once that cake is out of the baker's hands there's really nothing that they can do for you if the baker made a cake with a dowel going all the way through but the person that picked up your cake took a turn a little bit too fast and it fell over there's really nothing we can do about that and during wedding season bakers often don't have time to go back and fix your cake especially if it wasn't a mistake that they made and i often find in my experience the person picking up the cake is usually somebody that just wanted to do a nice favor for the couple getting married so they don't really understand that they need to have a certain vehicle to go and pick up the cake and they know very little about picking up a cake and it's also usually somebody that's by themselves i don't know why but they always tend to be by themselves and that can be very very stressful not only that but not a lot of vehicles if you're getting an over-the-top cake can actually fit a five-tiered standard cake it's really really difficult it's a lot of added stress for the driver or the person that is doing you the favor or if it's for yourself and it just leaves more room for imperfection to happen usually when a baker delivers the cake to you they do more than just picking up the cake and giving it to you i know for myself that i would make sure that all the cake tiers were unstacked and i would finish stacking and decorating on site for the most part if it was a cake that was a little bit more simplistic and i knew that things would just stay right put then i would deliver it as is but having a cake decorator deliver your product is really really great because if there are little imperfections or things that happen it's on the baker and it's not on you to fix [Music] realistic expectations now i think in my early adulthood i was very bad at having realistic expectations especially when it came to my vision and visions are so important to have i love vision boards i think it's fantastic to know what you want your wedding to look like but there does need to be some flexibility and sometimes too much importance can be placed on that wedding cake try to remember it is just cake it is just a nice showpiece and it is something that is edible and you really can't keep forever forever so it is of course totally fine to have a vision of what you want it to look like but keeping in mind with budget venue all the things that we've talked about those are all factors that will change the way that your cake will look and plus on your wedding day there's so many things going on that even for myself a cake lover i really didn't notice too much about my cake until way later until i looked at the photos and i said oh i i didn't know that that was on my cake a cake artist is going to try as hard as they can to make your vision come alive but if you don't show up with very specific pictures then it's going to be really really challenging to make sure that it looks exactly how you want it to even if you're a more relaxed person and you are open to different ideas you probably still have a set of parameters that you don't want to go outside of and the most important thing is to remember that everybody's vision of something is very very different so it's best to be specific and it's also a really good idea to look back on their work if you're happy with their work then you can probably pick a cake that's similar and say i want something like this but maybe you want the colors changed maybe you want to mix and match a few different things from their work if you are the type to get disappointed easily by something that doesn't pan out then it's probably best if you choose something that the decorator has already done before that way you kind of know exactly what you're getting i hope those tips help all of you future brides and grooms out there and i want to give a huge congratulations to all of those people getting married this summer i know it's a bit of a different time and maybe not

bowl doesn't have a spigot oh so we're just gonna have a time over here let's pour as much of it the dry ingredients into our wet ingredients about here you are going for eco whoa whoa okay let's mix that up a little bit that I saw that in the air that is giving you the yeah sorry let's do a low-speed like a two so we don't get a huge bigger desk clock well let it mix in a little bit then we'll add the more the dry perfect oh this is looking good just straight in as it's mixing yeah but don't be afraid to make a mess because we already did that I am afraid to make a mess though here we go teamwork teamwork teamwork makes the dream work oh that's good yeah we really did make a mess but it's okay we're having a good time over here oh this is looking good okay the last step we're gonna whisk this into here I'm gonna pour a little bit oh yeah oh sorry okay then we're just gotta know I need to be less cool seat so when we were talking about pouring that on ourselves earlier we we really were gonna do that it really happen I've never gonna have soft leg legs or what ever after oh yeah like cocoa butter lotion this is just just butter butter lotion give me some ASMR noises Sofia like here ready Oh actually it's easier to whisk in I don't know if I'm making any noise while I'm doing this you remember like I just turn it into an ASMR video oh yeah we're just the rest of it yes some are alright so we are done making the batter yep what do we do now we're gonna divide the batter into these three pans these three pans come together boom boom this is the princess baking pan from my row baking line and when you assemble them they make a princess cake dress so we're just gonna eyeball it and try to fill them about a third full doesn't need to be perfect but just try not to bend it in the middle just not right down yeah and it's only greased yeah perfect if I go for it like oh sorry I jacked it up look at you you go for it girl you know how to do this I don't matter in the pan ready I'll switch it up two three go I'm gonna shake it a little make it a little even get those really if I go fast out and things go do better wait wait no you got it you got to take this away from me I'm gonna kill it up painful more really more yeah boy there was a small glob that did go straight down the middle that's okay it's just on the counter it's just off the counter we've got batter in the pans our cakes are ready to bake you're gonna heat the oven to 350 degrees and bake for about 40 minutes and what's cool about these you throw them all in the oven all at the same time and they all bake evenly boom okay so our cakes are baked mm-hmm we've given them some time to cool so what's up next we are going to stack and frost yeah stack those racks yeah stack the racks stack and frost so yeah we've got a turntable hmm and I really like these ones they're kind of weighted a metal turntable they're really slick and they make icing Pro this is amazing yes yes it makes all the difference and so I've got a cake plate here you want to pick whatever you're gonna put your cake on now so whether that's a plate or a cake stands you don't want to transfer these later trust me trust her somebody has done that somebody we won't say who had somebody dropped it many times good all right so we're gonna start stacking so if this is the bottom one place it right here in the middle perfect now we're gonna ice each layer mmm okay so in the piping bag I got some buttercream icing and I've just cut off the tip like this so here's what we're gonna do you're gonna pipe a huge outline whoo look at that and Boman oh it looks so fun generous with your eyesight sure you want to be very generous because you want a beautiful slice when you cut into the cake you want it to go cake icing cake icing you want to see that I said yeah like that I just want to stick my face in that is it a weird impulse it's not I know it kind of has like a breathing hole right here in the middle you could do though you could just write there 24 hours of a cake layers haha oh that was a trending video I'd be in you could do that rose that could be a video for your kid are you can do it okay just take your offset spatula and spread it around and you just really hold it in a place I know I have this merch item of yours this this thing I have I use it to scrape off the lipstick on top of the mold it's so good for everything it's good for everything it's a multi-purpose tool Oh scrapes lipstick and frosting yeah okay girl now second layer place on top try to hit the middle try to line up the circle in the middle because we've got to put the doll in there all right now it's your turn perfect and have you just pipe a big ring you got this here I'll hold your sleeve oh thank you actually that's actually I don't even think you can see me if I really hit down here does this look really cool I can't tell you actually looks kind of superhero bro you're really good at this that holds a little smaller looks kind of bigger just like okay just get rid of that yeah we'll get rid of that all right that should help a little oh that's what I'm talking about I'm still not great at it but it's coming out you just get icing everywhere a girl you go for it you think that icing in there let's load her up I'm gonna put more in even more lighter too much too much yeah you tell me I don't know that's my kind of slice I mean maybe I put too much icing but like maybe not all right last layer oh please it on top and let's see if it's tall enough I wish you were actually a doll and I could buy you at the store I would get one in a second what this gal look the most similar did you give her a haircut yeah I tried to be the same way I love it that seemed like about the right height that's actually me that's actually really good then that's great then I'm excited about it girl we did it I'm sorry the whole thing with icing so I've just got the painting bag and I'm just gonna apply even pressure here at the bottom yes and then just start to spin and just I try to apply even pressure press against the cake boom wait all the way around just start at the bottom work all the way at the top is this a good speed yeah I think so I missed a spot that's okay we can add more we can add more okay then we just do this to the rest of the cake we just work our way up put a lot of icing on because it's easy to take excess off and this doesn't have to look perfect at all because we're covering it with fondant so if you can't ice a smooth cake that's fine because we're covering it so you just take your spatula offset and whoo spin it around we can put this extra right up here on the top that's it girl and when people are making cakes and icing cakes yeah you gotta stand like this you've been a circle cake around and around and you just keep doing it and it will just get smoother and smoother it's actually looking pretty good right now boom that's done all right yeah BAM I didn't actually look at don't worry imagine how scary would be if like there was actually take this big and you were this big Oh Rebekah's Amol oh came over to my house and did this to me really I am not joking I was a life-size princess cake I have to show you this picture I magic it I'm a busy busy camera yes it was so crazy but it wasn't cakes made like foam but she iced the whole thing okay in front of me I've got this piece of large white fondant I've ruled it out using this big fondant roller yes and if you don't want to stick to the service you use a little bit of powdered sugar not flour very important okay so Fiamma needs your help oh we're gonna take this big piece of fondant and we're gonna place it over the princess dress I just put myself down yeah put yourself down this is gonna be a whole thing we're gonna lightly roll it lightly gentle gentle we don't want anything to stick over the rowing Piru you're really you're really just this is happening and then you want to guide me don't do more just like just like line it up kinda or whatever it's only cuz you that good is that like in the middle or whatever I have no idea I think that's good yes we did what's happening same I get terrified every time I do that okay so here's where we gotta be really gentle because we don't work to tear yeah but you're just gonna gently pull very gently but look how cool this is let me spin it around this way so you can see oh yeah how the fondant lays it looks like a dress if you've done a flowy dress if it's too long don't worry about it you can just cut it off scissors work or one of these a cutter yeah it looks like a little pizza cutter you can actually use a pizza cutter if I want pizza thank me name what kind I am usually a mushrooms and olives type gal but I will take any kind of pizza I do artichokes and all ooh yeah that taste I like all the veggies on there it's delicious oh my god this is like literally a sewing pattern oh the top of my dress Wow we've got fondant over the cake yeah we're gonna leave this here and now we're gonna add the doll right in the middle so these are on don't cut out pieces kind of like you were saying what do you what do you call it up it's a sewing pattern yeah it's a mini sewing pattern out of fondant to look like Sofia's dress here that I got you in look at this the sleeves are the same as they are today but these ones are in white these ones are in black look at it it's amazing I'm obsessed with it it looks so great now we did this one in advance because I wanted the fondant to sit overnight because it has fondant since overnight it dries and hardens mmm so we want it to stay here perfect I'm gonna show you how to put this together okay so Sophia get your doll I'm here okay and now we're gonna have to take off all of our clothes yeah this is my favorite part Wow so we've got a little paint brush and a little bowl of water mm-hmm and this really helps the fondant stick to the body so I'm gonna paint you give you small any paint or oh it's cold no sorry about that I'm never gonna place the pieces on I like remains like a weird voodoo doll of me this viewing little voodoo I think I got my fingernail on my boob oops okay let's smooth a little bit we'll cover it up with lace detail we're gonna perfect little things over the top because I wanted to be over the top over the top not bad ro not bad thank you I've heard worse perfect and now let's put on your sleeves these kind of look like bells and they go right on your shoulder like that Oh got it put a little water here this takes a little bit of finagling but we can do it wrap her around cut off the excess okay this is the this feels look look don't look don't look it's fine we'll just leave it I'd I can't I don't want to got me freaked out about looters oh no don't be freaked out about it's okay Shane Dawson came to my house and made a voodoo doll and it's just been sitting downstairs for about two years so we're fine okay and then your sleeve it's kind of a triangle but with a rounded bottom and he cut off the top I don't know what shape this would be a bell about for a bell sleeve yeah and you connect the small part to the small for the elbow and then wrap it around oh we need to cut it off it's a little too big never to do give me as much sleep as you want this is better there we go okay now we're just gonna keep assembling her both arms until it looks like the dress okay take the end of this yeah and you're just gonna poke a hole right in the middle just help to break the tension of the fondant and then we're gonna place your Darwin oh that one got big enough for my thighs I think so all right let's hope when did you squeeze her in there Ouiser in yeah I do every morning mmm work it down work her down homework is that was first she can go I can't tell I think that's it I think I think as far as you can go okay now this is cool see this made this out of fondant oh it's basically a belt that connects the top half of the doll with the dress and you do it at like an angle see it looks like a triangle mmm oh yeah see then yeah and then this does a really nice job so go all the way around connects in the back yeah just press gently against the doll and connect it and if there's excess we could cut it oh wait it just happened yeah you're in your dress oh my god sorry yelling I'm yelling tbh you couldn't finish they can't hear but you know me we're gonna go a little bit extra so you've sent a picture of like the lease mmm and so there's different ways to pie place yes two little squares here that are beautiful Wow but I thought outlined look more Lacy and then we're just gonna put some of these little sprinkles in between each one in these little piping bags I have royal icing and we've got number one tips at the end which is the smallest tip got it and we're just gonna create these little patterns all over the dress all right they're kinda like clouds yeah yeah all

Lorelie and welcome to\nWedding Cakes For You - YouTube.  So this is my spring themed wedding cake, and I did\nthis in collaboration with Rosie's Dessert Spot. So we decided to do a\nspring theme, since spring is right around the corner or actually it's here,\nfinally, and we decided to do a spring theme challenge. So I don't know yet what\nher cake looks like she doesn't know what mine looks like, we just did our what\nwe think of when we think of spring. So I did a basket cake because I think\nbaskets and flowers are to me means spring, And these particular flowers are\nroyal icing. Now I haven't done royal icing in a long time so it was kind of\nfun because, this is actually a small replica of a cake that I did for my\nsister-in-law back in the 80's. So it's kind of a throwback. but I put a\nfew little touches on it that kind of bring it more up to 2018. One of the\nthings I did was I added the white chocolate on the top and that was\nactually Rosie's inspiration. And I in the video I mostly show you how to make\nthe flowers so if you're interested in learning how to make royal icing flowers\non toothpicks so you can just push them into the cake and have this beautiful\nbouquet they're actually quite simple to do so stay tuned\nand I'll see you on the other side. You will need 1 pound of confectionery sugar, (435 grams) 3 egg whites, 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar and a squeeze of lemon juice.\nCrack and separate your eggs and put the whites into a mixing bowl. Add your cream\nof tartar and the sugar and then the squeeze of lemon juice. Mix that with a\nwhisk, scrape down the bowl and beat until it looks like this. Add your coloring. Now this is just a\ntiny bit of pink Wilton gel. Cover the remaining icing with a damp cloth to\nkeep it from drying out. I added another about 1/4 cup confectionery sugar to\nmake the icing stiffer so that the flowers will hold their shape. Here's\nwhat it looks like. This little spring wedding cake is a very small cake, It's a\nnine inch, a six inch, and a four inch. So here's how many flowers I used. I used 18\nDaffodils, nine Daisies, ten Roses, sixteen of the little violet flowers, 38 leaves\nand ten of little violet kind of grape looking things. Then the vines. I did\nabout I believe I did like 50 of those. Maybe more like 30 (I didn't count them) I'm going to start with the Roses this\nis a tip number 103 Wilton. And the Rose begins with a small ribbon\nof icing which I piped directly onto the toothpick. Don't worry if they're not\nperfect because this part you won't see. Put those into styrofoam to dry. For the\nleaves, the flower base, and the stamens color your icing with green. This is\nWilton moss green. Now using a round tip, number 10 Wilton, make a cone shape and\npipe enough of these for the Daffodils and the Daisies. For the fantasy flower\nuse a number 10 round and pipe quarter-inch stamens on the end of the\ntoothpick. Set those aside to dry. Now pipe the leaves onto waxed paper. I'm\nusing a 352,  number 3 52 Wilton. The Daisies are piped onto squares of\nwaxed paper using a flower nail. Use a 102. Start at the center, the thick side\ndown (wide end of the petal tip down) and squeeze as you move the tip up and then back down to form a petal. You want to make sure that you keep\nyour tip at a 45 degree angle for the Daisy. (Wipe the tip on a damp cloth when the icing starts to build up on the tip) These are mini Roses and you can use a\n102 or 103 for these. I pipe the center, three petals, and then five to six petals. I call these fantasy flowers because I\nmade these up. They remind me of a sweet pea. Basically it's three petals around a\ngreen stamen. Some yellow centers finish off the Daisy flowers. And I made these\nup as well with extra purple violet icing. I love the Daffodils, They are so sweet. You\ncan pipe them directly onto the green bases. Now use the number 103 to make 5 petals\nholding your bag at a 45 degree angle. Make sure you have a damp cloth handy\nfor all of your royal icing flower piping. For the center hold the bag at a 90\ndegree angle and squeeze as you turn the base to form a circle. You can go either\ndirection here. A piece of styrofoam can be used to dry\nyour flowers. Technically speaking the Daffodil has 6 petals and stamens in the center. Let your flowers dry for at least a\ncouple of hours and overnight is even better. One more time.  I wanted to show you how to use a toothpick to clean up a mistake. so I messed up the pedal a little bit. The Daisies are glued on with just a little dab of royal icing. The gum paste vines are really easy to\nmake and they make a beautiful accent as well as a filler. All you do is you just\nroll out your gum paste really thin. And I used a green. I used a moss green for\nmine. After you roll it out you cut the strips of various lengths and then you\ntwist them around a pencil or a dowel rod. Then just let them dry overnight\nthat's it. I have a lot of tutorials on putting cakes together so this\nparticular part will be sped up. I will place a link to those videos for you\nthough below in the description box. For the spring wedding cake tutorial I'm\nusing my vanilla cake recipe. And for the filling I'm using my easy buttercream\nrecipe, which is just butter sugar and flavoring. For the outside of the cake however I use my Italian meringue buttercream recipe. Both of those can be\nfound in the links below and if you'd like to get a copy of my Top Five\nButtercream Recipes EBOOK click the link below. to sign up for my newsletter and I'll\nsend you the link to download your free copy. I'm crumb coating the cakes here\nthis is for catching any loose crumbs and also to lock in the moisture. bubble straws or even regular-sized\nstraws can be used to make dowels for your cakes. I like to start by putting\none straw in and then using the frosting mark as a guide to mark and cut the rest\nof the dowels. I then use either coconut or graham cracker crumbs to prevent the\ncardboard of the cake above from sticking. For this tier I simply cut the dowels right in the cake if the cake\nlooks very even I will sometimes do this. SORRY TECHNICAL Audio  ISSUES there. :-( The center dowel is sharpened with a\npencil sharpener and then pushed in from the top to the bottom. An easy way to raise your cakes to eye\nlevel is with a stack of books. For the basket weaving I'm using my IMBC recipe,\nand this is in number 10 round Wilton tip. Use a round tip if you want to\ncreate more of a Nantucket style basket. I prefer that or I also like to use a\nstar tip so star tip makes a really pretty basket weave as well. Pipe a\nvertical line and then horizontal lines across the vertical line. Start by touching the surface of the cake with the decorating tip.  Then begin to squeeze  :-) Keep a steady pressure on the bag until you complete your line to touch the surface once again. I'll show you another angle in a moment and then we'll move on. Here's another angle. Have a sharp knife\nhandy to remove mistakes. I do have a very detailed video on basket-weaving as\nwell so look in the description box for that link. I chose a simple pearl border\nfor the bottom of each cake, with a number 10 Wilton and a ruffle for the\nedging. Ruffle is 104. Alright so I've got my basket weave cake ready to decorate and I\ndid a little experiment in the back here of a bouquet that I'm gonna use around\nthe whole cake. So I'm going to go ahead and do that now and you can watch me\ndecorate it. And then I'll see you on the other side. you I decided to make a little topper out of\nwhite chocolate kind of like Rosie's style. I just saw her tutorial on her feathered\nwhite chocolate shards which was really cool. I didn't have a brush however so I\nused just a spoon and I spread out the white chocolate in a little bit of green\na little bit of white, and then I used a toothpick to kind of create little edges\non there. So I did that with 4 ounces of white chocolate or a 114 grams, and\nthen I used moss green and a little bit of leaf green just to make a really soft\ncolor green. I also made another one with squiggles\njust in case. I made a few pieces just to play around with. When you do place your\npieces on top of the cake do it quickly because you're the heat of your hands\nwill quickly melt that chocolate. And I also use buttercream underneath to kind\nof stick it in so it would stay.

Okay bye... :-)", "Km1hjwVxdi8": "you you hi I'm Alan Tatro with global sugar art we've had a lot of people write in to us and asked if I would do a youtube video on how to make your own wedding cake or how to do a basic wedding cake that beginners could do at home so I prepared this three-tiered cake and for the next 15 or 20 minutes I'm going to run through right from the beginning to the end after you've baked the cake icing it covering it with fondant and using some molds to create some easy and effective decorations this cake is a a 12 a 9 and a 6 inch cake and the 12 and 9 together will feed about a hundred people and this top tier can be kept for the first anniversary you can scale this cake down or up depending on how many people you'd like as long as you keep about 3 inches in difference between your tears you'll be fine so if you wanted to go up to a 16 inch your next one would be maybe a 13 and then maybe a 10 and if you wanted to add a fourth tier you can do that too so it's an easy cake to make I hope you enjoy this tutorial a couple tips I have three other YouTube videos out that would help reinforce what I'm going to teach today one of them I have a DVD or excuse me a YouTube out on how to slice the cake and fill it and ice it I have a youtube on how to cover a cake with fondant and I have a youtube on how to color the gum paste flowers the pre purchase flowers so that you can make them your own design your own colors and you can accent them the way you want I'll be doing all that in this youtube but the other ones will really reinforce and give you even more depth of Education so I hope you enjoy this tutorial begin by using a long serrated knife and cut the top off the cake and use a cardboard to slide under it and remove the excess cake flip the cake over use buttercream icing to create a thin layer in between the two cakes and I've placed the cake on a cake circular or a corrugated cake pad that's the same size as the cake so I have a 12 inch cake and a 12 inch pad need a small portion of fondant into a long rope and this is going to create a dam around the edge of the cake so that you can put a filling in and it won't squish out attach the dam right on the outside edge of the cake and then use whatever type of filling you want on the inside I'm going to use a raspberry and place the next tier right on top of the first one ice the sides in the top with buttercream this only needs to be a thin layer because you're going to be covering it with fondant and you don't have to worry about crumbs make sure you ice right down to the board so it seals the cake in and no air gets in and dries out your cake okay your cake is now ready to cover with fondant the easiest thing to do from here is to place this in the refrigerator for about one hour or in the freezer for about ten or fifteen minutes just so the cake firms up so begin by kneading some white fondant until it's soft and pliable sprinkle your work area with a little bit of confectioner's sugar keep the fondant moving don't don't roll very long before you move it when the fondant gets larger you can actually pull the wet the rolling pin across it rather than rolling and it will start stretching it for you the diameter of the fondant has to be the diameter of the cake plus four inches for each side so I have a twelve inch cake I have to add eight inches to that so I have to have at least 20 inches round of fondant all right use a smoother and smooth the top roll the fondant over your rolling pin very light lightly and then just drape it over the cake begin by mousse smoothing the top very lightly to pull any air bubbles out from underneath and go around the outside edge with your hands to adhere it to the cake and then work your way down open the folds up and just push down and the fondant will stick to the buttercream icing I use the scissors to cut off any excess and then I'll use the knife to trim it I'm just using a smoother on the side make sure that it's stuck to the cake all the way around and then I'll use a spatula or a knife and I'll cut it flush with the bottom of the board I like to use the palm of my hand and just go around the outside edge to make a nice slope make sure it's smooth and smooth the top a little bit and just make sure the sides are all smoothed out if you have an air bubble you can use a little straight pin and push it into the bubble and then the smoother will push the air out through the hole there so we have the 12 inch layer all done and now we'll show you how to stack the cake take another piece of fondant and roll it into a large log put a little sugar down on your work surface I'm going to roll this into a flat piece using a knife or a pastry wheel cut one flat edge and then roll up the fondant very loosely and then place it around the cake unroll it around the cake and bring it right up to the edge of the cake use your smoother to go back and press it down so it goes right up to the board and then we're joined in the back just press it together to make a seam and then just use a spatula or a knife and cut it flush with the edge of the board this gives you a nice finished presentation on the cake we're going to stack the cake next now we have our 12 inch tier has been covered with fondant and it's got the buttercream icing and it's got a filling in between it now we're ready to stack our wedding cake so the first thing I do is I take a look at my my covering of my cake and I decide where is the front of the cake and where is the back of the cake and I just put a little pin a little toothpick right into the foam board to denote the back of the cake now this wedding cake I'm going to offset the tiers rather than putting them right on top of each other symmetrically I'm going to offset it I'm going to bring them all toward the back of the cake so my next tier is 12 10 inch cake so I have a 10 inch circle and I sort of set it on the cake the way I want it to look and then I'll know where approximately I'm going to put my 4 dowel rods the dowel rods are an important part of constructing the cake to make sure that your cake doesn't lean or tip over as it sits so I know exactly where I'm going to put this so I've marked three little holes where I'm going to put the dowels and I've already got a hole ready to go here here's the Polly dowels that we sell that can be cut to the length needed for your cake they come 16 inches and they're very very sturdy but we also make a yellow one that's smaller that we'll use on the top tier so I cut four of them the same height the best thing to cut them is a strong pair of scissors or the easiest thing is a pair of pruning scissors that you would use on small tree branches and just push those right down into the cake and remove my toothpick where I want my dowel I'm going to push it right through the fondant and into the cake and you need at least four under every tear if I was doing a big 18 or 20 inch cake I might use six or eight but four of them will do so those go down and they sit on the bottom board now when I take my ten inch cake and I set that on this cake the pressure of the 10 inch cake won't squash the 12 inch cake below it that'll sit on top of the the dummies and I have my 12 inch cake ready to go we've already covered this one with satin ice or fondant and I know that the back is here and you can see on this cake that I've already got my dowels in and I use the smaller buttercream coloured dowels for the top tier they don't need to be as large for a small tier and I know that this is the back of my cake so I'm going to put a spatula under there and we know where the back of the cake is we're going to set that down just turn that a little bit and you can move it a little bit if you have to now remember when we covered the the cake with fondant it was already sitting on a board the exact same size just a quarter inch cardboard so this 10 inch cake is already sitting on a quarter inch cardboard so now these dowel rods push down and they rest on the quarter inch cardboard in between here that sits on the pillars that are inside this tier which then go down to the bottom tier so the pressure goes from from the dowel to the board to the dowel to the board and there's no pressure on the cake itself and then we're going to put the top tier on can something I didn't do the first time but just to show you can do it if you want if you really want to be sure that that tier sticks once is tier sticks to the other you can put a little bit of buttercream and that will work as a glue now I have my my top tier is ready to go and you can see that that is also on a cardboard and that one is going to go right on the top and again I want it to be toward the back of the cake and now I'll take a look at the front make sure everything's lined up just the way I want it and there you go now these boards on the bottom in this case will be covered with the decoration we're going to do if you didn't want any border on the bottom or if you were going to use a very very tiny border you'd have to make sure that fun that goes right down to your plate that you're working on when you cover it in this case we let the board show a little bit and I'm not worried about that because we're going to be covering it so now the cake is stacked and it's ready to decorate now we're ready to decorate the cake and to make this an easy project and a really beautiful cake we're going to use three different molds to mould the decorations that go on the bottom and on the sides of the cake I'm going to use the Karen Davies Alice lace mold which gives me a nice wide ribbon for the top and a narrower lace ribbon for the for the top tier I'm going to use the Karen Davies pipe Rose mold and I'm going to use that for a bottom border and then I'm going to use the global sugar art Rose border mold also for the bottom just so that we have a small border on the bottom that doesn't overpower the cake so I'll show you how to mold each one of these I'll show you how we apply it to the cake and you'll be ready to make your own wedding cake I'm going to begin with some either gum paste or a mixture of 50 percent gum paste and 50% of fondant and you just need them together the difference is if you use all gum paste it will harden on the cake and as you're cutting it you'll have to cut through it it'll break if you use a 50/50 mixture of fondant and gum paste you'll be able to cut right through it but it stretches a little bit more and it's a little bit harder to work with if you're a beginner in cake decorating so to begin with I'm going to roll out the paste and I'm going to do this smaller border first so I want a piece that's maybe about 1/2 inch in diameter any time you have any leftover just put it in the bag to keep it sealed I've got a little puff with cornstarch and I'm just going to lightly cornstarch that mold and then I'm just going to dump that right out and that way it doesn't really fill the cavities okay this isn't a really large mold so I don't need this rope to be very big I'm just going to follow the contour of the mold alright then have a little bit of Crisco or some sort of a vegetable shortening handy put it on your fingers and just push that into the mold and use both hands what I like to do is I building a little mountain range in the middle but that's exactly what I'm doing I'm pushing it to the outside edge and then pushing any excess up and I'm going to be cutting that Ridge off it makes it easier to cut off if it's all gathered in one place remove any excess so it doesn't have to be perfectly to the edge yet right now my my focus is to get rid of the extra so I'm going to use a palette knife and again a little bit of shortening and this will help cut through that extra fondant gum paste mixture now start in the center of the mold not on the end if you start on the end you'll pull all the product out of the mold so always start in the center and I notice I'm holding the top with my fingers and I'm holding it in place as I cut just follow the little and that's all the excess that will come off and if you're right-handed like I am just turn the mold put a little more shortening and go in the other direction they're put a little bit more shortening I'm not using a lot just enough so that it doesn't stick to my fingers and now I'm pushing it down flush with the edges of the mold and completely filling that in and I have no excess paste to worry about now because I've cut it all off there that's all pushed down I can roll over it to make it nice and even and these will pop right out I don't know if we can get a good close-up shot of that mold you can see the detail if you're not happy with the detail on the mold it's as easy as putting it back in the mold and just pushing it down again with your finger and then you'll be sure you get all the details there we go oops and you'd be able to see all the detail in that mold okay so both of these molds will be done the exact same way the larger lace band and the narrower one and then we're going to attach it to the cake so I'm going to move the cake over to the side here and this little band is going to go on the top tier around the top I like to use a hem marker a lot in cake decorating because it can it can make a mark exactly where I want something to sit on the cake so I'm basically going to measure here and I've decided where I want the top of my decoration to sit and I've already adjusted this little lever right where I want that to be so I'm just going to make a couple very very tiny marks that you'll never see especially once the fondant is over it but this will guide me as to where this has to line up so I'm going to then flip this over and I'm going to wet the back this is just a water brush or you can use a little paintbrush with some water don't make it too wet you just want it damp and that will work like a glue and it will stick this gum paste fondant mixture right to the cake okay now the other important thing is we decided earlier that the back of the cake was where my toothpick was so I'm going to start by decorating the front of the cake so I want this piece to be right square on the front so there'll be no seams in the front of my cake so I know my front is right here and that's where I'm going to start I'm going to put this right up and you can see that it will stick right to the cake and I'm going right up to my little marks there and just gently push it on the cake okay so I have one done now I would make a second one and I would do the same thing around the back and then my top border will be will be in place and then we're going to paralyze it and we're going to do a bottom border okay so I've used the same mold and I've molded the wider bands of lace just like we did the first ones where I cut them flush and I press them down and I unmolded them so these are going to go at the top of the bottom tier to reflect what we did at the top tier so let me use the same method I'm going to use my water brush at the top and then just a little bit on the bottom edge it doesn't take a lot and I know the back of the cake is right back here and here is my front so I want to get that piece right on the front of the cake okay and just press that in place and I've gone ahead and made several of these pieces so that I can do the whole cake now when you when you want to make sure that it's really pressed on you can add a little bit of water and just push the edges in that will help it stick okay we're going to flip this one add some water to this piece and I'll show you how to join two pieces together all right so we're going to start right at this edge I like to make sure that I have a nice square edge to deal with and I'm going to put that right up to that edge there press them in place and then when you get down here you can just use your fingers and pull them together just pinch the top and really from a distance when this wedding cake is sitting on a table at a reception you're not going to notice those joins and almost any wedding cake that has molded pieces on it is going to have these little joins some people will put a little flower or something there to cover but I really don't think it's a distraction at all so that's how the second layer is done and we would go ahead and we would do the back as well so now you have the the top decorations on your top tier and your bottom tier done now we're going to mold the Rose layer for the second one and this is the Karen Davies pipe Rose border this has done the exact same way incidentally if you have trouble unmolding any of these if your fondant is too soft or your gum paste fondant mixture is too soft you can put them in the freezer for maybe five minutes and pop them out and they'll come right out usually if you put a little bit of cornstarch in them first and then dump it out you'll be fine so I just made that long enough to fit put a little shortening on my fingers and again I'm going in from both sides I'm making that little mountain in the middle and then put a little bit of shortening on a palette knife or a or a little sharp paring knife and make sure to hold it as you cut toward yourself I guess that's why I use a palette knife I may have cut myself too many times you see comparing by okay and then just fill that right in there I roll it on the back to make sure it's flat and that way when I put it on the cake it adheres directly to the cake and I've got a nice flat surface and then pop that out and that is now ready to go on the cake and I have some others all made ahead when you make them ahead just put them on a board and put them inside of a large ziploc bag and then they'll stay nice and flexible same process we're going to flip these over add a little bit of water look for the front of my cake which is right here and I'm going to add that border right like that and we're going to go ahead and add a second one and you will notice that she designed these molds so that when you put them end to end they sort of interlock so you actually can't see the join very clever design I really like Karen's products and we'll put the third one on so maybe we'll go in this direction push that right in so it fits under the other one there we go hair how easy is that okay so we now we have our Rose border done and now we're going to move on and we're going to do the bottom border on each of these now we're going to make the border that this is the GSA rose border mold and we're going to mold that for the bottom of this tier and the bottom of the top tier now this is a small mold it's very thin and it's more delicate so this mole will have to be put in the freezer for about five minutes after you you put the paste in it now this time you don't need to cornstarch this at all just again make a little rope of your 50/50 paste or your gum paste put a little shortening on my fingers so I can push that in and again I'm going from both sides and I'm making sure that that's really pushed in well so that the little rose is in that mold get filled out okay make sure there's a little shortening on there and start in the middle and work your way to the outside edge there I'm just going to push all that right and make sure that's all inside the cavity and that's nice and flat now from here I would pop this in the freezer for three to five minutes and then you'll be able to unmold that and they'll look just like this I did a couple ahead of time okay so we'll put that aside now to put these on the cake it's the same process except this time so that I don't have to fiddle with these any more than necessary and chance breaking them even though I could piece them together this time I'm going to start in this front of the cake again and I'm just going to use my water brush and I'm going to brush maybe a quarter to an eighth of an inch of water up the side of the cake it's better to do less and add a little bit more afterwards if you need to and I'm just going to place that right in the front right up against the cake that's my little Rose border and we'll do one here I don't need a whole piece this time guys I want to come right around to the middle of the pack so that's how you would do the Rose border and I would repeat the same exact process for the bottom of this tier so once you have all your borders done then your cake is basically decorated now we just need to paralyze some of these make them pop so to get the the details of the lace mold showing and then we're going to put a bottom ribbon and we're going to add the flowers you", "ONwZHnYFPtU": "hey guys this week we create a kawaii style cute bride and groom topic for a wedding cake or a keepsake I've got a 4 inch drum here this is a UK kick drum which is solid inside another option to use is form core which holds supports quite well I'm covering it in white past stuck down with water smoothing it out and trimming off the overhang AM edging the board in ribbon the one I use is 15 millimeters wide I find it covers the drum under layer of sugar passed quite well just to touch this with either double sided tape or a glue stick [Music] starting with the bride we are going to share per dress from white sugar paste with tile or powder added we want it to keep it ship roll the bottom against the worktop whilst teasing it into a corn chip with your hand or fingers tease the base out at one side for a small dress train keep pulling the pair stop to make it thinner and trim it down so it doesn't get too long with your thumb and middle finger pinch in a waste turning it as you go trim off the top so it leaves a slightly wider chest part above the West add water to the bottom and stick it to one side of the baseboard dump in a cocktail stick and slide it off Center down the dress you want to keep the center clear for the head supports trim the stick down and leave a small part showing for the groom I'm using Renshaw's Navy pest this also has Tyler added and I'm rolling the chunky sausage trimmer piece oats and Mike in a line down the center don't cuts all the way through stand the legs next to the dress and check for size keep in mind he will have shoes to trim the legs down to the desired height with brain pest this is actually modeling chocolate that I just had to hand roll too short sausages have pierced for shoes and attach them underneath the legs stun them next to the dress and insert a cocktail stick down again keeping it to one side and leaving the center clear to keep him more secure gently tuck the cocktail stick down into the drum if it will go trim this roughly to the size of his torso now don't worry you haven't missed a step this is just to show the head size choose a polystyrene ball a little smaller than you want the finished head then takes on flesh paste usually I use a ball the same size for ease but I don't want the head too big instead for this one I'm using a smaller Bowl of piste but it is a tad trickier to cover just tease it up gently to prevent ripping if you find it difficult just use a smaller ball and the same size of piste when she get to the top roll it tightly in your palm to get rid of the creases and joins insert a cocktail stick into the center and then make another one and set them aside for later for the groom's shirt roll a sausage of white also with tile or powder added and trim it to size squeeze the top slightly so it makes it thinner slide this down the stick onto the legs make sure you've given the legs enough time to firm up a bit or you might make him a bit shorter than you'd originally planned I've watered down some black paint so it's a wash of gray Penta V on the front and color the remainder in I'll sort the shape of a tie on the top with a deeper gray and a thinner brush outline the Wescott buttons and the tie you can also add in the shirt color if you don't like to paint you can cut the Westcourt from gray hair since that with the Navy paste roll it out and cut out a rectangle that tape is in slightly at the top dampen the body and wrap it around securing the top close to the body trim off the front of the jacket at an angle the lapel is cut straight down one side with two points at the other finally a tapering down to meet the straight edge make one like this and another as a mirror image for the other side the arm is cut from a thin string of pest and the top cut an angle hold it up to check the size and trim it down again if needed that's better now attach it with water add in one on the other side leaning it ever so slightly away from the body take a small ball of flesh flatten it and attach it to the bottom of the arm with water add a little tile or to some flesh paste and roll a short sausage place this on top of the dress and merge them by stroking the paste downwards for the neck gently tease the top of the paste up into a point our arm is a thin sausage with one end flattened out and then rolled thinner underneath it for a wrist dump in the hand so it will stick to the groom's and carefully maneuver into position trimming the shoulder to fit you the other arm is made in the same way but tilted the handle words carefully lower one head down onto the center of the neck it should be obstruction free before placing the groom's on add a tiny ball of flesh for the neck hair is cut from brain past using a circle cutter a few sizes larger than the Hat wrap the circle around the back putting the circle to the best of the head gather the sides around and tease the excess to the top which can then be trimmed off with scissors with the Dresden tool marking some hair detail to remove the harsh circle line for the fringe roll a piece of paste leaving it larger at one end attach this to the front of the hair merging it into a hair line if it becomes too big give him a haircut very dashing for the bride's dress detail dampen the shoulders and the front of the chest roll small strings of piste and lay them over the shoulders press and dimple the piste with the Dresden tool to flatten it and give it a sort of less effect about smaller pieces heavy on the chest and then phase them out as you go down the dress [Music] dumpin the head ready for hair and tech some pale brown rolling it into long spikes swirl the spikes round with the fingers to curl it a little stick these to the back of the head either side roll out a larger piece and cut out a fair read or ship yep that's the best you're going to get texture it fraying the ends a little bit add this to the head at the height you want and then curve the sides around gathering the rest of the paste on top and cutting it with scissors again with a sausage of past flatten one edge of it thinner and place it across the hairline push the larger end down to merge it and also a blend of the thinner end into the hair roll you dressed until across the top of the hump to create texture all over make some smaller spikes into curls and gather them at the back of the head cover the join with a thin sausage of pest and texture that cut an angle finish it off with two more curl strands at the front with some Rambo dust metallic black pants and a thin pant brush paint on a little small black dots of pairs to create pupils and placing them far apart and law down will create a cute kawaii style effect add some eyelashes with pins and also eyebrows watered down red gel for the bride's lips works well dip a small ball tool into some white pins for dotting on catch lights finally for a blushing bride roll some pale pink into small ovals and flatten them under each eye and we're done Acutes bride and groom

next week", "ZaJc7q5At5k": "welcome back to Frenchie's bakery today I'm going to be showing you all how to make a wedding cake the first thing we are going to do is make our icing so here I am whipping up some cream cheese icing this is going to be a four tiered cake so I'm actually using both of my Kitchen Aid mixers since there is so much icing to be made once your icing is made you can start putting your cake together you want to start by piping a border around each cake layer this will ensure that your filling stays inside I'm filling my cake layers with a raspberry filling my cake is going to be four tiers starting at the bottom with a 10-inch cake and then on top of that an 8-inch cake and then a six inch and a four inch to top it off you want to put a crumb coat on each tier and let it sit in the freezer for about five minutes before putting on your final coat of icing so this is just me filling in the layers and putting on the crumb coat and the final coat [Music] [Music] once you have on the final coat of icing we are then going to move on to the decorations I'm going to start by icing my 6-inch cake layer with a dusty rose color once you have it all smoothed out pop it in the fridge and we will finish this tier later now we will start on our 8-inch cake layer I have a variety of small and medium pearls here take a handful of them and glide them up the cake until the whole tier is covered in pearls before we decorate our bottoms here I would like to stack the 8 inch and 10 inch cake take some smoothie straws and press them straight down into the 10 inch cake layer this will prevent the cake from collapsing we are then going to add our dowel so you're just gonna press the dowel straight into the middle of the 10 inch cake separate your 8-inch cake from its cake board and slide it right through the dowel [Music] now we can decorate the bottom cake layer here I have some white fondant cut out a medium circle and flare out the edges with a fondant press you also can use your finger once it's nice and flat bundle it up so it looks like a ruffled flower and just place it right on the cake this tier took me a long time so just take a seat and watch some Netflix I totally recommend doing this because it really is a very long process [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] back to our dusty rose lair I have a circle cookie cutter here and I'm just using half of it to make an indent towards the top of the cake we're going to drape some pearls down the side of the cake and this will just help guide us [Music] [Music] once all the cake layers are decorated make sure that they are nice and cool from the fridge so you can touch them and we are going to start stacking the cake just glide each tear down the dowel just like that we have a gorgeous wedding cake thank you all so so much for watching I hope you enjoyed this video make sure to LIKE and subscribe and I will see you on the next one have a good received everyone bye [Music]", "JslsMfUBMNE": "now reaction is coming into that major decision from the Supreme Court ruling in favor of a Colorado Baker who refused on religious grounds to make a cake celebrating a same-sex wedding some are protesting a decision and others are cheering it as a victory for religious liberty ABC's Eva Pilgrim is here with the story good morning Eva good morning Michael reaction has been all over the place and pretty heated as you would imagine in the case that involves gay rights and religious freedom some this morning criticizing the Supreme Court saying its decision didn't address the bigger issue and instead chose to have its cake and eat it too we must love a divided nation this morning the Supreme Court ruling in favor of a Colorado Baker who refused to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple because of his religious beliefs this is a religious ceremony that goes in direct conflict with my faith Baker Jack Phillips his case landed at the court after a lower court upheld the Colorado Civil Rights Commission finding he had violated state laws against discrimination by refusing to bake a wedding cake for Charlie Craig and David Mullins in 2012 we don't want other couples to go through the same thing so you know it's not just about us it's about our community as a whole but on Monday the justices voted 7 to 2 in favor of the Baker deciding that he wasn't given a fair hearing and riding the seed of Colorado's ruling exhibited religious hostility against him there's a concurrence by Justice Kagan and Justice Breyer that says if the Colorado Commission had just proceeded differently it still could have ruled in favor of the same-sex couple online the opposition furious as many try to analyze the courts thinking one Twitter user writing is Scott is suddenly suggesting that the First Amendment Trump's LGBTQ rights this morning Craig and Mullins say they are still sorting through their emotions just getting a national dialogue and helping change the public opinion about civil rights laws is a big win for us and just to be clear the Supreme Court did not rule that the cake shop had the right to refuse service to a gay couple the ruling that the Baker was that he didn't have a fair trial and should be punished so they're going to have to come back and look at that subject later is basically they thought the Civil Rights Commission didn't deal with it correct correct even thanks so much hi everyone George Stephanopoulos here thanks for checking out the ABC News youtube channel if you'd like to get more videos show highlights and

cherubs so today's adventure we're starting in the car because i need to go and buy a few bits classic craze because this video popped up and i recommended but this woman turned a convenience store cake into a wedding cake now right number one yes i did do a degree in bakery but the thing is everyone has the different unique talents and all of my friends were excellent at like the sugar flowers the traditional wedding cakes that sort of thing whereas my that wasn't my forte i was all over the product development so you know how like if you're an artist you're not going to be good at maybe you will actually you you probably have will have one strong set of skills so you're not going to be like sculptor drawer painter maybe you are actually maybe that's not a good example you each have your own things now i've never made a wedding cake and i've never wanted to make a wedding cake because i just knew that it would go wrong especially with our oven which is the most unreliable oven ever which would probably burn it then i saw this smells like this this looks like something i could do is it going to be a massive flop or is it going to be a success because hers looked fantastic um and i just wanted to give it a go to be honest with you and also then it could inspire maybe one of you if you because wedding cakes are so expensive so maybe you could make one at home for like a quarter of the price the cake that she used was one that only costco does in england we do not have those like big creamy cakes they normally just um have fondant over the top of it so the only place i can get it from is costco so i'm gonna go to costco first and then get some other bits i'm a bit nervous because this is so not me i don't do fancy cakes is not me i'm a very like i'm a home [Music] baker [Music] i have to say i just went to costco and i'm sorry to the man who checked my receipt i lied um he basically was like oh is it your birthday i said no it's not my birthday he's like oh i was like it's from my friend lie and um he was that are you having a party i suppose you can't can you and i was like yeah just six of us with two gigantic birthday cakes obviously why do i say that i just panicked because i don't want to be i'm turning this into a wedding cake for myself marry me like what am i supposed to say it was so awkward i'm actually coming to as the first so we're seeing if azda has anything i also really want to get macaroons because i saw a picture on pinterest and that's the 5.94 i suppose i could make them but the whole point of this is supposed to be ease so let's see if we can find some [Music] there's no macarons right we have everything and now we're going to go to hobbycraft because they only had christmasy cake boards and we don't want no chris i mean all for a christmas wedding but that's not the vibe right now [Applause] sorry i had a little delivery at the size of this cake it is gigantic now the thing is the design wise they didn't have many they had six cakes left and two of them were chocolate and obviously i don't want a chocolate cake for the vision i have i would obviously pick a chocolate cake my actual wedding cake so we've got this one which obviously the color isn't ideal because it's purple and orange um but the other one had loads of confetti like those little tiny sprinkles on it and then the other one is this one i don't know who you'd get this one for someone who likes music perhaps so the first thing that we need to do is we need to get all the icing off because that's what we're going to use also i feel kind of bad because i feel like i'm actually ruining a perfectly good cake like that is actually a perfectly good cake there's no denying it it's like what you did this for what jasmine i'm doing this for a challenge for myself to prove myself that you know what grace you can do anything you want when you're financially stable do you know what it is weird that we don't really have these cakes in the uk they're not like the most popular ones let's see how easy it comes off we've got a musical note oh you know it actually comes off easier than you think should i put each of the colors then i'm gonna need blue it's not enough blue is it what does it feel like i'm actually gonna save the blue in a completely other separate bar no i don't want the orange the orange is not welcome here it's actually going to take so much longer than i thought oh that was a good run i hope you saw that ready it's kind of fun every now and then you'll just get a pull look at that dingle dangle scarecrow okay this is what it looks like you can kind of see the imprint still now our mission is to try and get all the white icing off obviously there is no way that it's going to stay that crystal white this is so much icing oh my word i mean i would hope that this would be enough to ice the wedding cake this is satisfying i think that this cake is done um so now we're gonna just let it package it back up and we're gonna do the other one now okay now up next we have this one which has real life roses on it it's so annoying they're not in keeping with my color scheme but they might be able to like add a bit of texture i might we might i'm gonna save them basically and try and use them i wonder how long it takes to make just one of these do you know what the amount of videos that i've watched of people doing wedding cake tastings and i'm so jealous can i just do it as a single person can i just like i suppose that would just be cake tasting but it just is different when there's a real reason though [Music] i'm really in the mood to watch miss congeniality oh no how amazing was that clearly that is the method for it okay both cakes are done i'm gonna beat together this blue scenario and see if it's salvageable and able to be used it's more of a turquoise can you see that goodness knows what this color i might use this to sandwich it together because i really don't want to waste all this icing i might make a little bit of chocolate icing and add it to this so then it does just look like brown already it's a brown color okay so i'm gonna go around i have this i think this is a six inch cake board i'm not actually sure because they're all a bit of a muddle and i'm just gonna cut to create a six inch this might be eight inch let's check with the tape measure delivered at hobby craft okay lemonade inch in it that's all right that's all right that's all right it's fine we'll make something work because this was supposed to be wow i'm just really go for it no hesitation here no prisoners i'm just absolutely going for it that's what i love to see no hesitation because when i think about it no now i'm panicking when i've thought about it it's got jamming cream in the middle of it i thought it's just a sponge also that's not going to fit oh this is going from worse to worse thinking thinking thinking i'm just going to cut off this half mark where i went to and then just piece it together okay here we go okay so i'm going to put a little blob of icing on the bottom of the cake board oh my gosh it does smell incredible we bought our chocolate filling okay this is where it could get a bit tricky because i have my one half here i'm just gonna have to cut it off as i go and see how much no bit more it's so bouncy with a little bit of frosting you'll never know i'm just gonna adhere it together with a little bit of frosting in the middle see look at that you wouldn't even know hides a multitude of sins right this is all falling apart this is a disaster i just crumb coated it and i think i've managed to save it and i'm gonna blast it in the freezer because it makes it easier to actually frost it for real now for this cake board i'm going to do a seven incher and but obviously i don't have a cake board because i thought the one i bought was a six incher um but it's all got a bit peaked on it's fine is this six inches oh my gosh that's five and a half let me just do a seven inch one what about this saucer six inches i'm worried about i'm worried that six inches is gonna be too small oh well if it is then this is the learning experience this is exactly why i'm doing it because if you never fail then you'll never succeed because you'll never do the thing that you've always wanted to do and you'll never learn from the mistakes that you make so boom okay we're on to cake number two now and hopefully we have slightly less problems because this is actually going to fit unlike mr other cake okay crumb coat is done as you can tell so i'm going to pop that in the freezer now we're about to prep the flowers whilst those are in the freezer now the funny thing is right i always get vexed really vexed actually when people put unedible flowers on cakes like if you're having a dessert and there's i don't know a rose in there roses are actually edible but if you have like a delphinium or a hydrangea they're not edible and they're poisonous because if you eat that you might die serving food then it should be edible obviously this was a bit different with the wedding cake because you take them off but you do need to make sure that you wrap the stems or you dip them in wax i don't have a pot wax to hand so i'm just gonna have to wrap the stems now basically because with a yucky stuff that's on it and also you just don't i'm sure you don't want to like a plant sticking in your food whereas if you wrap them then i swear okay so i'm just going to do that now obviously they didn't have the macarons so i bought this and i did wear some blue glitter spray to spray on them but i might just keep them white because they didn't have blue candy melts they only had white um so we're going to use those to drip down one side of it i've never done a drip cake before i think i did once but i just it was so i just wasn't vibing it basically okay now we have our awfully iced cake and we're going to try and do a blue gradient i have never done this before so please bear with me also the blue that i've got is awful it it it's getting brighter and brighter i just wanted like a nice navy going into different colors but apparently it didn't want that and also i can't find my cake board anywhere so i'm somehow going to have to just spin it around and i also haven't got enough piping nozzles to do it with the piping nozzle so we're just we're just improvising we're just making it work and that's the key to life improvising this is so bad don't look at me i'm shy don't look at me i'm embarrassed don't look at me i swear we've got to use up this blue from the actual icing so it's gone to a slight green now we have this which is actually a dose gray but it's not one of these proper scrapers i'm just gonna [Music] oh no the cake is moving right this is okay i feel like this is better than i thought it was gonna be and then we need to just neaten up the icing on top because this is really really really messy up here okay you know it is what it is there's uh it's really a lot brighter than i thought but we're gonna make it work this is not wedding cake five this is a three-year-old maybe mermaid party vibes perhaps just gonna put it out there and now i'm just gonna i'm just gonna ice the little one cream so that will take like two seconds just these crumbs that are getting everywhere this is risking me doing this but this is so much better i love this one it's so cute okay i've just melted these candy melts again never worked with these um but basically you're gonna dribble it i'm really nervous because i don't know how this works you just i don't actually go all the way down oh my gosh this is so fun stop here that looks oh my gosh this is my new obsession i wasn't gonna do the whole thing but i'm tempted i want to go the whole way round but i'm not supposed to that wasn't the vision we had grace oh no it's going all the way to the bottom peeking out we're just gonna have to roll with this okay we're just gonna roll this side believe in yourself and then we go the opposite side on this one i wish this was baby blue you know i just put my finger in i don't know i did that i was stupid these are hard to do because they just run on their own free will also i did do some blue luster on here and it actually looks perfect because it kind of fits with the whole like half blue half knot vibe do you know what i mean oh my gosh it's already hard can i pick it off i can no one has to know so now i'm going to pop our downing rods in there um because obviously we've got a cake board and it needs something to seal otherwise it would just collapse so we're gonna do that that's really boring so okay we're going for like the mottled blue um somehow i gotta get these flowers on i don't really [Applause] understand how you do that but we're going to try and make it work obviously we've got this big boy oh but how's it that i don't if this is right you know what do we think i don't think it needs that okay now i'm going to transfer it to a board and neaten it all up a little bit um and i'll see you when that's done it's a fail it's safe to say that it is a fail you know what though i have learned a lot now i want that that should be over there more i've learned a lot i feel like this needs some more flowers hang on there's just a few alterations you know when you see it from a different angle and you're like i'm on a second how's that oh my gosh it looks so bad it looks so bad jesse what do you think it looks like it looks like a wedding cake and a coconut cake coconut yeah if i was to eat it my eyes closed and hoped for a flavor that flavor would hopefully be coconut what the hell that's so weird you know someone's like what flavor is this without smelling without nothing i would guess coconut and you'd enjoy that it's the blue and the white bounty that's what it is do you know i did how i did then put it in the oven put some eggs some flour some sugar costco i made it out of one of those happy birthday cakes do you haven't seen this though it's the icing is everything and the nice um white one with the middle it's actually jam and cream in the middle who's it merry christmas i think it looks like a wedding cake it's awful isn't it i took all the icing off and tried to make into one cake some take these here she is i accidentally put my fingers in it i've eaten pretty much that clay everyone loves the cake everyone says the cake is nice so we're just gonna see what it looks like inside what are you doing lovely i'm gutted about the flowers one of the biggest rules in baking is to not put unedible things on cakes yeah you you tape it you have to tape it i explained that i remember you saying she's going to throw some intrigue how you're going to cut it is it going to be right the way through no you can't physically it would pull out you just can't so i had to put a board i beg to differ all right i want to see you make it then i'd like to see it i wanna see a couple we're down massive giant slides for dad take oh that would be so funny take it i'd like to see it collapse what i'm saying oh savage i did put it together with chocolate frogs bless you it feels like my wedding guys oh what's the chocolate chocolate frosting because there was colored icing so i turned the colored icing into chocolate what do we rate it i haven't tried it yeah do you want to slide yeah everyone enjoyed the cake i hope you enjoyed this video love you all loads anything else you want to see from me comment down below bye", "IHChvxY0xck": "What's up guys welcome to man about cake I'm your host Joshua John Russell and this week the Halloween episodes continue I'm gonna build a five-tiered black cake with black buttercream finished with black crackle fondant and some gold accents Oh a ghost you guys are gonna. Put a ghost there right? yeah. Let's do it. Okay to get started wait Brennan you  don't have anything else superimposed on me. uh no no way. ok awesome so I'm gonna break down this petal pan I actually baked this with black cocoa powder So it's gonna be really dark and I made the buttercream with it so the entire cake will be black and then we'll finish it with black fondant this gives a Sort of like that Oreo kind of taste you can mix it with regular cocoa powder just to get a darker powder Or a darker color. I actually just used full black cocoa powder. It's going to be super dark. new shade. What would you call that shape? It's a petal pan. See it's like a flower which seems like a happy pan, but I baked black cake in it Well the rest of the tiers are going to be round. It'll make super-dramatic on the bottom Joshua you are really Goth. I'm the opposite of Goth actually, I'm like the white boy next door. That's what I am. Who sometimes wears mascara. I'm just kidding. I don't I don't know only on Tuesdays Look how dark that is. We're gonna cut this guy in half all right leave those guys together This one because it's so big I have on the final presentation board we'll just build it on top of here No one's gonna try this new garbage cake We did black cake on a cosmic love that was quite the MIT fool Nate Meant like a taste not a palm full. Tastes so Gothic. All of a sudden, I just want to listen to the cure. Yeah I love the cure. See you, it's so Gothic . its not Gothic. Is it? Josh is God, cant they just be a good band. I'm gonna clean up my crumbs I'm gonna fill this with black buttercream all right. We're gonna fill our cake but because it's a weird shape I'm actually not gonna trim this so we're gonna fill it in crumb coat it at the same time with black buttercream by the way if you want to see how I made the black buttercream it's in the description box below or up there in the i and while you are down there hit subscribe. I can really see the difference the way when you bake this stuff It gets super super black, and then when it's just incorporated into something. It's like more of a really dark brown This is cocoa so it's a real thing It's not like food coloring so your guests will eat this and their mouths won't turn black because it's the real thing And actually tastes really good it kind of tastes like Oreo. If everybody's mouth turned black. They'd be like so goth. Joshua you'd love that your goth Oh my I'm not goth at all Can I make something gothic without being gothic you know that means that defeatist attitude is pretty gothic. oh shut up. you guys are all fired leave the camera. You're not leaving. so we are going to slid next layer on and line them up So to get the definition in the crease here, I'm gonna just take my spatula This is not a spatula it's a scraper put it up in there and then just pull away in opposite directions Keeps that crease Alright, I'm gonna get in into the cooler, and then we'll do the final cut Now we're going to cover our petal pan with black fondant, and I'm actually going to do a crackle technique with this But I have to roll it out a little bit first cornstarch We do not go - no I'm out of snow Fresh snow yeah By the way you guys been posting some really awesome Halloween cakes keep them coming Show me what you got for Halloween take a picture and post it on Instagram and Facebook with the hashtag cake Slayer or #manaboutcake I love looking at cake pictures Alright that feels about good so roll it out to this point and then we're gonna take sugar sheets This is the sheet that you put through your edible printer, and I just airbrushed it like this charcoal gray color But I'm actually gonna cut off this outside edge, so we don't have a seam All right, so we're tearing all of our little sheets into pieces, and we're gonna just decoupage this thing together Did you just say a bad word? Decoupage isn't a bad word okay All right, so we're gonna moisten the fondant where we're gonna place our pieces so lets do one like here I think I'm gonna overlap it a little bit. Okay now we're gonna roll this out Alright, let's put it over our cake it's kind of cool, huh? The cake is covered now. I'm going to airbrush it black so the whole thing is super dark Okay, now my cake is airbrushed, and now we're going to stack them all together with bubble tea straws Now I'm going to use some edible lacquer to make her super shiny I'm going to pipe a dramatic collar around two of the tears the two solid black tears I'm doing this with royal icing that is dying a gold color and the reason why is because normally I would paint My white royal gold, but because it's against a black cake if I miss a spot the white is gonna really really show up Hey if you guys like gothic cakes I have a friend named Sonya McLean who has a Tutorial on how to make black lace. She has a great gothic sort of style We'll put an excerpt from her tutorial in the i or in the description box below Now we're going to make some molded Decorations for the teirs that I didn't pipe on I'm gonna do this with a little bit of gum paste It's in the same color that gold color so when we go to paint them if we miss a spot It's not as easily visible so this is the mold here It's a silicone mold so we're basically going to roll this out and press it in and then we're gonna use this and A little sharp edge here to cut the rest of it away, and then we'll pull it out of the mold This model is actually clear so you could turn around the other side and make sure you don't have any bubbles or make sure you've gotten every little bit of It a little bit, okay I feel like that's pretty good, and now we're gonna roll across and the sharp little edges are gonna. Cut it away So you can already see it here come on guy you're on camera. Let's do it. It freaks me out Are you freaked out? Why?\nBrennan: That's disgusting Brennan's totally freaked out by it sometimes art is gross and it's beautiful. I don't think this is gross I don't know. We're getting gross problem. Cuz it looks like skin color? No look up triptophobia. Yeah Oh, is that the fear of like lots of little holes? Yeah? Oh, yeah, people had that reaction during the octopus cake I apologize but sometimes Art is weird All right, so we'll take our pieces out in the middle here save those for another molds I'm just taking my fingers and pushing in on the paste to make sure we don't have any little hairy pieces all right And they'll pull it out you know upside down and you want to pull it very Very tight this way all the way back. You can use a little paintbrush to make sure areas are sticking see Brandon Freaked out still you should see his face It that's pretty wait till I paint it gold. It's just in a weird color And then we're gonna make a second decoration which is like this one swag pattern But we're gonna use the largest one here, and this one's similar But we're actually gonna just push it down into the mold and then we'll cut the excess away All right, so we're all pushed in I'm just gonna take my knife here. I cut away the excess. Can you use your big knife next time Been hanging out with ijustine have you? Hey, yeah, I justine uses a giant knife for everything I got this tip from her she got it from Crocodile Dundee I'll do the same thing take my paste and pull it away from the edge, and I'll pop this guy out. Oh there it is So now I'm gonna make a ton of these and we'll glue them to our cake and we'll finish everything with gold All right all my molds are cut out and now we're gonna glue them on with piping gel What's this music? Can you see her? For the final touch we're gonna add some gold to our mold and piping my favorite part gold uh Josh this cake isn't actually looking very goth it all it's not Goth it's gothic like a Cathedral like design like an era gothic Brandon you knew that right? What you didn't know You thought it was like the pop culture thing I know it's the old Marilyn Manson Brandon Okay, I'm not just the only dummy here Did you all think that yeah? No, it's for like a like a beautiful gothic like think about a Cathedral yeah I get it now gargoyle and stuff Sorry for making fun of you the whole episode. I know right I was wondering I didn't understand that part at all Our gothic wedding cake is complete, and I think she turned out super duper majestic hey I want to get to know you guys so in the description box below I put together this little question and answer thingy so I get to know who you are keep posting your Halloween pictures with hashtag man about cake or Hashtag cake Slayer because I love looking make cake pictures next week the Halloween shenanigans continue. We're making creepy eyeball flowers. It's gonna be awesome Alright Joshua well in ten nine that's a lot Okay tough here right hmm Before you go too much further. Can you take the bag off? Oh? Yeah, let's tuck that away for later when I'm sad", "NMiRYZrtLXU": "[music playing] The first thing\nthat you're looking for before the bride and\ngroom get there is the cake. I think I had a\nbite of our cake. Not even an official slice. A bite. Maybe Samantha had a bite. I wanted ice cream\nbecause I love ice cream, and it was my wedding. Different flavors were\nat different price points, obviously, and so that sort of\nhelped to make our decision. Go with your heart, and\nalso look at your budget. [laughs] Most couples do not know\ntheir budgets before coming in for a tasting consultation. I guess that's what\nI have my job for, is that I walk\nthem through that. Before we started\nwedding planning, Samantha always had this\nenvision of a 10-tier cake. And I don't like, what? 10-tier? What are you going\nto do with that? She said, I just want\ndifferent flavors. OK, no. The cake should not eat up an\nenormous part of your budget. It's maybe 1% to 2%. Something to\nconsider when you are setting your budget for your\ncake is CPS, Cost Per Slice. It can range from $1\nall the way up to $10 because you can get crazy\nwith the butter cream fillings and the\ndifferent flavors. Obviously, we didn't\nhave a 10-tier cake. It was close enough. We had a five-tier cake and\none additional slice for us for our anniversary. You always want to make sure\nthat you know your season. If you're getting married\nin the heart of summer, don't go with the\ncream cheese frosting. It's going to melt\non your table. You want to make sure that\nyour frosting holds up. That's first and foremost. I didn't realize that\nwith particular icings, like they have to stay\nrefrigerated all the time, and then that would affect\nyour cake being on display for the entire reception. When I go to a wedding,\nI love to see what couples put on top of their cake. I feel like that is\na moment for them to share something personal\nand have some fun with it. I actually had the\nflorist decorate it. I kind of gave\nthem an idea of how I wanted the flowers positioned,\nand it was beautiful. You need to have a cake monitor\nat your wedding, somebody that monitors what kind of\nslices these people are getting at the wedding. Because at the end\nof the wedding, there wasn't much cake left. We had about a slice\nthat was this big. And we shared it. Make sure your caterer\nsaves you a slice of cake so that when you go\nback to the hotel room, you can indulge in that\ngreat tasting cake. A lot of couples like to save\na piece of their wedding cake for their anniversary. I don't really recommend it. We actually did\nsave a good chunk of the top section of the\ncake, and the people who clean our house threw it out. The alternative is actually\nhaving that cake baker make you a fresh\npiece of your wedding cake for your anniversary. That's a way better way to go. Maybe the bakery\nwill provide you with the recipe with\nthe cake that you had, and it might be a really\nfun activity for you and your fiance to go ahead\nand make that cake from scratch on your year anniversary. My big piece of advice\nwhen picking out a cake is keep an open mind. That cake baker, she\nknows what she's doing, and you can trust her to\ncome up with some really awesome flavors that you\nmight not have thought of. We went into our cake\ntasting not being cake lovers, and we came out converts\nto the cake community.", "z55P1zeeXI8": "hey there i'm chef ani so not too long ago some dear friends of mine asked me to make their wedding cake and as you can probably imagine making a wedding cake can be quite an adventure so today i thought i'd take you guys along for the ride so enough talking let's make a wedding cake now this wedding was actually in West Virginia so we were going to need to transport the cake there the plan was to bake the wedding cake in New Hampshire freeze it transport it frozen to West Virginia iced and decorated there and that was the plan at 2:30 in the next morning we packed up the flowers and our cake into our portable freezer packed everything you need plus more to make a wedding cake which I kind of think we went a little overboard on but you never know you could run into the strangest circumstances and then it would be good to have some extra supplies just in case after driving all day we finally arrived at our destination the next evening it was time to start icing the cake we actually had the privilege of staying in a pastor's house and they were the nicest people they were so sweet about it we totally invaded their house and we were like hi could we please make a wedding cake in your kitchen I don't think they had any idea what was coming so the bride and groom asked me to make a semi-naked cake and then decorate the cake with flowers now if you don't know what a semi-naked cake is it's one you cover the cake with icing and then you scrape off most of the I think so parts of the cake is showing 30 and we're starting yes we're starting now beats the icing coming and so on you can keep doing that dad's job is to run errands we haven't seen him for like four hours and the reason for that was that we realized we needed a little more fridge space for this wedding cake so as you can see it's nighttime here beautiful house beautiful view there's the moon then you go to look and Oh what is that they're sitting on these kind people's porch we've been working for about five hours now I'll answer that yes we don't work you're Chaya again she's making a wedding cake I'm doing dishes [Laughter] don't fortune for the night after a few hours of sleep it was the big day of the wedding and it was time to finish the wedding cake so here's the thing when I make a wedding cake I like to put a huge dowel down the center of the cake and the reason for this is that it helps support the cake it keeps all those layers of cake from just sliding around at least that's what it's supposed to do but I find this process to be a little scary because you're literally sticking a stick through your cake I mean so many things could go wrong [Music] oh I prayed through that whole thing but thankfully it went well now all there was left to do was to ice the sheet cakes for the guests and to decorate the wedding day [Music] bounce ahead out so you'll see more in a minute and then we carefully had to drive that cake to where the wedding reception was going to be held [Music] I want to say a special thank you to the bride and groom and their families for asking me to make their wedding cake and I also want to thank my family for their help and support on this cake you guys are the best team I could ever ask for and last but not least I want to thank you for watching this video and for continuing to support me every week and I look forward to seeing you next Wednesday with another video may God richly bless you you", "sU8uGv4zaDs": "hey everyone who lives Marik again with the sugar geek show welcome back to the wedding cake series in this episode I'm going to be teaching you how to put beautiful fresh flowers safely food safely on your wedding cake you don't want to miss this one let's go ahead and get started okay so let's go ahead and start talking about the different types of flowers that you can put onto your cake obviously I'm not a florist and so I just buy my flowers at like you know the grocery store some higher end stores like Whole Foods or no or new season's carry like some really nice flowers so I just went there and picked out a bouquet that was kind of like already put together and it had some big flowers and some little flowers and some greenery and I just sort of separated those out so that you can see them this bouquet cost me six dollars so it wasn't that expensive and not that big of an investment I put them in some water to keep them nice and fresh if you're traveling with flowers then you're gonna want to keep them in water to keep them fresh by wrapping them and maybe a plastic bag and putting them in a bucket with just a little bit of water in the bottom to just keep them from drying out if I am setting up a wedding cake for a client typically the florist provides the flowers for me I never let the florist put the flowers on the cake because they tend to just stab them into the cake and there's a lot of pesticides and chemicals inside flowers to keep them fresh and healthy but it's not good to eat so it's really important they prepare your flowers properly so that you're not eating pesticides and you're not feeding pesticides to anybody else that's not good so to actually make your flowers food safe you don't need a lot of fancy materials I'm using floral tape this just happens to be pink that's what I had on hand but most common color is green to use floral tape well floral tape is something that cake decorators use to cover the the wires of sugar flowers before inserting them into a cake but it works just as well to cover the stems of fresh flowers before inserting them into KEK so this is something I use some scissors to trim down your flowers and some plastic wrap so the first thing I'm going to do is just kind of cut a couple pieces of plastic wrap or you can tear them I'm going to be placing a just a little bouquet of flowers right up here on the top and then a couple of them on the side very common arrangement of flowers that I did many times when I was making cakes for wedding cake clients so I'll show you how I did that first thing you're gonna do is kind of pick your main bunch of flowers take this little fluffy Daisy pick off any leaves and then you're just gonna take a little square of your plastic wrap this is really too big you don't need that much [Music] just maybe three inches by three inches and I'm just gonna place that right around the bottom and what this does is it traps any water from leaking out of the flower into the cake and then I'm going to take some take a minimum take some my florist tape maybe about six or eight inches I'm gonna stretch it to activate it this has wax in it and that's what makes it sticky and then starting at the bottom I'm just gonna wrap it around tightly and just go up up up until this whole stem is covered [Music] and some people you know argue about whether or not fresh flowers can be used on cakes at all because you know they do spray flowers with pesticides as well which could be touching your cake that's true I feel like the risk of you know surface pesticides really getting on your cake is very low but especially since people have been putting fresh flowers on cakes for hundreds of years and nobody has died that I know of but making sure that you don't actually leak pesticides into the cake I think it's valid and it takes some of these roses I think they're really cute you can just kind of hold them up see how they look together when you're thinking about making an arrangement on a cake you want kind of like one big flower a couple of smaller flowers and then some filler flowers so either really small flowers or leaves using the plastic wrap also helps the flowers keep their moisture it's like making a tiny little vase because when all the water stays in the stem instead of leaking out into the cake have some of this seeded eucalyptus very very in right now kind of have that hanging over to the side peel off any long leaves [Music] [Applause] all right so now we can kinda start making our arrangement this little guy will Bend like this just going to put them to the side I'm just gonna have like a flower I'm a couple little smaller roses small filler flowers a [Music] couple little flowers on the other side so main main flower in the middle smaller flowers off to the side and then you can just place these into your cake one at a time or in a group whichever feels most natural to you think I'm gonna go here first [Music] and this little leaf guy right here [Music] a little bit of a hole right there so I'm going to place another flower [Music] a couple of leaves over here kind of balance it out when I would deliver my cakes and I knew that I had to put fresh flowers on them I would give myself an hour to set up the flowers because I didn't want to feel rushed and sometimes it would take an hour probably because I'm a not a florist and I'm slow and then I'm just gonna add one here definitely a smaller bouquet just a little something to help lead your eye around the cake but doesn't overtake it right here beautiful beautiful I think that looks gorgeous okay that's everything you need to know about how to put fresh flowers on your wedding cake so it's food safe if you want more tutorials like this go ahead and hit that

it's billy from sweet styling and this week i am back by myself from riding solo for a normal style sweet styling cake without chow so this one is non-gaming related so the premise for this video last weekend i went on youtube and in my recommended section was a woman called the icing artist i am so mad i didn't know about her before last weekend because i love her so much she's just a bundle of warmth and fun and cake and i just love everything about her and i just want us to be transatlantic best mates the first video of hers i saw was her taking one of their american sheet cakes they get from supermarkets and turning it into a high-end wedding cake i'll link the video below it's fantastic and i was like this is a brilliant idea i need to do a uk version of this because we have different supermarket cakes to what they do i think their sheet cakes actually look really nice that buttercream is very smooth and i want to wipe and lick it however our supermarket cakes this is what we're dealing with so our supermarket cakes are pretty much always iced so they are pretty shameful so i'm going to try and turn these into a high-end wedding cake i'm so excited i can't wait so i'm going to get all these cakes off their boards oh they're so welded oh it's like some sort of sticky substance okay i'm going to peel the icing off whilst we're here how dry this fondant is as well i feel like they stuck this with piping jelly because there is not a drop of buttercream inside oh like this might just lift off because it is barely stuck look at that honestly what is this i've just laid icing over just a dry egg so that's what the laugh wears look at that i can't believe that's peeling away also look at how solid these are i'm quite confident that nothing structurally is gonna happen to this cake how old is this oh we're still going to eat someone to cut it up though ah yuck do you know what i could have got away with two cakes i think do i just do two let's see what three looks like that's a big cake isn't it should i just go for the massive cake more fun isn't it to go for massive cake i'll go to the master cake so what i want to do with this one is just trim this cake down so there's a slight border around the edge of the baseboard so that i can cream coat it in ganache and not have cake poking through because these bits are big i need to try them it was at this moment that she knew she dug none of these cakes are level so i'm gonna pipe a ganache dam around each layer and then fill with a little bit of fresh cream i'm gonna apply a crumb coat of ganache around these cakes now in an attempt to level them out it's like really fun also quite fragile i think because the cake itself is really light it's probably just mainly air and dust that's very low in fat you can have as much dust as you like the next thing was to actually neaten them up these cakes weren't even there was just nothing nice and straight and even about them so my girl the pro froster came out and she saved the day as always nice generous thick layer of ganache around the outside a few scrapey scrapes with the prairie froster absolutely spot on it's just the most satisfying thing to witness and then i wanted to get the cakes with their final coat of ganache so for this i think the ganache right down just by putting in the microwave for a small amount of time it doesn't take very long to melt until it's really liquidy then i spread some of that liquid ganache along an acrylic scraper and smooth that around the cake and if you keep smoothing that around it just ends up with a really nice polish finish once both the cakes had the finish that i wanted i added a little bit of stenciling now just a tiny amount with ganache i just wanted a hint of some more detail on the cake now the next stage was to stack the cakes so i used three straws in the bottom tier and cut those to the right height for this cake i really wanted to use my acrylic separator so i put some ganache on the top of the cake push the acrylic disk onto that and then put some more ganache on top of the acrylic disk and then sat the top tier onto it blooms and fakes dried flowers and palm spheres when i first saw that is my jaw hit the floor as like what are these so the set flowers i got was the cotton candy blooms because i like there was a little hint of pink in there i wanted a bit of color brought into this cake now ordinarily attaching flowers like this to a cake i would tape every single stem no one is eating this cake i cannot stress it enough so i have just gone through and pushed the stems in as this is 100 decorative so when i'm arranging flowers on a cake i'll start with biggest ones first and then i'll work down to the smallest ones and i normally try and go for some sort of s shape and then as a finishing touch i dotted some additional little blossoms around the arrangement this was such a fun challenge to do i can't even comprehend that this was supermarket cakes this morning it's not competing i really hope you enjoyed watching that video as much as i enjoyed making it have a delightful week and i'm sure i'll be back next week i don't know what with yet we shall see it'll be a surprise bye", "n_Jo10rr4Q0": "so guys today I got my third dime odd or cartridge we got some hybrid wedding cake just finished my strawberry Casa TiVo and on to the next alright so starting off no we got wedding cake for Graham [Music] brand-new just picked up last night so no leaks looks perfect all right got it off it up and also the smell I'm getting from this instantly man it smells like vanilla more like a vanilla cake let's try it out Cheers and so the taste instantly tastes like a cake batter I can definitely take some vanilla tastes like cocoa puffs [Music] five out of five on the high and the taste it's not overly sweet perfect", "kma6VvK3sj0": "today I'm going to show you how to personalize a wedding cake you'll be surprised what you can do using a few really simple ideas it's great fun to my first cake is covered with beautiful silk blossom and roses which I've bought from John Lewis I've used two types of icing to glue the decorations on to the cake fondant icing which is from Waitrose is a like a paste that you can just mold in your hands and then you can use as a glue and the royal icing for sticking on the details and I think it's a beautiful centerpiece for any wedding now I'm going to put this cake away and bring my butterfly and ribbon cake which is a very different idea these beautiful ribbons with the butterflies and the feathers from John Lewis and what I would say is that here I have a pic from a specialist cake decorating supplier or readily available online and I have inserted it into the middle of the cake because you really shouldn't push wires directly into a cake now I think that's a really beautiful cake very personal takes no time at all to decorate so I'm going to put that back and now I'm going to show you in more detail how to decorate a cake with sweets and here I have my beautifully iced cake from Waitrose need to order it and it has ribbon already and little polka dots piped all over it waiting to be decorated so I have started off with a really really beautiful ribbon that's a sort of sweetie colors and I've sorted the sweets out because I want a color palette that goes with my ribbon that was my starting point so to begin with I've taken a piece of paper and marked it I'm going to wrap it round the cake this will help me positioning the sweets to make sure that the Garland's that I'm going to create are all the same size so we need to take my ribbon and you'll see the ribbons are all lined up at the back so take it all the way around use the icing and attach the ribbon just simply at the back there like that so using my royal icing I'm going to create some different flowers with the sweets I do like creating designs that are quite organic now it's no coincidence that the green of these little shimmer balls is the same as my ribbon and I'm sticking them on using my royal icing all the way around you can see when I say you need patience you need patience to do this I once I'm happy with that then I will show you how to make it the garland let's see the holes here and then draw using a cocktail stick or my tool my needle tool accurate as you possibly can there we are that's as a guide for where I'm going to sickness fees which is using my royal icing again and the jellybeans and this shows you how useful it is to have drawn those lines as a guide before so that the Garland's will be all more or less the same I think with wedding cakes you don't need to cover every surface of the cake you need to be a little bit more restrained and create something that's that's beautiful so you continue to do that stick the sweets all over your cake until you're happy with it and and here is one that is completed and I think it's very effective I hope that my simple ideas will inspire you to experiment at home use your imagination and I think you'll be surprised at what you can create", "TOqAzMZZCoU": "hey cake errs and bakers welcome to my sugar rush today I'm going to show you how to create this beautiful white on white monogram design so I'm going to draw out some G's I want it to be a little bit modern but also a little fancy I like a little bit of whimsy in my designs okay so maybe I'll do this a couple times so I really like this G I don't even feel like I have to keep going I really like the size here these ones are a little bit small I like how this curves here at the end and then it curves a little bit over here as well and I can add more to it so I'm going to switch over to my marker from here and then I am going to start off by tracing this design now what I'm going to do from here is I'm going to go through and I'm going to thicken some of the lines it's gonna go from thin to thick and back to thin and thick again and it's just going to keep doing that wherever I see fit I think it's pretty good I'm gonna stop at this point and then I'm going to cut out this shape okay now I'm going to cut out these inner circles using an exacto knife now you might want to get a cutting board to cut this on so that you don't damage your table personally I don't mind if I damage this table because I cut on this directly on this table literally all the time and it doesn't really bother me it's my stuff it I don't really care I'm gonna go ahead and cut into this right on that line here's my satin ice to start with I'm going to take CMC powder yes you can use tylose you can use tricking gum however you say that but I'm gonna take CMC powder because I like the texture it gives my fondant more than the other ones and I don't feel like it has like a as much of a yellow tint as everything else it keeps my fondant pretty white and pretty looking so I'm just gonna take some CMC powder and I'm just gonna dip my fondant in there and whatever I pick up I think that's good the more CMC powder you add the faster your fondant is going to dry maybe add just a little bit of Crisco so that it's not try to start with and I'm just going to need all of that CMC powder into my fondant okay so I'm gonna knead it make sure that everything is incorporated okay so all my seams are up here I'm gonna flip it around and I'm gonna roll it between my hands like this and this just pushes all my seams together right here I'm going to squish my piece of fondant just a little bit we're gonna get some starch in here cards start just so much better to work with than powdered sugar don't use powdered sugar to roll out your fondant it's super grainy it leaves an awful texture okay so I'm gonna roll this out now I don't want to roll this too thin if I roll this too thin then you won't catch nice little shadows on your white on white design if you had two different colors going you know maybe the base fondant is a different color and this was white or vice versa then it's gonna stand out a lot better but if you're having like a white on white design you do want your fondant to be a little bit thicker so that it can catch some nice shadowing underneath the letter and I don't know really how to say health then that is it's less than a quarter of an inch but it's not paper thin we don't want this paper then so we have a nice thickness here now if we took our exacto knife and we tried to cut out the shape right away it's going to drag it's not going to cut nice even it's not going to cut nicely into our fondant it tends to kind of drag the fondant with it and it's a little bit more gummy at this point so you don't get nice clean edges so leave this out for about five to ten minutes with that CMC powder in it it'll be ready to cut okay so I have this piece of fondant that's already been out for a while and it's already hardened up just a little bit it's still you know you can still kind of bend it it's it's not completely hardened up but it is enough that we can start cutting it to it so I'm gonna take some Crisco and I'm just going to lightly rub Crisco on top of this fondant now use this method for a lot of different types of decorations and normally I would just apply the Chris go to the back of the parchment paper but this is so thin it'd be a lot harder to rub it all over these really thin line that's why it's sometimes easier to just do it on the piece of fondant so I'm gonna take this and lay it on top of the Crisco and I'm just gently gonna push it all down and you know very very lightly rub your finger over it to make sure that it is it here to the Crisco and I'm just gonna lightly cut some pieces away maybe we'll use this later so this is sticking to the table just a little bit so I'm just gonna lightly dust my table so that I can easily spin it around and cut into it okay so I'm gonna use a nice clean blade same as before and I am just going to cut straight up and down right next to that piece of paper I'm using the paper as a nice little guide to make sure that I don't ruin this shape [Music] so I could try to pick this up apply some water to it and stick it onto my cake but you run the chance of it getting a little bit dis formed in the process and you know maybe it won't stick to the paper as well or the paper just doesn't hold its shape as much you know it's it as you can see like even though the paper does hold its shape you can see it's a little bit easy to manipulate this which can be good but also not really if we're trying to pick it up and hold this delicate little thing and attach it to the side of your cake so to make our job easier we are going to take this nice pretty shape we are gonna take some acetate and you combine these in big sheets or you can buy them in rolls they're used a lot in cake decorating you can also buy them at art supply stores but I have found that they're cheaper and easier to find around Baker supply stores so we're going to take this nice thin piece of plastic and this is going to help us create a sort of stamp transfer so that it's easier to stick to the side of our cake so I've already cut this down to size and you can see it will pick up my entire monogram here so I'm going to take this we're gonna take some Crisco here and I'm going to rub Crisco on this acetate again you don't want big globs of Crisco but you know you want it thick enough that it will be able to pick up your shape I'm going to take this Crisco side I'm going to flip it upside down and I'm going to hold it over my monogram and I'm just gonna gently push down very very gently just so that the Crisco is adhering to that paper so I purposely left the paper on there so it will kind of help hold its shape at this point you can peel it off if you'd like but I'm just gonna leave it on for now and just place the acetate over that it sticks to it nice and I can easily flip it upside down you don't want pools of water you're gonna do this and you're going to gently rub your paintbrush over your fondant and what this does is it kind of rubs the water into the surface of the fondant and it's instead of having pools of water you actually get a nice tacky surface okay so my entire surface is covered in water now so we're gonna take this and finish up our cake what I really like about the acetate is that the acetate is clear so I can see where I'm placing this if you really wanted to you could mark little spots on your cake so that you know for sure that it's centered but I'm pretty good at eyeballing it so I'm just gonna go ahead and stick it on where I see fit you want to make sure you're gently pushing it down so that the backside that's a little bit tacky from that water is actually sticking to your fondant and then you can very carefully go from one side to the other and unpeel the acetate to begin with okay we're gonna peel back the paper ever so gently as well the sharpie left a little bit of a red brezza dew on the fondant it bled through because of how long it was sitting there with the Crisco normally I'd go a lot faster but with the demo it did sit longer than I would have liked it to so that's okay we can clean it up you can take a little bit of alcohol you can take almond extract or lemon extract or you can do straight alcohol like you know you could do Everclear but all I do is I take some clean q-tips I dip it in my alcohol base and we're going to use this to erase any color I don't know if you can see that but there's just a little bit of pink at the end of this q-tip okay so it's really good not to do any cuts at this point it's best to do all the cuts before you add it to the cake but sometimes if I need to clean up a little bit I do have a steady hand so you know it well I don't know I won't ruin it but if you or don't trust yourself so much then maybe do this before you add it on but I am seeing a little bit of gunky parts that didn't have a nice clean cut like I thought I did so I'm just gonna clean it up ever so gently let's say you've done this part and do you really like it but you wish you would have put a shape around it to frame it in so I'm going to add that now after the fact to show you how to do that so I'm going to be doing a circle shape I'm going to take some of this leftover fondant that I cut the other shape out of and I'm going to cut some partial circles real quick [Music] [Music] thanks for watching guys don't forget to hit subscribe for more delicious content coming your way and before you get out of here I want to go check out some of these other videos I", "CSZyoS5q988": "[Music] i'm so excited and i just can't hide it i'm about to lose control and i think i like it [Laughter] don't worry i'm not losing control i'm just happy i'm so excited and i'm thankful to god we are celebrating our 10 years wedding anniversary and to celebrate these i baked a cake i even used our wedding colors blue and yellow welcome back to create with tedx i'm chidima and in this video i'll be showing you how i transformed cheap grocery style cakes into this exquisite wedding style cake i've been seeing this challenge all over the internet and i decided to explore the possibility of doing this it reminds me a bit of the cinderella story where a simple girl was transformed from a seven girl with rags into a beautiful princess i just hope that at the end of this my wedding beautiful wedding cake doesn't get thrown back into the grocery store cakes just like cinderella was transformed at the stroke of midnight that would be weird wouldn't it i'm gonna stop here and get on right to making the cake but before i go please don't forget to subscribe to my channel as it helps me a lot also i'm going to be revealing something that's going to shock you at the end of this video so continue watching till the end and i'll see you at the end i used a total of five cakes from two different stores so the cakes from the first store cost me three pounds 49 each and from the second store the cakes cost me four pounds 90 each so the first thing i'll be doing would be to scrape off this icing i was thinking i was going to be able to use the icing but there were just too many sprinkles in it and i didn't quite like the texture of the icing as well when i had taken off all the icing completely i used a knife with a serrated blade to level the cake because it had a slight dome at the top then i took an 8 inches cake card and rubbed some butter cream on it then placed it on top of the cake next i flipped the cake over and took off the cake board that came with the cake i followed the same scraping and leveling process for all of the five cakes i used before i went on to the next step i used the peanut butter filling for my cakes so here i'm just applying the filling to the first layer and spreading it out i'm using my offset spatula to push it towards the edges of the cake while i move my turntable around after spreading the filling out i'll place my second cake layer on top then i put some filling on top of the cake remember i said at the start i was gonna use five cakes for this um cake so i split one of the cakes into two one half for my bottom tier and one half for my top tier you know how the tears of wedding cakes are usually high i wanted to achieve similar heights for my cakes after spreading out the filling for this layer i attached one of the half switch i spoke about earlier on top of the cake then using my offset spatula i'll smooth in the peanut butter filling and after doing this i'll put the cake in the freezer for 20 to 30 minutes so that the filling can harden before i coat my cake so while the bottom tear is in the freezer i'm going to start working on the top tear although this time while filling the cake i won't let the peanut butter filling get to the edge of the cake because i'm gonna trim this cake down to six inches diameter when i'm done filling similar to the first tier after stacking the cakes i'll place a cake board this time in six inches one on the cake sticking it down with some buttercream using this cake board as a guide i'll carve the cake down to six inches diameter [Music] next i'm going to crop coat my six inches tear so to do this i drew a circle on some parchment paper place the parchment paper pencil side down and then put some buttercream within the circle after that i'll place the cake on top of the buttercream circle like so then using my offset spatula i'll start applying some buttercream to crumb coats the cake [Music] after applying the buttercream i'll use a scraper to scrape off the excess notice that i'm keeping the scraper in one position and letting the turntable do more of the work so i'm just turning the turntable after crumb coating the cake i'm going to put it in the freezer for at least one hour before i do the second coat moving on to the bottom tear i've taken it out of the freezer and i'm gonna crumb coat it just like i did with the top just tier ready [Music] let me be honest i don't know a single thing that i haven't done to make you notice me [Music] let me [Music] it's a shame that my hands start shaking when i was done crumb coating the bottom tear i put it in the freezer for about one hour as well for it to firm up before applying the second coat i've now brought out my top tier from the freezer so i'm applying the second coat of buttercream before applying this buttercream i added a bit of powdered white food color to brighten up the buttercream a bit after applying the second coat of butter cream i put the cake back in the freezer for the coats to harden as well then i took the second tie out of the freezer and applied a second coat of buttercream too but this time i put some yellow food color in the buttercream as you can see i'm applying this buttercream only to half the height of the cake i didn't want an even color for this tear i wanted different shades of yellow so when i finish applying this shade i will apply a lighter yellow to the rest of the cake then i'll smooth in and take off the excess using my scraper [Music] i'll keep doing this until i'm satisfied with how it looks and then i'll put it in the freezer again for about 30 minutes after 30 minutes of it being in the freezer i brought it out place the parchment paper and the board on top of it and then flipped it like so then i removed the parchment paper from the top of the cake and then using light yellow buttercream i covered the top of the cake as well after that i put the cake in the fridge until i was ready to decorate i chose to use artificial flowers to decorate my cake but if you're doing this and you prefer to use fresh flowers you can use those as well so basically what i did was to cut the flowers short and then i'm using some flourish tape to cover them up to make them food safe after preparing my flowers i then started setting up my cakes so i put some fairy lights inside my cake stand i'm going to be putting up a video later on about how i made this cake stand and also the gazebo i used for this cake i placed a 10 inch mirror on my cake stand and then placed my bottom tier on top of the mirror using my offset spatula i'm just cleaning up the base of the cake [Music] next i inserted some wooden dowels in my bottom chair then i marked them took them out and then cut them where i marked them after cutting them to the required height i reinserted them into the bottom tier to serve as my support next i placed an 18 cheesecake card on top of my bottom tier before placing the gazebo on top of it next i brought my top tier from the fridge placed it on the gazebo then i started inserting and arranging the flowers on the cakes [Music] and finally our grocery store cake makeover is done this is the result a beautiful wedding style cake which i would use to celebrate my 20th anniversary [Music] so i says the cost of my cake i contacted the wedding cake bakery and the quotes they gave me was wait for it from 550 pounds so we saved ourselves hundreds of pounds [Applause] thank you very much for watching please don't forget to like this video and subscribe to my

[Music] [Music]", "zqCj6_oD6ls": "hey guys welcome to Christina cakes it I'm Christina and today I'm showing you how to do at DIY wedding [Music] [Applause] so there are a lot of people out there who decide that they want to make their own wedding cake and I've made a handful of wedding cakes myself and I thought it would be a great episode to show you guys exactly the way that I planned them out in the process that I go through to create wedding cakes so this wedding cake is actually for a friend and something that you guys should know is if you watch my channel you already know this but I'm not a professional Baker I'm a hobby baker and I just love it so much that I have really put a lot of time into it my skills have grown another thing is the case that I create whether it's a wedding cake or cake for event they're always for friends or loved ones I don't really take cake orders just from anybody that I don't know at this point I just feel like the cakes are so much more meaningful that way and this wedding cake that I'm going to be creating today is for a friend that is getting married this weekend so before I get started assembling this cake and putting it together there are definitely some things that you guys should know so the first tip would be to definitely start early so you can make a lot of your decorations ahead of time so you can make fondant pieces like a month in advance and if you're using buttercream flowers you can also make foods like a month in advance and freeze them I would definitely start with the little decorations at least a week ahead of time the second tip I'm gonna give you is definitely do it in pieces so bake and freeze the cake layers ahead of time and you can also meet your buttercream frosting up to a week in advance and story in the refrigerator definitely use a simple design and one that you can cover creatively if needed I will say this flowers are a lifesaver they can cover a multitude of a small cake flaws if you are a beginner Baker I would definitely suggest using buttercream filling for your whole cake if you are using like any like fruit fillings or soft fillings they can bulge and you don't want that to happen and buttercream is really stable so I definitely suggest doing that buttercream also chills and sets really firm so it's gonna help make your cake look more or feel more stable and when planning to assemble a cake definitely clear the whole day this key took me a six and a half hours from start to finish from stacking it to the finals creations the next tip would definitely be to always let the cake sit overnight in the fridge to help it firm up especially if your cake is going to be transported and the last tip I have is always make extra buttercream because I always use way more buttercream than I think I'm gonna need so the next thing I want to go through are the many supplies that we are going to need for our wedding cake so obviously cake layers for wedding cakes you definitely have to use a cake drum because it's heavier and it's able to hold more wheats acrylic cake disks these are to make sure that our frosting and edges look really smooth I seem spatulas various frosting scrapers simple syrup to keep our cake layers moist a little bit of royal icing boba tea straws a cake dowel a ton of buttercream icing a cake level and decorations and of course Wilton davin hole to help adhere the decorations alright so to get started assembling lucky I am using a cake drum so as I mentioned you're definitely gonna want to use a cake jump for a wedding cake because it can hold a lot more weight and what I did is I actually marked the exact center of this because when I place my cake layers I want to make sure that they are centered and I'm actually gonna even go a little bit further my cake layers I'm using a double barrel eight inch cake and then I'm going to stack a six inch tier on top so this is an eight inch cake board and I'm putting it in the center and I'm just using an edible marker and I'm just going to mark around this because I want to make sure to place my cake layers in the center of the cake job and this is just gonna wipe away so I'm not worried about it and the cake is probably gonna cover it anyway so I'm just taking a little bit of royal icing and I'm putting this down on my cake John and the reason I'm using royal icing is because this dries hard so it's like a glue and I really want to make sure that my cake doesn't slide around at all like an transport because this case obviously gonna go to the venue so I'm putting a little bit of royal icing down you can use buttercream as well that's totally fine but this just dries a little bit harder I'm going to start with I have my flat layer here or like the flat bottom is gonna go on the bottom of my cake board as I mentioned I already prepared these cakes in advance and we're gonna make sure to link the episode that gives the recipe and exactly how to make this chocolate cake and then I also froze them in advance and I did an episode on that as well so these cakes are already levels I am going to add a simple syrup and this is gonna help keep the cake moist and I do have an episode on simple syrup but it's essentially one part water and one part sugar and you boil it and I boil it for about 5 minutes and this is gonna help keep our cake moist and so I'm just adding it here this is really important for wedding cakes because like the layers are exposed for a little bit more time so they can dry out and there is nothing worse than a dry wedding cake so I'm adding simple syrup here and that's gonna absorb N and I'm gonna fill my cake with chocolate icing and I'm just going to give a nice thick layer here I do want a thick layer of icing I did not torte my cakes what she means cut the layers like in half to make them thinner so I want a good ratio of frosting to cake and I'm using just chocolate buttercream if you're doing a simple wedding cake I definitely recommend using buttercream it's the easiest to work with you can obviously use a filling if you're gonna use a filling you do a buttercream down and add your filling in in the middle of that but this is a simple wedding cake so we're doing all chocolate buttercream anat is what the bride requested so I'm going to continue to fill in stock until I have three layers here so you can see for the second layer I have this smooth underside is now on the top and I'm gonna do the same thing I'm gonna add a layer of simple syrup then we're gonna add our buttercream filling so what I'm doing now is I'm just starting to eyeball my cake and it shifts it at all I'm just moving it over to the center of my cake drum so if it's not level anywhere I'm gonna gently press down in that area so I'm actually gonna use my cake level and there it looks pretty good we're definitely not level here so I'm gonna press down gently in those areas [Music] I'm gonna add a really thin crumb coat of chocolate this is gonna get all covered with white icing so I'm doing now is I'm just filling in all the gaps between the cake layers and a car coat is essential because after it dries well the crumb coat is gonna chop all the crumbs because the first layer of frosting is always messy when you're building a cake that's very normal and after we chill it then the frosting that we put on afterwards looks so much better and you can get it really smooth when I was a new Baker I didn't know anything about a crumb coat and it was with basically a cake dish on a cake disaster and Google that I learned about the crumb coat and then from there on out I've always done one that was like actually for a friend's a bridal shower in 2014 that happens [Music] so I am gonna scrape away my excess frosting even though this is a crumb coat I do want to keep it generally smooth because I'm layering frosting over this so I'm just taking my cake scraper at a 90 degree angle and scraping away the excess so as I mentioned this is gonna be a double barrel cake so what that means is I'm gonna stack a whole other layer cake of chocolate cake the exact same size on top of this so I'm gonna stop here with this one I'm going to put it in the fridge to chill probably for about 45 minutes while I work on this second part of this double barrel as well as my 6-inch tier so now I'm gonna work on the second chocolate cake and I am going to start I have a 10 inch cake cake board and this is not actually gonna go anywhere on the cake it's just while we are assembling it so I'm gonna put just a tiny bit of buttercream icing because the other cake board on top of this is gonna come right off so what I do have is an 8 inch cake Forks I have an 8 inch cake and I'm putting it exactly over the center here and I'm gonna start building my layers and you're also gonna see I did get my turntable and I didn't put it in the opening but it is essential you I don't think you can make a wedding cake like a proper wedding cake without a turntable because it makes the icing process like so much easier so you definitely need a turntable so I'm basically doing the identical process of the last chocolate cake so I'm going to put some royal icing down think of it as a glue I'm gonna put my first layer of cake right on that cake board make sure it's centered at our simple syrup a thick layer of buttercream [Music] so the same thing this cake is gonna go into the fridge to chill for at least 45 minutes so now that we have crumb coated both cakes for our bottom tier I'm gonna work on crumb coating my top tier so this is a six inch cake and as I mentioned I have episodes for both my vanilla and chocolate keep their links below as well as the recipes so same thing as I did with my chocolate cake I have an 8 inch cake for this is not gonna be used on the actual cake but just while we're assembling it so I'm gonna add just a tiny bit of buttercream and I'm gonna stick my 6 inch cake board which just will be on the cake right over that so you can use royal icing or buttercream to adhere our bottom layer to the cake board [Music] and put my kick leader right in the center so kicks when they big they actually shrink a little bit away from the pan and that's why you have like even though this was a six inch cake pan that's why you have a little excess here because it shrinks on our simple syrup [Music] [Music] [Music] all right so now that our six inches chrome coated it is going to join the other layers and the fridge to chill for about 45 minutes all right so my cakes have been chilling and I am ready to add more frosting but since this is a double barrel cake and I want to use my acrylic cake disc I am going to stack these first before I add my second layer frosting so what I'm going to be doing is I am going to add some supports and so I'm using bobotie straws these are really popular you can definitely use wedding cake dowels if you'd like but these were just fine and they're super cheap just get them on Amazon and so what you want to do is you do want to get eye level and actually look for the highest point of your cake we like to think that they're level but I think that's here and the reason being is you want the straws to measure from the highest point of your cake so that when you put your other cake on it the straws are actually supporting the cake and it won't sink so that's the highest point and I'm just going to mark [Music] Lincoln edible marker and I'm just gonna cut right at that mark and what I want to do is I want to cut straws exactly the same size and that's really important so our cake is level so I'm gonna put six straws in my cake and for this because it's supporting an 8 inch cake and I'm just going to insert my cake dowels around my cake Center now I'm just gonna cover these up with some [Music] and simply important to tell forgetting to get to that there are dowels in the cake so they're not surprised when they cut in so the next thing I want to do is I do want to measure exactly in the center of my cake so I'm going to be inserting my wooden dowel and I'm gonna make a mark so I think you probably shouldn't add your frosting right before you put your cake dowel in so I'm going to insert my dowel [Music] and the reason I'm doing this is because I'm going to move this cape right on top of here it's very important that is centered so what I do is I'm going to lift this and I'm finding the hole and my eight inch cake board so I sawed off a cake board under here I'm just going to slide this cake [Music] right over release I'm going to gently press on me feet to be level so I put my double inner layer back in the fridge because it needs to firm up a little bit so well that is chilling I'm going to work on my 6-inch tear so I have a ton of white buttercream here and I'm just gonna put quite a bit on the top and I'm gonna be using my acrylic cactus and you can see that I already attached parchment paper to it that's the exact seeds exact same size as my disc yeah I'm just going to squish this down on my Apes presses I'm just gonna start putting white buttercream all over the sides and the goal is to press up against this disc and it's going to help us get really straight size and this is like hard so it's a guide for us so it's a pre thick layer of white buttercream [Music] and when I have a really thick layer all the way against my cake disk as you can see it winds up here I'm taking my acrylic smoother so you do need a tall one and I'm pressing right up against that cactus and I'm just going to start scraping around you're gonna see that some areas with a little patchy so I'm just gonna add in some more buttercream to those areas [Music] [Applause] [Music] so what I'm happy with the size of this tear what I'm gonna do is I'm actually leaving up my cake just on because this needs to chill before I cut it away and then add some frosting to the top or fix the top a little bit so this is going back to the fridge it's switching with the chocolate layer and I'm gonna work on doing the same thing with the chocolate layer but covering it with white buttercream all right guys I just realized I should not have dialed this yeah that's pretty embarrassing so I'm taking my adult out and I'm going to add my frosting and then put the dowel back in but the hole is already there that's totally fine so sometimes that happens with cake making you make a mistake and sometimes it actually it's a little confusing with filming trying to figure out how to put things on camera so cake tiles coming out so they can put my cake disc on and then reinsert it [Music] so I'm doing the same thing I have my cake disc with my parchment and I'm just putting this on the cake and kind of squishing it down I'm gonna go ahead and start adding all that white frosting just a really thick layer so just like my other cake I'm taking my acrylic tall smear and pressing right against that Keynes's and I'm just gonna start scraping away frosting and eyes are seeing patches you're just gonna go back in and fill them in with icing and the good news is this cake is covered in fondant flowers like a lot of them so if there are any flaws we just cover a flower so I'm just gonna keep smoothing this around until I'm happy adding frosting smoothing it can be a long process so both of my tears have been frosted and smooth and they are ready to stack and you guys can see I did end up leaving a raw edge on the bottom tier so when I was taking the kerlick disc off I was like smoothing it and then I actually liked this look better and then it's kind of nice like it just gives like a more modern look so I end up keeping on raw edge and it's actually easier to so before I stack my top tier I'm gonna dowel it um and also with the center dowel at the right time this time so I'm just gonna use my cake board yes I'm just doing like a rough outline here like very light I just want to know where to place my dowels so a rough outline and if you guys remember three layers down there's another cake board so I'm going to hit that so I'm just gonna place for dowels here and I'm looking for the high point so I just hit my cake board so I'm gonna lift up [Music] and I'm going to cut all of my straws to the same size [Music] and then from here I do want my center dowel so I'm not pressing this cake board I just want to get the center of my cake and I mark that and it's gonna go right through because I already had a dowel here earlier so I'm gonna hit the other hole in the cake board right there perfect so I'm just gonna stick a little bit of royal icing around here it's that glue so what I'm gonna do now is I'm going to take my six inch cake off the 8 inch cake border and where there's a six inch cake board over here so I'm using my cake lifter you know finding that and this is why we chill the cake because we want to make sure we don't mess it up and I'm looking for the hole in the keyboard yeah I'm just going to pop this here whoo it's always the part that makes me the most nervous and I'm just going to lightly press down and before I can finish decorating I want to make sure that this cake is chilled again so I'm gonna put it back in the fridge because I'm putting fondant on here and you get to crust so I put this in the fridge for about 45 minutes or so half an hour 45 minute so my cake has chilled and it's ready to basically finish so this is the fun part I'm gonna add my flowers and I am gonna paint this raw edge with a metallic silver so I'm just using a little bit of luster dust then I'm gonna mix with vodka to make a paint so I'm just mixing it together and making a paint here I'm actually getting on a step stool because I'm not short I can't see the top of my cake so I'm just painting that top edge with the silver this is gonna give it a more modern look and do the same thing around my bottoms here [Music] so after I have that silver edge I'm going to start placing my flowers so I'm gonna paint a little bit of Wilton Devon hold on the back of my roses but because I'm sticking it on this ledge here it should just stick nicely alright so my wedding cake is complete and I will say that this cake actually just came out of the fridge overnight it's actually the next day I always do that because I want the cake to set really firm and then there's always something I just feel like I need to touch up a little bit so I did touch up my silver a little bit and out of the few extra roses I really hope that you guys enjoyed this episode and he learns a lot and it was helpful to you if you did don't forget to give it a thumbs up and subscribe to my channel [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "m0hsqbl7hAI": "all right everybody back again with another heavy hitters these are my go-to now weekend weekend's up being what I choose price point is just right and so is the strength and seemed legit this one this one's wedding cake hybrid and like the gelato I can understand why they get this name from because it legitimately have that taste which is weird like gelato actually tasted it blowing gelato and this wedding cake tastes like you know the normal white frosted wedding cake that's normal at weddings I've seen pictures of the the flower and it was extremely frosty so I guess that's another reason they gave it that name but I can I can taste it and here they're surprising and this is another one where that that snowcap flavor comes out and I'm saying snow can I mean like it's it it's distinct it's like a minty sage kind of flavor that isn't very prevalent but it's there in some cannabis and this one has it right right on the initial taste and then it's more the aftertaste but that like white frosting wedding cake kind of flavor comes in it's really different to have a dessert type of taste come in at the end of a of a rip like that but that's what this one does really interesting let's try it I'll see even there right at the beginning I I still taste that from that white frosting cake flavor and let's say it's more prevalent than the snow cap actually that's just kind of there in the back of them the minty part of it herby flavor yeah it's a really interesting one I've never once again never quite had that bad taste before in cannabis so it's interesting I like it if they calling it they're calling it a hybrid and I would say it's right about middle it might be a little heavier on that it might be a little more of a body high of it this one but not much it's right there in the middle not the longest-lasting it's strong the effects aren't aren't very long-lasting now on this one like likes our D is one that I feel like sticks around or that Strawberry Cough was one not so much it stuck around that one it's just a creeper might be finding a new favorite though because the shop I get these from is not gonna carry him anymore due to a bad batch and they had a bunch that leaked apparently so I'm hoping they get something that's at least at par with these in the same price range because honestly I don't even like the other ones so I would probably just switch to paying more for these somewhere else but you can totally understand it if they don't want to mess with them you know since they leaked but yeah I like them keep yeah but uh yeah we'll make sure to try whatever they replace it with at least we'll make a video that eventually but yeah this one's awesome other than did not be long-lasting that's a good one wouldn't be on the top of my list but I would get it again so wedding cake it's an OG so that's but I'm getting sweaty wedding cake goatee and it's a real sweet tasting one though so that's different oh geez normally are not sweet tasting at all they're more fuelie labored this one is very very sweet so much so they named it wedding cake thanks for watching I hope you guys liked it", "ygavd-fHUM0": "hi guys welcome back to wedding advice buy pink book I'm Melinda and I'm Natalie in today's video we have Nicky from Lionheart Nicky is going to take us through the top ten wedding cake flavors for 2020 and they are all delicious comment down below what was your favorite flavor and most of all enjoy the video and happy planning top ten winning cake flavors winter training [Music] when it comes to choosing your flavors we like to take a approach of working with you to put together something that is unique to your special day we like to work with Swiss meringue buttercream as opposed to American buttercream just because it's really nice and silky smooth and it gives a beautiful finish on the exterior of the cake our cake sponges that we work with are also generally butter based cakes just so that we can construct really tall cakes so that it is in line with the style that we are working towards we have quite a broad spectrum of flavor options for our Brides to choose from working generally from a perspective of cake filling and frosting and then combining those three elements together to make a really beautiful flavor profile that's you will love and always remember Lemon Poppyseed pan cake filled with a white chocolate ganache and a basil Swiss meringue buttercream you'll see the filling on the inside and this is how we construct our tasters for our customers with the cake and the filling and the frosting on top so the lemon poppy is quite a standard flavor with the white chocolate ganache but the edge on the entire flavor profile is brought through by the Basil's whispering buttercream which is quite unassuming but really comes to the fore at the end of the flavor journey the kind of bride that would like this is somebody that's like something a little bit different vanilla cake folds with whoops lemon curd and topped with vanilla Swiss meringue buttercream this is perfect for those that don't want to go to tarts and just have a nice fruity edge to their flavor profile carrot cake filled with a cream cheese filling and topped with a vanilla Swiss meringue buttercream this carrot cake flavor combination is perfect for a general all-round crowd pleaser here we've got a chocolate and vanilla marble cake filled with dark chocolate ganache and topped with burnt butters force meringue buttercream with this cake being a vanilla and chocolate marble cake it's the perfect balance of the two rounded off beautifully by the caramelized flavor of the burnt butters Swiss meringue buttercream blueberry buttermilk cake filled with a lemon curd and topped with thyme Swiss meringue buttercream another one for the adventurous bride that loves her herby flavors the combination of the lemon curd with the time in the Swiss meringue buttercream is really unassuming and is a great while factor to surprise your guests with a buttermilk cake filled with a creme caramel and topped with espresso Swiss meringue buttercream it's perfect for the coffee loving couple a buttermilk sponge is one of two vanilla flavors that we have on offer the buttermilk being slightly more caramelized in a little bit sweeter and it's a really beautifully moist Spanish red Velvets cake filled with a cream cheese filling and a vanilla Swiss meringue buttercream it's quite a typical flavor profile the red velvet cake is perfect for brides that want to go a little bit more traditional because this is one of our very few oil-based sponges we wouldn't make an entire wedding cake out of this red velvet cake we will only allow our Brides to use it for the very top tier of their cake and not to go too tall just because the structural integrity of an oil-based sponge is not that of a butter base sponge and we like to avoid any dramas on the day of cakes potentially falling over threesome free pistachio carrot cake filled with a whipped raspberry curd and topped with rose Swiss meringue buttercream thus gluten free pistachio carrot cake is the perfect option for those that don't want to have gluten in their wedding cake and it is paired with the rose and raspberry filling a really really alternative flavor that your guests will be sure to enjoy raspberry buttermilk cake filled with a white chocolate ganache and a raspberry coulis wall topped with raspberry Swiss meringue buttercream this is for a real girly girl loves pink and into her fruits this cake combination packs a fruity punch and is perfect to complement any chocolatey desserts that you may be serving with your wedding as opposed to just having your wedding cake as dessert dark chocolate mud cake filled with a dark chocolate ganache and caramel swirl topped with Swiss meringue buttercream this is truly death by chocolate and definitely what the chocolate lover is going to go for this flavor combination is super decadent and I always say that if you're going to have coffee on your day for your guests to have just before they leave this is the perfect combination to have

"X8dTRP_FTas": "[Applause] [Laughter] i don't understand why you felt the need to do that because um today we are baking a cake i also don't know what that has to do with country panda chest bumping me kung fu panda makes food we make cake equals food we're making our wedding cake today so in today's video we have um a creative idea it's about 10 pm and we just got in the baking mood you know like you know those midnight baking moods so we have boxes of betty cronker here to help us out um and we're gonna make a cake saw you right now i've got some super moist and i've got some yellow recipes also comment down below if you hate the word moist i've heard that's a thing moist okay ready we're gonna do some super cool editing tricks then when we smash it together the cake's gonna be done ready sweaty okay we have a cake that's frozen you're i don't even think you can see the green on the top the magic of editing you will never be able to see you can't even see like the green you can see like a little green let me show you i'll expose ourselves for the viewers there you go look at the green we totally did not just go to the store and buy a cake because scrape off the decorations because we're lazy tonight and we didn't want to stay it's hawaiian that we're going to totally did not do that and we definitely don't still have these cake boxes still full and unused watch we can do more magic you ready when we snap our hands we're gonna have another cake ready three two one baby baby kitty also totally not store-bought because we were we have our big cake and our baby cake are you asking me to pick it up but i think one cake so i guess should we do that should it stick or should we slide it off we should go with slime i will try sliding it off okay step number one you know what i've been even cooler than snapping using the same cake mixes to bake two cakes i could have baked two cakes with the same cake juices editing magic so we're using a spatula a little it's called a spoon a spatula i gotta remember the previous audrey spectacular cooking show video oh yes it is a spatula as slide this bad boy on and by the end of the video i am like so worried that i'm gonna mess this up and then we'll go have to go back to the store and buy another cake center it how's that i think it's pretty centered oh my gosh it's so cute oh my gosh it's so cute is it yummy i'm gonna take a piece of it still not a fan of buttercream frosting have you tried little flakies yeah that's what i just ate which is why i said i'm still not a fan of buttercream okay the frosting that's where the frosting is that's what the frosting tastes like that's buttercream it's nasty ew okay the big cake tastes way better yeah you know what we already made our first rookie mistake as wedding cake bakers we should frost them today on our baking show we have aqua blue vanilla and we have how you say purple and french view lip violet probably something like that gold purple vanilla again but so they come with this one comes with fishy sprinkles that probably won't ever focus so you probably won't be able to tell this comes with normal circles here let's try that again fishy sprinkles sprinkles blue and purple all right so should we have purple on the bottom who wants hot or purple on the top blue on bottom who has the pants in this relationship you're wearing sweats pant pants i am wearing pant pants so i think it's me all right so then you choose i think are you feeling purple or blue today blue is a better accent color so i think the bottom should be and purple totally backwards when it comes to colors and probably blue is a better base color with purple being a better accent color but obviously you know the same though so yeah time to lather this baby in lotion uh done wow you are a problem i was hoping you would i like went full sand all the way in on like just that little hole right there so i was hoping i got a lot bigger group of frosting than i did like i was hoping i got like most of the can i just like flop like done oh you know the purple's so lovely it's taking up the white frosting and now i'm exposing some of the cake you know i'm glad we're both on the same page where we want our wedding cake to be definitely birthday cake style i just realized how birthday cake colors these are these are hecka birthday cake you know at our wedding we're planning on um the dress code being pjs yes specifically diamond peaches dino pjs so and they have one dinosaur chicken nuggets oh my gosh and mac and cheese yeah that's gonna be a lot of frosting if i eat a slice of this tonight i am not going to die and that's you aren't going to bed good night no this actually does not look half bad and it definitely looks better i think for our real wedding we should send a picture of this to like whoever's making our king and be like recreate this i would love if they took the time to detail like make the ombre kind of stuff like make the swirls in the middle when i'm in reality we were just like messy like throwing it yeah in reality the swirls came by accident we love a good ocean look yes it represents we also love a messily frosted cake look not me in the slightest just splatter that stuff on there well you know we both are not artsy people we we lean towards music and like dance music is artsy it's just not visual arts exactly well technically dance is also visual parts but it's not like working with your hands visual art yes like working with your whole body visual arts yeah we both play instruments i mean you play way more than me don't judge my dance moves i'm not a dancer teach me a dance right now teach me something okay um what's something you don't know i don't know oh you could do a pure wet a basic pyramid okay you ready first because you can't even see okay we're gonna do a face shape from your ballet side yes i'm trying to remember how we did it okay you're gonna go into fifth position what [Music] i

one so i've only smelt it and it smells like live resin so that's that's hype like it's i've smelled the it smells like the stizzy live resins too cold filtered cannabis only no additives i i was going to read that as oil one full gram we really wanted [ __ ] i'm unable to talk okay basically that's that so each package has a different color for if it's a sativa or a hybrid um so we got the indica wedding cake sick i'm super excited to try this it comes with a little cap so that's nice yeah first rip oh ooh hold on i can't i gotta get like a good okay first rip let's get it hope y'all are chiefing along with me hope y'all are enjoying hope y'all are [ __ ] staying educated with the news let's get it one gram wedding cake okay so right off the bat i'd say yeah it tastes like the live resin the only live resin i've had was ice cream cake and it basically tastes like that um so it's just straight herb it does seem to get a nice uh a nice rip off the bat like what was that like a two three second rip and i'm still exhaling so that's good i can already tell it's a bit uh harsh on the throat i'm just looking at the if you're wondering what the [ __ ] i'm looking at i just i really like this design though it's a bit i have my stizzy on me it's a bit smaller than the stizzy with the pod in it so as you can see it's like the slightest bit smaller but um so that's that's pretty hype and it's dude it's rechargeable so that's [ __ ] sick and it's a gram and it wasn't that much more expensive than a half gram pot first dizzy so honestly i'm [ __ ] [ __ ] with my stitching honestly it's a sick deal and i well i've taken one rip but so far it's it's cool and i like it and i love that i don't because okay with lilz not gonna cap the lil it'd be dying sometimes like my friend he's had two lils die on him i've had one lil die on me so they can be unreliable to be honest but it's got a charger who cares if this is unreliable i can charge it but yeah super sick uh the light couldn't tell but i assumed there would be one and yeah we got uh you probably can't no you're not gonna be able to see but there's a there's one tiny tiny bubble forming i can see it coming but i mean i'm ripping it so you know next one i'm also talking about the pole so the pole is tight it's a nice it's a nice bolt um it's got like it's kind of like the lil but it's a bit looser so you can like there's not really any airflow that's why it's got such thick clouds yeah for sure harsh on the throat animated out of water but yeah harsh on the throat um it does taste like live resin though it's nice it's getting me sweaty for sure but yeah the pole is nice i really like the pull it's it's tight but it's not too tight where you're like am i even getting anything you know like you can tell and it's a nice rip i wish y'all could see there's like one the smallest bubble ever so if that's if that bubble is one rip that's sick that's actually excellent what a sick word excellent dude this is [ __ ] excellent not but yeah overall look at this it's like it kind of yeah i like the shape of it i like the look of it the like matte grayish bl i i guess it's black uh it's like a it's like a charcoal the charcoal is [ __ ] hype and i like that it says one gram and wedding cake on it so that's nice in case you had like 30 you know oh [ __ ] where's my half gram uh a jungle nips you know you'll you'll you'll be able to hopefully you can read i would hope i don't know anyway here's our third rip let's get it wow what i don't like well i do like it's a good product obviously because as soon as you start to try and pull the light turns on which means it's cooking up so i can't get the smoke out of the chamber really but it's a it's a very well made product for sure you can tell and also that ghost was [ __ ] amazing um i really like this pacific stone like their logo on the bottom it's not gonna focus but i really like that hey dude i'm telling y'all okay i haven't actually said it okay yeah no it is a it is a a throat killer but i haven't said it i stone i have never tried them before but if all their other stuff is like this i mean [ __ ] i'm i'm down this is some quality [ __ ] like oh i haven't even i haven't even talked about the high [Music] so the high so far it's kicking in a bit slow mostly i'm just getting a little sweaty nah but let me let me hold it let me let me let me adjust how am i doing okay i'm all right okay i [ __ ] with it you know the wedding cake i like that i like that it's a okay it's like a it's a heavy set but it's like a chill indica it's not like a sleep you know it's kind of like yo so what we doing but like can we vibe you know it's like can we vibe what are we doing it's like both of them you know but yeah i [ __ ] with this i hope you all do too hope you all enjoyed hope y'all were chiefing along and i hope dude i'm hoping a lot of things for y'all and from i could just hope i hope the world is better i hope i get [ __ ] free weed anyway basically y'all should cop one of these try it out for yourself first one i've ever had i really like it i do need water though but i will say that it killed for a second and then it kind of went away so it's not like a huge deal but see i was gonna that's just my cough though ignore that but yeah last rip and then we're gonna end it y'all super super sick

these slices by the way we i asked if we could get smaller slices they said they're layer cakes so like this right here literally you know what we can do dana you know we can do right just have a piece of this just have this piece like take just three slices here no that's are you insane are they all together yes not person next person well they're kind of monstrosities it's not really my fault okay so this one right here i'm gonna play some this is called the dreaming princess it has um raspberry filling and some like almond paste thing which was there meringue on that one yes this is the says meringue on it this one is s'mores there's no that's the s'more one there's no other explanation and it has obviously graham cracker and marshmallow do you think it's marshmallow or is it moraine like that no it's marshmallow marshmallow this one is german chocolate no no this one is a how do you not know what any of these are the nutella flavors yeah why do you say nutella i hate that i just want to say it nutella it's a nut no nutella it's not like that though there's an accent on the you guys comment down below how to say nutella so this one right here focus camera strawberry shortcake like the kit right there i don't think i've ever had sure they can't see it at all we're in focus jesus [Music] look at that so that's a strawberry shortcake we can't speak okay and the last one hold it with a firm hand this time firmly grasping do a thumbnail because you look good right now no i don't know because i got excited exciting okay so this one stop posing okay so this oh so this one's the german chocolate which has chocolate and coconut which you don't like no it looks really good and i was like let me get busy with it this is kind of gross this is some kind of what is that a pecan yes i don't think a bank of pecans guys i don't even know how we would go about eating this that one's a mess but i know exactly how to go about doing that not that whole oh yeah right here right now wait we have to eat at the same time i don't know get down some fizzy cake and we got a big mess big mess big mess pigment yeah oh my god look at what i've done think about you want this at your wedding i'm gonna eat just like that oh should we feed each other with another one because i don't like it reading trash if i gave this to my the people at the wedding that would be like what kind of carrot cake it is kind of like curry like i thought it was chocolate i need that milk for an actual fact wait we need small sips because i'm not going to get more you would just drink milk and be like yeah that was good right only entire picture you don't just sit there looking in the morning like drink some milk for the day that was a no for me okay we're trying the s'mores now [Music] oh this is fire i know this is ten times better than i thought it would be no this is a good cake i don't think that one that's not a good fake it's a different consistency that's like when we make a pastry that one and then it's that's how ours tastes we're still eating this one so i don't know if i would have it as my wedding i'm gonna have it as my wedding cake i'll give this one a six i'm not gonna go for s'mores anyway i just wanted to have this cake and we both wanted that and we knew that [Music] that's fantastic okay relax that's good i like that one where are we going for next baby you mean you have to chill okay so this one is the dreaming princess with raspberry pizza so so far i wouldn't have any of this cheesecake at my no am i waiting let's see if i would get this one i think this is not what i want i think it was this it tasted almondy uh i taste it now no it's something that was like sour it tastes like it tastes like sour milk it was so good until i tasted that what you tasted why are you still eating it exactly what i didn't like about it the raspberry was good almond paste no i still taste it what is that this one this thing yeah it wasn't bad when i had it by itself just now what's this oh that's morning yeah yeah yeah that's good stuff maybe you need a blow torch marshmallow right there all right there's something in here that's like almondy like sour milk taste raspberry okay i already know what our wedding cake's gonna be do you agree chocolate and raspberry i mean i can't go wrong with that but i don't know chocolate raspberry fire i found my ice cream cake burger so do i but that will not last long you bring it out fresh yeah what if people get it in an hour or two hours what if what if people don't get the cake in time why would they get it i don't know people go to later for their cake goes later for their cake cake comes out you eat the cake if this isn't good then we're i'm gonna kind of just eternal yeah we're out because this looks fires yeah definitely want the back or just at least this part right yeah all right are you ready here goes strawberry shortcake which i've never tried i don't think i've ever had that's really good wow but what if people don't like strawberry on our wedding it's not a wedding cookie they really got the strawberry flavor down i feel like i'm on what is that show called my mom watches the halloween bacon championship whatever those things are i think i'm on that wow so i really like what you did with the strawberry little shows we should do that i'll go i like that this is the best so far no i didn't you know we got you know what we did for dinner we got food and i got a thai iced tea for a drink did you get her own drink guess what she ended up drinking i'll go get milk while he talks just what you get guess what she ended up drinking guys didn't you want to tell them um can you get a water while you're at a place that you what is it about milk and pastries that is like this really ties in together you know i think that's good i forgot your water gosh darn it oh something about what is the difference what is it about pastries with water with milk as opposed to straight water i put that's a good topic though right like what is it about the milk is the creaminess to it what does this do for the picture that water wouldn't do it compliments but why i know that that's what i'm talking about but why what does that do that just doesn't that's just like that clears up my system whereas this is creamy i feel like and that kind of like suits okay if this is not the best i will be very i don't know i don't want this anymore i know actually i just saw all that chocolate and i was like as you know you're getting old guys when you see sweets that you would have killed to eat when you're like like three years ago years ago i would have dogged this down and now i'm looking at that i'm like it's like a chore actually so much sweet it's not a chocolate that looks fire all right this is the banana nutella right see it might be good but i can see the banana in the cake already and i feel like i'm not gonna like that texture wise one two okay it's good but way too much icing look at my teeth way too much icing what you can even talk it's like you're stuck in my throat that was a disappointment see lovely little watch just a little bit on your finger the delicious chocolate i've seen and if they put that as a it's not even icing babe it's nutella oh that's straight nutella oh that's the probably do that much then see try try this without it yeah that's like this is great like this is great icing for chocolate and yeah it's just nutella that's why i didn't do anything to it you don't like it by itself is there chocolate chips in it i mean i don't like it i don't mind it it is a little too much yeah no banana pudding that's not the one for me this is the winner it was the prettiest and it tasted the best and this is our wedding cake would you actually have strawberry cheese strawberry shortcake for your wedding meat yeah for always for our wedding if it tastes like that sure it's good i think that's the first strawberry i've never had strawberry even just this tried that no no yeah yeah i think i'm gonna show you figuring out really well on this one i'm telling you i know what i'm talking about this is for you man no one else i went i'm with you comment down below which cake you would have at your wedding yeah some people already know that stuff which is probably never done i've never experienced i've never even thought about it until right now if i would have any cake for our wedding i feel like it would be chocolate raspberry or like you know the chocolate cake that they have but um like you can make it your you can make what you can make honestly probably that one too yeah these two are kind of gross yeah that one that one's better than that that one's good but it's just easy it's a basic cake that's why all right guys make

Joshua John Russell and this week I'm making an octopus wedding cake we're gonna build a gravity-defying cake using copper armature and doing some modeling chocolate texture you guys ready [Music] all right we're gonna start by breaking down our 6-inch vanilla cake this is a pretty intense cake so I'm going very simple with the flavor say--but garbage cake James can't have any of that sorry James he's on indictment Hills wedding so everyone follow James and make sure he stays on the side all right now we're gonna fill this guy with vanilla buttercream by the way if you guys want this recipe or any of my recipes you can click the I or get them from the description box below first trip to the cooler now I'm going to trim it crumb coat it and final coat [Music] I want to put this guy back in the cooler and then we're going to work on the armature I'm going to use some unconventional materials to build this armature so we're going to use some copper wire by the way if you're building armature the hardware store will become your best friend well I was your best friend just when I'm filming like not outside here you can tell people that so to build this I have to masonite boards this one is eight-inch this one is about a 16 and I painted at the top of this one white and the bottom of this one white because we're gonna Peck all the modeling chocolate around so you're not going to see this but if someone looks underneath the cake you might see brown and then I'm gonna prop it up on this little vase that I found just to keep it level while I glue all of my little leg you call these leg holders they're the bones although I don't have phones that legs okay Lex and then this tier will be fake because I'm gonna have to push all of our modeling chocolate against here to make it look like one if it was cake we would end up ruining the cake so this one's gonna be fake and the top two tiers will be real it's not a lot of cake in this more like an editorial piece something you would do for like art you know got it yeah that believable or now you didn't seem like you believed me I just I'd never liked it we're not much game you can't eat cake so I'm just gonna take my wire cutters and snip a piece of this off I think there we go this stuff is really flexible and easy to snap and then what I do is kind of shape it the way I want like I did this one and then I made a piece of this at the top flat so it will glue to here the fiddle it's the fiddle it will glue to here and then I'll glue it down here just to keep it stable and then once we pack the chocolate over all this it'll be super super sturdy and then we'll be able to carry the weight of the other two tiers alright let's see if our hot glues ready these aren't cake tools I don't know how to use them I don't know what I'll put this you know what it is it's the cord is like it's like that eh you do it just doesn't want to stay up there we go ok now it's time to glue this on so because this is painted the glue is not going to want to stick so I'm going to scratch it a little bit where I'm going to glue it so the glue will hold on okay so we'll put a little bit of glue on here I can't do it I can't do crafts guys no it might be this before now now I blame me there we go let's stop I'm gonna start this over I will beat you I think I just caught the garbage Channel fire okay I think we're ready now everything's driving me crazy blue up here just gonna start it okay you just rewind all that yeah all right apparently you have to do it by hand put some on these scratches you're useless the first one's always the hardest one once you get this one on the rest of them are really really easy unless you have this particular hot glue gun which is immediately going in the garbage all right let's do one on the other side right hot glue it dries pretty quickly all right now I'm gonna put the rest of my legs on all right now that I got three of them on and I'm sturdy I'm gonna take out my support I think so that is tight okay now put the rest of my legs on now I'm not armature is built I'm gonna grab my modeling chocolate and we'll start building this guy so the first thing we need to do before we start building our octopus tentacles is to panel a dummy cake that's gonna sit on top I'm going to do this with white modeling chocolate and a little bit of corn star line so we're making a dummy cake because like I said before when you're actually packing all of the tentacles on you don't want to damage a real cake so everything underneath will be I'll add a modeling chocolate and make real cakes will sit on top and I'm gonna roll this out with my spacing bands so that everything is exactly the same thickness gotta watch my hair it's not too big today I've been mindful of it I practice at home I put a mirror above me a minute [Music] so we're going to attach this using a little bit of your glaze just going to paint this on top so normally when I'm doing a regular cake I would put this on top because it's a dummy flip it over makes it much easier and then we can trim it by the way you guys been asking a lot of questions about the tools that I use or my favorite tools we put a collection together and we're actually giving a whole set away everything is in the description box below that looks about good now will panel the side all right I'm in rolled it up the same way but I rolled it into a log first because we want it to be a strip to go around the sides so I'm going to cut a straight edge along the bottom this will be the bottom edge of the cake so then we'll open this up take this little guy out no Jake the last thing you have to do is just trim the top so same thing use a sharp blade [Music] all right now that our cake is paneled we can finally start building our octopus all right so we're gonna put our first tentacle on using white modeling chocolate I've already processed this so it's already soft I'm just gonna roll it into a long carroty thing yes the idea really is just make sure that we have a lot of volume on the side that's going to stick to the cake and then we want it to taper off so I wanted to get it as long as this copper tubing is so it will fit around the copper pipe I'm gonna actually cut it open so I'm just cutting down and pulling it open like if you're actually filleting aqua cynical I don't know why you would do that I do like octopus octopi I took can we just change it to octa pieces cuz that's funnier you're not allowed to anything's ready remember all right now we're gonna stick it on filleted side I'm like a fishmonger filleted side towards the cake actually goes on relatively easy and you want some of it to actually stick onto the cake so thing with modeling chocolate sometimes that looks really kind of weird until it's good especially if you're putting something over an armature it's gonna like popping in strange will smooth everything out and then I'm actually going to take a small cell pin and we're gonna just mold the chocolate up to the 8 inch tier all right I think I've got the shape that I like and get it completely seamless you can use your finger as well the heat of your hands will do this and then we're gonna text for all this as well so if you end up having a little seam don't worry about it the texture will cover all that up but I'm gonna smooth it out using my little where we say this is called something it's like a fondant octopus see that's not so hard right now the structures built and the cakes made and the modeling chocolate then it's really easy after that you been home I'm just gonna make a yuna puss they're gonna grow back eventually let's wait [Music] so I've got it to the shape that I want it's pretty smooth now I'm going to add the texture and this suckers I'm going to do this to each one as I put them on so I'm just going to cut a little line this suckers would be on one side and the texture will be on the other and I'm just doing this with a little Dresden tool that's digital I'm going to start adding my texture I've got a couple of different quality tools here now we're going to make our suckers I'm just going to take little balls of modeling chocolate my hands are really warm so it's gonna stick to itself you could use a little bit of piping gel here or water to get them to stick together and then I'm just gonna put the sucker in here so then once it's on there you just take a little ball tool and we just want to open it up with the little sucker also known as things that terrified me when I was a child I'm gonna keep adding tentacles texture and suckers and just like that I'm almost done one left [Music] turn your head and cough [Music] this takes forever but it's going to look really awesome now it's time to stack the cake together I covered our tier that we made earlier and an additional smaller this is a four inch and because this is a fake piece we actually don't need both the two straws to go into this may be really hard to shove in your star from anyways so I'm just going to add a little bit of royal icing to here so he sticks only got something to terror take our six inch here we're just going to use three bubble tea straws with this baby top tier [Music] you all right for the final touch I'm gonna add some glittery sugar sand excuse me can you move your gear in my way FF he can't open his mouth he's making a pearl our octopus wedding cake is all finished and I love her thank you guys for joining me on this episode of man about cake don't forget if you want any of the tools or supplies click the I

YouTube\nIn this video you can watch as I create a three-tiered wedding cake from scratch.\nSo stay tuned! This is the orange version of my vanilla butter cake recipe which\nis multiplied by six to make fourteen, ten, and six inch, three layer cakes. The\nrecipe and the measurements are in my book Wedding Cakes with Lorelie\nStep-by-Step. I'll put a link below the video for you and also in the video so\nyou can go check out the books. The filling for this cake is a white\nchocolate buttercream. This is the Italian meringue buttercream with a\ntwist which you can see on this channel. You can also download a free copy of My\nTop Five Buttercream Recipes at weddingcakesforyou.com The links are below\nin the description box for you. This is a simple syrup and this is optional. If you\ndecide to use it you can just brush it over the layers and it gives you an\nextra little boost of flavor. Then a layer of buttercream, Raspberries, fresh\nor frozen, and then more buttercream to seal in the Raspberries. Do this for each\nlayer. The cakes are then lightly frosted to seal in the crumbs. Repeat this with\nall three tiers. Day one and two are now complete. On day\nthree the cakes are frosted. You can use a 789 frosting tip which\nI'm using here to put the final frosting on the cakes. Then you smooth it out with\na bench scraper or spatula. I just started using this tip and I'm loving it. You can create a rustic beauty using a\nspatula and doing a stucco effect like I'm doing on this cake. Mark the cake for a visual aid before\nyou decorate. The mounds of icing will be the main arrangement. Dark purpley blue\nhydrangea is piped using 101 over a mound of green. Light-blue mock-up of a stock flower is\npiped with a Mum tip The Mums are piped onto wax paper and\nfrozen for about 10 minutes before placing them onto the cake. The Mums are peeled away from the wax\npaper and placed over the mound of soft buttercream.\nI also piped white tulips with goldenrod yellow centers as an accent. They're made\nwith the Russian piping tip. I'll be sharing in the future a mini version of\nthis wedding cake with you for with more specific instructions on how to make\nthese buttercream flowers, and also how to arrange them on the cake. This cake\nwas especially heavy, so it's a good thing we were both keeping up on our\nweight training. Scott may need a little help there with his bodybuilding poses.\nThe cake made it safe and sound to19 Main in New Milford Connecticut. The\nbride and groom chose a beautiful monogrammed topper. As always delivering a wedding cake is a\ngreat cause for celebration with a cocktail or two.

would i'm excited so let's get started so the first thing i'm going to do is remove my icing and just prep my cake now this is the first wedding cake i've done i've been asked to do a lot of wedding cakes i've said no there's just a lot of pressure and i think it'd just be a lot of me crying so that's why i said no now i've got my cake boards i'm just going to cut out my circles for my wedding cake layers the thing that i really hated about doing this was that there's a lot of cake scraps but it's also a good thing because there's a lot of cake scraps and sheet cake is like the best kind of cake to eat it's better than most of the wedding cakes i've had in my life costco what are you doing you're working some magic in that kitchen costco i love you for it for the bottom layer i actually bought a second cake and it is a marble cake don't worry it came from the store as well i just cut out the circle placed it on top and then gave it a crumb coat now for my top layer i'm using three cake layers and the middle layer is actually just cake scraps that i grouped together to make a circle it looks like trash you guys i thought this was gonna fall apart but it didn't it held up and i know that the sides aren't perfect on this cake but i'm just gonna let it set up in the fridge for a little bit and i'm just gonna straighten it out now i added my second layer of buttercream and look it's straight you guys once it's set up in the fridge it was really easy to make straight lines on the sides of my cakes so there's always like two things that i say no to wedding cakes and baking competitions i keep getting asked to do baking competitions the outcome would be the same just me crying for like 30 minutes because i didn't know what i'm doing and i have no confidence you want to see a bigger cry for 30 minutes put me in your baking competition get out of here i don't want to do that now i didn't want to just create a wedding cake i want it to be disney themed so i'm incorporating mickey minnie and the disney castle i rolled out some black fondant that i added some cmc to i just started to cut out my disney character shape so we got mickey's silhouettes we've got mini silhouettes and then we've got the disney castle with mickey's head in the middle but you won't see it later on because of the flowers now there's this mickey and minnie splatter paint painting on etsy i really like it and i decided i wanted to incorporate it into my cake so i'm using a q-tip and just color blocking my silhouettes and just mimicking the design on the paintings i think they're just prints though i'll link it below because these prints are stunning i don't have anywhere to hang them which is why i haven't bought them but maybe in the future i will after i finish painting my designs it was time to start stacking my cakes i'm using boba straws you guys what is your favorite boba you like milk tea i like green milk tea i also like honeydew milk tea i think honeydew milk tea is my favorite that's where it's at now i got my second cake on top it is firm you guys it is stable and then i'm using some buttercream to just stick on all of my disney silhouettes doesn't that look sick you guys minnie mouse's never looks so regal and i did create some mickey heads to go on the back of my cake i thought it looked too bare and so i'm just adding these to the back just to give it a little something extra now the white buttercream was just a little bit too plain for me so i decided to add some splatters of silver luster dust mixed with some magic sauce just all over the cake even on the characters just everywhere not too much but everywhere then it was time to add some flowers and my final touches and these flowers aren't in the cake they're just resting on top of the buttercream so that it's really easy to remove thank you home depot for these flowers i added my disney castle to the top and voila my wedding cake was complete what sick can you believe this came from a sheet cake costco this cake is gonna taste just as good on the inside as it looks on the outside it is pretty sick that i created this from a sheet cake i thought that adding mickey and minnie would make this look too much like a kid's cake but because of the abstract way that they're interpreted on the cake it looks very adult man if i were getting married to chris pratt or chris evans or any any of the other chris's this is a cake i'd want now i was really inspired by this challenge and i created two halloween cakes using store bought 20 cakes i think they're coming out either thursday and friday and you should definitely be excited for those because they came out so well i hope you guys enjoyed this let me know in the comments if you want to see me make more wedding cakes i love you i'll see you very soon bye", "1HpCOUoww8U": "hey guys welcome to Rosie's desserts but in this video tutorial we'll be creating this really fun super pale wedding style cake I have an 8-inch cake that's been pre crumb coated so it's got a thin layer frosting all around a trap in the crumbs and then I'm applying a second layer of frosting this is gonna be the decorative layer this buttercream is unique in that it doesn't actually use butter it uses vegetable shortening you can place the butter so I'll have the recipe linked in the description box below and in the I icon up top as well if you'd like to know how to make this super pale frosting smooth it out with your bench scraper these are available at Rosie's desserts but calm and when you are happy with the finish on the outside of the cake bring in that lip of frosting to the center I've used my spatula to do this and then I'm popping it into the fridge to set for at least 20 minutes in the meantime you can work on your middle tier and your top tier I'm using the same frosting on all these cakes and following the exact same steps only this time once we're happy with that final layer of frosting just the neatness of it we're gonna take a spatula starting at the bottom we're going to keep it steady against the cake just the tip of it and turn the turntable while keeping your arm steady once you create one loop around reposition your scraper higher and higher on the cake until it's completely covered in these grooves bring the little frosting to the center and now with the six inch and the four inch we want to place these into the freezer for about half an hour to an hour just until the frosting is super super firm to the touch you could also use the back of a teaspoon if you don't want to use a spatula or you could use an even larger spatula to create even bigger groups if you enjoy these video tutorials feel free to subscribe we upload a new video every week bring them with the frosting to the center and again as I mentioned these go into the freezer for at least half an hour into the 8-inch cake and also into the 6-inch cake I'm adding in some dowels these are bubble tea straws that I've cut flush with the top of the cake and then I'm sticking my six inch on top with some frosting so it doesn't move around then I've taken a little teaspoon and I'm dipping it into some blue frosting I just use the white frosting added in some navy blue gel color by chef master and I'm creating this little dollops here in there I reload my spoon every second or so swipe and I add in a more gel color into the same batch of frosting just to make a darker and darker each time and I've done that three times concentrate the darker colors at the bottom and the lighter colors at the top to create kind of like an ombre petal effect stick your 4-inch cake on top of your six inch and remember we have dowels there to support the weight of the cake for that finishing touch we're going to add in some gold leaf Thievery is 100% edible you can normally buy it from most cake decorating supply stores or online just make sure if there's 100% edible massage it onto those two middle tiers and top to you and then for those faced here I wanted to still incorporate some gold in there so I've taken some edible gold luster dust and I've mixed it with a vodka you could also mix it with rose water spirit or if you can't use alcohol vinegar and lemon juice both work really well to create an edible paint paint in a petal here and there nothing too fancy just to tie in the gold leaf at the top to match and you're done a very fun very easy and I think a pretty elegant looking a wedding style cake I hope you guys enjoy this video and give it a go if you do hash tag Rosie's does that spot so I can see your awesome creations as well thanks again for tuning in I will see you in the next tutorial [Music] you", "ZKC6KgwGPyY": "hi everyone how's it going welcome back to our channel where we talk about

MOOUPZ  [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ", "Z3FO7qGFPlA": "hey guys welcome to Tuesday's tutorial we're going to create this rustic concrete style wedding cake with gold leaf flecks this was a cake needed for a photo shoot so it's old dummies it's a four inch top six inch Medal and eight inch bottom I have stacked them and stuck them together with chocolate if you were creating this in cake you could buttercream each cake first and then stuck like you usually would but I was short on time to get it done and find this the quickest way you'll need a base color of pale gray buttercream this is just a standard recipe of one part butter to two parts icing sugar and they added a tiny bit of black gel color this was created during a very hot week and I don't want it to melt on the shoots so you can add royal icing sugar to the mixture to help it set a bit firmer now whack that buttercream on however you like just pile it all on as we're going to scrape it back off now grab a scrapper it can be any you like I have this metal one just gently scrape around the sides to even it out a little this is the best bit it doesn't have to be smooth we are looking for rough and textured so don't obsess too much on getting that clean finish once that's done add a tiny touch more black gel to your buttercream to make a darker shade add random blobs of this color to the sides [Music] now go background with the scrapper to drag the color into the base color add some to the tops of the tiers to then repeat the steps again with an even darker gray don't forget to cover the board - we don't like naked boards slide a knife around the board edge to clean it up next grab a ball and add in some small silver garages I used to pronounce this how it was spelt druggies but it's a bit more sophisticated than that we also want to add a subtle Sparkle and crystal texture so this Wilton sanding sugar works great there's no elegant way to do this just grab handfuls and press them into the buttercream it's totally random and organic any that fall onto the board just press them in next water down some black gel color or pants in a ball and grab a clean toothbrush obviously a new one I have a few of these for character co-written there are only about 24 P for a pack of 2 now feel free to wear a glove if you like because we're going to flick the bristles with our finger and it will dye your fingernail black you'll see what I mean for the rest of the video hold the brush near the surface of the cake and flick the bristles it will launch little droplets of color like speckles this is just to add a subtle extra detail to the concrete effect next we are going to add flecks of gold leaf a frame piping gel really good for this just dab blobs of piping gel all over the cake where you want flecks of color [Music] next take some gold leaf as you can see this was a spare piece I have previously used these are just the transfer sheets meaning the leaf is on the square paper allowing me to handle it easily and it not slide off you can get loose leaf gold and silver but you can only imagine how difficult those are to handle press the transfer paper onto the piping gel and peel back the gold will stick to the gel and create rustic shaped patches now this is where the tutorial gets hot I'm making wired flowers those that know me or my work no I don't do flowers but my friend mesh invited me on a flower making dare as she's thinking about running classes I have to apologize to her because as I came to film this part I'd forgotten everything she said the kick was actually supposed to have dried flowers at the shoot but the delivering logistics didn't work out so I had to quickly whip up some dead dry looking flowers which is handy really because all my flowers pretty much look half-dead anywhere so don't look to me for flower making I'm just going to quickly walk through what I did I suggest booking a class with mesh when she's up and running because there's nothing she doesn't know about flowers cutters and pests okay so I've got some white flour paste and I'm rolling out a small ball over the medium sized hole on my flower pot once your paste is big enough for your flower cutter flip it off the pad now I'm just making random dead flowers so I grabbed this five petal pointed cutter and placed it over the raised lump cuts out the ship and clean up the edges then put the log back in the hole to thin out the edges with the ball tool [Music] next take availing tool it's a stick with ridges on that was kindly gifted to me by mich as I certainly didn't on any fly were making stuff rolled a stick across each petal to create texture next take a wire I don't know what size it is I think it was either a 26 or 24 and create a tiny loop in the end with the cutest mini players that you on push the wire into the center of the flower and down through the lump of pests pull the wire down so that the loop is just slightly showing and pinch the lump around the wire to a deer it we are going to hang them upside down so the petals cut inwards just loop the wire over and hang it on something until it's dry I opted for my kitchen cupboard handles don't make them all the same scrunch some of the petals at the best to make new shapes and forms [Music] I also created a few for petal versions with a hydrangea cutter you'll need to make quite a few I also made some berries with bowls of pests and inserted the hooked wire down into the center once your flowers are dried and set you can dust them I used rainbow dusts and Moroccan velvet and ginger Gore told you that toothbrush would stain your nails it's not dirt honest I'm dusting the four petal flowers with ginger glow and a dry brush then to add depth and brushing the centers and underneath with brown powder [Music] for the five petal flowers I'm using Moroccan velvet and brown in the center's again to create some chunky twigs take some wires and some cling film start wrapping the film around the wire it doesn't need to be nice and uniformed allow it to be thicker in some places than others just like real twigs next take some brown floral tape and tape all over the top of the film pull it tight again not attempting to even it out just let the lumps and bumps be what they're going to be once you get to the end squeeze the tape into a point as the inside is wire you can bend and twist them however you like make varying thicknesses by increasing or decreasing the amount of cling film you use now tip each flower stem and wire them together hold the flowers against the twig and tip up the stems adding more flowers or twigs in as you move down [Music] make sure you don't use them all you want to leave some loose to fill in the gaps create another Bunch with the burgundy flowers if you're adding your flowers to a dummy take a pair of pliers and violently shake with force as you try to get the brunch through all the polls Irene of course you could make life easier and Premack a hole with a screwdriver and easily slide them in but who has time for that right bend all your twigs and flowers into shape before struggling with your second flower spray now use some loose twigs and flowers to complete the bunch oh look I give in and pre poked holes with a cocktail stick add some more gold leaf to bare areas because why not Ong done a rustic concrete style cake with dead flowers and twigs this went to Holmes mill for a photo shoot and look great with the rustic walls fall saw is courtesy of the fabulous Kerry woods photography hope you enjoyed my epic flower making skills sari mesh bye guys you", "hGN8ggr8i6k": "hi everyone shanty from shanty sweet creations here today I'm going to show you how I prepare a wedding cake tasting for your clients this should be helpful for some of you home bakers out there who have to prepare tasting and take it with you and meet your clients at a restaurant or a local park so I'm going to show you how I get everything prepared and packed so it's a beautiful presentation and it's quick and easy and inexpensive you don't have to bake every single time you do a tasting so let's get started okay so the first thing I do is prepare five different flavored cakes I bake them eight inch squares then I will fill and crumb coat with a vanilla Swiss buttercream then I will refrigerate that until it's nice and firm and then I will cut each cake into one inch by two inch pieces and each piece gets wrapped in a piece of saran wrap but then I will take my seal-a-meal and make a packet one of each flavor and these get frozen and they are very well protective when you freeze them in the seal-a-meal pack you could also do several layers of ziplock baggies would probably work just fine - so then when it's time for a tasting I will take my pack out of the freezer the night before and put it in my refrigerator and then in the morning when I wake up I will take this out and put it on the counter and let it come up to room temperature when it's time to put the tasting together I will open the pack and take each one out and unwrap this pack by the way is for a two-person tasting so each packet that I prepare will be for two people so you unwrap it and then you cut that piece in half and then you put it on to your plate so I've prepared these plates and they have labels for each flavor and I will place my cakes onto the spot for its flavor and be sure to wipe your knife in between each flavor on a damp towel and then repeat that process for all five of your flavors so you will have a one inch by one inch piece frosted in a vanilla Swiss buttercream of each flavor I do a vanilla bean a lemon chocolate almond poppy seed and cappuccino but of course you can do as many as you want and whatever flavors that you want I usually do these because these are my most popular wedding cake flavors okay so once I get all my cakes plated the next thing I do is I put a fork in the plate and then I take another plate and put it over the top so what this does is it helps protect it in transit so it's not going to get squished I get these these plates from Crate & Barrel what's nice about them is that they're a little bit deep so that they accommodate the depth of the cake when you put two together so you go ahead and give it a lid and then you wrap that whole thing and a layer of ceramic holds a little the plates together and it protects it and seals it for freshness during transport so that's ready to go so then when I arrived for the tasting all I have to do is unwrap this and set it down in front of the client and they're ready for their tasting so the next thing I do is a plate of filling and frostings for them to sample and let me show you how I do that okay so I have a plate here with quite a few different little dessert cups and what I've done on each dessert cup is put a little label to tell them what they are sampling I do five different filling flavors and five different frosting flavors so you can usually find little ramekins and and then find a nice little plate that they fit on and I will show you how I put the filling and frosting in them so it's a beautiful presentation so again ahead of time I have prepared all of my fillings and frostings at the same time as I prepared my cakes and then I package them individually so that they're easy I can just grab one pack it's enough for two person tasting so I take that out of the freezer at the same time as I take out the cake so what I've done here is made small little Sela meal pouches with enough of the filling or the frosting in it for that one tasting this is how I make a pretty presentation I make sure everything is at room temperature and I kind of give the buttercream a little a little mixing here to give it a nice texture then you can cut off one little corner and then take your your 1m or your 2d piping tip and I insert that open corner into the piping tip and you basically have a little piping bag at this point you're holding the tip on to the bag and then you're just going to squirt it right into proper dish and make a little buttercream pile there and that's how it looks so it's a pretty little presentation it's enough for them to sample the flavors and it's very quick and easy so then I go ahead and fill all the rest of my dishes and I will show you what I can do after that so when I'm filling that the little dishes with the buttercream I use a fresh piping tip for each one it just makes it quicker and easier than running over to the sink and washing your piping tip each time and if you don't have a seal-a-meal to make these little packets with you can use like a little snack sized a ziploc bag or something like that makes it easier the the seal-a-meal pouches take a little bit longer to make I feel like they protect it a little bit more in the freezer so that's why I like to use those ok so this is what my sample plate looks like when it's done and it's a very pretty presentation and I guess I'm lots of flavors to to taste and then what I do is put a little plastic tasting spoons right on the front here so they have something to sample each flavor with and by the way I get these at the dollar store in a pack of twenty five for a dollar and I do use them wash and reuse so just put a nice amount of the spoons on the front here and then we're going to go ahead and wrap this in the saran wrap as well when I get to the tasting I unwrap this and I set it in the middle of the table so that both the bride and the groom has access to okay so there's the sample plate ready and this is one of my favorite things that I have found to make this whole thing so much easier this is a casserole caddy I guess I don't know exactly what it's called I found it on Amazon it's for holding casserole dishes when you're going to a potluck or something like that it has two compartments and it's insulated so I can't put ice packs in here if you want that I don't need to I'm never transporting for a very great distance in heat or anything so what I do is put my sample plate in the bottom and then I put my cake tasters right on top of that and then I also put in a bottle of sparkling water go ahead and close that and then in my top spot I have a pretty hearty little wineglass I got this at my local store for about $2 so it's pretty thick and sturdy and then I wrap that in a nice cloth napkin to protect it and this is also the napkin that I've set with the cake tasting plate for the bride and groom to use so I've got two wine glasses in there and then the top space also holds any of my materials I always take an iPad to show my portfolio and and then my my paperwork that contracts and and all of that go with it that just gets read on the top and you're ready to go you're ready to very quickly and easily take a very nice cake tasting presentation to meet your clients you have plates Forks napkins glasses with a sparkling water you have all five different cake flavors frosting flavors and filling flavors you have all your paperwork your iPad everything that you need for information and and it isn't a beautiful percentage that was helpful for some of you home bakers out there for me it's a much easier way to deal with my tastings I can prepare a whole bunch at once ahead of time and then when it's time to do a tasting it only takes me 20 minutes to put it together so I find it a much easier way if anybody has any questions feel free to email me Shanee at Chaney sweet creations calm and don't forget to follow me on Facebook and YouTube Shanee sweet creations okay everybody have a sweet day you", "xAWIbnn1Pxs": "hi this is another edition of kicking all the way and today we're taking it out of interviews actually showing you a beautiful technique that is really popular now and we showing you how we decorate this gorgeous cake with wafer paper alright my name is Lala Ryoga Jimmy and I'm the creative director of dainty FS bakery and the host of kicking all the way which is a platform specifically to educate to inspire and just to let you know what happens you know in the cake world so I mean without going too far from what we want to do I'm just going to show you what I have in front of me I have yes this cake that we've been decorating we've done the first year or should I say the last year the meat here and I'll be showing you how you know I turned just a colored cake with this gorgeous designs so I will tell you a bit about this design I have in front of me 2020 guys everything has become so eclectic modern and there's just a bit of flow airiness and simplicity there's a lot of architectural designs now and you know things that were not allowed before or seem as in norm everything is just okay now so I think this is just a beautiful time to express yourself as a cake designer and in front of me I have three designs we'll be working on we're done with this one this black square cake on the left and then the right hand side I have this cake that we're still working on and of course this particular design that I'll be showing you how we create it and then we'll finish it up together so what am i using for this deck all the cakes have been baked and covered in fondant and I like to do that so that I could just prep and make things ready in Nigeria where we live is very humid and if I'm working with fondant cake with the team we prefer like a very solid structure I no some people outside Nigeria actually do this over the cake itself before here for peace of mind for me my team and of course the client we always try to first of all you know bake the cakes fill them crumb coat them allow the fondant to dry to the touch all right before we get on with any other decorations we'll be putting on the cake so the style of this cake is the wafer paper like I mentioned it's just a flat white sheet but it's amazing what you can do with this medium I have come to fall in love we need so much because it's just so creative it's it's just so that's just so much you can do with it from flowers to designed like this you can print on it you can and because it's edible you know you can actually eat it it tastes like wafer by the way you can also color this sheet like I will show you how we turn this white sheet into like different shades of white pink and you added some pearls and all of that so to go ahead with the design I will be needing the following items we need a bit of color right these are this is just a combination of white white pearl and pink pearl all right that I have poured and added some edible spirit okay and we use edible spirit instead of water so that we can dissolve properly and of course once you place it on the wafer paper it quickly dries off so we don't use water at all for wafer peopIe it has to be either alcohol or edible spirit and then this is also very important this is my piping gel and this is made in-house immediate here at the interface because to do and it is just made with lemon conflab water and yeah that's it when it tastes delicious - okay and then of course we'll be using this beautiful moves silicone molds I don't have to get these guys you can just use any mold you have it's about just being created in your placements you're also going to need a scissors a brush and then of course an offset spatula I love working with an opposite offset spatula instead of the straight ones and we have some royal icing here I'll rather use this to stick on the edible flowers we have milled here instead of the piping gel for stability because it dries really really hard and secure all right I also have a foam alright just the form we just cut into this shape this is what we would use to dab the color over the cake alright another technique you can use to get this colors to use an airbrush but I want to have this class to be relatable it's not everyone that has it has airbrush in their stores so I mean if you have one that's fine we have one here because we tend to do a lot of painting but I mean if you just have this and a clean sponge you are fine alright so now we'll begin and I will just walk you through how we design this cake happy cake and guys [Music] four sheets of wafer paper and like I mentioned earlier they're just white flat sheets and creates the texture and the pattern we want with them so what I'm doing is I'm just literally ripping off from one end to the other like so there's no right or wrong way I wanted to look as rustic and untidy as possible and so that I can gain much more ground I tend to put about three to four papers on top of one another and just rip so that you know it takes a shorter process so I just go on like this until I completely rip off the entire sheets that I have in my hand and that's the last part so we have roughly about 20 strips of wafer paper and I will show you how to adhere this onto the cake now that's the piping gel and the piping gel acts as the glue that would help my wafer paper attached to the fondant and then I'm just literally just going round the entire surface of the cake with my piping gel I want to be generous with with this so that's the wafer paper can thoroughly stick onto the cake now in the early days when I started working with wafer paper we used to use water but I realized that the water was just too much for the wafer paper and so it would rip it off so piping gel is a much better option gently now just placing the piping gel all around the cake and I tend to like to place it totally and completely so that you know when I'm placing the wafer paper one after the other I do need to stop so often we begin to place the wafer paper and this is very easy we're literally just taking the wafer paper and applying it round the cake and then you will notice that the portion that is ripped and untidy is the part that starts from the very top we need a cake to look very rustic and once you start this way and continue around the design it ends up looking very beautiful airy and just very rustic so we want to also make sure that we rip one end of the wafer paper so that it looks untidy and then we just continue to go around remembering to stick it onto the cake where it ends before adding another strip to it so as we begin to place it one after the other going around the entire cake it's important that you leave a very short distance from the top one to the second one you need your frills to look quite tight and the closer they are when you are playing them one row after the other I find the more beautiful it looks so if you kind of make the gap too wide it doesn't look too beautiful so you want to make sure that you apply each row as close as possible to the other row and then just have fun with it okay there's no right or wrong way of placement at the end of the day it all comes together so you take your time to close whatever gaps are bit too wide and then you'd manipulate the prefer paper you can bend it out fold it in just have fun with this process [Music] and here we are we've been able to place the wafer paper strips all around the cake and it's already looking beautiful so now I want to put in on the finishing touches now that's on fifty-fifty we've rolled we need the elasticity of the flour paste to pair with the fondant in a 50/50 ratio so that it can dry perfectly for this purpose so now we're going to begin to use the silicon molds to make flower designs then I just have a couple of silicone molds at hand that have the design and I'm looking for and gently we place it all into the crevices very patiently like so and once you pop it out it gives you the beautiful design on the silicone mold [Music] so I'm gonna take my time I mix on and then we'll begin to place it on the cake I'm taking some of the 50/50 and making some unique flower designs want to make sure that it sits flush once it's gone in you press and then you pop it out like so so we make this in different shapes and sizes and we leave them all to dry but for the sake of this video we've actually made some and left them to dry because it's important it dries properly before you begin to use them so for the next phase of this decoration we're going to take some liquid color and then just mix them together have a bit of fuchsia pink and some white luster and I mix them all together so that I can get a very light shade of luster pink [Music] and with the phone we begin to dip and dab so this technique is called dipping and dabbing now the trick to this is to use very minimal color because if you take too much of the liquid it will all just roll down the sides of the cake and we don't want that we just want to introduce the color in a very minimal way okay then we just take it bit by bit on different portions of the cake like so it's okay to use an airbrush machine to actually create this type of texture on your cake so that I could show you how versatile or how creative we can be we don't like to kind of limit ourselves to one particular tool we like to try out other techniques that can also allow us get the same results and I find this dipping and dabbing works absolutely fine so I'm just going all around the cake just gently I don't have any pattern in mind I usually like to walk very organically and look at the project in front of me and creatively begin to enjoy myself and enjoy the process so I say to you when you do things like this don't be too hard on yourself embrace even the mistakes that you make you never know what will come out of that [Music] now because we have used a lost our airbrush color you will notice that we're having the finishing of the the pink it's looking very satiny very elegant and I wanted this finish because we're creating a very romantic type cake thing and there we go all done now [Music] now it's time to go to the next set of Decker details now for the next set of design we're going to use this royal icing and realizing is the glue the perfect glue to add hair usually any apply design onto your fondant cake I'm just gonna roughly spread the royal icing onto some specific areas of the cake and then with that I begin to apply the flowers that we made earlier on one by one we apply these floral details onto the cake and I tried to cluster them in such a way that you know it has a beautiful flow so I use a big flower and medium sized flower the much smaller flower you know just clustering them up in one side but making sure that it all goes with a particular pattern I just use this technique and applied the flowers of the floral details onto the remaining portion of the cake [Music] again there's no right or wrong way just simply apply them having a pattern in mind placing a big one medium-sized one then a much smaller one all up in a particular section as a cluster once I've applied all the flowers to the portions I want then I begin to just take the royal icing and dab to the cake as well just to add another interesting texture we're trying to make as many patterns as possible onto this one cake so that it can be interesting to the eye [Music] now to apply the sprinkles onto the cake you know it's really difficult to take the sprinkles one by one and place it onto the cake I devised the means where we take this very dry foam place it inside the Crisco all right and then dip that into the sprinkles like so and with that we can now add that onto the surface of the cake now how beautiful is that so what I'm doing here is just applying the sprinkles onto the portions of the royal icing I just dabbed onto the cake so that adheres itself without falling off and I use this technique to apply the sprinkles around the cake [Music] after playing the sprinkles I really love texture and now I'm taking some dry J's in the color silver and white and with this tweezer I would apply them onto the cake as well like so I find for designs like this adding more elements that are cohesive you know helps to tell a much elegant story a much romantic story especially with this theme of cake so one by one I take the tweezer and place it strategically around the cake and really the cake is looking gorgeous now to complete our cake design we've made some sugar flowers ahead of time and I'd like to call these sets of flowers sugar flowers because they are not botanically correct so there's really no fuss we just like to make them look as realistic as possible and here we have the peonies the orchids some berries and some filler flowers we also have some IVs and some twigs as well I'm just going to show you how we added this detail onto the Fila flower we took a bowl of flour paste used a wire just at the bottom we left it to dry for at least a day and then we use piping gel around the surface and then dip it into sugar and that is what gives this finish that you see now and this set of flowers will be used just to fill in spaces here and there after we've done our arrangement carefully now I'm just going to arrange these sugar flowers around the cake in a beautiful flowy and a befitting manner [Music] here we go we're all done now our beautiful 3-tier rusty beautiful area and flowy wedding cake the perfect modern design thank you for watching to the next video it's bye for now [Music] you you", "d7T94ijfQw0": "I've already got the bays for my wedding cake and I just spent the last two hours looking at pictures on Pinterest on tumblr of wedding cakes and I'm so inspired like why why do I want to do this because we're gonna order this from a one-star and also a five-star bakery I want to make this kind of like difficult like technical this might potentially be the ugliest wedding cake you'll ever see but it will be a technical challenge so we can truly see the differences okay so I think we should draw like a bride and groom on top just because like I think this will make it easier to visualize the whole thing and apparently my groom is marrying a pictionary paper like literally what is this this is just my preference but basically I want my wedding cake to be a pastel wedding cake with color I know some people like a white wedding cake but I think that would be boring I will do some things with white but for the base I thought we should do some macaroons so I want to make them in pastel blue and also in pastel pink this has to be the saddest attempt and making macaroons and I'm sorry in advance but it's what we've got why does this look like an Easter egg cake let me attempt to do some filling on the macaroon just so they they fully understand that these are macaroons I want the base of my wedding cake oh I want the base of the wedding cake to have this like a drape like effect okay this looks they looked a lot better on Pinterest also every bridezilla on their wedding day so I want this whole bottom of the cake to be in blue and I know that's not very conventional for wedding cakes but like I want to make this an actual challenge for the bakeries because otherwise this would just be boring so I'm gonna I'm gonna clean it up a little bit to make this a little more wedding cake like I basically want to add like these little pearls I've seen a lot of photos of wedding cakes and a lot of them I've got these like it's not a very complicated step but I feel like these little like changes is what's going to make this look more like a wedding cake and all I can like an Easter Bunny birthday party which is kind of where we're at at the moment I already know what everyone is gonna say that this doesn't look enough like a wedding cake so I'm thinking I'm doing like like a frosting like edge like a very wedding cake like very like old-school like Grandma wedding cake I guess and then I saw a lot of ugly wedding cakes they have these like Dre effect so I think we should do that as well this is the most confusing wedding cake ever this top part looks a lot more like a wedding cake like I'm actually getting excited for this and I've seen a lot of pictures of these wedding cakes are basically a tree with flowers and it honestly looks it really sounds weird but it looks so cool so that's exactly what I want to do just just for me this is my son weird but I promise you guys like I saw photos of this and this really worked so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to draw like a tree but I swear to you if this goes the way it goes in my head this is gonna work a literal artist like I don't know what this is but like in my head this makes sense what I want to do is I want to draw some flowers all around the top as if they're growing from the tree so let's do some in the back as well some on this side I'm a little bit worried about the price because these are three layer cake so I will tell you the price and everything like the price differences this is definitely supposed to be like a wider like in pastel colors so maybe I'll add some like notes just make everything impossible so that it looks like a wedding cake but that looks a little more like a wedding cake now than it did in the beginning I'm hoping they will do these little sticks cuz I want the cake to like feel like a wedding cake in a wedding cake is always so big and like separated the levels and I want that for my look for the base I mean they can do whatever color they want I'm not gonna be specific about that but that is basically my wedding cake I'm probably gonna be the first person ordering two wedding cakes on the same week actually probably not I forgot about the existence of the Kardashians Kris Jenner would she would be proud of me right now I'm gonna place the order guys and next time I see you guys I will hopefully have the case in my house I will see them and I will react to the one star and the five star before we show it to you I just want to say that the one star cake actually cost one hundred and twenty pounds which is around the same in dollars I think and the five star one cost 400 this is the most amount of money that I've ever spent on food like ever but it is a wedding cake I'm gonna close my eyes guys and we're going to react to the cakes I think we should bring the five star cake first because I expect it to be amazing and then the one star weight do you have to build the three layers or does it come already build you have to build it right I'm probably more nervous for this then I would be from my actual wedding which probably says a lot Wow so we've got how many of these like three boxes I think it's casting a shadow or something like wait can you help me slide it because I don't I wouldn't look at it after it's been on camera can i slide it oh my god imagine if it falls after I spent 400 pounds on it holy oh my god I can't even show it all on camera this is I literally got goose bumps we need to show like a bigger image this is the most beautiful wedding cake that I've ever seen I've honestly I've never seen anything like this this is definitely a dangerous game that I'm playing here did I honestly feel like I might have designed the wedding the dream wedding cake for so many people like the caller's the pink like I expected a little bit more flowers but like I know and this is this is better than I expected do you see the detail on that they did exactly what I wanted the macaroons are these like homey oh my god I can't eat this I honestly can't even is I feel really bad it must have been so difficult to do this and also not make it look like he was made by literal five-year-old because the idea like you guys saw my drawing there's a reason what these people have a waiting list I would postpone my wedding for this cake like I'm not exaggerating this is truly the best have you seen the bride and the groom the quality of this oh maybe maybe you shouldn't also the detail look look at the way they did like the little steaks it's so much better than what I expected then what I even asked them to do like they didn't have to snap like that this is the craziest thing I think I've ever bought for one of my videos to the point where I generally I don't think I actually should I freeze this can you freeze a wedding cake isn't that thing that brides do can I actually freeze this and save this for my wedding day do you think this last fifty years can my wedding cake survival World War three like that is the question me arriving to Iran with my freezer Jesus Christ I feel like we need to get some shots of just the cake obviously this was very expensive like we do have to take that into consideration so we can be terribly disappointed when the once our cake arrives because you know this is like on a different level so hopefully it's going to be fine so I'm going to move this aside a little bit while we bring the one star cake even the boring layer it smells so good why does it smell like that so help me move it a little bit forward oh this one feels more stable I haven't seen it yet but I can only hope that it's in frame because they honest against it yet but this is the warn star cake hmm look I mean after we saw that like anything would be disappointing like we have to be honest right I feel like I haven't even seen it maybe it's better in the front let me have a look from the front actually what's on camera doesn't look like the huge difference but the part is really killing me is the drip effect like I feel like this place is really good at doing plain cakes because this layer how much looks better than the five star one I mean everything else is in a complete different level this is like comparing my contents to like david dobrik like we support I can't seem to get this well on camera without like literally ruining the whole cake but this drip effect it's like it looks like smear do we like a knife like honestly I would probably do a worse job than that you know I pay them for a budget wedding cake and actually the second layer does not look budget at all on camera it's like no translating nothing of what I'm saying which is really frustrating but in real life this one this wouldn't feels more 3d that one feels a little bit cleaner I finding this a little bit much for an actual wedding cake like my drawing looked a little bit more like this and also like this is so smooth on the trip this is like actual art like it belongs to a freaking cake Museum this is like my post nasal drip my runny nose when I got the flu this actually looks better this is the one star cake versus the five star I honestly think I like the ones are better but I do get this is a lock last year a lot cleaner I find the top of the one star a little bit confusing and when it arrived the little figures oh my god I tried to do on the wedding day I think they did exactly what I drew which was this weird figures the tree actually looks cool I don't love the pearls around here I feel like this is way too much pearls but you know they bought them they're like we're gonna use it oh my god that's interesting are you kidding me this is like the most beautiful souvenir [Music] I feel really bad about this but he makes me feel better that I'm going to freeze that hold we going happy wedding day so we're gonna taste a macaroon Zin one slice of each I hope I can still freeze it after so I didn't ask for any specific flavor so I wonder this is I think strawberry which I guess is a classic for like a wedding day I want to show you what he looks like on the inside I know people are always interested about this but that's a really clean card this gets scarier and scarier gotta be confident in life sometimes I think this is the same flavor I'm not I'm not expecting like three different flavors but I think it's the same okay I feel like if you get it a thicker slice it's actually easier this is the exact same flavor which I guess for a wedding not everyone is as trashy doesn't mean it better be freakin good this is getting really really dangerous but there you go I mean it was kind of a clean cut for this one so we're gonna cut the one star one now and then we're going to do the final taste test the top is crunchy it's like separated because I feel so soft I could be wrong but I think this is gonna taste really good but also guys I just realized that they didn't have any macaroons around it that's why it looks a little bit here as well but you mean I can't blame them like a much smaller budget they did when they feared and ungrateful regardless it's like wait in the middle do you see that there's like a hole of things I it's like falling apart I wasn't even touching it and he was like collapsing on the inside so it does feel homemade I'll give them that this literally feels like a homemade cake just wanna say that he favored win this it's no my fault the cake is really crumbly like it's kind of fully apart on its own this layer is beautiful though like they actually did a really good job it's really hard to cut this cake but it's the same in every layer I think as well is that is this strawberry does it look like strawberry let me do a layer of the oh my god oh my god see that's the annoying part of all these pearls being around it listen imagine 100 on your wedding day it's like sorry I can't cut the cake oh my god oh my god we got a a damaged little man and it's the same as the other which is gonna make this tasting a lot easier because all the same flavor right I think I think we should just taste it let's taste it if this was actually my wedding day and if I actually slice this cake to present to guests the five-star one cuts a lot easier like this is such a clean cut on the cake like I'm not very good at cutting cake and it just it's solid it's also a little bit tougher well the one star one it's very crumbly like it looks delicious it smells delicious way better than that one but it looks a lot Messier so I guess if you want like a more rustic look for for your wedding if you're doing research I mean and I just want to say before we actually try it that I honestly think they did an incredible job like I'm really grateful that they actually can do this on a much smaller budget try to get like a little bit of everything the filling a lot of the sponge wait okay I'll just use my hand it is a shrimp it is sexy food I don't know what flavor this is weird you wanna try it try that it tastes fishy right I should have went for one of those wedding cake taste test that's a better idea I was really excited to love this like I love the look of the cake I'm still gonna freeze it for how beautiful it is I'm definitely not freezing this for the flavor this is a little pre-made cake this is like someone actually made it but I mean everyone say it but Betty Crocker would have killed this like I don't know what to say honestly I just am disappointed that maybe they spent a lot of time with macaroons Wow no that's good I'm not even thinking on how much I spent on this which was a lot it's just objectively not very good wait I need a second opinion because I honestly it tastes like refrigerator like when the absorbs all the flavors it's awful right ladies and gentlemen we've just experienced it's kind of not every artist can be a baker that's for sure let's try the one-star cake this layer of cream and even though we fell apart it's like a lot thicker but it doesn't mean this country's better you mind if I'm just disappointed Judy give it a try it's a lot better this point is good like I wasn't even sure for a second if I tasted this I would think that this cost how much that will cost and that would the other way around like I don't know how this makes sense this one is a lot better I mean look at the plate it's a literal mess but it tastes like a homemade cake you almost tastes like tastes like caramel it's not too sweet it's like you're good creamy like layer in the middle I've been scammed and I feel like I scammed someone this is so different from the previous video we filmed on one versus Firestar cakes because this time around I mean this one just looked incredible like I honestly could not believe that they did that and then this one I wasn't as impressed even though I reckon the on camera looks a little bit better than it does in real life when you can see the imperfections but flavor-wise to me this is a 5-star flavor cake it's really good it's creamy it is homemade I love it I would honestly I would choose this any day over that and honestly because I care more about the flavor than the look to be completely honest I would probably have this one in my wedding if you wanted a great Instagram photo then there you go I mean that is like on a different level like it's exactly what I asked for I hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did please I would really appreciate if you could subscribe to my channel and also switch my notifications on but honestly only subscribe to my channel if you actually like this video like if you did and that's totally fine I always say that because it's fine my videos are not for everyone but if you did I would also really appreciate if you could give this video a like today it was probably the most money I've ever spent on a video because oh that so I would really appreciate the support and let me know if you like this or not let me know in the comment section down below which cake would you prefer a cake that looks incredible and tastes not so good or one that tastes amazing and you might not look the best I think that's like you can there's literally two types of people one

one of these so you know what to do I will see you guys on my next video and I've got a lot of cake to freeze or figure out what I'm gonna do it so it'll be a great time to have friend", "s02IYON69t4": "hey guys it's Gretchen from Gretchen's bakery here with an in-depth look at how to make a three-tiered cake I get so many questions about building tiered cakes that I thought it deserved another go since I did make a tutorial last year for the same topic and click here if you want to go check that one out but this time I feel that I will address the most asked questions and hopefully this will be a better than ever tutorial for you you can skip forward here to any topic that you're curious about if you do not want to watch the entire tutorial just click the screen here for whatever topic you'd like to skip to first of all the cake question can I use blank cake recipe for a tiered stacked cake and my answer is you can use just about any cake recipe you like as long as you build the cake properly we are in an age where we're no longer stuck with plain white cake for a wedding cake so whatever the bride wants the bride gets today I will be using a combination of my golden vanilla butter cake and chocolate buttermilk cake so don't forget all the recipes plus tons more information is on the blog at Gretchen's Bakery comm so click here or click the link below the video to go grab the recipes and more information I am making a 10-inch plus a 7 inch plus a 5 inch tiered cake because typically you will have two to three inches in graduation from one cake tier to the next as you graduate up to the top and this cake here that I'm making will serve approximately 60 people and that does not include the top tier because that is the anniversary tier that the bride and groom will save and celebrate one year after their wedding and you may notice that my servings per tier are slightly less than the Wilton guide to cake cutting but I have been using this Gretchen's Bakery guide for my entire 20 years making wedding cakes and I have never run out of cake use whatever guide you feel more comfortable with or ask your caterer or who whereas cutting and serving your cake to get on the same page with you as far as expected servings the next question I get a lot is how do I convert the recipe to make larger cakes and I'm not really a cups volume gal when it comes to making larger cakes than the standard recipe yields so follow this guide here for how to calculate how much batter you're going to need most standard recipes are calculated to make two 8-inch cake layers so 4 to 10 inch layers you will need one and a half times the recipe the 7-inch and the 5 inch layers will then be another one and a half times the recipe so in total you will be making your cake recipe three times if you just fill the cake pans halfway full then you can be sure you're going to get cake layers that rise nicely to the top of a 2 inch height cake pan I do have more information on the written blog post as usual for other sized cake pans so be sure to click through and read the entire blog post please okay so now that we have our cake dilemma solved what else do you need cardboard circles that are the same exact diameter as the cake tiers you are using as well as parchment paper circles that are cut to the same size as the middle tier and the top tier this will be more clear later when I show you how to use them and why a pastry bag and whatever tips you need to decorate your final cake some people like to smooth ice their cakes with a bench scraper for perfectly even sides every time or an offset spatula will do as well some sort of turn stand for decorating the cake will make your life so much easier and I will link to everything below as well as in the written post and last dowel rods I use wooden dowels in each tier and never plastic ones or the kind that go through the entire cake it's just my preference to do it this way now here is the first tip and trick to making stunning cakes with minimal skills and minimal time it is to just buy premade fondant flowers I am teaming up with fondant flowers calm for this tutorial and I have to say they do make beautiful flower at very affordable prices even when I owned my bakery my motto was I just cannot be all things to all people there are plenty of people who specialize in making beautiful fondant flowers like the ones you see here so why not let them help you this way you can concentrate on the hundreds of other things that you will have to do to pull off a fabulous wedding cake of course if you do make your own fondant flowers more power to you but those of you who do you know how much time they take so this is really a great way to save time save your energy and make a gorgeous cake with minimal skills now in addition to the cake recipe you also need your filling and icing recipes I am using buttercream throughout but of course the possibilities are endless and you are not limited just because it's a tiered cake so here I will be using two recipes of Swiss buttercream for the crumb coat and the final icing I also have an additional recipe of buttercream here for the filling but I have made a quick raspberry puree to add to the filling buttercream for a nice variation and great taste simply add the cooled puree to the buttercream and give it a spin onload to incorporate the next thing that you'll want to do is trim each cake layer to the exact same size for all the tiers it is your option whether you want to do two layers of cake or three or some people do four layers of cake really that is your option just make sure you're trimming them all to exactly the same size I do use a ruler to make sure that I'm doing just that this will give your final iced tiered cake the perfect symmetry and look that you want for a stacked cake and I always do say what you start with is what you'll end with so be sure to follow that through from beginning to end now we can get to filling and crumb coating our cakes for this step I just use the pastry bag with the coupler inserted and no tip and I do have a bowl here that is basically used for the crummy buttercream so that I don't add that back to the main bowl of buttercream you're going to want to keep the crumbs as far away from the final icing as possible each cake is built on the cardboard that is the same size as the cake and the cardboard stays on throughout the entire process even upon stacking the cakes as you are filling the cake be mindful of the amount that you're using for each layer this way once the cake is cut you'll have exactly the same filling proportion to the cake layers it's just a nicer cleaner look when all the layers are perfectly even the crumb coat is rather thin since it is just a crumb coat and this is a very important step to getting a clean-looking final result not only do we trap the crumbs in the first layer but pay close attention that the sides on the top of the cake are perfectly level and even what you start with is what you end with now I do use another cardboard that is slightly larger than the cake that I just iced just to transport it back and forth from the refrigerator in between the tiers repeat the process with the next two tiers and notice that I am using the excess crumb coated icing for the next cake this ensures that I don't end up with a giant bowl of crumbing icing also take note that I'm icing the crumb coat directly flush with the edge of the cardboard after all the cardboard is 100% perfectly shaped whereas my cake may not be so it is a perfect guide sometimes I have trouble getting the smallest here to cooperate since it is so small and it's lighter compared to the others and it just wants to slip and slide all around my turn stand so I do use a damp towel here to keep it in place okay now for the final icing of the cakes you see I am back to the first tier that I've crumb coated and I have been spinning my buttercream on low speed for about 10 minutes to get the air bubbles out and to make it silky smooth now since I just finalized my bottom tier I have to place it on to the serving platter one thing that I will stress is to make sure that your serving platter fits in the refrigerator before you start building your cake you don't want to be stuck with a cake that won't fit back into the refrigerator I do like to decorate each tier separately before it is stacked and again this is just my preference there is no rule that you have to do it that way I am doing a triple swiss dot on the base tier with a number two at eco tip at this point I will also prep my tier for the next cake to go on top I am measuring it loosely with that parchment paper circle just to give me an idea of where to place the dowels but you can use the cake pan that is the same size to give you a better outline I will mark the dowel with a marker or just use the icing as a guide as to where to cut and be sure to cut all the dowels separately so that they are exactly the right height as the cake I typically use five dowels in each tier one in the center and then four around at the edge of where the next cake will sit for cakes that are much larger than the one that I'm making here I may add a few more dowels for added support you can really use your judgement as to how many you want to use here is where that parchment paper circle comes into play this is to create a barrier between the bottom cake and the next cake so when the servers are disassembling the cake for serving they're not going to pull off a giant chunk of the buttercream this way it leaves the bottom cake intact and it's much nicer than with gobs of buttercream missing repeat the final icing procedures and the decorating of each tier as well and be sure to keep the other tiers in the refrigerator in between working on the one that you're working on I am doing a single Swiss dot on this middle tier and then prepping it with the dowels for fitting the five inch cake topper on top of this one don't forget the parchment paper liner into the refrigerator to chill while we go on to the next tier this one I am doing just a delicate cascade dots to tie in the whole Swiss dot themed after the icing and decorating process I make sure that all the tiers have chilled in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes before stacking I will use a very light buttercream to act as the glue for each tier and this goes directly on top of the parchment paper liner remember the cardboard is still under each cake tier place it as centered as possible and then repeat the process until you've finished with your last tiers and yeah you did it you just built a three-tiered wedding cake now for the best part of all and that would be putting on the borders and then the fondant flowers I am using a number eight at Eco tip for the borders and by the way everything I use today is found in my Gretchen's bakery essentials

will need either a dummy or a real cake two acrylic plates the larger one must be at least six inches wider than your cake this allows enough room to use a smoother Sarah Chino passed atop some tracks a rolling pin a blunt kitchen knife and a sharp edge smoother you may need an occupant in need of those pesky little air bubbles grab some tracks smooth it into the side unto the top of the cake making sure that it's completely covered if you are covering a dummy cake place a small weight behind covered in cling film this prevents the cake from moving if it was a real cake you don't need to do this warm up your pace with your hands making sure there's no cracks so it's nice and smooth once you start rolling keep the paste round so it's easier for you to cover your cake place your cake onto the smaller plate and lift it over your pace so that you can see if you've rolled your paste out big enough gently place the paste over your cake making sure that you have enough to completely go all the way around the cake using the palm of your hand just gently smooth it around the cake to fill there's any air bubbles make sure that you remove the weight before you start attaching the paste to the side of your cake using the palm of your hand and working the top part of the cake to begin with gently push in not too hard so that your pace is attached to the cake then you can work round the size the cake going down lifting up the pace at the bottom little by little making nice smooth sides once this is done you need to trim off the excess leaving about five now at the bottom for when you flip the cake over lightly dust your cave with ice your sugar place a large plate on top of the cake then with one hand place in the middle on the top and the other one directly beneath the cake then flip your cake over using the palms of your hands to gently put the pace so that's attached to the cake then with your spare hand likely place it on top of the cake do not push down holding the smoother at the bottom making sure it's in contact with the plate and the cake at all times then you need to push the smoother into the cake then rocking it forwards and then backwards so you're pushing the paste one way and then pulling it back into this way this is how you create there's perfect sharp edges you will start to notice that they were no longer being a gap between the paste and the plate for taller cakes place your hand higher up on the handle and press into the top and smooth round which is making sure that the paste is stuck to the cake using a knife cutting from the outside to the inside making sure that the pace is attached to your cake place the small acrylic plate on the top then flip the cake back over using a soft brush to remove any excess icing sugar your cake should now look like this perfect sharp edges and smooth vertical sides once you have stacked your cake this sketch will show you how to mark your cake to position the ruffles you can use a lead-free pencil or does one of your tools to do the markings on your cake for the ruffles I have used a sarah tuner wafer paper cut into strips they're around about 35 to 40 mil and then cut into squares they don't have to be perfect or the same size you will also notice that there is a rough and a smooth side you need to place the rough side up gently spray with some cold water then start to fold them in different positions twisting and folding the paper in different directions making sure that you have a lot made up before you start applying to the cake attach these to the cake you will need a scribe a tool a brush edible glue or piping gel making sure you put plenty of glue under the ruffle so that you can attach it to the sides of the cake as well as the board then you can start adding more ruffles as you go along I then started on the other two tears so that the angle of the ruffles would look the same keep working on all three teeth applying the ruffles in position and using pins to keep them pace until they are dry work all the way around the cake till you become to the top remove the pins when your ruffles are set ribbon your board your cake is now finished you", "flLJs7BCjpI": "wedding cakes have become bigger and more elaborate over the years today's wedding cakes are multi-tiered and even multi-flavored they're typically covered in fondant icing and decorated with ornate sugar flowers the finished product is an edible work of art perfect for that special day these customized wedding cakes are covered in fondant this special icing acts as a canvas on which delicious designs can be created the Baker starts by making chocolate cakes for the bottom tier once the cakes come out of the oven she transfers them directly to the fridge the cool firm cakes are easy to slice into layers she spreads buttercream frosting between the layers the frosting ingredients include lightly salted butter icing sugar and Dutch cocoa powder layer by layer she builds the tier to the desired height she puts the tear back in the fridge while it's solidifying she makes the gum paste that will be used to craft the edible flowers first she adds icing sugar to egg whites [Music] then fins out the mixture with a teaspoon of water next she adds food coloring she mixes the ingredients for a couple of minutes until they're thoroughly blended she adds tylose powder a synthetic version of gum arabic to harden the mixture after another 15 seconds of mixing the gum paste is ready for kneading the baker rubs some vegetable shortening on her hands for lubrication she sprinkles some icing sugar on the table to prevent the gum paste from sticking then she needs the gum paste for 5 to 10 minutes now the artistry begins she uses a set of modeling tools made of food safe nonstick plastic first she makes a little hat out of the pink gum paste then she rolls out another piece until it's paper thin the baker uses a gum paste cutter to cut out several teardrop shapes one at a time she lays the teardrops out on a hard foam mat she things and curls the edges with a ball tipped modeling tool to create a natural-looking rose petal then she switches to a scribe tool she curls back the edges to make the pedal even more lifelike then she applies tasteless edible glue [Music] she adheres the first petal on to the point of the gum paste hat she wraps it all the way around to create the center of the rose the Baker attaches the next layer this time using two petals she adds several additional layers using two more petals each time until the rose is complete she snips off the base of the Hat then lets the glue dry for 15 minutes the Baker uses green gum paste to make the leaves she rolls the paste thicker at the base and thinner at the top then she presses the sheet against the top of the board to produce vertical veins she centers her leaf shaped cutter over one of the veins and cuts out a leaf after attaching a wire to the base she uses a silicone stamp to imprint smaller veins on the leaf this makes it look more realistic the Baker curls the Leafs edges with a round tool she is as a different tool to deepen some of the veining and complete the leaf the Baker sets her decorations aside and removes the cake tears from the refrigerator she firmly applies the fondant over the chilled shot lip frosting she made the fondant earlier with melted marshmallows butter icing sugar vanilla extract and food coloring she applies fundin to the remaining tears then stacks them she begins decorating this cake with ribbon an Italian lace she attaches the flowers with stiff edible glue made from egg whites icing sugar and lemon juice she can also make edible ribbons and lace by pouring liquid gum paste into the appropriate molds this special gum paste uses corn syrup and corn starch to reach the right consistency a magnificent custom-made cake is designed to be a showpiece at the wedding reception admired devoured and always remembered [Music]", "9aj_YcD0Hnw": "hi guys in this episode I am going to show you how to make a dummy wedding cake it's going to be awesome this fake tiered cake is just an example of what can be easily achieved with just a couple of things some photo and purchased flowers it is indeed less challenging to deal with a fake wedding cake than edible but dummy cakes have a different purpose and are reusable dust a working surface and fun down with cold start and need the funnel until soft and pliable like a play-doh and roll out into a large 1/4 inch thick disc eliminating any air bubbles on a surface then brush discs lightly with egg white and drive full down over it first one done five more well let's do it again smooth out the surface and pull out with one hand and with the other make circular motions to smooth all it out down and attach to the polystyrene trim around base with a clean sharp blade or a rolling pizza cutter and reseal funnel scrapes for the next disc overlap tears sticking them together with a dash of egg white and insert a bamboo skewer in the center next decorating as you know there are so many ways of decorating cakes from hand craft flowers to purchased flowers what I am trying to show you is that in the cake decorating world it is not that complicated you just have to create an money that goes with the shape of the cake and its theme you can spend a couple of hours or days it is totally up to you guys I hope you have enjoyed this wedding cake episode if you want to know more about it check out my website www.sceeto.com for and follow me on

kind of it draws me in and I want to do something with it I love baking with fruits so more than chocolate or caramel or you know I love all those things but really my my sort of my go-to is to do fruit desserts so and then funnily enough I'm also weirdly inspired by things like architecture and art [Music] when I moved her I'd been a pastry chef in restaurants and I wasn't sure like I sort of thought about doing that here but I wanted to change and there was a new market called Broadway Market just opening and they were always like really cool amazing food businesses that were just starting and I thought that I might as well just do my own thing so I started violated as a stall on Saturdays baking in my home on Friday all day Friday late into the night and then I'd get up on Saturday and I tailed whatever I made so I did that for quite a while and then realized I needed a bricks-and-mortar so I got the bakery that you see behind me [Music] [Music] I received an email from Kensington Palace asking me to come in to have a chat about you know possibly some cake ideas for the wedding it was really exciting it was kind of like really out of nowhere I was the surprise to me completely I came up with a few ideas and brought in some samples and we had a few meetings and and then went from there so yeah it was really an honor and it was totally a pleasure it was so much fun it was a hard work but it was really worth it [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] like any wedding that we would stand for there's a lot of logistical details that you have to work out it you have to you know timings are one location as another how many people with a cake like this is on such a grand scale that we needed to you know have our team at the bakery you know fully in order and then also have a satellite team because we made the cake at Buckingham Palace so the kitchen that Buckingham Palace is amazing they just like her very well oiled machine and they really helped us too so it was yeah pretty straightforward in a way weirdly [Music] you", "ROMiDaI8KwU": "Hey everyone and welcome to my channel\nCakes by MK. So here in New Zealand we are in the lockdown period, and during\nthis period I was supposed to make a wedding cake.\nAnd I absolutely love making wedding cakes, so I was pretty disappointed when I\nhad to cancel that booking. But I decided that I'm gonna cheer myself up and I'm\ngonna make a wedding cake anyway. But it's only me and my husband at home so I'd\nhave an irresponsible amount of cake lying around if I made a normal-sized\nwedding cake. So instead, I'm gonna challenge myself to make a teeny tiny\nwedding cake, so let's see how that goes. But yeah, if you guys are new to my\nchannel then please click the subscribe button below and don't forget to turn on\nthe notification bell so that you're updated whenever I upload a new video.\nApart from that, stay tuned and I hope you guys enjoy this video So the first step is to get all our cake\nlayers so that we can use them to layer and build our wedding cake. Now I've kind of thought this through in my head, but I haven't tried it out so I'm just hoping\nthat it all works out. But basically what my plan is, is I've\ngot a small six inch cake here and I'm hoping that's gonna be enough for this\nteeny tiny wedding cake, and then what I'm going to do is I'm gonna level out\nthe top and then I'm gonna cut the entire cake in half through the middle\nso that I've kind of got two small cakes which I can work with to then make my smaller cake layers with, and then I also don't have any kind of cool\nround moulds lying around, but I did manage to find these measuring cups\nwhich are made out of metal so they're quite sharp around the edge so I'm\nhoping that's gonna act as a good kind of mould that I can use to cut out round\ncake layers. So what I'm planning is this is going to be the size for the bottom\ntier, then the second tier will be this size, but then I really wanted to make a\nthree-tier cake but I couldn't find anything that was kind of small enough\nto then cut out a round circle that was going to be smaller than this,\nso then what I thought is for that part I'm just gonna use a small knife to cut\nout the round layers for the top tier. So I don't know, sounds like it's gonna work\nout in my head but let's just try it out and see how it goes. Also this is a vanilla cake recipe that\nI'm using and I've got the full recipe to that on my blog which I'll post a\nlink to below. Now to cut the middle of the cake I'm going to use a cake leveller\nfor that because I want to make sure that it comes out really really straight All right so we should have two really\nnice flat layers. Yep, there we go. Alright so I've got two nice cake layers\nwhich I can work with now, and first what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna make the\nlittle cake layers for the bottom tier of the cake and I'm gonna use the big\nmeasuring cup for that. All right so I've got a really nice\ncircle but it's stuck, so I'm hoping that it's gonna come out. Yay\nokay cool we've got our first layer for our bottom tier and I'm gonna go ahead\nand do the second one. It's looking really cool! Now for our middle layer So I'm on to the final tier now, I'm\ntrying to figure out the best way to cut out these little circles. I was just\ngoing to use this little knife and kind of cut out the little circles myself but\nthen I need to measure it against the second tier to make sure\nthat the top tier isn't too small or too big, so I thought what I'd do instead is\nI'm gonna cut out two more of these and then from that I will then cut around it\nto make it a little bit smaller for our top tier and I'm hoping that's gonna be\nthe best way so yeah I'm just going to go ahead and try it out So I've managed to cut out a small\nlittle layer there so I'm going to do the same thing with the other one. Okay\ncool so that actually worked out pretty well I'm pretty impressed with how they\ncame out, so yeah so I've got the two layers for each tier and now what I'm\ngonna do is I'm just gonna clean this up and then I'm gonna get some icing and\nwe're gonna start icing these cakes. So I'm all cleaned up now and I'm ready to\ndo the crumb coat on each of our three tiers. So for our crumb coat today I'm\nusing a vanilla swiss meringue buttercream and I do have a video\ntutorial on how to make this buttercream and I'll post a link to that below, so\nyeah I'm just gonna go ahead now and do each of the three tiers separately So for those of you who aren't sure what\na crumb coat actually is, it's basically your first layer of icing that you put\nonto your cakes to trap in all the crumbs and then you put that into the\nfridge to harden up and then you do your final layer of icing on top of that so\nthat you have no crumbs on the outer layer. So this top tier is so small that it's\njust moving around everywhere so I have to use my fingers to keep it in place Okay so this small tier was pretty hard\nto handle but I'm hoping that once you put it into the fridge and the icing\nhardens up a bit then it'll be a lot easier to handle after that, so I'm gonna\ngo ahead and put these into the fridge now. So a normal sized cake you'd\nnormally leave in the fridge to harden up for maybe about an hour or so but\nthese are pretty small so I'm thinking they're only going to take about\nmaybe like 20 minutes, so yeah I'm gonna pop them into the fridge now\nand then we'll be back to do our final layer of icing on top So our icings all firmed up now and now\nI'm gonna go ahead and do the final layer of icing on all our three cake\ntiers. This cake is so tiny that it keeps moving around so I've just got a\nnon-slip mat to put on the bottom So these are actually really hard to\nsmooth out on the edges, and I'm finding that it's actually easier to\njust use my pallet knife as opposed to my cake scraper so I'm going to keep\ndoing that and hopefully I get some really nice smooth sides All right so I've smoothed out all the\nsides now, that was way trickier than I thought it was gonna be, you think\nit's going to be really easy because they're small but I think because they're\nso small it's actually way harder so yeah I think I did an alright job and now\nwhat I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put them into the fridge again for about another\n20 minutes for the icing to harden and then we're gonna come back and stack our\ncake. So our cakes are out of the fridge now the buttercream is really nice and\nfirm so we're gonna go ahead now and start stacking our tiered cake. Now\nnormally when you stack a tiered cake you'd put in dowels to act as like a\nsupport system to make sure that the cake doesn't crush or fall apart, but in\nthis cake the tiers are so small that I'm just going to go ahead and stack\nthem directly on top of one another. Alright so I've got the tiers on it's\nlooking really cute I'm actually really loving how it's turning out, but I do\nneed to go and fill buttercream around the edges and just kind of straighten it\nout a little bit so I'm gonna go ahead and do that now All right so I've cleaned up the cake\nit's looking really cute and now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put it into\nthe fridge now for another 10 minutes for the extra icing that I just put\naround it to harden up and then we'll be back to decorate it. So our little mini\nwedding cake is out of the fridge now it's looking really really cool and now\nthe last step is just to do a little bit of decorating. So today I decided to keep it\nsimple and I'm just gonna put some gold leaf on it and then it's done. Okay so\nI've put the gold leaf on it, it's looking really really nice but I think\nit is missing a little something so I'm gonna go ahead and just put some large\nsprinkles around it. All right and there it is our cute little mini wedding cake\nis done So I've just cut through the cake and as\nyou can see the layers have come out super super nice, I wasn't quite sure\nwhether you'd be able to see the layers like that because it was such a small\ncake and it was really hard to ice, but I'm super happy with how it's come out.\nSo yeah, I hope you guys enjoyed this video on how I made this tiny wedding\ncake, please like and subscribe for more videos like this and thanks again for\nwatching Cakes by MK :)", "bQCaRpRex3k": "- \u266a - KEYSHIA:\nThe sword is heavy, but I cannot complain because\nthis is what I asked for-- a big-ass diamond sword\nto cut this big-ass cake. - [tension-filled music] [tension-filled\nmusic continues] - KEYSHIA: Yeah!\n- GUESTS: [cheering] - Yeah!

why not draw the one thing i love the most cake and i asked a one star and a five star bakery to make my custom cake come to life and boy oh boy apparently there's something worse than my art and that is a cake based on my art hi guys i'm mars and for today's video i don't even know ever since i can't remember i've always been really good at one thing which is eating and really bad at another thing which is art any sort of art i am bad at drawing dancing singing just don't count on me for that so why i thought this was a good idea mostly because i thought it would just be hilarious to see if any bakery could understand what my drawing of a cake would be so before i could actually send my design and you know i'm being very generous when using that word to the one star and the five star bakery i actually had to come up with something so first thing i did was download this app and the app is called drawing desk and it gives you a kids desk a sketch desk coloring desk for the different artists out there and of course i had to pick the kids one because i am just not equipped to do anything better than a literal child and after a lot of blood sweat and tears this is what i came up with it's a wedding cake at least in my mind it has a flower it has a heart i thought i could do this kind of fade white would fade from yellow to kind of pink and then the heart says m and b for mar and burrito because our love is just eternal there's no love more pure than the love you have for your dog so i made this design i sent it to my friend who laughed in my face and she actually ended up making this for me so if you guys want to envision that this is what the cake looks like that'd be my guest but i didn't send this to the bakery because that just seems unfair and that was in my actual design so i sent my little kid doodle sketch and had them go to work i think for this video we need to start with a five-star bakery and this bakery first off they were really rude and i was just like sir you are not giving me a five-star treatment just because i am not actually an artist there is no reason to be treating me this way what did i do to deserve this other than not knowing how to draw at all i'm not sure they thought i was trolling them or i was insulting them or they just really weren't vibing with my cake but they were not nice but anyhoo here she is the five star cake oh she's slippery this cake low-key feels like she's about to fall it's like she wiggles around i'm just like what you made out of cake so actually i feel like i should address that now they asked me what the filling would be for this cake and i was like my art just didn't go that far so they suggested we do a strawberry champagne filling because it will be fitting for a wedding cake and that sounded delicious so i was like yes we do that this cake was 80 and i think that price is fine especially for it being like a custom-made cake but the taste test will be the ultimate test wow creativity is really not my forte so this cake honestly looks really good i feel like they did a really good job at this kind of weird fade that i did i will say my original design did have more of a white space but that was only because i couldn't figure out how to do the fade all the way to the bottom i didn't really know how to work that kids out yup it is what it is i like that they put the flowers i mean i will say they took some creative liberties with the flowers these flowers look so much better than what my fake flower looks like they put three little flowers and i think these are made out of cream oh yeah they're definitely made out of cream look at that tastes really good when i sent the picture they did ask me what that was i i was just like what do you think that is a sponge because you could be right i mean it did kind of look like a sponge i like that they did this little swirl thing which i don't even know what that is i was just like let me add something that would be easy for me to draw the heart it's also really nice how they did like a big heart and a little heart i didn't really do that in my design but i mean i wouldn't have known to do that it's almost like they upgraded the cake you know i think it's really nice even though apparently they were very insulted by my requests and to be honest they shouldn't be for all they know this wedding cake has some crazy backstory they should not be judging people's art it looks pretty identical to my drawing i never expected any of my weird art to come alive and that's probably for the best and now the one star cake i mean wow i am insulted as an artist i can't believe they did this to my artwork i mean i'm not gonna judge this cake because i feel like it might still taste delicious but i literally have no idea what the flavor is for this cake so they said that we're just gonna do a surprise flavor and when i went to pick it up the lady at the bakery wasn't there she was out doing some shopping and she left her kids at the bakery literally the only people that were at this bakery were children who really were just very confused i had no idea what was going on and i was just like give me the cake before they realized that they probably could have done a way better job at drawing a cake than i did so i mean i guess it does kind of have the fade effect but the colors are just completely wrong it's like they didn't even try they made a red and white cake and my cake didn't really have a lot of red it had more purple and you know what the only part that was red in the cake that i drew was the little swirly parts and that's not in this cake they just didn't include that it's just not here but you know i feel like this cake is cute i mean i love the little hearts they weren't drawn on they were just like stuck on here i feel like they're very pretty and also you guys this cake was 15 so for the price of the cake i almost feel like it's unfair to judge it but that's what we're doing with judging cakes so you best taste delicious i mean the fate is there it's just not the right colors that it's fading it's just red the top part does have like this little design i mean it looks more like a wedding cake than what i designed and they did put the little heart that says mmb and the flower the flower isn't edible it's just a plastic flower but i feel like for 15 and based on my artwork this is a pretty good job i mean this person what could she expect and honestly i agree with my terrible skills i really should not be expecting much i'm so excited to do this taste test mostly just to find out what this cake is all right we got both cakes here i'm nervous i know i'm gonna be judged but you know if you're gonna judge me on something judge me on my art skills not on my cake cutting skills that kind of hurts it hurts because i just love cake way too much i felt very unstable saying that as i waved this thing around so first i'm just gonna remove the heart thank you that's just what you got to do sometimes oh oh this is really delicious it kind of tastes like a cookie mmm the heart is delicious oh okay five star i see you this cake doesn't really have a front or a bag it just really looks the same all around let's see what does strawberry champagne taste like we sophisticate it all right here we go oh she's soft she's smooth she moisturizes daily she's using that expensive skincare she going to sephora oh god you guys i'm sorry i don't know i'm just made to live a life of eating cakes not cutting them this cake smells delicious wow it smells so good i just want to eat it up oh my gosh okay so it's not very stable she pretty but she unstable she an influencer it's very pink so pink wow all right so the inside of the cake is this beautiful really pastel pink color it's so pretty so let me just try it oh oh oh my that's no oh oh this might be the nastiest one i've tried oh god no oh that's disgusting that's straight up gross that's not what i can't even tell you what this tastes like i'm confused so is it the cream let me try the cream ah the cream kinda tastes like cheese but not really let me just taste the cake on its own without the cream it does not taste like champagne at all where's my champagne we've been scammed i just want the cake without the cream because the cream is not good so the cake on its own tastes fine it doesn't have a lot of flavor actually it's not even sugary why why this nasty straight up nasty just throw the whole cake away the flavor in this cake is the exact same as my drawing how did they get this to be so accurate they both trash wow i mean expectations are really low if the one star cake is not better than this it would have to be literally the worst cake i've ever tried in the history of cakes this cake is absolute trash i almost feel like they did this on purpose because they were so rude and they told me they were doing strawberry champagne but this is not strawberry champagne this is a conspiracy theory that's not cool imagine it was your wedding day and you have some special cake that means something in your life to you and it's ugly but she pretty in your heart feel like a newborn baby and then this bakery just coming for you like that that's not cool not all the way from the bakery where the mom left the children the one star cake oh she's soft but chunky at the same time that was kind of weird okay we're taking a piece of the heart and just ripping it out oh wow this all cream oh look it got strawberry that looks yummy so this cake looks like it's some sort of vanilla and then it has some sort of strawberry in the middle kinda like a strawberry jam oh god i'm just praying for this cake to be good i cannot handle two bad cakes it's all terrible it's not sweet i'm confused as to how a cake isn't sweet she's also i mean it's kind of dry this is weird i mean it's vanilla with some sort of salty strawberry jam not sure why the strawberry jam is salty but that's not horrible i feel like this cake i could actually eat that cake is not edible i don't know which one's the winner this one looks nothing like my cake but it's good and it's cheap and the five star is exactly like the picture i sent them just trash so i guess you guys decide who was this battle it almost feels like it should be a tie but you guys don't forget to check out the other cake videos i've done i love you guys so much i'll see you on the next one bye", "0qIuedNdf3M": "Hey I'm Tracie! welcome to or welcome back to my youtube channel. I absolutely love how this texture turned out! it's subtle\nand yet beautiful; kind of marble-esk and of course the gold leaf is shiny!\n(Who doesn't want a shiny Wedding Cake?) Enough said let's get to it! Since this is only a display cake, I'm using a foam dummy, and to make it taller, I'm just\nusing a layer of rice krispie treats. I'll coat that in buttercream. As you can see, I put a little lid on the\ntop, that's just so I can hold it down and scrape at the same time. That's a\ntrick I learned when I did pottery smooth out the surface of that Icing. here's a piece of mylar folder to crisp\nup that edge. here I've covered a 10 inch, an 8 inch and a 6 inch cake all in some\nmarshmallow fondant. here I'm using a little fondant paste to fill in that gap. and now I'm going to create the texture.\nhere I have some ivory food color, mixing it with a little alcohol. and this is just a scrunched up piece of\nplastic wrap. I'll dip it in the color and I will dab it on the cake like a\nsponge. it creates that nice texture effect I have moistened the fondant just a\nlittle bit with a little hand steamer and I'm going to apply the edible gold\nleaf. I'll have a link in the description box so you know where to buy that. It's easy to place the gold onto a wet surface using a dry paintbrush I have a general idea of the direction\nI'm going to place the gold but mostly I'll be putting on randomly. now it's finished with that beautiful\nivory texture and that shiny gold foil So, recently I teamed up with a company\ncalled SCALEABOUT. It's a platform where you can go on and you can ask me a\nquestion and then I will come on a video, just like this, and answer you directly\nand personally. Go to scaleabout.com  I am going to leave a link down in the\ndescription box and ask me your questions I would love to hear from you\nbye", "4wX1Otjle9I": "[Music] hey welcome to or welcome back to andy's cakery i'm tracy and as you can see i'm about to pop but i wanted to do one more practice or display cake before the baby's born just a few weeks left oh my goodness time has gone by fast and slow and fast and in all my restless nights i came up with this beautiful design with real fresh roses i love them so i hope you enjoy watching this as much as i enjoyed creating it first i covered three dummy cakes or foam cake tiers with white fondant i did a 10 inch an eight inch and this one is a six inch just smooth that fondant onto the chair then i got some red fondant and i'm cutting a variety of sizes ranging from large to small circles these will be for the little flowers on the bottom tier [Music] once i have all those cuts i will thin the edges using my roller and a ball tool i'll put them in a little drying i'll thin all those circles large to small [Music] and using some piping gel i will glue them into each other [Music] and the last piece i'll fold a little more just to form the little center [Music] and i made quite a variety of sizes for those also then i let them sit overnight and dry a little both the tears and the flowers so the next day i'll use a little clear piping gel to stick those on the cake and i'm using toothpicks to secure them so they don't fall off until i have them surrounded by white [Music] ruffles [Music] and i'm going to surround them with lots of teeny little ruffles to make the ruffles i roll some fondant out in my pasta roller i rolled these to a number three thickness [Music] and each little circle i think i did over 300 of these i fold them to look like a little ruffle [Music] and then with piping gel i stick them around the red roses [Music] next i'm going to pipe the eight inch tier right here i'm using this register tape just to mark where i'm going to be piping in this piping bag i have some red royal icing royal icing is one of my favorite icings to use because it dries hard and those strings usually just stay put unless they're touched then i'll put a dot on every mark and this is where i'll be piping the strings i'll pipe some little swags and get them as close in depth as i can i'm using a number one round piping tip [Music] and then i'll add a second row also after those are piped all around the cake i'm going to flip it upside down and do the same thing then i'll pipe one row on the alternating dots clean that up with a damp paintbrush now the tear is still upside down i'm going to be piping some strings below the top or above if after it's flipped over [Music] it's still upside down i'm piping some swags on the bottom of the cake after those swags that are hanging off the cake are dried i'll pipe a second row now the cake is upside up again i'll pipe on the alternating dots [Music] now moving to the six inch chair i'm going to do some deep pipe swags and i'm using this register tape to get the depth as similar as possible [Music] and on this tier i'm piping three different layers and then i'm moving to a number 18 star tip and with it i'll pipe little stars between those swags a large one and two small ones [Music] my icing consistency wasn't quite right so i thickened it up to pipe these top stars and off video i actually removed the other large stars and re-piped over them with the thicker icing with some royal icing i will glue the medium-sized roses onto this tier and then pipe a star border along the bottom of that cake [Music] and i thought i'd add a couple more little stars around the roses now i'm going to glue the little flowers onto the second tier and i'm also piping a little star where all the strings meet [Music] time to stack the cake and add the roses here i have just a stack of cardboard i'm using to raise the 10 inch cake up [Music] and with royal icing i will stick those roses onto the board [Music] and here's the eight inch tier i'm sticking on and adjusting being very careful not to break those strings i'll very carefully put roses on that tier also stick that last tier on there and add some roses on top [Music] the bottom tier of this cake probably took me five hours alone and then the other two probably took me another five so this is probably a ten hour project and here is the finished piece [Music] well thank you so much for watching this is probably the last new cake i'm going to make before my baby's born so it might be a while before i get new videos out depending how i feel after this little man is born if you like watching my cake videos i invite you to subscribe it really helps my channel grow and of course leave a comment i do read them all thank you for watching bye", "L6y6DiiBDXc": "[Music] hey guys welcome back to my channel today we're doing something a little bit different I'm making a wedding cake and I have two days to complete the process so I thought I'd take you guys along with me and show you how I do it this is my third wedding cake it's a carrot cake three tiers with fondant dumpees flowers some piping so I think it's gonna be pretty cool and I thought I'd take you guys along and show you the process so let's get started so the first thing I did was actually make the flowers which I started a couple of days in advance just to get a head start on things and to give them a chance to dry so I'm just rolling out some gum paste and then cutting it out with my flower cutter and thinning out the edges then I'm going to leave it to dry on some tinfoil which is gonna help it keep its shape and I'm just gonna repeat this process many many times [Music] now that the flowers have had a chance to dry overnight I'm going to attach a toothpick to the back of the larger flowers and a few of the smaller ones with some royal icing so that I have a way to actually attach the flowers to the cake some people like to use wires I personally just prefer to use toothpicks so I left the royal icing to completely dry overnight and now I'm going to color the flowers with an airbrush the wedding colors are a peachy orange and a deep purple so I'm spraying the flowers orange and I'll be using some purple fondant later on [Music] [Music] so once that's done I'm going back in with some warm oil icing to attach the smaller flowers to the larger ones which give them some depth and a more realistic look and finally I'm just finishing off with some edible pearls in the center of each flower so now it's time to start the actual baking process I spent all of the first day baking since obviously I have a regular-sized kitchen as you can see so it takes quite a while to make enough cake to actually construct a wedding cake I believe I made nine nine by 13 inch cakes and three eight by eight which is how much it took to make a three-tier cake with three layers and now we're on to day two of the cake making process I'm gonna start off by trimming leveling and stacking all three tiers so as you can see I've just started with a cake board that has a little bit of buttercream on it and then I'm just gonna trim and layer as I go trying to keep everything as even as possible I personally like to pipe a border and then fill the rest of the surface with buttercream just to keep everything nice and loveable and then I'm just gonna repeat the process with all three tiers fitting the cake pieces together [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] next I'm giving each tear a crumb coat to seal in all of the crumbs before giving them a final layer of buttercream [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] and finally it's time to start decorating which is my favorite part of the process so I'm just putting down some icing sugar and then rolling out some fondant [Music] [Applause] I'm just gonna drape that over the cake and smooth it over and trim off any excess from the edges and I'm just going to repeat this for each of the two tees [Music] [Applause] [Music] now I'm adding in some purple detail which I mentioned earlier I'm just rolling out some deep purple fondant and attaching a few strips onto each cake [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] as you can see there is icing sugar all over the purple but that will easily wipe off with a damp paper towel now I'm adding some piping detail with royal icing I absolutely love the white on white piping look I think it's super subtle and elegant and just adds so much to the cake [Music] and finally it is the day of the wedding so I'm just putting in some wide straws or bubble tea straws whatever you want to call them and these just add some support to the cake and after a very stressful 45-minute drive shout out to my mom's amazing driving skills the cakes made it safely to the venue and it's time to start stocking before the guests arrive so I started by setting up the base and then I used some royal icing between each layer just to add a little extra stability and then I use a little more royal icing to pipe a border at the base of each tier I have no idea why I started with the middle tier but I guess I felt like it [Music] [Music] and finally the last step is placing the flowers on the cake I put a few in the corners and then the rest go on top and there we go guys there is the finished piece I hope you guys enjoyed this video don't forget to give it a big thumbs up and leave me a comment down below if you like the style of video also please hit that subscribe button and stay tuned for more videos coming soon thanks for watching guys bye", "NTxgXF54avI": "hey guys welcome to Rosie's desert spot in this tutorial I'll be demonstrating how to create these three miniature wedding cakes the very bottom tier is a four inch round cake and then I've used cookie cutters to cut out the other two tiers for this once you stack them all together make sure that they evenly spaced in between each other so might only be maybe about a centimeter smaller than the other one create a crumb coat on all of your layers the bottom tier didn't actually really need much of a crumb coat so I just went ahead and created a funnel layer on this one however to make a more stable cake and to make sure you didn't get any crumbs in your final layer of frosting don't be lazy and just make the crumb coat you're going in on the sides till it's nice and heaped and then taking a very small acrylic spatula or bench scraper and just going around the cake smoothing down that frosting with your spatula bring that Lipper frosting to the center and then pop your cake into the fridge and work on the other two layers in the meantime right now I'm working on the white cake that's going to be decked out with the pink fondant flowers so each tier is going to have white frosting on the outside small cakes become more and more difficult to work with they tend to move around a little bit so it might be a good idea to not use as much butter cream on your spatula when you go in with these other two top tiers unless frosting means less friction and so it gives you a bit more control and it makes the neater job and I can list below these sizes that I used for each tier by the way so if you'd like to know the exact dimensions in a centimeters that information will be in the description box below the very top tier was a little bit too small and hard to work with and that's why I created the crumb coat made it a lot more stable and easier to work with once I've had at least 20 minutes to set in the fridge even a now if you can pop them on to each other because they're incredibly light you will not need any dowels for this at all stick them on to each other for a bit of buttercream and then I'm going around the very base of each tier and creating a pearl border using I believe this was a number three circle piping tip you can experiment here and use a different colored buttercream for the little pearls but I just went ahead with some white the frosting that I've used in this video is the hybrid buttercream frosting I'll link it in the description box and also in the little eye icon if you'd like to know how to make that one for the low decorations I have some light pink fondant that I've rolled out pretty thin me about one millimeter in thickness and I've used a blossom plunger cutter to cut them out and then I'm plunging them directly into the frosting if they don't stick maybe use a little bit of water to help them in here I've gone from light pink to medium pink to dark pink at the bottom for this next cake following the exact same steps on in terms of covering it with frosting and this particular design was my personal favorite I always tend to gravitate towards the rustic looking cakes and I just use my spatula to indent little diagonal swipes starting at the very bottom moving to the middle once that Row is complete and then moving to the very top edge once that Row is complete it's going to create a lip of frosting at the top just bring that back into the center clean up the base and into the fridge they go to set for at least again another 20 minutes if you can an hour that would be fantastic follow the exact same steps with your other two cakes if you're enjoying these tutorials don't forget to subscribe to our channel we upload a new video every Tuesday once I've set for a good hour if you can a pop them on to each other just layering them on top the icing is nice and hard so I can handle it with my hands and I won't into the cake clear up your cake board if you like and then to keep them similar looking I've created a pearl border around each layer again with some buttercream preferably white buttercream I kind of ran out so I have to use this turquoise color pop your flowers on top and stick them on make sure that you wash your flowers first now these cake are pretty tiny so I had to find these flowers out in the wild so hey at least they're organic but definitely give them a good wash beforehand if you have a little flowers in your garden that you plant yourself that's fantastic as well be a bit of a struggle town trying to find flowers small enough for miniature cakes for the very last cake I'm gonna do an ombre so I've got a nice dark teal / turquoise for the very bottom tier creating that final coat and it goes much lighter at the very top medium in the middle and then dark Reds bottom [Music] stack them on top stick them on with a little bit about a cream and then here have gone in with the lighter teal to create the purl border stick on some flowers again these ones here I took from my grandmother's garden these are pretty little pink flowers I'll ask her the name for these and I'll list it in the description box so you guys know what to kind of where to find them or what to find what to look for add some pretty ones on top as well and those are your three miniature wedding cakes and that is they create three miniature wedding

"siPNyF3IWX0": "[Music] today is finally wedding day for one of my sweet brides and i thought i would bring you guys along and show you exactly how i stack a wedding cake and deliver it fully assembled and this is no little cake y'all it's a six tier 300 serving cake so come hang out in the kitchen and i'm going to help you cake it till you make it my cake layers are already filled iced and chilled and ready to be stacked i'm going to be using a mix of plastic poly dowels and jumbo cake straws i use the pvc cutter to make cutting the poly dowels much easier and i'll also be using some wooden skewers to keep my tiers locked together there are links in the description box for all of these items i'm going to be sharing lots of great tips and tricks in the coming weeks so go ahead and hit that subscribe button so you don't miss out the first thing i do is make sure my tier is level this is a 16 inch cake and i'll be putting a 14 inch on top of it so i'm using a 14 inch cake board to find the center and i'm just going to mark it with a skewer then i measure and cut the first poly dowel and use it to measure every other dowel for this tier that way i know they are all the exact same length this cake is big and heavy so i'm using quite a few dowels on the tier you'll notice that i didn't put a support in the very center of the tier that's because i use a cake safe to deliver all of my wedding cakes there's a center rod that'll go through the entire cake so i just leave that area open since this is a buttercream cake i'm going to add a parchment paper circle under each cake board that keeps the buttercream from sticking to the board and pulling off when the cake is disassembled and cut and now i just repeat the process for each tier [Music] so [Music] do [Music] because this cake is so tall i moved the base tiers to the base of my cake safe that way i can stack it directly on there and won't have to move it when it's fully assembled the plastic feed can easily move around my work table so it's super easy to finish stacking [Music] i use the poly dials in the bottom three tiers for extra support before the top tiers i'm just going to use some jumbo cake straws that i picked up at hobby lobby i'm short and this cake is tall so i had to break out the stepladder to finish stacking shoe that is a big cake y'all it's time to box it up in the cake safe the steel rod goes all the way through the bottom so there's no chance of this cake shifting during delivery [Music] so the florist left a mix of greenery and soap flowers for me to use so i added those in a swag along with some fairy lights and it turned out so pretty [Music] if you enjoyed this video be sure to give us a thumbs up and drop a comment and let me know what's the biggest cake you've ever made happy caking [Music]", "ouDttUZDgrk": "[Music] do [Music] do [Music] so [Music] [Music] do [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] do [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so so [Music] you", "4_yIHzU7t8o": "hello friends welcome back to my channel today i'm going to teach you how to make this cake you're looking at sit back and roll along with me [Music] okay let's get started you need a set of this four pounds actually is the smallest size so today i'll be showing you how to bake your calabash cake so after preparing my pans i'll have to scoop in my batter so now i'm distributing my cake batter into those pans actually the batter is not supposed to be too light so the cake can be fair for you to work on so now i'm spreading it out i'm using my spatula spread out the surface of the batter and as well smoothen it i'm going to bake foot at 5 minutes with 180 degrees centigrade now my cakes are out of the oven i will have to release them from the cake pans [Music] you have to make sure they don't overstay in the oven so your cakes won't go dry so now it's time for me to start the main work i used four straws strong straws to be precise i had to dip them into the cake that would be down and i guess they are too long so i have to cut them after cutting them i'll carry the one that will be up then i'll have to push it into the shell so they can stick together as one cake now i've gotten my shape the calabash shape i had to use little pieces of fondant to fill in the space in between the two cakes and make sure you use the same colored fondant with the main background fondant too so because our calabash cake will be brown so that's why i use that fondant to mend it now i'm applying my light buttercream onto the cake the work of this buttercream actually is to make the fondant stick to the cake so i will need to rub the buttercream around the cake i guess you've seen what i'm doing actually cake decorating can before no so now it's time for me to need my brown fondant and i would advise you to um prepare this fondant two days before the day you'll be decorating the cake so i finished kneading my fondant now i'm rolling it out so you have to roll it to the size you want that can fit the cake i finished rolling my fondant now i'm putting it on the cake i'm just spreading it out so that my cake will look neat so i guess you're enjoying what i'm doing now i have to spread out then secure the sides and the base [Music] now you can see that the fondant is sticking to the cake and i'm cutting up the excess fondant because i don't really need it i'll still have to cut out more [Music] i'll need to cut off the excess so now fold in that part so it collapsed very well at this stage i've secured the fondant to the cake and it's time for me to use my craft knife to do the remaining wok i'll have to cut off the ss fondant as well i'll have to do this neatly so you can see what i'm doing [Music] so now i've finished cutting off all the excess fondant around the base of the cake [Music] now i have the shape that i'm looking for just stay tuned and watch me do my work so i'm securing the sides by rubbing the cake with my palms and also using my smoother [Music] plus my fondant smoother to smoothen the cake [Music] so this is it then i'll have to cut out a little fondant so that the main cake can sit on it remember there is no um board or paper underneath so that little piece of fondant is what the cake is sitting on so i'll need to secure it then cut off any excess fondant around the base so this is my cake i'll now have to make it look very neat then place it on the main cake i've already covered the main cake that's the base this cake you're seeing down the white one i covered it earlier so now i'm going to start forming my color brush funnel so you have to roll it like as as if you're really now the funnel that you're moving a funnel then after getting the shape you have to use your rolling pin that's the short scan rolling pin to create that hole actually where the wine will be coming out from the pound wine so now i guess mine is too long i will have to cut it yeah this size lens is okay then i'll have to rub a little water on the cake then stick the calabash funnel that will move it on top so i'll still insert my strong strap to go down so it can hold now some people might decide to leave their calabash like this but i always love to make it look very real so i will have to roll out some fondant strips with my hands actually then i'll have to cover the neck of the color brush let's say i'm doing this so that even if the color bash falls the neck will not break so i've put it around the neck of the color brush so it's just a matter of being creative nothing more so now we are going to put our pound wine a lot of people they use um realizing to do that but i love using fondant so everything will be dry it's not as if this is a real color brush with penguin we're trying to do something we're trying to be creative you're quite trying to make it look like the mentee so i'm trying to use this to show people that this is a caliber scarring some wine inside so i guess this white fondant is representing my palm wine as you can see it's overflowing so the palm one is kind of coming out small and what i see is pouring out so that is it that's my calabash cake with pound wine the fondant pan wine so now i'm going to decorate the rest of the cake i used some ghost sequins to go around the base of the main cake that's the cake that is carrying the calabash so i will need to go around i had to put little water [Music] on it just use brush then rub a little water then stick the sequins to the cake now it's time for me to decorate it as i want so i'm using some artificial trees to decorate this cake [Music] so if you see yourself in a place where there is no um cake decorator and you want to do this cake maybe for your um traditional wedding you can also do it if you go to the stores you can get all these artificial trees and use them on your cake so that is all as you can see my artificial trees are standing thin so now it's time for me to form the bracelet that is um the coral beads that the groom and bride will be wearing so um we just want to make it look like a real traditional wedding cake so this is it i had to use my red fondant you can also use an orange or coral colored fondant then roll out some strips with your hands your palms then try just watch what i'm doing and i'm using this a knife to create that mark give it a mark so it will look real you can see what i'm doing i get it looks like a real bracelet so i have to do that create the mark on this bracelet and i'll have to date the second one too then lift it up and make it look real to an extent we all know that his fondant is not the real thing so i'm placing it on my cake then also i'll need to um make it stay well so that the other one can still be sided too um this one i guess i'm sure with it i'm going to rub some water on top of the white cake then i'm going to place the second bracelet just beside the first one actually one is for the groom and one is for the bride so how do you see my cake i guess it looks like a real traditional wedding cake now i'm going to secure it very well so what else okay i'm going to place a topper so that people can just see the top i know that is for a groom and bride that's the traditional wedding gig so big stopper says mr and mrs after today you know that this couple there will be one so now my cake is ready i hope he's very lovely i hope it's beautiful wow wow my cake is ready the traditional wedding cake is ready", "o7ob57igdiA":

garage at his home in Washington State the couple were married on March 17th 1915 but never got around to the tradition of eating the top tier the 67 year old opened the hat box and discovered the preserved cake still decorated in white icing along with it was a handwritten poem written to his grandmother by a friend that Red Deer a Nez remember me when far away an only half awake remember me on your wedding day send me a slice of cake Ronald tells Inside Edition that he can't believe the cake has made it through a few world wars and there are no plans to eat it because it was as hard as a rock the family plans to keep it as an heirloom be sure to watch Inside Edition you", "HOWBiehj9jY": "hi I'm des de Wilson I'm the author of two wedding-cake books both the wedding-cake book and wedding cakes you can make I'm here to show you how to make a simple at home wedding cake and believe it or not you can do this at home there are a few things that are really important when it comes to decorating a wedding cake now first of all the cake has to taste delicious and we'll get to that in a moment but in terms of making it look beautiful because I think that's one of the first things we think about when we think about a wedding cake there's some tools that you're going to need now first of all wedding cakes are usually constructed out of multiple tiers and what I have here is some pans for a really good reason this allows you by playing and stacking with pans in your kitchen to give you an idea of the dimensions of what your cake might be we have a six inch a nine inch and a twelve inch pan and this um this arrangement of these three different sizes up to layers of each once all is said and done will feed about 75 people and if you're an avid home baker and you're thinking about making a wedding cake at home a 75 person wedding cake is about as much as I would suggest to to try first time around so the six nine and 12 inch dimensions is going to fit do you very well so you've got your pans figured out again you'll need two sixes two 9s two 12s those are ready to go and then I want to show you a few other things that you really need you're going to need cardboard rounds in the same sizes as your pans so we have a six nine and 12 inch cardboard round these are purchased at cake decorating stores and craft stores and you do want to purchase them as opposed to cutting out rounds out of random cardboard because the smoothness of the edges of the pre-cut rounds this is going to help you make a smooth side to your cake the other thing you need to decorate beautiful cakes is a turntable now this is a pretty heavy-duty turntable see how smoothly it rotates and has a heavy Styron bottom if you decorate a lot of cakes at home even just birthday cakes I would suggest investing in one of these if in lieu of this if you have a lazy susan that would help as well so I have my six-inch tier I have my 9-inch tier and my 12-inch tier now these two I've already put the frosting on the outside and you can see that they're not completely smooth and I did that on purpose because if we're making a simple homemade wedding cake the last thing we want to worry about is you know whether it looks absolutely perfect in smooth because frankly Kate's can look beautiful in a variety of ways in terms of the actual cakes that you bake you can bake whatever cake that you like of course all of these recipes can be found in my books and you can find some of the recipes at da Wilson com but what I did for our purposes was I did a yellow cake and that's because a lot of wedding cakes you're going to want a white exterior and it's going to be easier to frost a light colored cake with white frosting than if you had a dark chocolate cake inside you'd have to work the frosting a little more I like to use an Italian meringue buttercream on my wedding cakes and that recipe is on my website day-day Wilson comm I already have it made here I'm just going to give it a quick spin we just want it nice and smooth so I like to start by putting a pretty good amount of the buttercream on top now this this cake is on the cardboard round and when I get to the sides of the cake you're going to see how that cardboard round helps us the buttercream starts falling over to the sides we're going to use that buttercream for the sides the turntable the cardboard and the spatula are going to work together so you're going to take some buttercream you're going to put it down so that you're you're feeling that cardboard around and because that cardboard round is nice and smooth and round it's going to help you keep a nice shape to the outside of your decorated cake obviously this would stand true for any cake that you're decorating even if it's just a nine-inch layer cake for a birthday party or baked let's get the top looking a little smooth I'm going to end up decorating this with some edible flowers some rose petals and roses to be exact but let's say you have a cake topper or something that you're going to want to put on top you want to get the top looking kind of smooth and then bring yourself down to the same height and spin the cake around and this is going to help you tell whether it's level I like to know that a cake was made by hand so if you see some of those spatula marks as far as I'm concerned I like that even better so now I'm going to use a small offset spatula and I'm just going to make some of those pretty swirls on the side I'm just giving it some texture this is made of two layers of cake and together this makes a tier so we have our six inch tier our nine inch tier our 12 inch tier now these are quarter inch dowels that I've actually already sunk into this 12 inch tier they're going to help support the next tier on that cardboard round it's a quarter inch dowel that you buy at any hardware store the way you cut it to fit is just sink it into the cake all the way down and see you can see where the frosting you can see where the top is you know where to cut and so we can just put it right back in and it will be flush with the top of the cake you want the dowels to be towards the center of the cake because they're going to be supporting a smaller tier the 9-inch tier the first thing I'm going to do is take a little bit of our soft buttercream and I'm just going to put a little bit of soft buttercream here to act as a glue it's really to help the nine-inch cake adhere so I have my nine-inch cake on a cardboard round this not only allows me to hold it but it's what's going to go over the dowels and help start building this cake we're ready to put the six inch on top of the nine-inch two dowels we'll be fine for this last tier so a little bit of our austan glue on this tear as well put that one in place I have it on the turntable because this way I can turn it around I can see whether there the tears are centered which they are but what I can also check is see there's going to be a few little places where we just want to patch up the buttercream we're going to put flowers on this cake fresh flowers are obviously a really good choice for a simple homemade wedding cake because all you have to do is get the flowers you don't have to make the decorations you want to make sure you use edible flowers and if possible you also want to make sure that they're not sprayed I'm just going to go with fresh roses so I just look for the prettiest roses and start putting them on the cake I would decorate it once you get it in place at the reception hall or wherever you are don't decorate it earlier than that usually is like a front of the cake it'll be displayed on a table and there'll be a way that it's facing all of the guests so think about that as you're putting the petals on if you're an avid home baker there are a few things as satisfying as making a wedding cake for yourself or a loved one and with this simple homemade wedding cake believe me you will not only get a creative thrill but your guests will be wowed you can find recipes for this cake and others in my book wedding cakes you can make and also at Baker pedia calm the Baker's resource you", "sfncDVbzIbE":

with another video and if this is your first time here welcome to my channel and if it's you're not not your first time here welcome back i'm a professional cake decorator just outside of philly i've been decorating cake since 2002 and on this channel i show you my tips and tricks and ways that i bake and decorate cakes to help you along your journey so if you'd like to join me hit the subscribe button and the bell notification so you can get notified whenever i release a new video so it happens sometimes we plan parties and we forget to order the cake or the bakery cancels on you or whatever would happen and you realize you need a cake in a day or two and i'm going to show you how you can make one yourself pretty fast using another bakery's cake so what i did i went to the grocery store yesterday and i bought two round cakes so when you go to the grocery store you get these basic cakes with the buttercream decoration and flowers on it but it doesn't look very exciting and you want to bring something nice to your party with you so i'm going to show you how to turn these bakery cakes into a beautiful cake for your party all right so to start i want to first make the icing so you're going to need two and a half sticks of butter a half cup of shortening i like to use high ratio shortening i use sweetex you can also use crisco i prefer high ratio shortening because it has a better mouth feel but you can use whatever shortening you have two pounds of 10x powdered sugar and of course wilton clear vanilla my favorite it is a little difficult to find right now i hope it's just because of corona but i love this stuff i prefer clear vanilla so it doesn't change the color of the icing so i just have my mixer with my paddle attachment here i'm gonna add the two and a half sticks of butter and beat that on high for about 30 seconds and then i'm gonna add a half cup of shortening and mix that on high for about 30 seconds i'm gonna add the two pound bag of sugar if you find that it's piling up too high on one side just turn it on for a second and it'll help the sugar go down the bowl and then i like to cover it with the towel so you don't get a huge poof uh cloud of sugar going everywhere so i'm just going to turn this on uh probably about 30 seconds and then start to add some water i just use this i know this is a coffee scoop but i use this as kind of like a tablespoon to add water depending on your environment it depends on how much water you're going to add if you're in a really humid environment you might only need two tablespoons if it's really dry like it is right here here right now in philly it's it's dry and cold so i have to add about five tablespoons so you just have to get it to the correct consistency you don't want it too stiff and you don't want it too liquidy so now i added three tablespoons i want to check the consistency i don't like to use a scraper blade if you use a scraper blade you can skip this step but scrape down the sides and the bottom and it's still a little too stiff you see it's kind of difficult to push this spatula through it so i want to add a little more water and then turn it up for about 15 seconds to get it really wicked together now you can see this is a much better spreadable consistency so i'm just going to set this aside i want to take a piece of plastic and cover this so it doesn't dry out and then we will continue alright so to do this i'm trying to make this as simple as possible for someone who's not a baker so to say so to say so to speak or whatever anyway to start you this is going to be so much easier if you have some kind of rotating device a turntable or cake stand or something i always put a non-skid pad on top of my turntable to prevent the cake from shifting around and you'll really be able to do this with just a spatula and when we're smoothing the cake if you have a bench scraper that's flat on the bottom that doesn't have a handle sticking out on the bottom you can use this if not we can do it with the just a spatula so to start i'm going to put on some gloves since i'm going to be handling the layers of the cake i have a plastic bin here so i can put the extra icing in and i'm going to get my cakes these cakes came refrigerated i took them out of the refrigerator and let them sit out for an hour or two so the icing is soft and it's going to be easy to scrape it off trying to hold this steady with my bottom hand and the top hand i'm just going to start scraping off all the icing down to the cake [Music] [Music] [Music] okay now that i have the icing off of both of the cakes i need to remove there's two layers of cake here and it looks like there's some filling on the inside so i'm going to separate it remove all the fillings so then i'll have four layers of cake so just have a cutting board here or something that you can rest the layers on you can easily lift it up getting the spatula underneath so really no icing stuck to the bottom which is good and now remove the filling from the middle on both cakes [Music] okay now you have your four layers of cake i'm actually going to use this cake board so take the the cakes off of the cardboard and if you don't have a cake board we can use these we're going to cover this so you want to get all of the icing off of here wipe it down with a paper towel and then we will make the cake board [Music] okay now let's make the cake board what i usually like to have three boards as my cake board between three and five however if you don't have any of these on hand just use the cardboard that came with the cake it'll be a lot easier now to stack this to make it a little more sturdy if you can see cardboard has lines that go across one right as you can see this one bent here so to make it a little more sturdy you want the vertical one way to be vertical and one way to be horizontal so it's not going to bend since you have the lines going the opposite way it just makes it a little more sturdier i'm putting the part that had the icing on it on the inside and here i have a piece of aluminum foil this is actually heavy duty aluminum foil it it's less likely to rip if you only have regular aluminum foil you just have to be really careful that you're not going to pull it and rip it i've done it plenty of times even with the heavy duty i fold in the corners it just makes it a little easier to wrap everything around place this down in the middle and then holding the cake board in the middle i'm going to start pulling this around i'm going to pull it down flatten it and then keep doing that pull it a little more flatten it you know and keep moving it the whole way around the cake this is where it will usually rip if you pull too hard you're going to rip the foil so just be really careful with it [Music] i took my gloves off because i'm going to be using tape on the back and i can't tape with gloves on now i have a roll of duct tape i always use duct tape for this you can really use any sturdy tape i would use packing tape over scotch tape but if that's all you have then that can do when i put the duct tape on i'm going to put it half on the foil half on the board so start putting it on the foil side push down and then i'm going to pull it in towards me a little bit to make it a little tight and then press it down so i'm pulling it in and pressing it down making sure you're not pulling too hard so you don't rip the foil and voila now we have our cake board okay so now i still have my turntable with the non-skid pad on it i have my cake board here my layers of cake and i actually put i made a little bit more icing and i put it all in this tupperware container this lock and lock instead of covering the bowl with plastic like i said earlier so you want your icing your layers of cake and your cake board on a turntable if you have it and your spatula so let's start by putting a little icing on the cake board this will help secure the bottom layer of the cake to the cake board putting that layer down try to center it on the cake so just spin it around make sure that you have an even border the whole way and then push down to secure it to the icing now i'm going to take some icing on the spatula and put it on top of the cake how much icing you use is going to be personal preference i'd like it to be like a quarter of an inch thick but if you want more icing put a little more in there generally i don't like to have my filling be more than a quarter of an inch thick so spreading that all the way to the edges and trying to keep it even in the middle like you want it flat the whole way across level is the word i'm looking for and then repeat the process so put this on top try to make sure that it is that it is exactly on top you see how it's hanging over a little bit on this edge so i need to maneuver it so it's stacked directly on top of the other tier the other layer press down rinse your hands and repeat the process [Music] i'm kind of holding my spatula at an angle here and turn the turntable and it can help you level it off i'll put the top layer on press it down the reason i press it down is because a lot of times cakes settle as they sit and this kind of helps to speed up the process a little bit so it's not going to settle after you ice the cake i'm going to bring back my other bowl of icing that i'm going to throw away this icing i'm going to keep for future use so what i'm going to do now holding my spatula straight up and down against the side of the cake and just start scraping off well i'm not really scraping it off i'm pushing it into the cake so i'm just smoothing that icing that's hanging off which is kind of making a crumb coat we're going to actually do another crumb coat before we ice the cake as well but just scraping that off and putting the excess in the trash bowl all right now we want to put a crumb coat on here before we put the final coat with the textured buttercream so take a little bit of your icing now i like to use an offset spatula to ice i use a small offset spatula some people use an icing tip in a bag and just squeeze it on there um some people like to use big spatulas to do it i just have been doing it like this for so long this is the way i do it if you are experienced and know how to ice a cake you can ice it however you would like i'm just explaining this for beginners so take a little bit of the icing and you want to do this in little sections what you want to make sure is that you press the icing against the cake and don't have any air bubbles formed behind the cake so i'm pushing it down and kind of press it against the cake and then start to move it around what you don't want to do is press this against the cake and then lift it off and then push back down because you're going to get a lot more crumbs so once you press this down on the cake just keep the spatula attached to the icing and start to smooth it around so i'm bringing this all the way down to the very bottom of the board [Music] and i do this in sections so i'm going to do a row around the bottom and then a row around the middle and a row on the top the icing that i'm putting on here is about an eighth of an inch thick not super thick okay now that i did the bottom row i'm going to do the same thing in the middle can you see how thin the icing is that i'm putting on there it's not sticking off very far it's about it i think that's an eighth of an inch or a quarter it's about an eighth of an inch it doesn't have to be exact you just don't want it to be too thick [Music] now i'm gonna do the very top of the cake [Music] now we're going to fill in the top so same thing taking a little bit of icing pressing it against the side of the cake the difference is in this on this row you want to have icing sticking up above the top of the cake because we're going to push it this way and get a really sharp edge so making sure i'm still pressing it against the cake so there's no air bubbles and then spreading it around making sure that some icing is sticking over the top now we want to even out the icing and smooth all of this out if you have a bench scraper this is much easier to do but we can do it i'm gonna do it with a spatula in this because most people who don't really bake that much won't have something like this if you use a bench scraper what you do is dip it in the water i have a hot it's not boiling but it's a very hot pot of water you dip it in the water to heat up the metal take a paper towel wipe off the water hold this straight up and down against the side of the cake and push in and then i'm turning the turntable with my bottom hand to start to even out the buttercream okay if you don't have a bench scraper that is okay we're going to do this with the spatula dip the spatula in the water wipe off the water so the metal is hot hold this straight up and down don't have it on that angle in or out you want it straight up and down so you get straight edges push it against the side of the cake and start to smooth it out so repeat the process dip it in the water wipe it off hold it straight up and down i'm turning the turntable with my bottom hand and just really holding this straight up and down giving light pressure against the cake to smooth out the buttercream not pressing too hard now we're going to texturize this so it's okay if it's not perfect since the spatula isn't as tall as the cake we're gonna have to smooth it out up here as well so if you have a tall spatula this may work out better this one is not offset and i hate when they're not offset however same thing stick it in the water heat up the metal wipe it off hold it straight up and down but i'm going to hold it at a 45 degree angle and try to smooth it out this way so that's much easier than just using the little one and a lot of people may have this in their house so this way it would just smooth the whole thing all at once i'm holding it at a 45 degree angle light pressure holding it straight up and down getting straight edges on the side of my cake if you just have a little spatula then you're going to just do this on the top part holding it straight up and down trying to keep the edges straight it's the trickiest part so you don't you don't want to push too hard and cause the cake to start coming tapering in at the top you want to try to keep an eye like i'm kind of looking at it from the side and making sure that the sides stay even and that is good we are going to cover up all these imperfections so don't worry if it doesn't look perfect next i'm going to take a paper towel this is just a bounty paper towel it's a select a size so it came off in this in this height if you just have a regular paper towel you're going to want to trim it to the size so you can put it around the cake so what i'm going to do this paper towel has a diamond pattern on one side and the other side is kind of just like a dot pattern so put the smaller pattern against the cake because this pattern is going to transfer onto the cake put it against the side of the cake and i'm going i'm going to do this left-handed to show you and then i'm going to have to do it right-handed because i'm right-handed but i'm putting this against the cake and i'm just taking my fingers and rubbing up and down trying to make sure that the sides are still even i'm not pushing too hard or just to distort the shape of the cake and then pull it off you can see the pattern transferred that's okay we're just trying to get a perfect round shape moving the paper towel over to the part that i did not do yet and repeat the process rubbing your hands your fingers up and down we're going to cover all the pattern that was transferred on here is going to be covered so we don't have to worry about that now i'm going to take my folded up paper towel and we're going to get a sharp edge on here same thing you always want to warm up the metal in the hot water wipe it off with a paper towel now i'm going to get even with this cake so i'm going to get down a little bit what i want to do i want to start pushing this icing that's sticking over the top of the cake straight back and then i'm going to turn my spatula this way and push it so you'll see what i'm doing you want to make sure that you're not starting too low because if you start too low you're going to push into the cake you want to make sure you're over the top of the icing so just kind of look it's better to start too high and then you can adjust i will show you so if i start too high i start to push straight back and there's a gap there so you can lower your spatula a little more i'm holding it perfectly horizontal if you hold it on an angle it's not going to be even the whole way around so that's why i like to get eye level hold it horizontal press it into the cake start to push straight back and then down and i'm constantly putting the icing in the icing bucket warm up the knife or the spatula wipe it off now continue so i'm going to put this end of the spatula on that line that i just made i'm going to use that line as a guide and put the other half onto the icing that i have to push back so you line it up press straight back and then down line up the line press straight back and down and do this the whole way around getting the icing off the spatula warming it up wiping off the water and repeat the process [Music] and if you do this right by the time you get to the end it's going to be lined up in a straight line because i've been eye level with the cake making sure i'm holding the spatula even the whole way around so now that this is done i'm going to put this in the refrigerator for at least an hour you want the butter and the icing to solidify so then we could put the texture buttercream on the outside of this so put it in the refrigerator for about an hour or so and then we will continue and now we are going to add the texture you just want to make sure that the icing has solidified so you're not going to mess up the shape of the cake as we do this next part i have my icing here just gonna mix it up a little bit get your spatula and what i'm gonna do is put a really really thin coating of icing on the whole cake [Music] now you don't have to be perfect with this we're just trying to get some icing on so we can get some texture on the cake i'm actually going to put some on the top as well and then take your spatula and holding it straight up and down just press it around so it is going to hang over the top a little bit get a piece of plastic and crumble it up and we're going to texturize it using the plastic so i'm going to hold it against the side of the cake again i'm using my other hand to turn the turntable and i'm going to hold this pretty much steady hold it against the side of the cake and start to make little swipes i really should do this left-handed but no actually i will so you can see what i'm doing so i'm going to turn the turntable with my bottom hand and just start making little spikes this makes a really pretty pattern in the cake i really like doing this texture you may find the buttercream starts to glob so if you want to you can fold this in on itself or go grab another piece and continue the process so you don't want too much icing on the cake right now because you're kind of just really putting a pattern in it you're really not trying to take too much icing off if you have too much icing on it's just gonna make a mess so that's why we put a thin layer of icing on when we do this i'm gonna go get another piece same thing crumble it up and start again so just until you get the desired look to your cake for the top of the cake i'm just going to get rid of the excess that's hanging off and then make the texture on the top of the cake just turning it in a circle grabbing a new piece of plastic as it gets gross and just keep refining this and there you go that looks pretty good now i just want to clean up the cake board so you can wet a paper towel and just try to wipe the excess icing away [Music] now if you want to finish off with a ribbon and make it pretty you can so lifting off the non-skid pad from underneath here it just the ribbon sets easier sits easier against the board if i don't have the non-skid pad on there i have a stick of non-toxic glue what i like to do is just press it against the side of the cake because the aluminum foil is sticking out a little bit here and i want it to be as flat as possible so the ribbon will be flat against the board hold the cap down press it against the cake board to really try to flatten the foil [Music] and now this is going to stick much easier since this is only two boards i need only a thin ribbon it's three eighths so just take your ribbon wrap it around the cake board to see how long it has to be make sure it overlaps a little bit and then just cut it off here now i'm going to take my glue stick and put glue around the perimeter of the cake board and on the whole strip of ribbon this is disappearing purple so this will turn clear it's only purple so you can see where the glue is being placed find the front of your cake there's always i say there's always a part that looks the prettiest and most symmetrical so just turn it around see what you want to be the front and i like this the best i think so the back is going to be right here that's where i'm going to start the ribbon pushing it against the side and then i'm holding it with one thumb and pulling it without my other hand and push it against the side of the cake board and continue the whole way around [Music] when you get to the end take the part that's going to be overlapping and just make sure you put glue on that part of the ribbon that it's going to be touching [Music] and then you can seal it and now i can tell where the front of my cake is because the back is going to be where the ribbon meets so i'm just going to turn it around here's the front of my cake now i just want to show some options for decorating i you can always go to a local craft store if you have time you can actually order a topper from etsy or or you know amazon can even send you something pretty quick etsy usually takes a little while but i just went to the local craft store and i bought this topper so if this were to be a wedding shower or an anniversary cake or a wedding cake or you know whatever it would be so you can put that that in the top like that totally adorable i wanted to give you some other options as well if you are in a pinch this is why i'm showing this option here because a lot of times people need a last-minute cake and i'm gonna have to do this at the last minute so you may not have time to make decorations i went online and this is my name and i just googled carolyn name two separate words carolyn and name and then i clicked on images and this picture came up and i've i've done it for so many names my name is not very popular the way that it's spelled but it still came out that way so for the most part if the name isn't too unique you should be able to google it and find the name somehow printed in a funky little font like that so if it's for someone's birthday you could do their name if it's not if it's if it's a captain america theme i just did for another example print out whatever pictures you would want to put on the cake these are not going to actually touch the cake so i'm going to use some packing tape which really is not food safe however it's not going to be on the cake it will be okay so i just basically want to laminate this before i put it on the on the lollipop sticks if you have laminating paper it may be easier so you don't have to do little strips again i'm just doing this if you're in a pinch and need a quick decoration before i cut it out i'm just going to put the paper why can i talk i'm going to put the tape over the name press down to make sure there's no air bubbles flip it over and do the same thing on the other side in the case of the captain america i'm gonna need two strips making sure the tape is on the outside of the picture [Music] and then if you're doing a strip next to another strip try to line up the tape as close as possible without overlapping at least on the front i got a little wrinkle there if you get a wrinkle you can always grab a flat edge and try to push it out this way flip it over and do the same thing on the other side and then cut them out [Music] then flip them over make sure that they're straight up and down a little bit of tape and some lollipop sticks for the name since it's so wide i'm going to use two putting one on either end and just taping the back [Music] and here you have some decorations that you can put on the top so you can just stick it in the top of the cake like so right and there you have a couple different options ways to decorate a cake making it a little more special than just a bakery cake so here you go here is your last minute cake that you were able to put together in less than three hours including the time that i had to set in the refrigerator which is not bad i rearranged the love letters on here just because i think it looks a little better with a little more character if you will rather than just having them straight across the cake you could do them on an angle too whatever it would be this cake looks like to me that it's about seven inch round the way as as tall as it is it looks like it will probably feed between 18 and 20 people and i will put that back in the refrigerator until about two hours before you're ready to serve it so the icing has time to soften and it can come to room temperature because cold cake never tastes as good as room temperature cake it's much more it's much softer and it to me it just tastes much better that way if you prefer cold cake then leave it in the refrigerator and take it out and eat it right away each cake was 15.99 at my local grocery store so in total the cakes were 32 the cost of the ingredients for the icing is probably four dollars or so and then you have all the little the ribbon and and the aluminum foil but i would say you're able to make this whole cake for to feed twenty dollars to feed twenty dollars to feed twenty people why do i always do that i did that in another video but anyway you can make this whole cake to feed around 20 people for less than 50 and just a couple hours of your time so if you're in a predicament right now where you need a cake it's last minute you don't want just a grocery store cake with buttercream flowers on it get the cake take the icing off and make it your own and it will still be beautiful and everyone will think you're so amazing because you made this beautiful cake one more thing i wanted to say that i forgot to mention when i was making the icing you can color that icing any color that you want so if you want to color the icing i can link icing colors below as well you want to add the coloring before you add the powdered sugar so you mix the butter and the shortening and you can add the flavoring and then add a little bit of color and then put the sugar in it makes it a lot easier to color the icing when you do it before you add the sugar and i'm talking too much and it's late and i'm and going a little crazy so i'm going to stop rambling on so i think that is it for now if you have any questions or comments leave them below i will get back to you as soon as i can and please like this video if you

that it's just snacking to be honest but honestly right now when i just hit it off the bottom i don't know why but the other flavor wasn't burning when i would hit it off the bottom but this one i gotta burn flavor off of it i'm not gonna lie i'm not gonna catch you i don't know why so now i have to hit it until it gets that burnt flavor out of it you feel me like y'all give me what i'm saying [ __ ] if y'all ever accidentally burned the big chief y'all know me or y'all know what i'm talking about but yeah i think that's the end of this video y'all to be honest this is snacks i feel like the new flavors i don't know i feel like these are just they usually look badass this just looks clean with the ca stamp on the boy but yeah that's the end of the video", "RLJYC-lrxnE": "not only was i able to have a wedding under ten thousand dollars but i had a legitimate wedding under five thousand dollars and my honeymoon and no it wasn't a backyard barbecue thing is though it took me an entirety of a year to find all the vendors and to diy my decorations and to find inexpensive accessories so that i could have an inexpensive wedding but one of the big topics that took me a while was to find a legitimate wedding cake that didn't cost 800 but yet would still feed all my guests i am so serious when i say that saving all that money was worth it so that i could put it toward other things and especially toward my honeymoon and toward my student loans so in this video i'm going to share everything that i learned from my countless hours of research to get a beautiful wedding cake without going over budget i will also go over a detailed list of why cake prices vary and on top of that i will share some tips to get a better price on your cake or your desserts for your wedding oh and hey don't forget that you can access this article with more details about wedding cake prices and all the other related articles in my wedding series on my blog to learn how to save thousands on your wedding through the link down in the description so each of the following eight factors do affect the price of a wedding cake first the cake size then paying specifically per price next using sheet cakes additional flavors decorations having a cake stand and setup and delivery let's first discuss the size of your cake so the size of your cake is the biggest factor that will affect the cost of your wedding cake most big bakers do go through a price per slice scale but some bakers out there do still do a price specifically for the cake itself the average price per slice for a wedding cake ranges from a dollar fifty to about three dollars and fifty cents but do be aware that bakers usually just provide a base pricing on their website so any additional flavors or frosting or decorations would then boost that price up even higher it is also important to note that the shape of your cake does affect the pricing so round cakes are the cheapest then square cakes next then would be hexagon cakes and other shapes would then increase the price as well and do note that sugar-free and gluten-free wedding cakes typically do increase the price and make them more expensive next it's important to note that extra flavors cost extra so while building my list of inquiries when i was trying to find my wedding cake i found that it would go all the way up to about six dollars per slice when you had a gourmet price but some other bakers did charge around a dollar fifty additional per slice but to be honest your guests are likely not to care so i would really suggest not spending that extra dollar two three dollars per slice and just stick with the base chocolate or vanilla to save some money regarding decorations most bakeries will allow you to provide your own decorations but we'll still charge you for them to put it on the cake for example i made my own flowers for my wedding and i wanted a small floral piece that matched my bouquet to be put on the cake but it did cost an extra 35 dollars for him to simply place it on the cake once he arrived to the venue but hey here's a breakdown of decorations that can add an extra cost to your wedding cake first having a wedding topper especially if they make it custom second having floral or real flowers then having gold accents and then lastly having fruit placed on your cake so in regard to setup and delivery you can expect anywhere from about thirty dollars to a hundred dollars for the delivery and setup of your cake you can always have the option of picking up a cake on your own it's just a lot riskier and you'd need someone you'd really trust on your wedding day to do that task for you but do note that most bakeries also will charge an additional fee if you do live outside a certain mileage of their bakery hold up one second take a moment to just answer the question down in the comments below because i want to know if you've already had a wedding comment how much that you have spent and if you're looking to have a wedding soon how much would you be willing to spend next let's discuss my tips for spending less on wedding cakes first don't go with the pros so the first tip that really saved me money was that i did not choose any of the top bakers in my city and none that were actually placed on the first page of google so when i called for quotes over a series of weeks i found that they would not negotiate prices or they just were flat out way too expensive so instead i found a guy who was pretty new through facebook and after looking through his cake example photos on facebook it definitely appeared that he made cakes that were of the same design yet he charged much less because he was new to the industry his customer service was excellent and understandable because he needed more customers and to make money since he wasn't a large bakery and he was able to properly provide cake testing unlike some of the big bakers that i contacted tip two is to use sheet cakes now sheet cakes are a much less expensive option to having a traditional wedding cake they also are a good option if you want to buy a smaller wedding cake for your photos and for your cake cutting but then feed everyone with the sheet cakes that's what i personally did for my wedding cheek cakes from a bakery cost approximately 50 per quarter of a sheet and so you'd expect about 100 for half of a sheet for reference a quarter of a sheet cake will serve around 48 guests while half a sheet will feed up to about 98 guests lastly let's talk about the cake stand most bakers do provide an option for you to pay to rent a cake stand which costs on average around 50 and this is one aspect of the wedding cake that people just forget about so what i did is i went to hobby lobby and found a beautiful wooden cake stand and using my 40 off coupon i got it for 15 which then i was able to sell afterwards for 30 dollars and make a little bit of a profit be sure to check out the next video in this wedding series to continue to grow your wealth and be smart with your money thanks for watching", "HuEKpKYlcE0": "earlier if you saw some really special moments from my daughter Carly's wedding everything was beautiful right down to the cake but I found some wedding cakes that let's just say they different okay let's start with this one right here obviously they had a bunch of hunting buddies at the damn wedding and one of them shot the two damn deers who shot the deals it had to be a hundred okay here's another wedding cake we found there we go somebody's marrying a stripper here's another one these people couldn't decide what damn cake they wanted so they put all the mo now and then here's one you won't believe hold up before you show the picture here's a woman that I found who wanted to really really create a memorable cake a cake that embodied what she was feeling ladies and gentlemen her cake her cake is hot you stoner danger most of you miles are hanging open matter of fact all of you because you've never been to a hood waiting before don't put this on black people this is not our doing this is some who it doing right here hey folks thanks to all of you today hope you had a great time remember you can catch me on instagram at icy waters TV you", "fMYu7xHYgGY": "hi I'm Manette rushing owner of custom cakes in Savannah Georgia and today I'm going to show you how to disassemble a stacked wedding cake and also how to cut it in the dowling and stacking video if you remember we used a center dowel for our cake use your spatula and run it around the cake make sure you're under the cake board so that you're loosening it from the cake below this is Anna neat process so be warned use your other hand to study the tear as you lift the cake straight up and off of the other cake and remember we're removing it from that Center down so it needs to go straight up to remove the center dowel you just have to twist it gently and pull the DAO straight up now to remove the plastic dowels I like to use needle nose pliers to remove them and I only use the needle nose pliers for cakes so we're going to pull those again kind of twist and pull straight out of the cake okay and I'll repeat the process again on the next cake just lift it off the cake and set it aside and then remove the dowels all right you need to use a really sharp knife and what I'm going to do is I'm going to treat this round cake as if it were a square cake that's the easiest way for me to cut the cake so wedding cake servings are one by two by the height of the cake so I'm going to go in about two inches and I'm going to cut until I get to about a half an inch before the edge so I'll go in one-inch one inch one inch and then lunch and then I'll finish off this row and this can be for somebody who really likes frost and then I'll take a damp cloth clean my knife go in 2 inches and start it all over again so go ahead and cut until you get to about 1/2 an inch or an inch from the edge go in 1 inch and cut and that's how we cut our wedding cakes", "4FZMb7N1xIY": "hey guys how's it going it's jane over here janie sweets welcome back to my channel in this episode i'm coming at you with a tutorial on how i created this beach theme uh anniversary cake i absolutely love how this cake turned out especially because i used the same exact topper that the bride used 10 years ago so if you want to learn how i made this cake please keep on watching so i'm starting out with my carrot cake recipe i will link it for you guys below i can't remember if in that video i did use nuts in the carrot cake but if i did just so you know in this particular cake i didn't use the nuts but it's the same exact recipe so i'm just going to just kind of eyeball it and cut off the dome it doesn't have to be perfect or i'm not trying to have it level or anything because it is just going to be a one-tier cake so just go ahead and do that and then use your either italian meringue buttercream or any kind of buttercream i'm using my easy meringue buttercream i'll link it for you guys below just to create a dam on the outside because i'm using a cream cheese filling on the inside and cream cheese never will get set or hard in the fridge so it's gonna be slipping and sliding all over the place so i don't like to ice my cakes with it however it is super delicious so i like to put it on the inside of the cake so i am just going to continue cutting off the tops of each of my cake layers and then adding them on top of each other with my cream cheese icing in the [Music] middle [Music] once that's done i'm going to crumb coat the entire outside of the cake with my easy meringue buttercream and again you can use whatever buttercream that you want just anything that's going to set in the fridge is perfect for that so once i have crumb coated the entirety of um the cake i'm going to pop it into the refrigerator to set a little bit once i can touch it and i see that the icing is not sticking to my fingers anymore i'm just going to take it out of the fridge and then put a generous amount of my buttercream on the outside again and that's going to be the final icing or the final coating of the cake so using my offset spatula i'm just going to grab some buttercream out of my container and then smooth it with my bench scraper [Music] once that is done i am also going to add little pieces of blue uh buttercream all over the place and that's just going to create that um swooshy kind of design i don't know um what the proper term is i think it's watercolor effect um but anyway so you get the point of what i'm trying to do i'm just going to do that all over and then bring in the lip of buttercream on the inside so that it's not sticking straight up but to be honest with a design like this it would have been fine as well so once that was done i popped it in the fridge and then i grabbed some um coral color not coral some um what's that color like a greenish blue i don't know aqua aqua color um chocolate um melts so they are not um chocolate chips they are actual chocolate melts because they are going to stay a lot firmer for you so i've just melted them in the microwave and then i'm just going to eyeball where i want to kind of cut it so as you see i'm just cutting it so that once it dries in the fridge it's actually going to come off a lot easier you could also break it once you're done but if you cut it ahead of time it's just going to make it easier for you and i am going to just make some lines um so they look like i don't know like a mermaid tail i don't know what it's supposed to look like but it looks pretty anyway so i'm just gonna pop this into the refrigerator for a little bit and then in to a ziploc bag i'm going to add in some white chocolate ganache and white chocolate ganache is just two parts chocolate one part um heavy cream so if you use one cup of heavy cream you're gonna use two cups of white chocolate chips you're going to melt it in the microwave and then swirl it around until it's completely melted and then once it's cooled down a little bit i'm going to add it to my cake so this is going to create the drip design effect that i want i'm just going to smooth out the top and then in this um towel i have some graham crackers that i'm just going to pulverize with a hammer or a meat tenderizer um and then i'm going to add it to the side of the cake [Music] i'm going to clean off my boy just a little bit as i go and then just make sure that it sticks to the side and then i'm also going to add some at the very top and that's just going to mimic sand for the beach then i'm popping it into the fridge again and i'm gonna start working on my um designs on the side so i'm using a couple of molds here if i can find them i will link them for you but any beach themed mold will do just as long as you have um some seahorses different um different shapes shells you can use whatever you want here just as long as it looks beachy so i'm using just regular white fondant to do that and then i'm going to pop them right out once they're done and then put them to the side [Music] once i was done and i had enough i am using a peach colored um petal dust so these are things that you use to color or kind of like dust over flowers gum paste flowers to make them look more realistic so i'm going to use the peach colored one and then i also have a charcoal one i know it doesn't look pretty right now but on the cake for some reason it's gonna contrast beautifully so don't worry too much about it just very lightly dust um your your shells [Music] the reason why i use charcoal as well as the peach is because it's going to give a really nice contrast on the cake now once the cake is out of the refrigerator i'm gonna use just some chocolate ganache to stick it on to um or to stick my shells all over it the reason why i'm using chocolate ganache is because like i said the cake is um pretty cold from the refrigerator and it's not going to stick to the buttercream but if it was freshly made it would now again this is the topper that my client has provided me i love the fact that she's using the same exact topper from 10 years ago it's so sentimental and i was just like ah gushing all over it anyway so once that is done i've placed my topper i'm going to place my shards of chocolate all over um i removed the topper real quickly just so that i could place the um shells that i wanted around the [Music] topper [Music] so this is it you guys this is the final result i really really hope you have enjoyed this video because i enjoyed making it i love the fact that she used her topper from her wedding um it is one of the most sentimental cakes that i have made to date so i absolutely love it actually let me know down below if you would reuse the topper for your wedding cake because that is really interesting um anyway you guys please give this video a big thumbs up if

love you i'll talk to you next time", "cyirqNeFExM": "hey guys i'm angela braniff welcome back to my channel today i have a really fun video for you guys so i was watching the channel the icing artist and she is crazy talented i'm gonna link her channel down below but she did a really fun video where she challenged herself as like an expert okay she's an expert i am not to go to the grocery store buy a grocery store cake and turn it into a beautiful wedding cake and i got an idea because my children i usually just buy grocery store cakes or go buy the box cake and make it myself which no shame there's absolutely nothing wrong with that i have done that for years uh sometimes we do costco cakes i mean just whatever you know it's cake kids love cake but in the past from time to time i have really enjoyed making like really fun cakes for one of my daughter's birthdays i made this toy story cake that i used fondant on it and like the whole thing right i went all out and one of the things for me is that making cakes like that is time consuming in the prep the baking of the cake and then the decorating of the cake so i thought this could be kind of cool because it could cut some of that time out the baking time all the mess that it makes to bake cakes this could be hopefully quicker now is this cheaper absolutely not i did a cake for my daughter's 12th birthday she wanted a piggy hamilton cake okay she has a pet pig named eliza hamilton and she wanted a pig slash hamilton cake so this is the cake that i made her using this method bought some cakes from the grocery store and turned it into this so when i posted that online i had a lot of people saying well that's great you did a great job but isn't it just cheaper to buy box cake mix and you could just do that yourself yes that is definitely cheaper so in no way am i claiming that this is a cheap way to make a birthday cake okay i'm just telling you that this is something fun that i wanted to try and that i found when i did that for her cake that it turned out really well and i appreciated not having all the baking dishes and stuff like that and having to spend the time prepping and baking the cakes as well i just got to do the part that i enjoy really which is the decorating my son's seventh birthday was coming up he wanted a ghostbusters cake so i'm gonna share with you guys today how i took these cakes from the grocery store just plain basic grocery store cakes and turned them into a really fun cool ghostbusters cake for my son for his birthday again i'm not claiming this is the cheapest most effective efficient any of that kind of stuff it was just a fun little challenge for me to try i hope you guys enjoy let's go make a cake let's go bake a cake except we're not baking a cake we're just decorating a cake so whatever let's just come on let's go all right so this is everything i picked up to decorate his cake with i got some things from amazon i'll link stuff down below in case you've got a kid that's really into ghostbusters too i got the number seven with his name on it from etsy and then i just grabbed two cakes at walmart the white one has like a rainbow center and the chocolate frosted one is chocolate on the inside so i thought it would make kind of a cool layered cake on the inside for him and then i'm just going to start by taking all the icing off it kind of just slides off which is gross and nice all at the same time makes it slightly easier to manage if you can just kind of pull the icing off and it's interesting to see how they uh sort of prop up a badly shaped cake by icing it uh it it really you can kind of see the bones underneath not that great so if you're somebody who bakes your own cakes don't feel so bad if they're floppy lappy and sloppy because that's how apparently the bakeries do it too they just cover all their sins with icing [Music] without a sound and a moment you will cry for help that we only think about our staff oh yeah [Music] all right and then i just took one of these cardboard circles i've had these forever and uh transferred it on to there flipped it upside down and transferred it and then i just took some of the icing from the cake already and used that to make it sort of sticky surface i could put the other layer on and i put them on upside down just so i had a slightly flatter cleaner surface to work with and then i took an icing bag and this is just vanilla white store-bought pillsbury icing put that into the baggie and i'm going to use that the footage goes blurry here so i apologize for that but i'm kind of just trying to fill in like i said these cakes are kind of lopsided there's some a little bit of holes in them so i kind of used that to build back up the main shape and then i'm going to do a really sort of rough icing on this um obviously i'm working with all store bought ingredients so nothing is like perfectly smooth or great so this is gonna be kind of what i call like the the rough edit if you will i'm gonna give it shape i'm gonna you kind of smooth everything out and you can see little chocolate chunks coming through and everything but this is gonna work for now and i'm gonna stick that in the fridge to kind of i don't know solidify i guess and then while that is in the frigerator i'm going to pull out the fondant and this is what i'm going to use to make like the little city buildings on the outside of the ghostbusters cake so i just got some food dye again i got a variety pack on amazon and i used the black and you can use powdered sugar to sort of flower the board and i used black and let me just tell you it took a lot it took a lot and a lot and a lot of black food dye and i still couldn't get it perfect so i'll show you what i do in a little bit but i also did yellow which will be sort of the windows of the buildings if you will so i did a little chunk of yellow fondant as well all right now i'm going to pull the cake back out now that it's had probably an hour in the fridge and i'm going to take the second jar of icing same type and i kind of whipped that up and made it a lot smoother and easier to work with a little more pliable and this is where i'm going to go around and kind of do my second coat of icing this is again it's not buttercream icing it's not anything special and i don't expect it to be perfect so i'm just working with what i got to try to make the shape as smooth as it can be and the outside lines and layers as smooth as they can be and i use a little bit of water as well that kind of helps to smooth things out again it's not perfect um and i don't care all right so then i went ahead and rolled out my fondant as you can see the gray i mean this is with a ton of food dye and that was as dark as i could get it so there might be some trick out there that i just don't know but i'll show you what i ended up doing so i went through and kind of cut out the shapes that i wanted for the buildings that will go around the bottom side of the cake the bottom layer of the cake if you will and then i just kind of was like trying to get creative and figure out ways i could make the little windows the little yellow windows so i just did some lines a little checkerboard and chopped those up into little teeny pieces [Music] and applying these to the cake it stuck just fine um just sticking the fondant directly to the icing so i didn't use anything else to make it stick that was enough so what i ended up doing and probably just could have done from the beginning is to just take the black food coloring and a little paint brush that was in my icing kit and use that to kind of just paint over the outside of the fondant and paint those buildings black again i probably just could have done this directly on white fondant and it would have worked out fine but you live and you learn you know i just couldn't quite get it black enough so then because i had that little layer of black food coloring on there i was able to just stick the little yellow pieces of fondant directly onto the cake and that held them on so i didn't again have to use any additional products to try to make those stick like a night sky in july cause you you never leave me and now comes the fun part i get to add all the decorations so i got the little sign that says jonah from etsy i realize after the fact that it kind of looks like a 70 instead of a seven but that's okay and then this really fun like icing drip it kind of looks like slimer slime which was sort of my intention there so i thought that was really fun and then i just stuck my little figurines in there and gave them a little bit of balance and grip with some extra icing and that was kind of it i feel like it turned out just really fun jonah absolutely loved it and i i'm proud of it i think it's a fun cake and i really have found that i enjoy cake decorating who knew [Music] so there you have it my son's ghostbusters cake now of course there's things i would potentially change or do differently nothing is ever perfect but it was a fun project something i really enjoyed and it let me get a little creative with the decorating and not have to worry too much about the baking in the mess so i hope you guys enjoyed today's video if you did be sure to give it a thumbs up subscribe to my channel if you've not already and i will see you all again very soon bye cause you you never leave me dry you all my life", "R8pKyW9ueSE": "hello everyone is tony and i am here again with another one of your wedding requests and I just got a message all the way from Guyana Nicola axes if I could recreate a three tiers chandelier cake scene well it looks like these cake stands are going for around 140 dollars I want to show you how you can create your own three-tiered cake stand with light for about thirty-five dollars so this project I went online again to shop wild things calm and I ordered a 20-yard roll of iridescent crystal gemstones for twenty dollars to hold your cakes for just a few dollars each you can get lots of different sized platters at Party City I'm making a stand for an 8 inch 10 inch and 12 inch cakes from Party City I picked up a 16 inch acrylic platter and a few 10 inch clear acrylic dinner plates and since I already had this I'm using a 12 inch platter that I got from Dollar Tree also from Dollar Tree I'm using three medium size acrylic bowls and very small push lights to put everything together I'm using gorilla glue epoxy and hot glue gun okay now let's get started now since I couldn't find a really small platter to hold my 8 inch cake I picked up a pack of clear acrylic plates from Party City and since the plates weren't as thick as I'd like I decided to glue three of them together to make a stronger plate [Music] so I turned all the bows upside down and with the epoxy I glued the different sized platters to each of the bowls I put book on top of them the weigh them down and keep it in place and I let them dry for an hour now that they're dry I'm going to measure out my acrylic crystals from the top of the platter to the bottom I'm going to cut it so that I have a small bead at the top I'm cutting a number of these the same size and I'm going to hot glue it to the ridge of the platter I'm putting the hot glue between the big bead in a small B and I'm gluing that right in a little indentation of the platter when you hot glue and you want to hold it there for about 25 to 30 seconds I'm gluing long strands around each piece every other indentation then I'm going to come back and cut shorter pieces and glue those pieces in between each piece so that the piece is alternating sizes when you're done you have your three crystal chandelier tiered pieces now to make this glow just use a tap light underneath the bowl for each level [Music] and you can use this as a crystal spin and just put your entire cake on top of it or you could put the tiers in between the cake put the largest platter down over the push light put your cake down put a round cake board on top of your cake a little bigger than the bowl that's attached to your platter oh and before you put your cake board down I will cut pieces of wax paper the size of your cake board to put on top of your cake underneath your board then put push light in the center and then your next tiered level on top of that [Music] after it's all set up and the lights are turned on you can attach two tiers to the cake board with a few pieces of clear tape that way it will be easier to lift the top tiers off when you want to get to the next cake and since there's wax paper underneath the tier will come off real easy and you can just remove and discard the wax paper without disturbing the cake too much so there you are

5 inch 3 layered cake and it's already crumb coated and i'm covering with italian meringue buttercream [Music] italian buttercream is more stiff i'm going to repeat this process adding buttercream with my spatula and then scraping out with my bench scraper and i'm going to smooth out the top with my offset spatula [Music] repeat until you achieve a smooth and nice cake body now i'm done with smoothing my cake we're almost done we just need to add the decorating pieces [Music] i prepared my pieces yesterday and i dried it overnight it came out really nice with this smooth texture and it almost looked like a chiffon fabric i'll show you how i made this after the arrangement and i'm going to add some light texture on my cake before adding the light texture i always check if my cake edges are sharp enough and my cake body is straight if i'm just adding some texture on my cricut cake it won't look as nice as the straight cake body so i always check before adding some textures [Music] so my cake is prepared and i'm going to have this texture part as the front of my cake i also decided to use this biggest part as the main center piece so my whole idea was having a cake that looks like a chiffon fabric it's like very silky and wavy and very feminine and delicate so i was thinking how to create this mood with my fabric looking rice paper pieces so i thought it'd be good to have some pieces on the top mainly but other smaller pieces can be on the side of the cake so it can create some flow from the top to bottom [Music] it's not easy to just decide everything inside my head so i like to pick up the smaller pieces and move around and play with it and decide where i should place the smaller piece do here we have the final piece i think it looks really nice with just using rice paper now i'll show you how i made this rice paper pieces i prepared a bowl of hot water and i brought silicon mat and place it on my baking sheet and i wanted my rice paper to have some curvy lines so i made my silicone mat in a wavy shape so the first piece i used two sheets of rice paper to make a thicker centerpiece and once it's soft i lift it up and kind of slap it on my silicone pad to have a nice and natural drapes if you just wrinkle with your hands it won't look really natural so i recommend you to kind of slap it on your silicone mat you", "Dfg5387cTQs": "so the royal couple have they've chosen a red velvet cake and also a chocolate cake and the cake has really surrounded by an autumn theme it's it's got lovely reds and oranges and it's even the flavor I think has got an autumn feel to it the cake is a five-tier cake but it's varied in different heights so there's it's a it's modern but it's also traditional being a traditional stack tiered cake and it's going to it's decorated with lots of beautiful sugar work and there's also hand painting on it as well we've got like traditional autumn leaves really we've got maple leaves and ivy as well which is Ivy is something that Princess Eugenie is very connected with so it's a lovely thing to draw on them and to include there are a lot of eggs involved there's a lot of vaso obviously just for the sheer amount of people that are hoping to have a piece of cake there needs to be a lot of okay there's going to be at least 15 kg of flour I think butter probably the same amount eggs up to 400 eggs it's it's a lot of ingredients it's it's a huge scale so it's it's it's something that it's a bit different for me I'm used to baking on it on a much smaller scale so it's a challenge I declare before

married in Chicago and I wanted to make her wedding cake so we figured out the best way to do that was to actually have me prep all my cake layers here and buttercream as you can see and then take it with me to Chicago and assemble the cake once I get there the rationale behind that was just that I have my big mixer here that beauty right over there which is an 8 quart I can make 4 batches of buttercream in 2 time 3 batches of cake batter and it just made the process a lot quicker so I'm going to show you how I'm gonna wrap all my cake layers prep them to go in my carry-on and also how I'm gonna package my butter and what I'm gonna do before I add it into my suitcase and I'm actually bringing 8 badges of buttercream with me I don't think that for this size of cake I'm gonna use more than six batches but I just want to be safe and I have an 8 quart mixing bowl here that allows me to make 4 batches at once so I was able to just make two of those and I'm gonna bring all this with me it's to be super sure that I do not run out of frosting there is nothing worse than running out of frosting when you're in the middle of making a cake especially since I'm not bringing any ingredients with me so I put one batch into here and then this other massive batch is going to go into here I got this container at the Container Store it's not super expensive as nice latches and an airtight seal which I really like just makes me feel like the buttercream is gonna stay nice and fresh however I also put it in this older container I have which is not quite as secure I'm going to wrap all of these into in saran wrap just to make sure that everything stays nice and tight no lids come off nothing happens because I'm going to be checking the bag with the frosting so it seemed to go through a lot more wear and tear than our cake layers which I'm going to bring in a carry-on so that will just super make sure that everything is good to go throughout my flight to Chicago now I'm going to attempt to put this buttercream as gracefully as I can into my container before I do that I'm going to give it a really good stir to get it smooth and I really like this container too because it's so wide it's gonna allow me to easily restore the buttercream before I add it to the cake down the road this is a lot of buttercream so for about just comfortably this container this we fit 236 ounces or 7 liters so quite a bit about our cream it's very heavy so now that all of our buttercream is in containers it is time to wrap these with some saran wrap I'm sure there is a more graceful way to do this but I am by no means a saran wrap bro so you also could use a bag if you wanted to or whatever method you think is gonna help keep your buttercream protected and safe okay one down one to go so now that our buttercream is all ready to go it's time to grab out our cake layer so I just pulled all my cake layers out of the freezer I baked them and let them cool and then I double wrap them in plastic wrap I am also storing them on some cardboard cake grounds it just helps them stay flat and also it makes them easier to transport so you can see underneath my cake layers I have some cardboard boxes and these are gonna go straight into there and then actually this does not fit in my carry-on so I'm gonna attempt to carry this on as one of my carry-on bags and see what TSA thinks of that I know that other people have done it in the past so I think it will be fine but that's gonna be one heavy carry-on so this is when you really feel like everything is starting to come together you have basically done all the hard work and the last thing to do is just get everything fully packed and then run through all the supplies and tools that you need to make the cake so as you can see for my cake layers I did not level them I decided to wait to level them until I got to Chicago I felt like that would help keep that moisture because as soon as you cut it you're kind of exposing the Cape to air so by leaving that the caramelization on I think it's really just gonna help keep it super moist so this is not closing all the way so that's gonna be fun so what am i ton doing is trying to tape this and then I will see if it'll still fit my suitcase I think it will might god that's heavy that's gonna be hard to carry through the airport all right so we have our cake layers figured out for the most part and now it's time to run through our tools so I meant throw all this back on the freezer just to make sure it stays nice and cool until the very last second for we head out on our flight so I'm gonna walk through everything that I kind of think from the very start of the Assembly of the cake all the way to adding long finishing touches so of course I have a rubber spatula just because with the buttercream you really need to give it a good stir especially when you freeze it and let it come back to room temperature sometimes you can get a lot of air bubbles in it sometimes you also might need to adjust the consistency and add a little bit more heavy cream a serrated knife which I'm going to be checking don't worry but it's important because I haven't level my cake layers yeah I wanted to leave all that caramelization on the cake layers I think it keeps in the moisture and so I wrapped them that way but once they thaw I need to level them and trim them if needed on the sides and then once I do that of course I have to add the simple syrup so simple syrup is just a mixture of equal parts of sugar and water it's really great because it helps keep the cake nice and moist I don't usually add simple syrup to my cake layers just because they're already pretty moist however when you level all your cake layers and they're sitting out as you're trying to assemble everything for a wedding cake they can sit out for hours so with that in mind I think it's really important that you do add simple syrup just to be it's super safe and so you know that your Cape there is a moist the other thing is I'm a someone whose cape on Thursday once I get there and the not till Saturday so it also just gives you peace of mind once you finish assembling it that you know when you cut into the cake on the actual wedding day it's gonna be delicious and moist I have a small and a large offset spatula for assembling my cake tears making sure my buttercream is nice and smooth getting sharp edges on them and then of course I have bench papers so I'm actually bringing two I bring one that has a bigger handle which is great for smoothing sides and then this has been metal one it's a tack oh it's just I feel like because it's thinner it gives me a little bit more control so sometimes I prefer to use this as well so just tack 9 doesn't take up a lot of space so I'm bringing to have some sprinkles to fill inside the cake and I also have a pair of scissors so scissors are important because we need to trim all of our fur me I use bubble tea straws as my supports if we need to trim all of our supports to the perfect tight as we make each tear insert them to make sure the cake is properly supported so I have here some thick bubble tea straws they are 1/2 an inch in diameter Gotham on Amazon super cheap you could also use wooden dowels if you don't want to use plastic I totally get it but wooden dowels are really hard to cut so I really prefer to use bubble tea straws just because you can use regular scissors to snip them as opposed to like literally a saw wooden dowels are challenging speaking of wooden dowels so we have tons of straws to support the inside of the cake and we also have some wooden dowels so I'm thinking this will be my main central wouldn't know but it's not super tall suddenly a foot long so if it doesn't reach all the way to my talk to your ask some extra vowels just in case to make sure that everything is in place there's some great little cutters here that are awesome for cutting flower stems and then of course some floral tape which we're gonna wrap around them just to make sure that none of the fluids from the flowers or the greenery leach into the cake so I believe I have everything I'm going to need to like cake fingers crossed joke will be on me if you guys think I'm missing anything let me know in the comment section but the great thing about you know modern-day is that if we did free anything I can always order it on Amazon to the place where I'm staying in Chicago and I think we'll end up being a fan the end so I'm gonna pack all this in my suitcase with my buttercream on my cake layers and I'll give you a quick preview of what that looks like so starting off with my first suitcase here I'm gonna add my 9-inch cake layers and my 6-inch cake layers I'm gonna actually add a bunch of packaging material around the sides to make sure that everything is nice and secure and then I'm also gonna add some my supplies into the other side I forgot to mention earlier I'm taking my cake stand with me so I'm gonna disassemble it just make it easy travel with I'm gonna bring my non-slip mat here which I'll fold up and I'm just gonna wrap the paper towel around the enter of a cake Sam just because it has some grease on it I don't want that to get on my supplies alright so now that that is in place our bubble tea straws and is spilt in the rest of this space alright so that looks pretty good I'm gonna add some bubble wrap in here also just keep things from shifting too much you want to put this in with my buttercream so I've been saving these up from like every Amazon package I've gotten for the last month and now we're going to find a good one to use that looks great and then the moment of joy for me that literally fits perfectly so just as a reminder you guys the 12 inch cake layers I'm gonna carry on in my hands through security and almost like so this is ready to go I'm gonna set this aside and then we'll pack our buttercream so this thing I'm going to check the buttercream is frozen solid I think if this bag gets tossed around a little like nothing - - fingers crossed oh man James myself knock on wood nothing too bad is gonna happen I'm gonna really well Pat it but it's also just so heavy it's the buttercream this is basically all butter so I'm gonna put this in here and in addition I actually wasn't able to fit the base of my cake stand in this bag I could have but I think it would have hit the cake layers and I'm worried that I would have if it slid it would have damaged the cake layer so I didn't want to put it in there so I'm gonna attempt to fit that into this bag this is like cast-iron heavy it's very strong so I'm not worried about it getting damaged I just need to make sure that everything fits in there so let's start with our smaller container of buttercream everything fits so before I started this process I laid out my suitcases and I did check the measurements so everything to make sure that like my cake boxes would fit in here and then my Tupperware fit in here but you just never really know ones everything is full how it's gonna play out especially the cave layers but I really recommend checking that before you get too far in the process so if you do need to run out and get a container or a different suitcase you're prepared and you don't have any last-minute stressors because nobody needs that you've already put so much time into this process you just need things to work out in the end so I need to add a lot of padding in your exciti case and then there's yeah I am actually I'm gonna add this I'm gonna stop here too but I'm actually gonna add a poncho to the top of this so I'm gonna be in Chicago for a week so I'm running this Chicago Marathon the weekend before this wedding which is why this is a little bit convoluted but I didn't have space in my regular bag for all my clothing so I'm gonna have that poncho into here I think it's gonna act as a great way to help keep everything in place and it's wonderful because I couldn't fit it anywhere else so when I say a poncho it's just like a warm running poncho that you get after you finish a marathon they give them to you at the end and then you can reuse them at the beginning of a race before you start it's cold out you can bundle up in this and then toss it away once the race starts don't worry they donate all the clothing that are tossed erases so it's kind of like a never-ending cycle of warm ups but I think that this is gonna be perfect for this this is actually gonna work out great the only issue I ran into is I was planning to use a 16 inch cake board or kick drum to build the wedding cake on and that is not gonna fit in anything I'm carrying this so I think that I will end up ordering a cake board to Chicago once I get there so I can't believe it but everything - the game board and anything else I may have forgotten it's ready to go thank you so much for watching this video I hope that you find it helpful or you'll be

three-part series on how to bake a wedding cake this is video number two and in this video I'm going to show you how to stack this wedding cake like this and we previously showed you how to bake the cake and cover it in buttercream and coming up in the future video I'll be showing you how to decorate the wedding cake so stay tuned for that one as well and make sure you've checked out the first one let's get started in this video I'm going to be showing you how to tear the wedding cakes that we previously prepare in our first video all we're going to be needing for supplies besides the cake are going to be these 12-inch wooden dowels now I get these from Wilton and that's what they're called the 12 inch wooden dowel rods and you can get them in any cake store you can order them online from Amazon or Ebay or such or you can order them directly from Wilton as well so let's get started stacking and tearing our cake so on my work top I have the base of the three-tiered cake so this is my 10-inch cake on top of this cake is going to go an 8 inch cake but in order to prevent collapsing into the bottom tier what we do is we put in these wooden dowels just insert them straight up and down into the cake like that and I'm going to be putting three in if you're doing like four or five different tiers you might want to put more more of these dowels into them but since we're just doing a three-tiered one and my cake is very solid I'm not worried about it collapsing but it's always good to have this extra support here so what I'm doing now is I'm just taking an edible food writer and in yellow and I'm just marking where the top of the cake is and then when I pull them back out that's going to be where my cut line is just below the little mark right there you can use a knife you can use a little mini saw or whatever you'd like to in order to cut that so I'm going to go ahead and cut those and then bring them back and show you what to do now I have my dowels cut to size and now I just put them back into the holes that we made already like and then taking my next tier up cake so we're going to the eighth inch I'm just going to lift it up and then I'm just going to place it on top of the bottom tier just like that so we've got the two layers here the two tier stacked and what I'm going to be doing now is putting in three more dowels but because it has to go through the layer of cardboard underneath the eighth inch underneath the eighth inch cake I've sharpened the dowels to a tip so that just helps with pushing through the cardboard layer so just the exact same thing I'm just pressing down and you'll get a little bit of resistance at the cardboard and then you just want to press right into your bottom board there so I'm going to repeat that with all three here going through the board and then using my edible writer again and I just like the color yellow because it's just if you make a mistake it's easier to get out then some of the other colors might be just marking there and I'm gonna mark all three of them and then I'm going to cut again and I'll be back when I've got all three dowels cut I have my dowels cut to size so I'm going to put them back into the holes that I pulled them out of I'm just going to help myself there at the back of the other ones this helps to go down a little bit and then we're going to take the smallest top tier and we're going to put it on the top now that's going to gently yeah so then next we will put one final dowel through the entire thing so I have one remaining dowel to put into the cake now this final dowel is going to hold the entire cake together so that if you were transporting it it won't tip over or whatnot so this one goes through all three layers now I don't bother putting it all the way through to do the guide hold at the beginning because I want to cut it so that it comes like a ways underneath the top of the cake because I don't want to have any sort of this dowel poking out through top of the cake so what I'm doing here is I'm just kind of eyeballing it and I know I want to take up at least an inch maybe an inch and a half off here so I'm going to go and cut that off and then I'll be back to put it into the center so I've cut my dowel now and I'm just going to insert it right into the center here and then I've got another little extra piece of dowel on hand to help me push it through here so it's gone through both of those layers then I'm just going to use this little extra piece just to push it down through there so once you have that hole still left over you're just going to take a little pee a little bit of buttercream and just patch up that hole and nobody will be any of the wiser and it is just hidden like that so that's how you tear a three-tiered cake so make sure you check out our other videos as well we've got the video that shows you how to make the cake and ice them and our video coming up will be how to decorate a wedding cake thanks for watching see you next time you", "IdbyQa94MOc": "welcome to artisan cakes where we provide the tools and the knowledge to emphasize you our passion for baking today I thought you guys might want to see a little what we do for cake structure when we are in the process of building a very large design sometimes that calls for additional cake tiers in styrofoam and one of the most common questions we get here at the shop is do I need to put supports in my styrofoam well the answer is yes you most definitely do and the reason you need styrofoam support because it still has a little bit of squish to it the styrofoam will compress and I'm assuming if you're going to do a 20 or 22 inch styrofoam then you have a ton of layers up above that if you have a ton of layers of cake this will compress so just to go back to what we're doing today we are talking about styrofoam tears in large wedding or stocked cakes and our question of the day is do I have to use support in the styrofoam the answer is yes styrofoam does compress if you're using large styrofoam rounds this happens to be a 20 inch if you happen to be doing tiers above this you probably have an 18 inch to 16 a 14 a 12 and 8 maybe 10 and a couple of sixes I don't know some of those might be double barrels we are talking about a lot of weight on the styrofoam and while our styrofoam quality is quite nice and rigid that does not mean that it won't compress it will compress so let's talk about how I create my supports so the first thing you're gonna notice is this PVC pipe coming up the middle yes I do use PVC in my large wedding cakes this is a guide portion we will actually have a PVC piece that will breach primarily two-thirds of the way up the cake so even though this one stops here we go much taller and then we use heavy-duty MDF boards or masonite boards on the bottom get that out of your way so you can see and to that we have something called a floor flange this can be found in your hardware store I like the galvanized and they're a little more food safe I would still do a coating a PME spray or a quick lacquer possibly coat it in chocolate something so this doesn't actually touch your cake if you're putting cake directly on it in this case we are going styrofoam on this layer so the first thing I have is a corrugated round with the center cutout for the floor flange and what this does is eliminate this this little gap the space if I were to put the styrofoam directly down there'd be a little bit of wiggle because the styrofoam wouldn't be able to get past this floor flange so to fix that I put one piece of corrugated that's roughly the height of the floor flange I have four flat screws holding that in place this happens to be a adapter for a half inch PVC and you'll see it's designed to screw directly into that floor flange so it goes in nice and tight PVC just slides into that and I'm not I've got a nice sturdy straight pole that's going to keep my cake upright it's especially useful if I'm doing chandelier or hanging cake tables everybody gets a little nervous when I start hanging things off the ceiling I have a one-inch hole cut out to a loud room for the PVC pole that gives me plenty of wiggle room all the way around so they get it lined up exactly the way I like it I've also taken time to use a styrofoam cutter or styrofoam melter and we use the single plate or SPS plate systems and I've taken just a moment to measure this space and I used my styrofoam melting tool to cut that out slightly then I used hardwood dowels notice I said hardwood not bamboo not softwood that is a hardwood dowel and it goes directly down into the styrofoam all the way through the bottom when you put those dowels in I don't have to take just a minute to clean off a little chunk ease there's these can you see that you want to clean that out so that the dowel goes all the way through the styrofoam without creating lumps through the other side all right so now I have this compressed a hardwood dowel in place I've taken time to cut out a one-inch diameter circle in the very center of my single plate system that goes right over the PVC and then I take a moment to line those little cutouts and now I have a hardwood dowel supporting all four corners just as if it were actual cake I have a column supporting all four corners of the SPS plate it's in there nice and tight and flush that just leaves a little bit of space to have to ice with buttercream or cover in fondant whatever your preference might be and then as we work our way up this cake we use a two plate method so this is going to be for a 10 inch cake this is a 10 inch greaseproof corrugated board we've taken time to cut the center hole out again to allow for that PVC pole and then I'm glued it to a board that's slightly larger the way this works is we place our cake onto this nice pretty board cut it fill it I sit when we are ready to stock the cake on-site we actually use a spatula and we wedge it between these two pieces pop it loose and then we lift cake and all up and over the PVC pol we take a moment to line up the spaces slide this up so we went line that up and slide her down the PVC pull drop it in place and we would do that for every single tear so to answer your question yes you definitely want support in your styrofoam if you're using a PVC Center you're going to need a board that's the same size as your cake with that one-inch cut that we have room just slide our cake down the PVC and then I like to glue this to a transport board with just a single dot of glue that way it stays in place as I'm icing it I used the nice edge for crisp clean cakes and when I'm on site this lifts up and slides down the pole yep that's going on the bloopers reel later so there you have it that's what we do to create our well-supported cakes with MDF or masonite board floor flanges adapters half-inch PVC and the single plate system thanks and we'll talk to you soon", "RAlYJjcS8kw": "the largest cake to have ever been constructed was the one they built for mogan sun casino the cake was 17 feet tall and weighed more than 15 000 pounds and that still didn't cut it into this video's picks welcome to top 10 world and here are the top 10 most expensive wedding cakes let's dive right into it shall we number 10 130 000 dollar cake the first cake on our list is the platinum cake designed by nobe akira and you won't believe the backstory we have for this one now while some of our other cakes on this list were actually intended for a wedding or a special celebration the hundred and thirty thousand dollar cake was solely made for marketing purposes that's right platinum guild international ordered a plane cake and they draped it with platinum necklaces rings brooches and some other types of jewelry the reason they thought that their customers would be attracted by smashing that like button if you haven't done so already but no they actually thought that the shiny jewelry on the cake would attract customers and they would be drawn to buying more we don't really know if it worked but we know that the cake had platinum flakes all over the cake so pooping gold is finally a thing number nine 850 000 cake the price jumped pretty damn high with this one and it's just our second pick for those of you that don't know this cake was also created for advertising purposes the department store takashimiya and osaka japan wanted to attract customers to their storefront so they built a chocolate cake and then gave it a little bling 850 dollars worth of it to be exact a hundred diamonds covered the chocolate sculpture top a 14 inch cake and after the holiday season was over it was said that these guys actually listed this cake at auction let's just hope someone is crazy enough to buy 50 carats worth of diamonds on a damn cake number eight 1.3 million dollar cake now this is a very small cake but it's very expensive and we can say that we absolutely love this cake we know that many wedding cakes are actually big but this one is small compact and elegant and expensive as hell it was created for the dallas bridal fair back in 2010 where it was kept on public display so numerous people were seen taking photos of the cake to transport this little fortune an armored vehicle along with 24-hour security watch was sent to accompany this red jewel the edges were covered in luster dust frosting and there are silver leaf decorations all over the cake oh and there are 240 diamonds on this cake worth of upwards to one million dollars so yeah number seven five million dollar cake and with this cake we dive into the bonanza of extravaganza why because this cake looks like a chocolate mistake that fell into a pit of diamonds tip side down now one jeweler owner in south africa wanted to create a cake with which he could showcase the riches of the african continent the cake is fully made up of chocolate and in the shape of an african continent nothing special right well what about the diamond covered borders in southern parts of the cakey continent covered in just 2000 of them this was done in order to symbolize all the diamond mines in south africa just please don't tell us people actually ate those number six 20 million dollar cake this is one of the most expensive cakes in the entire world it was designed and created by naid parsa and the cake set the owner back in eye popping 20 million dollars the cake was built so elegantly that you don't even notice all the jewelry and the diamonds placed on top of it and since the occasion was luxury bridal shower the fondant and decorations were shaped in the form of a bridal gown that draped over the tiered cake at the bottom there was a row of pink roses and the entire cake is covered in golden flakes but the tricky part came when the crew had to transport this cake 20 million dollars worth of jewelry is not something you should take lightly so six bodyguards made sure the cake reached its destination presidents don't get that many bodyguards number five 30 million dollar cake buddy valastro from cake boss has made some pretty crazy cakes in his life but none were as crazy as the 30 million dollar cake he had to build for devorah's diamond gala but he had to make this cake on camera and had a security guard breathing down his neck the whole step of the way this pissed him off actually but the guy said that he was just doing his job after all there were actually 30 million dollars worth of diamonds rubies sapphires necklaces and much much more now the cake was nothing special it's just a plain white cake with some frosting to make the jewelry pop but it's this simplicity that gave the cake a lot of elegance and once the cake was done the security guard helped them load it into the truck and carry it all the way to nyc now he was watching them like a hawk while the guys were cracking jokes about stealing the 30 million dollars number four 35 million cake one tree lunken pastries chef wanted to make his country proud so he constructed a cake in the form of a pirate ship and he had 10 layers one on top of the other and each layer had a different taste the flavors include cinnamon zucchini purple yam coconut chips as well as pistachio rosemary almond cookies white chocolate coconut meringue baked cheese sweet wine berry pineapple walnut pumpkin and lemon man that's a lot of sweet and in the middle was a giant treasure chest filled with some sort of riches and those blue green red and yellow stones you see around the cake yeah those aren't candies they're actually precious stones which explains this crazy price tag number three 52 million dollar cake the national gay wedding show doesn't spare any expenses when it comes to wedding cakes the tv show wanted to attract the viewers attention so they constructed one of the most expensive cakes in the world now some say this a tier cake was nothing special but all the diamonds atop the cake would disagree and even though there were so many diamonds on the cake from a few feet away you don't see any of them which is partially the reason why people criticize jules and tim smith the creators of this cake for taking so much money for a plain wedding cake number two 75 million dollar cake the second most expensive cake is 75 million dollars that how much does the number one pick actually cost for the answer to that question you'll have to wait a few seconds now let's talk about debbie wingham's runaway cake she built for a birthday engagement for an unknown client the cake was built in the for a runway and is six feet long weighs almost half a ton and is filled with triple belgium chocolate and chocolate ganache inside now as for the price tag would you be surprised if we told you the cake has around 4 000 diamonds included in it we sure were and many of the people that saw it said that the little dolls were made horribly but that's what you get when you add diamonds to it number one le novelle now this is what you call a wedding cake now these guys don't charge millions of dollars for their cakes but they're pretty close to it some of these cakes can run for five hundred thousand dollars but it's worth it when you see that some of their cakes are 20 feet long weigh about a ton now you understand why they're so outlandishly expensive now they're not the most expensive cakes in the world but they are some of the best looking cakes we have seen so far le novelle is a family-run bakery from indonesia that is 24 people working 12 hours a day to make these cakes and because you only pay for the jaw dropping design we include them as our number one pick imagine adding 4 000 diamonds on top of this cake and on that

practical tips to ensure that your next buttercream cake is a success be sure to stay till the end where i share a bonus tip if you're new to my channel and want to learn more about cake decorating be sure to subscribe for more tips and tutorials now let's get started there are times when you'll need your icing to be very thick this is the case if you're piping buttercream flowers however your icing should never be runny when working with buttercream strive to achieve a nice medium consistency in which your spatula glides smoothly through the icing and the icing has some thickness to it but never runny next when you color your icing never use liquid food coloring the reason why is that it contains water and this water can greatly loosen your icing making it impossible to ice a cake or pipe decorations with gel food coloring is the best choice and is becoming more and more accessible you can also use oil-based coloring as well have you ever eaten red black purple or pink icing that's had a bitter taste to it this is a direct result of over coloring avoid using too much coloring especially red black purple and pink the best approach is to color the icing one to two drops at a time stopping occasionally to taste the icing now don't lick the spatula of course but tasting by dipping a clean utensil or toothpick into the icing then discarding it works best [Music] icing of any color will slightly darken as it sits over time [Music] are you enjoying this video and learning something new if so go ahead and hit the like button now i always tell my students there is improvisation in cake decorating and this piping bag is missing something if you're just getting started you may want to always prep your decorating bag with a coupler a coupler allows you to easily switch piping tips if you change your mind about your cake design this saves you time and keeps you from having to create multiple bags containing the same color so don't skip the coupler if you're planning to use a variety of icing colors on your cake you should definitely listen up to this next step when coloring your icing make sure that you color enough icing to finish your cake avoid coloring small quantities of icing it can be very difficult to match icing colors if you happen to run out it's better to have too much colored icing than not enough this is whipped icing meringue buttercream is very similar these cakes are covered in american buttercream and white chocolate ganache american buttercream and ganache crusts over or hardens without refrigeration and are more

traditional to the slightly more contemporary that the bride can easily put together and choose to customize in her own way with her own look her own flowers to create a bespoke cake what I'm going to do today is I'm going to show you how to dress your cake in an easy and relaxed way my first tip would be to put some groundwork in you can use fantastic sites like Pinterest or blogs there's loads of wedding blogs out there you can do it the old-fashioned way and use magazine clippings and just get a mood board going hone your taste work out what you like when it comes to flowers colors and that will give you a really good foundation so that you can go out armed with the knowledge you need and choose the right flowers the second thing if you're lucky enough to live near a wholesale flower market I would really recommend getting up early going down there experiencing the hustle and bustle looking around seeing all the colors and the real variety they have and getting inspired by the place it's a really good idea to do a dummy run if you can a month or two in advance so I'm starting at the bottom and I'm trying to get some basic structure in and it's all about staying relaxed and setting your mind at rest you could go out buy your flowers dress it doesn't have to be a cake it could be upturned cardboard boxes or hat boxes or a cake that you've made at home just so you get an idea so that you can practice and have a bit of fun and find out how the shapes work tip 4 would be to keep things simple you don't want to over complicate things by buying too many different varieties of flower I'm using really lovely dark and Emin ease here and beautiful succulents which are excellent to use because they don't need much water and then I've got some really lovely deep tulips here that are a broad just kind of purpley red color tip five would be to rope in a friend or a family member someone who's going to be interested in your wedding and is prepared to just give a little bit of time if you can do a dummy run with them then you can bring them in on the day to help you because you'll be busy being a bride and getting married and then they'll be able to put the cake together as you've done it on your dummy run and it'll be as ugly as you wanted it", "yJibz1JNzFc": "talk to me baby i've been waiting for a lifetime just keep on fading in all these photos just

Jen from cookies cupcakes and cardio comm I want to welcome you to the first video of a three-part series on how to bake a wedding cake this first video today is going to be the process of baking the cake and covering it in buttercream the subsequent videos will include how to tear the cake which is stacking it and the last video will include how to decorate the wedding cake so make sure you stay tuned for those coming up in the future let's get started so the first thing I'm going to talk to you about are the baking pans to make our three-tiered wedding cake the big one at the bottom is a 10-inch round cake pan and that's going to be our base our next or middle tier is going to be an 8 inch round cake and our top tier is going to be a 6 inch round cake now each of these will need to be baked two times so when we're finished you're going to have to 10 inches to 8 inches and to 6 inches to complete the cake this is called a heating core and what this heating core does is you place it in the center of each of your pans if you choose to you don't have to use it but it kind of speeds up this it speeds up the baking time of the cake and you put a little bit of cake in the center as well of the heating core and that leaves so that when there's a hole left in the cake you still have the cake that pops out from the center of the heating core I'm not going to be using that but I do want to tell you about it because it is a handy thing to use especially when you're making larger wedding cakes now these cake pans have straight sides which is something that you want to make sure that your cake pans have so you don't have any angles to your wedding cake and these ones are each 3 inches high and the cakes will be baking to be about a total of 2 inches in height so we're going to start the baking process next we're going to start out baking our 6 inch cake for the 6 inch cake you're going to need 2 cups of batter per layer so in total for the top tier you're going to need four cups of batter now I am using a homemade vanilla recipe which I'll put a link in the description box for you but you can use any kind of cake that you choose you can also use a box mix if you prefer that as well you just need to make sure your measurements are the same at two cups so I'm just taking some nonstick spray and I'm spraying my pan here and then I'm also putting a layer of wax paper in the bottom that just helps pop the cake out a lot easier when the cake is finished so then in goes my batter and I'm going to be baking this one at to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and it will bake for about thirty minutes and then it should be nice and finished so I'm going to pop that in the oven and then I'll have to repeat the process so I want you to make sure that you're remembering that you have to do two layers per size of cake pan our next two layers will be the middle tier and it is the 8 inch so again I'm spraying my pan and I'm going to be using per layer three and a half cups of the cake batter for this layer give it another spray so you'll need seven cups in total for the middle tier and it's going to bake for from probably about 55 to 60 minutes at 350 degrees Fahrenheit so I'm going to pop that in spread this around first and then pop it into the oven and then we will be working on our largest tier next now we're on to our largest tier which will be the bottom and it is the 10 inch / 10 inch layer we're going to be using six cups of batter so in total we're going to be using 12 cups of batter all together for both of the bottom tiers so I'm putting this the wax paper in again at the bottom you can use parchment paper if you prefer and I'm just putting this in now this one being that it's the largest it's obviously going to bake for a longer time it's still going to be baking at 350 degrees and it's going to bake for about 60 to 70 minutes and you just want to watch it to make sure that it's completely finished in the center and it springs back to your touch so I'm going to pop that in and I'll be back with all of the cooked cakes so all six of the cakes baek's they're nice and golden-brown but if you notice when you've been baking cakes you might find there's a slight dome so what we're going to do next is we're going to level each of them off because we can't we need to have our wedding cakes be completely flat so they stay straight up and down so I'm going to level off my cakes now and what I'm using is a large attack o cake knife and it's just got a serrated blade if you don't have one of these you can just use a regular kitchen serrated knife it works just the same so I'm just putting it here and I'm keeping the blade level while turning the cake around here on my turntable and I'm just making sure that I'm using a sawing motion because I don't want any part of the cake to tear I want it all to be cut in this level area here like that and you can see it slides easily off just like that so I'm going to repeat that for all six of the layers now that our cakes are all leveled what I'm going to talk to you about next our cake boards now cake boards are essentially just cardboard pieces and they're covered with foil this one is quite thin it's the 8-inch one that I'm going to be using for my 8-inch layer now this one is a six inch one and as you can see it fits perfectly on top of my six inch cake now this one is a bit larger and it's actually called a cake drum and it's thicker and it's meant to be used on the bottom of tiered cakes or whatnot now these two I purchased locally at a cake store you can find them at major stores such as Michaels and whatnot you can even buy them online Amazon and eBay try those out they're just called cake boards and this one I actually make made you just cut it out out of cardboard and then you cover it with your own foil so that's what we need next to support the cake so now we're going to start covering it by in buttercream so now I need to attach my cakes to my boards so what I'm going to do at for glue is I'm just going to use a little bit of icing just smooth that into the middle there like that and then I just put my cake in the center there of the board just like that now you may notice that because this one is the bottom one it is a little bit bigger than the other eight and the six inch boards for this one we want the base to be a little bit bigger because when transporting the cake you want somewhere for your fingers to be able to go so that's why this board is a little bit bigger than the actual cake so this one in total is 12 inches in diameter so now we're just going to start by putting a thin layer of buttercream in between here like this and then I'm going to plop the top part of my bottom layer so my other 10 inch just like that don't want too much some too scraping some off like that and then I'm just going to place the second one on top just like that so I'm going to repeat that process for each of the three tiers now we have all three of our tiers the layers are all stacked on top now what we're going to do is we're going to do our crumb coat a crumb coat is the initial layer of buttercream that goes on to the cake to catch any of these crumbs that come off as you're applying the buttercream to the sides in total I'm probably going to be using about 12 to 18 cups of buttercream and I will put the link in the description box below to my vanilla buttercream recipe that we already have up on the channel so I'm just going to coat all three of these cakes in my initial crumb coat and then I'll be back to show you the final step to this initial video in the series so the last step to icing the cake after the crumb coat has caught all of the crumbs from the sides of the cake we're going to use more buttercream and just cover it completely so I'm going to do all three of these different cakes and then we'll be finished how to bake and ice a wedding cake so there you go everybody I have finished off the beginning stages of baking a wedding cake we've got it covered in buttercream and the following videos are going to cover how to stack the wedding cake which we call tearing and how to decorate the wedding cake for a final product so make sure you stay tuned for those and I will see you next time you", "8a0IpEdWb74": "[Music] we are back in Minnesota so obviously back in Minnesota means either we're seeing our families or we're doing wedding stuff which clearly if you're seeing this video it is another wedding series video we're doing both yeah we're seeing family and we're getting wedding stuff done so hi know I got a lot of requests on my youtube for these wedding series to come out a little bit quicker but we are probably doing like one video in the series a month because we have to fly back to Minnesota for everything so this time around we are food tasting or what people are gonna eat at our wedding as well as we are and we are cake tasting which is I'm looking forward to that so that second food is first then cake tasting so it should be a really exciting day both of our parents are joining us so parents we give food young wedding stuff exactly yeah I'm excited let's do it [Music] so basically how this works I don't know how it works in all venues but for our venue once you sign your venue contract which is the first thing we did since venues are very hard to come by especially on a Saturday but I gave you guys a sneak peek of that in patan eyes cue a move songs that we did but that's the only clips of the show of the venue till the day of but they have preferred caters so once you sign that contract you're basically ensuring that you're gonna go with one of their caterers so they give you three options different tier levels and price levels and food options so we decided to go with the middle one which is a farm-to-table option so all of the food is locally sourced which is amazing so that's what we're doing today we're gonna go try some of the dishes not all of them but some of them just to test it out and figure out how we want to build our menu [Music] okay thank you okay [Music] [Music] newcomers so they stay nice and fresh I would not be cooked inside will be the short ribs single serving for you basically now we're waiting for a quote we decided on the entrees decides and the salad that we liked for getting different clothes and trying to guess how many guests but it's really hard just again the guest we're guessing on the guests um we have an estimate but you know it's hard because you have to feed everyone so we're trying to guess and then we're gonna move on to the bar right parents do you guys like the food how about you parents what's your favorite ravioli dad short ribs John Wow and ravioli so if you're coming to our wedding it's gonna be ravioli yeah we we just finished the tastings went well and our life away and food basically and alcohol for the wedding very expensive well um but you know what's great because guess where we're going next cake aging which I'm excited for because we have about six cake flavors and we're gonna try we made it to the cake the cake bakery [Music] I is [Music] okay okay different flavor but if you want strawberry which I can't see you better right here I think so so far no bye it's a cupcake party [Music] my favorite cake [Music] I only thought it out like that in the strawberry lane you're out there the silence of the tasting thank you so much tasting done done both food tastings done so another check off the wedding to-do list and now we're full now we're going back to Patrick family so super quick trip home we are already back in New York but I thought I would give you guys a little outro and tell you guys the decisions decisions we ended up going with Pat is actually had a photo shoot right now which is why he's not here with me explaining all this but I thought it would be helpful or maybe just interesting to you guys to know what we decided on so for the cocktail hour Pat and I decided that we were each gonna do a signature drink so a bride drink and a groom's drink and then we are going to do a charcuterie board so basically I just decided that we thought that that would be very wide range a lot of people like that kind of thing it's easy to just grab and eat things as you want to during cocktail hour and I feel like a lot of people like that stuff and then for the actual meal we decided on doing more of a buffet grab tables that type of thing because we wanted people to be able to get what they wanted if they wanted a little bit of each thing instead of an actual plated meal and picking certain entrees and maybe only getting one side or you know I just that's how I like to eat I'm a bird so I like to eat little bits of everything but that's kind of why we decided to go with that version and it's just really easy so we decided on the strawberry salad which you guys saw in the clips and for the entrees of course we went with the butternut squash ravioli we also did the short rib and then I think we're going to add on the grilled chicken with the Apple relish just so it gives people a very wide range of entrees to choose from feel like everybody is gonna be satisfied with something and then for the sides we decided to go with the roasted carrots Brussels sprouts and mashed potatoes so lots of food options for people we're still going back and forth on the plates we really like the bamboo ones that they showed us their recyclable they're eco-friendly we kind of liked that option and it really goes with the theme of our venue which is in a barn so between farm-to-table recyclable materials is just very us so we liked that option and then moving on to cake these are the info photos I gave Sarah for the cake that Pat and I really liked we're not huge frosting people which is crazy but yeah we like very thin layers of frosting which is why we really like the look and taste of a semi-naked cake we ended up going with just one tier so that's gonna be the cake that Pat and I cut and then everyone else is gonna have their option of cupcakes so we picked four flavors strawberries and cream lemon amaretto and red velvet and we're kind of going for this kind of set up at our venue so I think it's gonna look really good we're really excited I'm so thrilled to get another check off the wedding planning checklist so yeah food cake done so that is another video in my wedding series if you haven't seen it me trying on dresses that's the one before this after this you are going to see us shoot with our wedding photographer or a photographer here we're not sure yet we're kind of tight on time to send out save-the-dates but you're gonna see behind the scenes look at us shooting those photos or invitations and it's gonna be great so I really hope you guys are enjoying this series so far as I said in the beginning of the video these are gonna be coming out probably monthly it's a lot for us to travel back and forth so we're gonna do our best to get these out very timely for you guys but there's a lot of people involved a lot of planning and scheduling so we're

tea on number one we're just finishing up the biggest week of the fall oh is this beautiful cake pretty intense work that we have to put as a team and arrestee on inventory I'm stacking a cake the most important thing you can bank on is your dowels as you can see those are custom cut to each client and they're very very strong I never use straws I don't think they're reliable I know it's use but I do not trust them especially when you deal with a cake that maybe is this and the second tip make sure it's centered that's gonna make the whole difference at the end of your project I think we're about there when it comes the last tear of the stack a little high try to aim it right in the center as much as I can't do that too much to don't have too much - moving around here it is now I'm gonna do the border addy topper that's actually not going on the topic going on the side and we're done [Music] whoo that's a nice-looking cake [Music] intimated to the Hyatt in Louisville we've got a wedding cake in a nineteen box dessert bar the wedding cake is ready to go all we have to do is set it and the hotel is going to do teaser Clark we're set up now on this cake we chose to do some red flowers and if you can tell we put it together we like to do that in our shop as much as we can so we avoid having last-minute a guessing game in this case coming to the second floor is a hotel in downtown Louisville was a Brady so monograms duplicate of the imitation gilded in gold and I think it turned out very nice [Music] we maintain where it's been on top all ceremony is taking place so we

top 10 most amazing wedding cakes number 10 Indonesian castle an Indonesian bakery called LAN oval cake has quickly become world renowned in the past few years for their extraordinary designs not content with a typical wedding cake these craftsmen take things to a whole new level they're more modest cakes cost around five thousand dollars but the top-end ones are in the region of half a million and when you see what they produce it becomes clear why they're huge castles feature intricate sugar work and even custom lighting to accentuate the features the largest castle they've ever made required more than nine thousand hours of work and needed five trucks and a crane to transport it to the venue and to install it some of the more famous case they've made include fairytale castles a 90 urge a Panisse pagoda and an ultra Dom inspired design if you can think of it they can make it the founder of the bakery says that while they are more than capable of making these creations fully out of edible cake it would involve so much that so far no one has chosen that option instead going for a large cake at the center that's surrounded by extravagant decorations number nine Dubai sheikhs daughter's cake in December of 2016 shakeela Tifa one of the daughters of Dubai's leader Sheikh Mohammed got married and as you'd expect no expense was spared in the celebrations one of the standout moments was the arrival of the cake rather than having it wheeled in or installed in place ahead of time this lucky couple had theirs lowered in from the ceiling initially concealed to look like a floral display it's eventually revealed as a giant eight tiered cake which according to some estimates may have cost as much as 1.2 million dollarz this really was a wedding fit for a princess and it shows what's possible when budget isn't in issue number eight the amethyst cake weddings and precious gems go hand in hand but have you ever seen one on a cake before the trend for amethyst cakes began in 2016 after this design by intricate icing cake designs the closer you look the more real it appears to be with the effect being achieved by a combination of granulated sugar and rock candy multicolored modeling chocolate is used to set the geode into the fondant and then gold leaf is added as the final touch the original took around 16 hours to decorate and while newer designs have become increasingly complicated this is a cake that virtually anyone could recreate for their own wedding number 7 carousel cake Angela young who's better known as Angela baby is often seen as being China's answer to Kim Kardashian and her 31 million dollar wedding in 2015 had an incredible cake as its centerpiece reportedly taking a month to make the 10-foot tall design featured an operational carousel and dwarfed the happy couple if you think that's a crazy size for honey wedding it's actually quite reasonable considering they had two thousand important guests from across China in attendance and the venue where they held the banquet even had its own holographic castle number six the Trump flower painting think what you will of Donald Trump but he and his wife milena sure know how to spend their money to show off they got married in 2005 with guests and attendance that included the Clintons Heidi Klum Simon Cowell and 350 more so it's no surprise that they pulled out all the stops for their cake it was apparently designed by milena at a cost of $50,000 the 7 tiered cake weighed 200 pounds was made from yellow sponge soaked in Grand Marnier and was decorated with mm sugar spun flowers perhaps the most surprising thing about this cake though was that none of the guests got a chance to taste it so much metal wiring was needed to keep everything in place that it wasn't feasible for it to be cut and served on the day instead guests were served from backup cakes and it was left to the staff at the Mara Lago estates who eat the actual cake after the event had finished so none went to waste number 5 upside-down chandelier cake kaley cuoco is one of TV's biggest stars after landing roles in eight Simple Rules charmed and the Big Bang Theory so in September of 2013 when she married her first husband Ryan Sweeting she made sure her ceremony was one to remember for the cake she wanted to do something different and turned to the butter end Cakery in Los Angeles to help her out the result was astonishing known as a chandelier cake the six tiers were put together upside down and suspended from the ceiling the Baker's revealed that to achieve this effect they had to install an armature through the center to hold it in position wooden boards between each tier and sandbags were hung off the chandelier to help support the weight the sponge was two different flavors and the couple were able to cut the cake while it was suspended with it holding its shape perfectly with such a physics-defying design it's a good thing her Big Bang Theory co-stars were on hand to make sure everything went to plan number for luxury Bridal Show cake 2006 bridal shows can be a great way to gain inspiration for a wedding and give suppliers the opportunity to show what they're capable of in 2006 Nahid Parsa from la patisserie artistic displayed a cake at the luxury bridal show in beverly hills which at the time was the most expensive wedding cakes you have ever been produced the traditionally designed 8 tier cake was decorated with handmade flowers ivory fondant and white frosting but it was covered in something special to justify its twenty million dollar price tag diamonds they were used to stud the entire cake from top to bottom and then just to add some extra color the bottom tier was also accented with flakes of gold number three Mohegan Sun Hotel cake while this next cake may not win any awards for being the most beautiful or elegant it currently holds the world record for being the largest ever made it was created by the catering team of the Mohegan Sun hotel to be displayed at their New England bridal showcase in 2004 and it was absolutely massive it took the combined efforts of 58 chefs to complete the 22 foot tall design and across the seven tiers it weighed a total of six point eight one eight tons made with vanilla sponge and a combination of vanilla and almond buttercream each tier was decorated with chocolate bows and hearts and needed two forklift trucks to lift it into place as you'd expect the ingredients list for this record-breaker is extraordinary and required 10,000 pounds of pound cake batter and 4810 pounds of frosting layers had to be put together in blocks and a boom crane was used to lift people high enough to put the finishing pieces on the tongue the whole cake was enough to give a four ounce portion to fifty nine thousand people if it had been served at an actual wedding but in the case of this particular cake it was destined for less fussy mouths while some was given to attendees of the show the vast majority was in the end shipped to a pig farm in Montville number two Disney projection cake Disney themed wedding cakes are some of the most popular designs across the world but with so many different spellbinding movies and characters to choose from what if you can't make up your mind luckily in 2014 the house of mouse revealed their solution to this dilemma a projection cake it's a simple design but one that can be used to an amazing effect the standard version uses a five tiered artificial cake which can be upgraded to a real cake and has a white chocolate castle sat on the top tier everything is plain white because hidden to one side is a gift box that hides a projector that beams images on to two sides of the cake there are plenty of different options to choose from such as Tinker Bell flying up the side to release a shower of sparks Cinderella's carriage passing each tier to the top or images and scenes from your favorite movies custom designs can also be added and the display finishes with a wish for the happy couple to live happily ever after it truly is the dream Disney cake and by using technology is far less complicated than building the designs from fondant number one Prince William and Duchess Kate's cake every bride is the princess on their special day but not many become actual princesses Kate Middleton was one of those lucky few when she married Prince William in 2011 in an event where only the very best would do the cake as is tradition in the UK was a fruit cake and each layer was wrapped in a brandy soaked cheesecloth and left to age for a few weeks to develop a rich flavour before it was put together the design itself was fairly traditional and was covered in white fondant and sugar crafted flowers each tier had a different theme though and care was taken to represent all the countries of the UK on it for England there were roses for Scotland there was epistle for Wales there were daffodils and shamrocks were incorporated to represent Ireland furthermore an oaken and acorn were added to symbolise endurance and there was even a sweet william flower in honor of the future king this was truly a wedding cake fit for Prince you", "lG7S6X5OqB4": "hello and welcome to another video I am a Z and this is obviously vegan I make videos about veganism vegan lifestyle the recipes

wedding cakes not grooms although he keeps making those stupid videos with his brother do you guys know I've gone wedding dress shopping with Mia at a beautiful five-star luxury place and that's also tried on really inexpensive Amazon wedding dresses but now I look like a fat ghost roaming through the hallway give me chicken nuggets or I'll kill you do so today I thought it would be fun to go YouTube style and order a wedding cake from a five-star bakery and order the same wedding cake from a one-star bakery so you guys know I'm a literal ho for aesthetic and I go on Pinterest to find these like ideal weddings that I want to have and I've kind of settled on this one it's called forest fairy vibes so I've talked with Nick about it only both agree we really like this wood tree leaf aesthetic with fairy lights that are also very natural in every forest and obviously I want the cake to really fit so I want something very rustic looking made with fruits and flowers it looks like it was made in the forest or something like not polished so I've gone to a one-star yelp place that wrecked my house I've also gone to a one-star hotel that wasn't that bad so I'm interested to see if the once our bakery will be okay let me know in the comments if you think the one-star cake will be five times worse than the five star cake so I got in contact with both bakeries it defies our bakery I could actually just email and talk to them but once your bakery I went in person and I showed them a picture on my phone and then they took a picture of it so they both have the same exact photo of the single-layer crumb coated cake with fresh fruit and flowers figs red flowers just really beautiful and dainty I told both places I wanted a 16-piece chocolate cake that's why you order it here a 16-piece chocolate cake with chocolate filling but I told them they had to wiggle room if they wanted to put hazelnuts in it nuts are praline or strawberries I didn't care whatever they had on hand then I'm going to go pick up both wedding cakes and I have them here with me today and I just want to tell you if you like this video and you want to see more 5 star versus winter cakes I found so many good ones on Pinterest I found a food one a baby one birthday one we could do maybe one for Valentine's Day and I have a lot of family here that likes to eat cake so give this video a thumbs up

now so this is a five star cake it weighs a whopping six pounds they gave it to me in this box and the one star place also gave me the cake in the box but I took it off because it had stickers of their name all over and out of uh I don't expose your ass okay so this cake cost me 60 American dollars it is from the five-star place and now I'm going to reveal it to you guys this cake me this own moment okay I'm nervous are you guys nervous tell me what kind of cake you guys are thinking about for your wedding ah [Music] whoo okay so I've actually seen this before I saw it when I want to go pick it up and I'm gonna be honest my initial reaction was like is this the cake I ordered okay let me show you the cake up close I'm looking at the picture of the cake and the first thing I noticed is that the picture that I sent them the cake is a little bit higher but I understand that maybe that was my fault for ordering 16 piece cake maybe if I had ordered a 10 piece cake it would have been higher and like smaller but yeah I just take a little bit shorter the crumb coat is actually a crumb coat but it's a very neat one like I'm sure this Baker was like ah I kind of want to like cover up the layers I don't see like I see a little bit of a ridge from the layers not that much this dripping looks a little bit more liquidy than the photos but the color she nailed it or Heath it is it perfect I'm gonna be honest though the cake doesn't really smell like vanilla delicious chocolate cookies you want to smush your face into it smells like these daisies right here 10,000 thumbs up in the next cake video I was just snapping face into the cake I won't Trisha Paytas the cake for you you just got frosting in my hair but it's not the only white stuff they get in there I'll be okay I immediately noticed the absence of figs which I'm extremely disappointed about because figs are my favorite fruit because it kind of looked like and I just wanted so with the picture that I send the flowers are correct but there's also seems to be some kind of green baby's breath here but instead of doing green baby's breath they did green daisies which I appreciate I think these flowers are actually nicer than baby's breath and then I see the grapes here I don't see the blackberries I don't see red flowers and I really needed the red flowers because I think it added a nice contrast of difference but I really do appreciate how they've also decorated the bottom of the cake I feel like the red flowers really make a difference I'm wondering why I don't like it like why don't I like you I'm really hard to please huh okay ladies and genitals we're here ready to cut the cake so the flowers are just stuck in here the cake is so heavy and thick but the knife is just going right through it I feel a lot of layers ah that's what people say to me about my emotional baggage I don't have one of those professional cake things because I'm not a professional I'm just a walnut but cake lifted out pretty good whoo I'm a master cake cutter if you're wondering not only a master baiter but also a master cake cutter flowers were just stuck in with the stems hopefully washed but I hope the cake doesn't taste like flowers here is the official cake see there's a hair in it but that's definitely mine hmm so the actual cake sponge is very chocolaty but let me explain the type of chocolate there is hazelnut a chocolaty like Nutella there's creamy thick chocolate like Lynch there's a chocolate at the bottom of the drumsticks which is the best chocolate on earth and there's chocolate syrup chocolate this tastes like chocolate syrup it's not bad it's just like a distinct chocolate flavor the buttercream is so good so creamy and rich the cake itself is very dense but I think they made it like that so that it could easily absorb all the layers of frosting because I feel like the cake layers got smushed with the frosting and smush and then it absorbs the frosting so it becomes a really dense moist cake which I personally really enjoy as you can see I'll probably sit here and eat the whole cake okay friends I'm trigger dying with anticipation to see what this onestart cake looks like and I'll tell you some caveats first I had to change a thing that was sitting on because it had the name of the company all over it and I don't want to expose anyone so I just changed it onto a piece of cardboard I had at home so you have to ignore that because that's not how they gave it to me they gave it to me on the same shiny thing that the other company did I just didn't want to blur for seven hours of my life so I just moved the cake so I did move a little bit of the dripping but the cake itself I did not touch I promise you three to one [Music] what do you think I like this one a little more just talking about color wise I find this one more striking more visually appealing and I think that's because of the red flowers damn I don't know I'm like already shocked the actual construction of the cake is a little wobbly it seems to be like falling into its center but they did get blueberries so but still no things so no eating for B whatever I lost an emotional she's for you okay so this is the one strut cake and then this on top is a cake I ordered so pretty similar although I guess the five-star place actually got the colors more closely and then as a crumb coat this ones are really sloppy sorry Bridge smell this one also smells like flowers but they did seem to get the flower is more correct than the other place because of the green and the white and the red and the raspberries so structurally its weak but visually I think it's a little more similar I mean what you guys think in comment I'm really I was expecting these cakes to look a little bit more similar I'm a little shocked like when the dog made my boobs he was like huh what oh okay you know that's a little bit what happened with these pigs I think one of them what oh okay okay so now I'm gonna cut into the cake because your girl wants to eat it I love a chocolate cake this one is chocolate on chocolate okay so this one is a little bit harder to cut into it seems like it's getting stuck a little bit but I mean it went down really similar to the other cake not seeing a whole load of difference this one seems to have more layers and the layer of frosting seems to be a little thinner all in all this one is more dry it's a really drawer actually but the flavor of this one is actually much much much better it's a nuttier chocolate it tastes like they use maybe like the off-brand Nutella like they have this hazelnut spread here that I think is what it tastes like actual cake layers are so dry it's dry but hazelnutty does that make sense so the flavor is good the actual cake is very dry seems like they didn't really frost the layers like the frostings name is really thin this one this is a water layers one two three four five six seven seven layer cake oh my god these don't exactly look like wedding cakes I think because I didn't get them so big and so stacked it looks like more of like a birthday cake I would not be disappointed with this cake they're both really pretty I don't think one cake is better than the other to be very honest with you because this one tastes better that one might look a little better on the inside but visually this was more stimulating for me I don't know why so I'm sitting here with the one jar in the five star cake and I called Nick because I want to get like a person's opinion on it like who's actually here nicolai one of these cakes is from a one-star bakery and the other one is from a five-star bakery can you guess which is which and why you know what I'm gonna go with this is the five star because the edges are really smooth and it looks a little bit cleaner this one looks a bit glide I thought you gestured when you said one star per spot I thought you just sort of meaning by gamma one star so offended but now I know it's not the case let me show you what it's supposed to look like and you're gonna tell me like which one got it closer because I feel like that's also really important okay so this is a picture that I sent them okay so which one do you think is closer well this one because all right what do you mean this one's totally different this this uh this one's chocolate cake it's like chocolate on the outside this one is white like how it is in photo yeah they didn't get the layers though that's this cake on the image has like layers you're like The Crow yeah crumb coat crumb coat look at you are you go Baker oh my gosh yeah they didn't do the crumb cut coat crumb crumb coat the calm coat they need you to calm coat on the case in Bulgaria but this is in English like you have no problem right now thing you know what now I'm getting confused because I'm used to speaking both language is now a little bit pretty sure myself speaking English like these yes very nice very nice after one day in Bulgaria hello my friend after two days of Bulgaria chec get away after three days in Bulgaria mr.

rolled out some of my homemade marshmallow fondant if you'd like to know how to make that I do have a video unlike other cakes on this one I rolled the fondant out extra thin just so I have a layer of fondant to paste the waves onto you drape it right over the cake smooth it out with my fondant smoother 's and go down the side with my hands smoothing out all those ruffles and then I'll cut the base off with my little pizza cutter get rid of that excess then with two fondant smoother 's I pinched the edge together to make it nice and sharp now we're going to start making the ruffles to make it easier I'm using the pasta roller attachment for my mixer I had a little bind there so I just ripped it off [Music] cut that in half made it a little smaller [Music] I believe I rolled these ruffles to a five on the pasta machine and then with my little pizza cutter I cut little heels I guess that's how to describe it he's flat on one end and round it on the other they kind of look like little Hills to me cut out a bunch of them then using a mixture of one part corn syrup in one part water i'm oiss in the cake a little bit and then I start laying the ruffles on I'll make sure to ruffle the edge right there and don't forget to add a little more water to the previous ruffle [Music] for this 8-inch cake I'm using medium-length fat ruffles if that makes sense speed up the video a little bit it's the same thing over and over again [Music] if I didn't like how that was placed I'll replace it like to make sure to cover up the end so they're not showing it looks a lot more neat adding a little extra glue where needed [Music] [Music] I'm not going to put the ruffles all the way to the base just yet I'm going to wait till I stack the cakes to do that now we'll work on the 6-inch cake it's doing the same things except this time the ruffles are a little shorter but still fat or tall however you prefer to say it speed up the video again [Music] [Music] I'll finish the base of this tier when I have it stacked now I've got my baseboard here I'm putting a little fondant paste on the bottom to help at the 10 inch cake stick [Music] centering it into position there I cut these ruffles a little longer but they're still about the same height as on the 8-inch cake [Music] now I'm going to work on the very bottom of the tier for this I've cut long a very short ruffles and I make sure the flat part of the ruffle is touching at the very bottom of the cake so as not to leave any space [Music] hmm I didn't like how that was laying so I'm going to readjust it I still don't like it - try that one more time there we go much better clean up a little bit with my spatula and fold them down to make ruffles and they'll go and nitpick all the ruffles and make sure they're ruffled as I like on every real cake i do i always add support dowels or straws in the bottom tiers [Music] for a ten-inch I'll add five straws around the outside clip them off right next to the cake so sorry my hand gets in the way of the clipping and I also do three on the inside that'll give a plenty of support for the center of both tiers I'm putting a wooden dowel and that will help stabilize the cake for transportation after I've got the 8 inch stacked I will finish the base also with longer thinner ruffles [Music] and I'll do the same with a six-inch tier after all the tiers are stacked and the ruffles are laying nicely I'll take my hand steamer and steam all the excess cornstarch dust off the cake to make it nice and shiny this is the picture I took a home with some silk flowers and this is a photo I took at the venue of with those homemade gum paste peonies thank you all for watching keep an eye out for my next video you're welcome to subscribe if you'd like to be one of the

today I want to tell you how I make my wedding cake how I bake them you can see here I have my pata I have already creamed it with this sugar and in the botted here I have two thousand two hundred fifty grams and the sugar is one thousand one hundred and fifty grams now the egg I used here is 45 eggs I've whipped it cream the butter and the sugar very well have to cream until is very fluffy now the nest then I've just added is the water that I worked a little bit and they can see me mixing it very well just try as much as possible is not always easy for water and a egg to combine very well but all you need to do just try as much as possible to at least mix then the nest and I'm add Indiana is the cream vanilla I'm going to be adding 2 tbsp and after the cream vanilla I'll be adding my bottle scotch and the bottles Katya also I'm going to be adding 2 tbsp remember the the cake is huge if you are buying butter in budget only would have bought for this particular cake is nice sachets by 250 grams so what I did invite such add butter what I'm using is a pocket butter so right now I am adding the lemon remember the butterscotch I added 2 tbsp and I'm adding the lemon now 1 tablespoon making a total of 3 flavors the vanilla flavor the cream vanilla flavor the butterscotch and lemon the three flavors I am using for this like I said before cream vanilla ice 2 tbsp the bottle scotch is 2 tbsp and the lemon is 1 tbsp continue mixing and then you'll get your flow and this flow is also 2251 with this recipe the flow and the bottle had this thing in grams so I now go measure my baking powder using myseif to sieve it into the flow this is to avoid lumps because if you don't if there's any part of the cake where the lumps and sad and did not dissolve that part is definitely going to be bitter take note of that so now I'm adding the baking powder remember 4 tablespoon and 1/2 and 1/2 tablespoon now how did I calculated each tablespoon is for 500 grams and in this particular water I have about four of the 500 grams and half of the 500 gram which is 250 that may be two thousand two hundred and fifty grams so I'm adding 4 and 1/2 tablespoon to make sure I put it accurately that's why I'm explaining it now this is the teaspoon and this is 1/2 teaspoon remember a teaspoon and a half teaspoon is equal to 1/2 tablespoon and then you mix very well after Segen mix very well to be well incorporated the nest will now add into your creamed mixture bit by bit as you mix sorry the sugar is 1500 grams until all is added remember you are folding in you are not being hard on it remember you are not fighting with it there is a way you will mix your kick it turned out to be bread like and you will not like it so at this particular point all you need to do to get the best texture of the cake is to pump out the mixture so we call it folding in can see I'm folding in the mixture finally I'm adding the last tool as I keep on falling in comparing it but until all is completely mixed together you can see it's fully mixed so the nesting is 500 grams of mixed fruit I'm adding my mixed fruit with about two cups of brandy I've previously soaked this mixed fruit two days before the day I'm using it remember it is always very important that you soak your fruit because that particular fruits you suit will help the lifespan of your kick the nest I'm adding my browning I'm used I'm adding it directly from the bottle because I want to get it real it kind of lined since I want to make a marble cake I want the cake to be marbled but the total copy can actually you can use 1/2 cup you can use 1 cup depending on your own taste and you can as well mix everything together to be brown like but for this particular class I'm teaching you now I want to model the cake marbling is making sure that is not well combined you can see some part today is brownish and some parts from past days creamy in color the next thing I will be doing is to line the pan that I will be using two big dick and I'm going to be using three of the six inches pan three of the eight inches pan and three of the twelve inches fine everything depends on the design you want to make from your kitchen place the bottom of the pan on your catchment to follow your baking paper I'll rule out in line now using your scissors you cut the line around the echo line you have ruled out please if you have not subscribed to my channel endeavor to do so so that you can continue to get my videos whenever I post it and also hit the bell bottom by the side of that subscription button it will always help you to get my recipes whenever I post one so now you can see I'm tracing this circle out and after tracing it I'm not going to line it on the bottom of the front I remember you must grease the pan first using your bottle can see I am already clogged minutes make sure all parts of a side of the pan is completely greased with the water you'll have to stick the paper to the pan this is the same thing I'm going to be doing in every order with every other pan that we are seeing that I just showed you now your line in this second clip and after that you cut out another one not a longer one for this side of the pan so do this in all of them and then I will share the butter into all the different tanks now my oven is heated off already has been heating similarly after I put all this cake all these are really officially I will send them to the oven remember the oven must be moderately hot shouldn't be too hot so avoid getting your kicks bones and by the time the cake is ready to be able to status CUNY and it does QR or your knife comes out clean know that the kick is ready so I'm cutting out the long one now so line at the side of my side on this side you can see it's well lined the same thing is what I did with the rest and then I will share the bottom of the pan and bake until the cake is ready now we show you how to decorate this wedding cake this is just the baking aspect of it the next class I will show you the cake that I baked and also how to decorate them so now you split the button among the pans and then big thank you very much do try out this recipe on my description box if you have any question also do us I will always be there to incite share this video if necessary bye for now", "lbAnDis7OuI": "ON FOX 8 NEWS IN THE MORNING.

THEN I SAID THEY DID SOME", "kuP_2DAWRoY": "my name is Alice Hart I'm a food writer and a food stylist there's a fantastic range of M&S cakes from fruitcakes for a more traditional finish you can have chocolate a vanilla sponge lemon there's something for everyone I'm just going to talk you through some different ways of assembling your cakes using dowels which is not a complicated process at all all you're going to do is use lengths of plastic or wood to support your cake because when you've got such heavy layers the cake needs a bit of help so it doesn't collapse firstly insert your dowels into the cake on the largest bottom tier you need to use for dowels evenly spaced to support it you need to use a pencil to mark the dowels at the top where the cake ends pull the dowels out again and snap them or cut them where your pencil mark is put your dowels back into your cake repeat this again with each layer you won't need to use for dowels anymore because the cake layers get smaller so use three in a triangle shape and you need to put the next tier on top which is now supported by the dowels underneath if you're using pillars to separate each layer of your cake is a similar process to using the dowels alone position your pillars on the cake push your dowels down in through each pillar vertically and then mark at the top of the pillar where the dowel ends then remove your dowel cut it as you did before and reinsert it into the pillar and the cake this adds extra support to your pillars so that they don't fall over sideways and make your cake collapse repeat this process up the cake you'll only need three dowels in a triangle shape from now on so once you've built your cake and it's feeling sturdy and secure you can think about how you're going to add your flowers and decorate it to create a bespoke look that matches the rest of your wedding you order in-store or online and then you go into store to collect your cake the cakes take 21 days from the day you order them the great thing about M&S is that they do a range of wedding flowers wine and food so that everything's covered you", "T8vfQKs381k": "hi this is leon terry of tahita cakes and i'm back again to show you how i'm going to frost this cake with whipped cream frosting okay now i'm having a wedding cake and the cake is a whipped cream wedding cake and i'm going to demonstrate how i will frost all the cakes but using this one here okay so i've already prepared that the colors for this wedding are white and pink and i've already frosted i've already whipped the cream as you can see it doesn't have little bubbles very smooth so i'm going ahead to first [Music] okay so i'm going to scoop a little bit of cream and using my palette knife i will spread the cream all around the cake go to the sides ensure your cream is well whipped there's a video i've already done about how on how to whip your cream from scratch and to achieve a smooth consistency without their bubbles so that you can also [Music] you know have an end product that is has a smooth finishing this wedding cake is a three tiered cake plus two separate pieces for the for the giveaways so this is going to be the bottom tier and i have two more on top of this i'm going to use this cake smoother and i love the way it's tall so it goes with most of the tall cakes without much trouble so you lay your you place your smoother perpendicular to the cake at 45 degree angle between the cake and the smoother and then you go ahead and scrape off the excess while smoothing the surface of the sides of the cake as you can see it's becoming very smooth okay that's it [Music] just i'll go ahead and scrape off the top excess cream to also create a sharp edge [Music] so as you can see i've created a sharp edge on the cake all around the cake and i've also scraped off the excess cream and at the same time creating a small finishing for this for the decoration of this cake i'm going to or to to do to make some lines or some decor or on the side using these cake deco item this cake tool and i'm going to use this deco pattern so let's see how it goes [Music] so i think that's it maybe just a final touch to make sure it is smooth [Music] okay then i'm going to do a final touch on the top for a sharp edge just for the just a touch i think that's okay so i'll just do a simple design on top [Music] and that's it so now i'm going to clean up the board it has some if you can see this there's some excesses on the board so i'm just going to clean up the board okay so that's it and the final step for this tear for this tier i'm going to pipe the border with pink so i'm just going to just smoothen the [Music] [Music] cream i have my piping bag with me this is the piping bag and i have a shell tip attached to it i hope you can see the design of the shelf tip [Applause] [Music] you fold your piping bag like this so that now once you scoop your cream it doesn't you know identify every other place the whole piping bag so you maintain a clean piping bag throughout your piping [Music] i'm just going to remove excess air air bubbles so that it doesn't the air balloon the air doesn't pop on your cake while [Music] piping [Music] you can also after you tighten your grip you can also just pipe a little in case there's air it will pop out there [Music] so with the shell tip i'm just going to press release all right so we are done with this part and i'm going to show you what we've done for the rest of the cakes and i'll be back shortly hi guys i'm back to show you what we've already finished on this is the entire wedding cake with these kobe pandemic uh wedding cakes have really reduced in sizes so we're going to have this as the bottom tier and then followed by these and then finally these pins the top and then these two are for the giveaways now something i wanted to mention is that you have to double your cake doubling your cake um gives stability for the you know upcoming cakes on top of that tear so like for instance if this is going to be the best here then i'm going to do it like the way i've done on this cake i don't know if you can see there's some doors on this cake okay so you can see these these are called doors you normally use them they're different types of doors you can have plastic doors you can have wooden doors so in this cake in this case i'm going to use a wooden door wells now these doubles can be bought from supermarkets or you can actually have them uh tailor-made you know to your liking so i have these with doors so i'm going to double this cam the same cake and then we're going to have this tia on top of this tier okay and then now that this has doubles now it will be ready to accommodate the next tier which i'll place on site now one thing you need to note is that we don't tear from the bakery we tear at sight so i'll carry these separately and pack them separately and then i will later on show you um while at site how we now you know uh stack them up stack this cake onto this one and then this one on to this one okay so thank you for watching please stay with us and watch till the end as we go to the side with you in mind so that you can learn a tea party all right thank you so much hi guys this is liam terry and we are at the site where we are setting up the whipped cream wedding cake and i'm going to show you how to stack up how you tear up a whipped cream wedding cake okay so follow me and i'll show you [Music] so i'm going to use the cake lifter to pick up this cake from this is the wood that we brought the cake with so we're going to pick up this cake so you scoop beneath the cake to pick up this the thin board that's that's below this cake so i'm going to pick up that thing but slide it away slowly [Music] try to pick it up now with my hands so i have it now so i'm going to tear it up [Music] so when you're tearing up you have to okay so you have to try and um and and and figure out where the middle the the center the middle of the cake is where the center is so so that you don't place the cake too far on either side okay so that's what i'm going to do [Music] and okay so i've realized the cake has come this way too much so i am going to gently push and push the thin board towards the other eye so that i push the cake gently there you go there you go slowly so i think now it's okay so these ones this shouldn't worry you because then we are going to do a piping a border piping around it and it's going to hide any damages you may have done minor damages okay so i'm going to pipe with the white cream so i've already packaged my white cream on the piping bag and i'll go ahead and file it okay so i'm going to now place the third tier on top and we'll do the same same as we've done on this so i have the top tier and i'm going to estimate and then place it on top [Music] there okay so i'm going to pipe then i'll put some [Music] i j i j j [Music] hi guys so i am done with the setup and you have seen how i have teared the whipped cream cakes so it might be a little tricky in your first time but once you get used to it then it becomes easy so that's what i've done and i've covered with the piping on the on the borders and that's it guys thank you so much for watching remember to subscribe remember to like and share this video and i hope it was a blessing and you are able to to get some tips from me thank you so much and god bless you [Music] changed [Music] you", "iBKqmMHZO4Q": "[Music] i've been holding on [Music] when i come back [Music] i run [Music] just away [Music] [Applause]

different cake options for our wedding literally a whole day if you asked me what would my dream day be it would be be in Byron Bay just eating cake all day [Music] pierre was in charge of directions today so we're lost Oh fantastic thank you folks we're in the right spot it is here see here took charted directions that's why we're here what's wrong so we're going to these first Baker's and I'm not sure I've never done this before but it looks like we're just gonna go in there and get to try something but we also forgot to have breakfast today because we were late [Music] this many cakes is that's gonna fill me up I gotta admit I'm pretty excited I'm actually really glad we didn't have breakfast we have cake all day for breakfast lunch and dinner just cake this is actually super annoying because yesterday we decided we're gonna start our start start our proper getting fit for the wedding I mean I'm assuming we shouldn't eat everything like the whole cake here we go what was that raspberry panna cotta and white chocolate buttercream don't cut that in half no so I probably tried three cakes and Pierre wants all of them same actually really hard look so far it's four out of four how many cakes to make [Music] hands just had a great idea we basically just tell everyone that we're getting married I mean this seems like a really good way to spend Monday I feel so full up and this is cake tasting one of three so we borrowed Tara's car today hopefully she doesn't need it I don't know she knows we took it I did actually bring her some cakes so if she know this is missing hair it's alright just be like don't worry about that worry about this [Music] we've just finished our first tasting I had no idea how much like should go over load I was gonna feel I legitimately feel like I'm gonna have a sugar crash in a minute like when you have too much coca-cola so so we're gonna go go some lunch but we don't know exactly where we are but I would like to go to the men's club because I always like going to that place yes we need to have some regular food now like to reset our palates basically like gourmet wine tasting we need to like cleanse our palates and make sure that we give every cake equal opportunity to the cake and then spit it out so the problem with Cana no choosing cakes for our wedding is that we have completely opposing palates like he likes fruity flavors so at this last tasting he literally picked two lemon cakes and two raspberry cakes and I like chocolate flavors because you know I'm normal so we keep butting heads with what kind of flavors were gonna do so I think we're gonna have to do like one of those tiered cakes that has different flavors so that we can compromise we've literally gone from cake tasting to wine tasting so we need to give up everyone so we started prepping for it last Monday but you know I'm a last minute kind of person I always like even at uni I used to just cram everything into the last minute I think it just keeps you in the edge keeps life interesting that's a terrible way well food we chose in the menu yeah not the menu but the restaurant the caterer is locked in and chosen menu has not been sorted but we are gonna have a sit-down like proper like meals served kind of thing I'm not doing canapes or anything like venues lockdown dress is being made so like fittings I have like four or five fittings in the next few months why Janine so many things well because I keep eating cake proclaim how much you love me into the world you have to put all of your deepest feelings for me in writing and say you might need to cry are you serious I was literally gonna Google some thousand deku deku and flowers that's a big one and I had literally sorted all of the decor and design and I haven't yet sort of the flowers see this worries me because piers been sitting on Pinterest with her like her computer facing away from me because apparent I'm allowed to see it you can see in add a whole well she's not showing me she's saying that now that she's not showing me some kind of a bit this might end up looking like a fairground Wonderland you wait my pinch is very ambitious we'll have a look yeah I reckon it's like peers idea is here and our budget is around about here so I have to find a compromise where the one thing I've been planning a lot of is the actual video so Sam Evans is a friend of mine who helped me produce the video the engagement video with Pierre back in France last year so me and have been going back and forth working out ideas of what I might do and so far we've got for the intro of this wedding video it's gonna be the plan is I'm gonna bleep all out what I just say but there's three incredible vehicles that are gonna get me to the wedding and we're gonna shoot that probably like the week beforehand so this intro is gonna be insane so even if the wedding is a bit like really starting to feel real we've got about a less than a hundred days left to go before the wedding I'm not sure the exact count we haven't started any dance lessons and Cain and I honestly we try to film ourselves dancing recently we are so awkwardly Whitney is so awkward at trying to like when people see me dance like I've lit literally tell them mostly last week at the gala I was dancing and people with rhythm we're actually coming up to me and high-fiving me I'm saying you're good at you good at dancing solo but you're not good at dancing with a girl you want to leave whether you can just watch body pop [Music] that was that was beautiful that was a mistake I know I'm very full now we have the biggest lunch ever I completely forgot was going on eat a load more cake now next cake tasting here we come cake-tasting these look unbelievable by the way I've had like a little sneak peek look well as you'll see when you cut this open look the inside will ooze out yeah it went to messages died like a really good non-abrasive out from the middle as well this is great isn't it Oh like a crime scene [Laughter] giri's help me out of my dungarees I am so full up that was just incredible I don't think that helped our wedding diet very much starting now now [Music] okay so for this next cake tasting we have driven from byron bay at two tambry mounts and we're currently like climbing the mountain and we're rising altitude so much that my ears are like popping literally if you like my brains about to explode is not I just do this yeah I think she's like at flying altitude level right now we'll probably at like 60 meters this must be what it's like to be like an astronaut we have arrived this is marinas house and this is her little cake making house check this out [Music] [Music] okay so what we're thinking of doing for the wedding is probably a three-tier cake maybe something like this my initial thought was to go with like that semi scraped really rustic looking style but I'm also so in love with what she does like look at this workmanship it is just darling its work woman moonship Wow I've never actually seen cakes like this before they next this one looks like it's made of stone marble yeah is the plan that we're meant to taste the flavors here and then whatever we like here it goes into these big cakes yes and you can have different flavors on different tiers so basically if we can't decide on one flavor and I do think it's a better idea to do different flavors on different tiers because some people like really fruity drink chocolate stuff like that basically there's a structure in here so that each tier is actually on a different kind of place like a cake whole lot and then there's a stick in the mill holding these tiers together this is the best dinner I've ever had this is this is good because I'm experiencing a sugar comedown from the last place so now I can get back in and have more sugar this is the white chocolate mud cake so traditional sponge with vanilla bean buttercream okay try the dark chocolate mud cake you're happy I'm not gonna have this one because I don't eat dark chocolate yeah just because it reminds me of coffee too much for me tiny little I'm trying to have like half of each because honestly otherwise it's too much shall we call this video a wedding mukbang yeah mark hey I must admit I've not been very interested in like the wedding preparations until now I got my suit I'm fine here you can do the rest for now but this is not that bad everything else is like a little bit of a you know chore to do or is this that's incredible that was my best moment exceeding session this cake we try now is like legitimately mint green its pistachio financier with salvaged hairy sauce yeah that is speaking my language also that cherry has gold leaf on it plus I think people we've weirded out when they cut through it and it's green people know what pistachio is darling it's about 30 seconds ago I didn't know what it was I think we should go with the caramel mud cake because that looks amazing you notice he's actually gonna be better than our wedding day because on our wedding day we only got one cake done when I was a kid I used to get the entire jar of lemon curd and just eat it with a spoon so I think I'm gonna like this one there's something so good about lemon curd because it's so tight but it's so she agrees it's like fights against itself hmm I think women to feed each other inconvenient in between the last cake tasting in this one I had a such a big sugar crash that I just fell asleep because bizarrely enough my favorite flavor it's still the first white chocolate mud cake really that's when we tried here mine still might also be the duck table mud cake with contract can we just agree that like we're not gonna do dark chocolate seeing as one half of this relationship hates dark chocolate but darling we can do tears and most people like chocolate it's not dark chocolate why can't we agree like if one of us hated killer Tigers we wouldn't have won at the winning this is how negotiations and wedding ago when we first started planning the wedding her mum gave me this piece of advice which I'm realizing is very very true it was happy wife happy life and what I have to do some that is if I let Pierre make all the decisions with this wedding everything goes swimmingly yes so I'm just saying yes to everything I've chosen my suit and I've chosen the band I'm chosen the DJ and that's the three things that I'm very passionate about and also I've chose I mean I'd like your opinion but the end of the day I whatever all is mine what I've noticed is my opinion doesn't count I completely forgot we have an equipment at home and we're mid cake-tasting so I've got to try and bring Pierre away okay that was a pretty successful day [Music] well [Music] you", "ydfCil8AT4A": "hey guys how's it going today we are making something really amazing it is a wedding cake for my sister so she's getting married and I thought you know what a nice gesture it'd be if I

a baker he's an artist part of it is icing piping part of his paintbrush part of it is airbrush create the leaves and the flowers his canvas cakes like these we paint on cakes we sculpt cakes we sketch cakes it's design what we're gonna do deeply religious Philip says his Christian faith guides everything in his life this one is a verse out of first Corinthians stand firm be strong and immovable always working thewe Z a Stickley for the Lord including his refusal to bake a wedding cake for a gay couple that cake is that strong of a message in our culture and marriage in general between a man and woman across all cultures religions is an inherently religious event that faiths part of an epic legal clash between religious liberty and gay rights all of which began when Charlie Craig and Dave Mullins walked into masterpiece cake shop in 2012 like any couple Charlie and I were really excited to be getting married same-sex marriage was still not legal in Colorado so the couple was planning to get married in Massachusetts followed by a reception back home near Denver and on this particular day when we were going to sample wedding cakes and when David and Charlie came in we introduced ourselves what can I do for you we're here to look at wedding cakes it's for our wedding it was a really special day because Charlie's mom was in town she does not live in Denver so she was particularly excited so I realize right then that this is not a cake that I'm gonna be able to design and create for them so I tried to apologize to him so you know also you cookies brownies birthday cakes anything else in my store but we weren't in there for brownies for my birthday we were in there because we needed a cake to serve at our reception and at which point they both jumped up swore at me stormed out of my shop you know Charlie had a binder full of ideas and concepts you know well we never even got a chance to open the binder you don't see it as an act of discrimination I see it as an act of following my faith it's not just a cake is it an iconic symbol of a wedding this is a religious ceremony that goes in direct conflict with my face when I realized exactly what had happened in the car you know I broke down and started crying that one encounter at this unassuming cake shop in Lakewood Colorado just propelled both the cake Baker and the couple into the center of a scorching national debate that went all the way to the highest court in the land and today in a 72 decision the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Baker it's good for Jack it's good for businesses who want to run their businesses according to their convictions whether they're Christians Muslims Jews secular whatever the case might be I think it's good for that and celebrations erupted outside Phillips's store just a great day to have cake I'm very excited Craig and Mullins say they were blindsided by the decision the first emotions were just shock and disappointment the bakery may have won the battle but it has certainly lost the war the court really recognized today the deep harms of discrimination and those harms apply equally when it comes to LGBT people we were in Colorado just last week only days before today's far-reaching decision for Mullins and Craig even over five years later that brief interaction still stings I was mortified I mean neither one of us had ever been treated this way before at a business dejected and furious the couple posted about their experience on Facebook we wrote just a small modest post that said hey we were discriminated against this cake shop their post went viral we received this outpouring of support from people literally around the world encouraged by the public response the couple filed a complaint with the Colorado Civil Rights Commission Colorado is one of 21 states that prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation Colorado's Civil Rights Commission ruled in favor of the couple describing the Baker's refusal based on his religious beliefs as one of the most despicable pieces of rhetoric that decision was upheld by the Colorado Court of Appeals it made us feel like we were valued members of our community it's not about hate this is about not creating a message and a government forcing me to because people have called you a bigot I'm not I serve everybody who comes in my store I just don't create cakes every cake that people asked me to create as part of the ruling the Commission ordered Philips to retrain his employees and serve everyone wedding cakes regardless of sexual orientation so he stopped making wedding cakes altogether his refusal he says cost him 40% of his business and worse we've had death threats we've had emails phone calls I was going to turn upside down aided by the Alliance defending freedom a Christian advocacy organization Philips petitioned the Supreme Court to take his case we're asking the court to look at it as creative professionals should they be forced to violate the First Amendment our deeply held religious beliefs to create art that violates those beliefs which is more important saying the state of Colorado violated his First Amendment rights of freedom of religion and speech and there's the slippery slope of does this chip away at other artisans whether it's a jeweler or a makeup artist or others who would then have the ability to essentially boycott gay marriages I think that the Supreme Court is looking at all that those were good questions that they asked in my case however that's not an issue what I do I paint on cakes I sculpt cakes it's clearly art it's clearly protected this isn't about a cake it's about the right of people to receive equal service at a place of business that anyone else would the news that the court would take up the case was a shock to everyone involved the weight of both movements sitting squarely on their shoulders I know it's hard to predict how you will feel but if it came down in your favor how would you react I would be probably overjoyed couldn't you create a generic wedding cake that would be available for anybody who walked in and then customized for certain people or is that against the that would be sidestepping the issue that's still the government forcing me to create cakes for ceremonies that go against my faith I think sadness and fear over what the future will look like for people based on this precedent so this was a 72 decision but there was actually a lot of disagreements even among the justices who agreed with the outcome in the case Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote the opinion for the court the only dissenting justices were Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor today's ruling a narrow victory for religious rights advocates at least four justices affirming gay rights but ruling in favor of the Baker because ironically they say it was he who faced anti religious bias calling out the Colorado Commission's language as disrespectful and hostile towards his sincere religious beliefs I think it's hard to know just reading the opinion what it's going to mean kind of on on the ground in practice coming out of this I think we know that it's important for state officials to approach these kinds of disputes respectful of the claims on all sides LGBTQ groups including GLAAD worry this ruling could open the floodgates for bigotry hiding behind religious exemptions you're well aware that history historically businesses have used religious exemptions to deny service to after chimeric ins at hotels or restaurants or I can't answer for that all I can say is that that's not my belief at all there's no question that opponents of LGBT equality will and already have seized on today's opinion as standing for far more than it does this case was never about cakes and we know our opposition won't stop at the cake shop today the move was celebratory but Dave Mullins and Charlie Craig say the fight for equal rights is far from over the struggle is real and you know civil rights aren't gained overnight and you know we hope that we've raised awareness not just in Colorado but across the country of how this form of discrimination affects LGBT people across the country every day hi everyone George Stephanopoulos here thanks for checking out the ABC News youtube channel if you'd like to get more video show highlights and watch

talk about [Music] wedding season is here so let's get naked well make a cake that is a naked cake is a nun frosted rustic style cake that is beautiful for weddings and we're going to decorate it with berries and make it big and bold so let's get baking the recipe that we're going to use for our naked cake today is a Victoria sponge the Victoria sponge is very traditionally Irish it's very similar to an American yellow cake and we always eat it with jam and cream kind of similar what we're going to do today so we're gonna cream the butter on its own first just to loosen it up a little bit and then we're gonna add in the sugar and we're gonna be sit on it till it gets nice and light and pale while the butter is beating sift together your flour baking soda and salt until combined in a joke add in your eggs and vanilla and whisk together the butter and sugar should be well creamed now scrape down the sides of the bowl to make sure you got all the sugar then turn your machine on medium and start to slowly add in your eggs only add in bit by dish because you don't want this mix to curdle in the middle of adding in your eggs turn off the Machine and scrape down the sides again now that all of your egg is in there we're going to gently fold in the rest of our flour you can do it on the machine just keep it down low and don't mix it for too long all the flour is incorporated it looks lovely and then tasted a little Victoria sponge so much and I was young in my moment make Victoria sponge the best thing was that she let us lick the beater actually the best thing was that she turned off the beaters before she did as they come to bake your cakes grease and line your cake tins now for the wedding cake that I'm making I'm gonna put in the description below and I'm also going to include four smaller cakes just in case you don't want to make a big huge cake spoon your batter into the tin and even at the top this cake generally cooks pretty evenly but sometimes there can be a little bump in the middle so a nice trick that I learned in college would just make a little hole in the middle now ready for the oven bake your Victoria sponge at 350 degrees for around 40 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean in the middle gorgeous so I have my cakes ready to make a three tiers naked cake I made these cakes yesterday because it makes them much easier to frost if they're still cold and also a little bit dry from the day before I'm gonna show you how to cut and decorate one cake and then we're going to start to assemble it all so for each cake I'm gonna cut in two layers now a good trick is to get down nice and low I know it's hard but cut the cake layers as evenly as possible so now we have our three layers so you see all of these lovely crumbs as nice as they are and they are not nice in your frosting so get a little brush or you can use your hand and just try and sweep them away you don't want them to work their way back into the frosting I'm using my master recipe for buttercream frosting I'm gonna put a link in the description below the less you move around your frosting the less crumbs are gonna make their way up into it like I said this cake is rustic so there is no wrong way to frost it it's gonna look beautiful regardless also gonna layer on some jam because traditionally in Ireland you would have it with cream and jam and then just spread the jam around gently place the second layer on top and repeat like before with the frosting and then another layer of jam I'm using good-quality raspberry jam but you can use whatever Jam you like and then top it off with the last layer to get that naked look run your palate knife around the cake to smooth the frosting it gives it a beautiful rustic feel so before you put it on your cake stand we're gonna dredge it in icing sugar try and get the sides as best you can use the spatula to lift your cake onto your cake stand or serving pleasure I'm gonna continue with the other two layers and soon enough we're going to be assembling at all you know all of these smears and smudges like this is such a rustic cake it's part of its charm then again dredge this and ice and gently place the cake tears on top of each other at this point I'm gonna start to add berries some greenery and the whole cake is gonna come to life use as much or as little as you like and remember less is more you can even fortunate your cake to match the colors of your wedding it is the perfect cake for a rustic backyard wedding I fela seen using tips from other kin community channels I found great hair and makeup ideas and ways to make a beautiful rustic table setting this all adds up to a simple elegant wedding you can create yourself I really hope you are inspired by this week's video and remember if you want to make a cake for a special event do it yourself and make it make it I'll see you back here again next Thursday for more bigger bolder baking [Music]", "PKaa_QvJPT4": "welcome back to how to kick it I'm Yolanda and this week I'm teaching you how to make a floral tiered cake which is great for any occasion maybe something like Mother's Day to make this cake I baked 20 pounds of carrot I level each cake to the same height now for each size cake that I baked I baked three pens of that size and one of the pans I baked half the amount of batter as the other two pegs this way from the two regular pens I'll get two layers of cake and from the half size I'll get one for a total of five layers of cake and then I flip the cakes over and remove the carmelization from the pocket for this carrot cake I've decided to make an orange spice associate now my carrot cake recipe which you can find on my blog has oranges in it and some spice and I just wanted to amp it up huh to make my orange by simple syrup I boiled together freshly squeezed orange juice water sugar cinnamon stick and then a few pieces of my lovely orange peel which I just cut off overnight that's what sir squeezed wanted to do for his mother madam squeeze yes it is a family business he's carrying it that's why he's a sir he's actually sort of squeezed a lot the third you can't tell buddy's bougie he's wearing a top hat and bowtie in my cake book right now we are having a Mother's Day sale at had a cake accom grab the best deals and surprise your mom with amazing goodies click the I to check out my shop I've decided to fill this cake with cream cheese frosting because what's better than carrot cake with cream cheese frosting I need to pipe an Italian meringue buttercream fence around each layer of cake and then fill it with cream cheese frosting this way the buttercream sets up nice and firm and the cream cheese frosting can't if you want to see how I make my cream-cheese frosting you can check that out right here to pipe my fence I use a round piping tip I place my time rank butter cream in a piping bag and then I just turn my lazy susan while I pipe a border around the edge of the layer of cake then I a dollop of cream cheese frosting in the middle and spread it out to the fence making sure it's an even layer I don't want you to dredge up crumbs okay your mama doesn't deserve dredged up crumbs my son plays this game called one two three the floor is lava one two three the floor is lava then you're supposed to like get up on the couch so pretend the surface of your cake is lava and don't want your a spatula to hit it you really love that good yeah okay so I want to set up a playdate yep and then I need to crumb coat the outside with Italian buttercream and chilli I need to repeat this two more times my other tiers of cake if you guys want to see what I'm up to when I'm not in this kitchen head to head to kake.com and sign up to be a VIP I'll send you an exclusive video to your inbox on Monday night and I'll give you a first look at just like a pink now your crumb coat is chilled it is time to ice these cakes of course I'm using more Italian meringue buttercream and I'm just putting it on the sides and the top and then I want to use a bench scraper to get these sides nice and smooth plus the cakes are quite tall and the taller acade gets the harder it is to keep it straight I made about three batches of buttercream in anticipation of the making this cake and what I love about buttercream is you don't have to make it and then use it right away you can actually save it so you can freeze it for up to two months and you can keep it in your refrigerator for about a week and when you're ready to use it you just want to thaw it out to room temperature my Italian meringue buttercream is the recipe that I get the most questions about but it is in my book Cody what pages off Wow 30 close enough and I have helpful tips on how to store it as well and there's a beautiful picture of it and the goals and roll it deserves the goal number once your cakes are iced do you want to chill them and this time we really want our tears to be well cheer tears yes well chilled because the next step is dowling and tearing this cake place the dowel in firmly down to the bottom and then mark the height of the cake remove it and cut all of your dowels accordingly we'll need to be underneath the next tier of cake I got a new pair of gardening shears and it has changed my life I don't know why I waited so long and they have a bit of a spring so it actually helps you when you're pushing and they're sharp I've dumped that zero and I got me a hero I want to name my gardening shears I really do that's how much I love them guys please leave a comment below if you know what I should name new garden shears the next thing I want to do is place the next here on top this is where butter cream cakes get really tricky if this was a fondant cake I would use royal icing no dry and definitely stick bottom cream gets solid but it's not really sticky you still have to be careful again we're gonna repeat the process so measure that next tier from the center measure to make your circle formation of dowels to hold them next here place that to your on cut your dowels to size and then add your final I chose not to tear this cake perfectly centered because it's a buttercream cake it's harder to do and you won't be able to move your cake as easily the other nice thing about doing this is it gives you more room on the surface of each cake to place your flowers just tell people it's let's look rustic if you need to patch the bottom edges of your buttercream tears with my buttercream make sure your cake is cold and do this if it isn't you're gonna ruin the beautiful smooth job you've already done so if you feel like your cake has warmed up or it's really warm where you're making the cake puts the whole cake in the fridge let it chill and then fill in any gaps that you've created now I wanted to show you guys a really simple technique it's very Martha Stewart circa 2002 I'd say I'm just gonna pipe buttercream polka dots onto the cake I'm not gonna measure it's gonna be random and in fact I'm even going to do different sized polka dots so the easiest way to do this is to put a coupler or can I show you at a couple high coupler the easiest way to do this is to put a coupler in your piping bag so this is a coupler and then you add a tip whatever size tip you want and then you secure the tip in place with this okay but what's great about it is midway through piping you can change tips so you just unscrew it put another tip put it back on and you don't need to have six different piping bags but ik and why I love this is it's very carefree you don't have to worry about measuring a buttercream cake which already can cause indents in your cake and it's the perfect opportunity to hide any flaws you don't like your cake maybe there's a little air bubble me like you know and I'm saying maybe there's an area that you feel is not as smooth so just make some heavier dots there and no one is the wiser because it's not a perfect pattern the one thing about buttercream cakes that scares me is that if you poke them you can see it and boy I poke escape accidentally any little nick or scratch and the buttercream just lifts off so if you poke your cake like I did again the key is chilly chill the cake use a small spatula to fill in the area and if it doesn't look perfect pipe some more hook it up guys it's time to make this cake floral and decorate it with some beautiful fresh flowers but here at how to cake it I make a new cake every week and if you want to see what's upcoming please subscribe I'm adding fresh flowers to this cake I got them from my friend Casper and what I need to do to prep the fresh flowers for the cake is clean them up by taking off any leaves on the stem trimming them so that they're not too long and then the next thing I like to do is make little bunches almost like boutonnieres and then wrap them in floral tape and then what I need to do is get some straws and so I found the thickest straw I could find and then I cut three inch lengths of my straw and this way what I'm gonna do is anywhere I want to add flowers to the cake first I'm going to insert a plastic straw and then that little bunch is going to go into the straw I want to create some nice sort of bunches or arrangements of flowers on the top of each tier as well as just down at the base and I try to alternate their locations I'm like one over here I just like doing that you could do them all down one side and have it cascading you can do anything that you like so he is your son you need gifts I could even make you a cake he used actually last year he picked out an excellent card for me he picks his himself and it had a rolling pin and like often yeah he picked it himself and he actually has made me a cake you sound less impressed this is impressive this is gorgeous it is it goes this is a gorgeous marbling and this is not play-doh this is fondant I'm happy with this floral tiered cake and I'm super happy that I'm about to eat carrot cake but first I need to put on my floral print and then cut a slice did you help birthday of flowers or hon I've told you not to talk about that cake well it's still your solicitor but thank you I want to take that video down Oh ask Justin I can try I'm not sure it began that's not good enough okay that's not good enough you know what if I can make another tiered floral cake I can make another half birthday cake you're gonna make it again I'm gonna make a half for thinking they're live action I'm Kanye West in this I'm gonna remake half birthday cake next

(girl laughing) (girl laughing) - [Interviewer] Have you\nnoticed that sometimes when you're married to\nsomebody you do wind up getting in a fight with them?\n- Yes. You can get into quite a couple arguments, which I go for the spicy. For the vinegar, some things\ncan be a bit annoying, and then the sour is sometimes you have to just shake off your anger. - [Interviewer] That's\nwhat marriage is like. It's sweet, it's spicy,\nit's bitter, and it's sour. - And painful. - Wha? It looks good. - It tastes just like my grandma. - Yeah.\n- Soup. - Wait, let me guess. Is this from Vietnam,\nbecause it looks like pho. - [Interviewer] It's German wedding soup. - Hochzeitssuppe. - Honkakonk! (both laugh) - Hochzeitssuppe. I don't think I'll remember that. - Ew! It looks like alien farts. Like, they put them in a freezer,\nand they turned into this. - No, mm-mm. - Okay, I wouldn't dare not taste it now.\n- I don't like the inside. - [Interviewer] They're\ncalled husband and wife cakes. - I ate the wife. - I ripped the outside of it. (both laughing) - [Interviewer] Do you\nwant to get married? - Maybe when I'm like, Daddy got married. I'll be as old as him. How old were you when you got married? - [Dad] I don't know.\nYou'll have to ask your mom. - What?! (laughs) He doesn't even remember\nwhen he got married. - Oh, presents! - I take this one. - I take this one. - Mm-hmm, what is this? - Peanut butter and jelly! - [Interviewer] Ooh! - I've got a good idea. - [Interviewer] (laughs) You're drunk. - I'm so not drunk! (burps) - [Interviewer] They're\nlike a party favor, and at the end, everybody gets one. - Well, it tasted good. - Mm-hmm. - [Interviewer] Do you like them? - No, this is a bad wedding. - [Interviewer] I'm not married. Is there any, like,\nadvice you could give me? - Be nice to them, and\nif you don't love them, just dump 'em. (laughs) - [Interviewer] Okay! Ready? - Uh-uh. (\"Wedding March\") - Ah! (laughs) - [Interviewer] Now you're married! (boy giggles) - Goodnight everybody,\nand get married fondly. (girl laughs) - [Interviewer] (laughs) Okay, great, cut.", "-8H1fyo71l8": "and now the first time ever in a public gathering we have mr.

all our fillings and buttercream oh my god look at those cookies and cream pieces of each one oh they're like in little slices yeah those something like oh there's three slices each perfect yeah so they're already like sliced up oh well there's six slices so we have french toast churro yellow cake and red velvet these are so cold they almost feel like they were frozen they're really cold so amaretto crunch strawberry maple mousse cookies and cream which this looks so delicious i think it has like churro pieces in it okay well just take out your silverware and let's go i hope no one yells at us churro yeah i think yeah sure is definitely what i want to try first sure oh my god it smells like just um it smells like cinnamon ready yep so it's uh it's like almonds yeah i didn't know that there was nuts in there almond it tastes really good though it does really taste good you wanna try mama you try it you can taste like the crunch but it's not like a hard crunch it's like a like a or the amaretto crunch well it's the same thing i really like though it's like so cinnamon okay [Music] i think i'm going to like these more better these better traditional i was i was hoping that the churro was going to be better because everyone wanted it yeah i heard like so many people talk about how good the show was i like the cinnamon but i really do like it what is the maple smelling maple syrup it smells just like maple syrup that smells good like smoke crunch wow i didn't expect it to be like a cream when i dipped it into a syrup oh my gosh all right thank you now this one is the one this one is the maple mousse and french toast cake it tastes like christmas does it it tastes like christmas doesn't it like almost a gingerbread mm-hmm it tastes really good it tastes like it tastes like uh you know what it tastes like it tastes like waffles and syrup tastes really good okay let me try it it does taste like christmas like straight up i don't know if it's the maple syrup like that is giving it that like that tastes really good so if you try just the mousse it's like very creamy it melts yeah it's not as rough as this one this was great it was very good i thought that would be good with regular vanilla too i think i want to do the cookies and cream yellow cake with cookies and cream filling so like this one looks like oreos i hope they use real oreo and not like fake focus no i think it's i think it's real oreo i think it's real oreo it looks like yeah it looks like cake it looks like you can get it on texture oh it's probably like yeah it might be it looks like cookies and cream ice cream though you see this one it could be the different kind of smells like oh my god yeah it smells like a mixer [Music] all right this is your fork right yeah it's like rationing okay i feel like this is gonna be my favorite yeah that cake felt so like spongy is it fluffy mm-hmm it was really spongy how does it taste david that one's my favorite taste little black what just like orange like oreo right now the maple one is my favorite the maple one so far this is like cake with cake filling look like cake filling no it tastes like that it tastes well tastes like cake filling to me i like the yellow cake you can try it like yellow cake open up the yellow cake is probably my favorite cake so the cake yeah the yellow cake is really good maybe you could try the yellow cake with the maple filling try the buttercream too oh yeah we haven't even tried the buttercream um this is just normally i like the waffle one better than the the vanilla cake is really really good but the oreo wasn't that fresh the buttercream might taste good with the um no smell oh the oreo with the red velvet yeah or the red velvet with the buttercream we didn't get the cream cheese filling because i bet that would taste good with the red velvet but i figured we could we know what that tastes like that's icing yeah that that's icy that buttercream is definitely not the best it is i mean it's better it tastes like ice cream it tastes like icing yeah well that's because it is that's what goes on the outside i thought no no we could only pick a certain amount oh we haven't read the strawberry these are the fillings that go inside on the outside that's what that is it's just so that way you can you can taste it i just want you to be able to taste it with this dress right now strawberry with red velvet orange yellow whichever one with yellow cake probably yeah this one's probably gonna be my favorite that is very strong that's really good is it good like fresh oh yeah strong fresh strawberries that is fresh like mom it's so fresh you just get that strawberry like strawberry milkshake it almost tastes like a strawberry ice cream yeah like a strawberry milkshake and it has a consistency of like a malt yeah option but then i feel like because we can do more than one layer of flavor so you can do one of like a did you try the um amaretto crunch no this one is supposed to be really good with the churro i think maybe i was mistaken i didn't know we got the alma mater crunch and the churro so this is crunch that has churro bits this one has almond bits that one looks good this is almond apparently this one's very good with the caramel cake let me try it kind of smells like almonds well there is almonds that's very almondy yeah that one's not my favorite the almonds do you want to try it with the chocolate i mean how did it taste to you just added cake it tastes good though like this filling juice which one are you trying david the trail cake with the amaretto french icing how does it taste i like the texture of the almonds i really do they're not like too crunchy they're like soft but not like squishy okay so there's still a crunch maybe this one with the red bubble would you want to try to dress the almond oil crunch i really like the strawberry and the waffles are my favorite right now strawberry and my favorite cake is the vanilla cake the vanilla taste what is this crunch did i not say yellow cake nope oh well i don't know you don't like the almond crunch i guess this would be a risky because i don't know if everyone likes nods it's too um texturous i don't like the texture [Music] right yeah we don't want to squish the cake we have some decisions to make they're really good though all of them are really good but the yellow cake was my favorite just put the silverware inside and then you guys can finish up when we get home and put it in the fridge yeah we'll put it in the fridge for a little bit savor then we'll let your dad try it too i think he'll be excited we saved some for him yeah but actually they gave you quite a bit actually i was like oh it's small but it's actually really big eating that much cake is like and you eat it slowly or taste it that was a good amount for tasting they put salt and pepper in here oh they must do this at like the restaurants because there's already there's salt and pepper in case you want to add it on your cake [Music] [Laughter] which ones did you try already so dad tried the cookies and cream with the yellow oh don't worry the strawberry with the yellow he tried french toast with maple churro churro with amaretto yeah and that's just the buttercream that you could try with like any of them but man this vanilla cake oh the texture is so good come on i wish we would have got the cream cheese for that cream cheese yeah if you put some cream in the middle of that it would be perfect [Music] yeah i can't get over that strawberry and vanilla that is so good the strawberry is really good this salsa is really good what's your favorite i haven't tried the chili i feel like the churro with churro might be too much so maybe like the vanilla yeah with the churro might be like a little less cinnamon yeah i probably wouldn't get it as the cake icing though like this the amaretto even though it was really good yeah yeah i don't think i would get this i think i wanna i don't have a second paper crunch with the because i i don't think is it together right the french toast actually tastes as good yeah did you try it the french fries and maple is like one of my favorites the french chosen maple is also really strawberry i love strawberries that is just so easy yeah that's strawberry ella what do you think um yeah okay you're gonna try this one now yeah you gotta try this one oh that one with the tell me how you like that [Music] the strawberry with the vanilla cake it's like eating a warm soft strawberry shortcake yeah it's so good strawberry yeah essentially yeah i love it so good", "OiApn6HRgro": "hi guys so today I'm gonna show you how to do a simple two tier wedding cake now I'm gonna put three layers on each of my tears here I have a 10 inch cake and I have six inch cakes right here I also using cake boards this is a 12 inch board grid onto a 14 inch board over here I also have a 6 inch board to cover up my cake so let's get started let me show you how to put those together okay so I'm just going to go ahead and put a little bit of buttercream on my board just so that my cake does not move around and then I'm gonna go ahead and put my layer on and my cakes have been in the freezer so it's a lot easier to handle and then I'm gonna go ahead and start with a rim around my key just like that and then I'm gonna go ahead and fill my cake this is whipped cream cheese frosting that I made earlier and if you guys are interested just let me know and I'll put a tutorial up on how I make my whipped cream cheese frosting okay and then I'm just gonna go ahead and put my next layer on upside down do another rim and this is just to keep my filling from getting out from a cake so this will secure my filling because my feeling is not as strong as buttercream because it's whipped and so go ahead okay and then I'm gonna put the final layer on and I always put the bottom side up so that way I know that it's gonna have straight edges and the top is gonna be straight so now I'm going to go ahead and crumb coat white cake okay so I'm just gonna go ahead and start crumb coating my cake I'm filling in the gaps first cause it would be a lot easier for me to frost the site once I have the gaps in so I'm just gonna fill it in like this and it doesn't have to be perfect because we're still gonna be doing the final coat so I'm just gonna go ahead put a light crumb coat on my cake just to seal in any crumbs and this is just buttercream frosting that I made earlier today so if you can see it doesn't have to be perfect because basically what you're doing is you're just filling in the crumbs for the next step okay so I'm just going on top and smoothing out the the top of my edges really fast and what I'm gonna do now is this is gonna go into my freezer for several minutes I would parsley maybe about 15 SEC's and once I put this in the freezer I'll go ahead and start on the top tier so let me just go ahead and put this in the freezer really fast and then we'll start on the second tier okay so I have myself a six inch board and I'm just putting it on a bigger board so that way it's easier for me to handle my cake while I'm crossing it and I'm just going to put a little bit of butter plate over there just so it's around oh yeah sorry about that that was my husband because he's happy about something okay so now I'm gonna go ahead and put some buttercream on my six inch board just so that my cake does not move around and I'm just gonna go ahead and repeat the same process with this cake and then I'm gonna ahead and crumb coat it and then show you what I do next okay so I'm done with my top tier for now and I took out my bottom tier it's why I've been in the freezer for about maybe just five minutes not quite ten and I'm just gonna go ahead and start frosting my cake and I always start from the top going to the bottom it's so and this was a cake request for this weekend and so this was just one of the design that they had asked for and so I will be making this for them for tomorrow so I'm just making sure that all my sites are filled but I don't see any cake showing and I'm not looking for straight sites because they want this cake to have swirls on it and so that's what I'm gonna do hopefully you guys can see what I'm doing it's kind of an angle at the moment so I just want to make sure that all the bottoms are covered and I'm just gonna try and take off whatever excess that I can on my frosting at the moment okay and then I'm gonna come on top here I just want to make sure that I'm not frosting to cover all the sides of my cake and then I'm just gonna clean off my top just like that and I'm starting from the edge going in that way I don't have a ridge at the side of my cake and all I'm gonna do is clean my board I'm gonna use my spatula for that okay and so I'm just gonna go ahead and start from the bottom and they lost the scroll effect and so that's what I am gonna be doing and I'm just taking my spatula going from an angle and I'm just putting a dent in my frosting just like this and it helps have a turntable too and so it does help you guide your cake pull this all I'm doing I'm going to go ahead and come back on topic beam it off just like that and I want to make sure that I don't see that's so much bossing I kind of want it to be a bit smooth so I'm gonna go ahead and fix this with some hot water and then I will come back and show you what to do next okay so I went ahead and smoothed out the top of my cake and as you can see I use my six inch cake pan and I did an indent on my cake just to make sure that when I'm putting my top tier on it's on there as even as I can I'm just gonna go ahead and just measure out my okay so again I'll just be putting my dowels into my cake and measuring it out and then I will show you what it looks like after that okay so I'm just inserting my last dowel right now I just used a knife to cut my dowels and I made sure that they were all the same size so I basically just inserted one marked it and then made sure that all adele's match the first one instead of inserting it each one in and then cutting it to its its size so I'm gonna go ahead and put this back into the freezer finish my top tier frosting it and then I'll show you how to put the cakes together okay so I just really took my cake out of the freezer there's not one has actually been in the freeze a little bit longer I think this one's been in there about me 15 minutes this one maybe not even 5 minutes but I just wanted to green show you how I put my cake together so I'm just going to go ahead and lift up from the bottom you remember I had put a six inch board on the bottom of this cake and so I'm just gonna go ahead and put that down just like that fix my frosting I'm gonna go ahead and just pipe a small border it's like a bead border if you can see I'm just go ahead and start from the back just like this and I'm gonna go ahead and go all the way around my cake and then I will show you what that looks like okay so I'm done putting my cake together and piping my border on so now all I have left to do is putting my flowers on and these are fondant flowers that I made earlier today and if you guys want to see how I do it just let me know and I'll try and do a tutorial on it but I'm just gonna go ahead and put them on the cake yeah doesn't really have to be in order I guess but I'm just gonna go ahead and stick them on the cake that's out and again these are just the fondant flowers and so they're edible just like that and then I made some leaves over here too you can see and then I'm just going to stick these on to the cake too and so I'm not really making these into any specific order or anything I'm just sticking these onto the cake but I will show you what it looks like after I'm done okay so I just wanted to show you the final piece of what my cake looks like and this is a wedding cake again it's a very simple wedding cake anyone can do so hopefully you guys like my tutorial and don't forget to subscribe thanks for watching you guys", "cXyIHCswLgs": "hi I'm Tina from deco-pack what you see in front of me are two cakes from our wedding elegance line this wedding cake and it's accent cake we call them charming today I want to show you how to do some of the techniques it takes to make these two cakes let's get started I'm going to show you the ombre technique but on a smaller size cake so what we're going to do is take our darkest color with a tip number eight ninety seven and make us first strip right around the bottom and then just finish off just like that and we're going to make a few strips with the same color and make sure you start in the same spot and overlap just a little bit as you go around and go slowly so that you have a nice straight line will do one more strip and then we'll change colors next we want to go to our next lighter color and start in the same spot and make our nice ribbon design we're going to make one more strip with this color and then we're gonna change colors again so then we want to start with our next lightest color and again start where you left off and overlap and it's very important to work your frosting and that will reduce the amount of air bubbles that you get now we're going to do a quick strip around the very top it's going to link our two colors together okay now we do our last strip around just like that and our first layer is complete next we'll take our five inch cake and place it on top of our layer now you want to take your same color that you just used and make it your first strip on your second layer just like that now we're going to switch colors and we're gonna use our lightest color and as you can see I base ice my top tier the same color as my very last color I want to use on my cake and again you start in the same spot make your way around now we're gonna do our last strip around the cake line right around the top now our ombre look is complete I'm going to show you how to make fun flowers that you saw on the main cake we're gonna use our gardenia spray so what you want to do is just take your scissors and snip off the large flowers I'm going to use this flower and our gum paste petals to make a new modern look and what we're gonna do is airbrush it first with olive green just barely barely spray him then we're gonna use teal green and we're gonna airbrush just the edges of the flower it'll give a nice kind of aqua II feel to them we're gonna do the same thing to some of our petals olive in the middle and on the petals you just also want to just do the teal on the very edges now we want to shimmer our flowers and our rose petals the shimmer enhances the color in the flower and again with our rose petals we're just gonna take it and press it right in the front there and we're gonna add our petals around our flower and there you are we've got a nice modern flower on our beautiful ombre look now I'm going to show you the rosette technique on my accent cake you want to start off with your cake base ice with the color that you want your rosette to be this way if there's any gaps in between your rosette it won't show using a tip number 828 we're going to start at the bottom and we're gonna make a c-shape go next to it squeeze and make a C just go all the way around your cake like that now you want to start your second layer start in between two of your bottom C's and keep going around it's just a really nice way to complement your main cake now I've shown you a few techniques how to create these two charming wedding elegance cakes to see our full line of wedding cakes please go to our website deco-pack com", "F2kLMhp4bOs": "this fridge guys this thing comes in clutch look at all those concentrates boys but today we're going to be using this bad boy welcome back to another sick quick little video by your boy sebiji man today guys i thought it'd be cool to do a review on one of my favorite pods of all time it's been a long time since i've had this one man i've actually only ever had it once and it was when it was first released man so i kind of want to you know give it a try again maybe maybe it's not as good as i thought it was or maybe it is as good as i thought it was the first time all right guys so without further ado man as you guys can see by the intro we got the cannabis derived terpenes pod by stizzy right there boys nice little silver packaging and this one right here is the chem dog all right boys so this one the tc man the thc on this one is sitting at a high 89.78 thc so it's almost at a full 90 percent man so i'm actually really really excited to try this one now let's go ahead and pop this sucker open take it out of the case go ahead and pull the rubber off and then for the battery we're not going to be using a regular battery man we got a big battery right here boys i got it nice and fully charged so hopefully we can get some nice hits off of this and really really i just really want to see if it's as good as it was from the first time i tried it alright so without further ado guys let me know in the comments below if you guys have ever tried a cannabis drive terpene pod from stizzy if you have let me know what flavor man so without further ado guys let's hit this cheers oh yeah that's good well hold on now for the first hit add some fire it doesn't taste as gassy as the gorilla cake that i had it the first ever one they're garlic like i don't even know if they make that flavor anymore but that gorilla cake man it was one of the most phenomenal strains that i've ever had in my life it was so gassy and citrusy maybe that's why sizzy gave me that flavor so i could you know hype it up but so far man this one i'm not getting the super gassiness maybe i just have to bust it in you know get the coil wicked up all that stuff so let's go in on hit number two [Music] yeah it's just getting more and more gassier the more i hit it far after the two hits man this is a hybrid and i'm getting a little bit more of the indica dominant side of this because my head change was just so sudden and so like quick that it has to be indigo bro because i've never felt this quick of a head change from a sativa or you know i mean it is a hybrid but guys i don't know what it is if it tell me tell me that you guys feel the same way because whenever i try a hybrid cartridge sometimes it either does completely nothing to me or it completely destroys me when it's indica dominant so i don't know if the manufacturing companies you know the lab testing whatever it is maybe they just don't really do a good enough job to tell you if it's an indica because this one right here it might be an indica from the head change that i'm experiencing i could definitely get i'm starting to get like slumped my eyes are starting to get low i'm starting to like slur my words a little bit i'm trying not to but if it happens it's because of this dizzy pod guys come on don't blame your boy all right so what's going on hit number three man this is so far i'm getting the gassy notes but that's all i'm getting it's nothing like crazy flavor and it's not necessarily bad but i definitely want to taste a little bit more of i don't even know what to expect actually i don't know what i want to taste more out of but it's just a straight up gas and it's not enjoyable enjoyable i'd rather have a little bit more sweeterness or pininess terps but this is like just straight up gasoline you know terps so it's crazy something new for me so let's go in on hit number three okay and that one was a little bit from this one i'm getting like a little bit more muddier like flavoring to it and it's not like nasty but i just like the weed bro it's just the weed is just very very heavy [Laughter] and very very in your face it's like boom like me as a heavy hitter this is actually just very very in my face bro like i'm literally choking up over here trying to just hold my breath in from what i remember you know that's where chem dog gets to the name the cabinet is just super gassy toxic likes flavoring and it's just boom hits you in your face and i've never really had a good chem dog so i can't really say that you know i've i remember exactly what it tastes or smells like but this if this they probably brought out in this specific pod they probably brought out all the flavor profiles the entourage effect whatever it is because i'm tasting and you know feeling the high that i've never felt off of a chem dog so maybe this is a true form of the chem dog because honestly it's a pretty crazy high man and the flavor the flavor that i'm telling you guys is just like a skunky disgusting like taste bro and it's just like it's just from the plant you could tell us from the plant the terps are just just like just like some it reminds me kind of like some gmo to be quite honest it's just like garlicky like really deep muddiness taste to it but it's good you know you know that's kind of what you want out of what you wanted to just like destroy you in flavors i mean this is a whole different flavor profile that i've ever had because i'm more used to like you know sweeter terpy you know og piney notes but this one is just like intoxicating so far this cartridge um or this pot i should say is just insane like i'm faded right now probably on a scale from one to ten maybe like a eight so let's try to get to ten boys let's go [Music] yeah the flavor profile is insane like i cannot really see myself [Laughter] this is what a 90 cartridge does to you man this thing is annihilating my lungs like i'm dead serious i cannot even like catch your breath it's just like pow pow pow all in your face like the high is just i'd probably maybe up skeletal 8.2 i'm definitely getting a little bit more more and more high as i hit it but [ __ ] dude i'm baked and i'm pretty sure it's also because i'm pairing it up with the big batter because if i were to have it on the little body i'm pretty sure i could take blinkers and [ __ ] like that but ah guys i'm sorry i apologize i'm over here trying to catch my breath this is the first time that a cartridge has done to me you've done this to me in a long time it's insane all right so chem dog definitely some fire 89.77 tc is one of the highest percentage cdc's that i've seen on a cartridge honestly it's very very rare that you get those thc percentages people lie in like bs like distillate cartridges like 97 thc and in reality it's not even close to that so this i can truly say that it's actually pretty close to like a 90. it has to be like what they're saying it is because it's so fire and like the flavor the flavor is just something i've never like tasted before it's insane so chem dog you got me laid out this is definitely what i'm gonna put in a head stash for like when i'm dry or something i know this is gonna be the go-to to get me nice and faded right so we're gonna go ahead and end out the video here guys ah i'm faded i don't even want to take any more hits so i still have to edit this video do a lot more chores i'm going on san diego tomorrow so you guys might see a little san diego trip so you know let me know in the comments below if you guys want to see that let's get to 400 likes and i'll record my san diego trip all right boys so i'm ended out here i appreciate every single one of you g fam one last favor if you enjoyed the video you leave a like hit the comment oh man i'm so faded bro and last but not least hit the subscribe button i'll catch you guys on the next one", "hLW5oJ7KnXE": "hey guys welcome to Rosie's visit spot in this tutorial I'll be teaching you how to make this super white frosting and how to decorate your wedding cake I have a white 12 inch cake board and applying some buttercream frosting and my 10 inch cake on top and I'm sitting it in with some cream cheese frosting I'll have the recipe with this in the description box below stack up all your layers I used two 10-inch cakes cut in half make sure it's all nice and level and centered and then using a spatula to press the extra frosting against the cake here I'm creating the buttercream frosting on the outside this is actually Crisco vegetable shortening icing sugar milk and clear vanilla extract B that together for about two minutes and it should look something like that and I'll have their recipe in the description box below now using that frosting I'm creating the crumb coat to trap in any crumbs starting at the top and then adding a decent amount onto the side of the cake as well move that down and then clean the top by bringing that extra lip of frosting to the center of the cake I popped my cake into the freezer for about 10 minutes while I worked on the second tier now this is a seven inch cake following the exact same step and again putting that back into the freezer for another ten minutes and I'm creating now the final layer of frostings I'm adding in these and amount onto the size of the cake and it doesn't have to be too neat because we'll be texturizing the outside so just make it nice and even and clear at the top and then using your spatula keeping your hand nice and steady let the turntable do all of the work so you'll start on the line just above the last that you created and I like to clear up my spatula in between the lines of large keeps a bit neater once you reach the very very top bring that little frosting to the center you'll tend to raise the buttercream a little bit around the edges and you guessed it back into the freezer for ten minutes follow the exact same steps again with your top tier and I'll note quickly there is a two cake balls on this cake there's a 7-inch cake board which is exactly the same size of the cake and in the cake board that you can actually see right here they'll be important in a next step so I have five extra thick straws to support the weight of the cake is cut flush with the surface of my bottom tier cake really stops here from the cake board and there is a seven inch cake board underneath this top cake that's very important there needs to be a cake board the same size or a little bit smaller under your top tier and I'm creating a bit of a line to stop the so you can't tell where the one cake stopping Eon begins and I've also created a shell border to hide that same as well pipe another border for the bottom tier as well and then we can start there creating with our flowers these are called exquisite white roses and I've applied some wire at the bottom of each raised to help tuck it into the cake you can decorate some greenery what I really love to do is they create with some G Y P flowers chips I don't know I think it's called chipboard gypsy flowers and they're very beautiful very white and collect baby's breath but this particular cake I just use the white roses how can you take top up and you're done see they create a wedding cake or an engagement cake using super super white buttercream frosting thanks guys for watching I hope you enjoyed this video tutorial and I'll catch you guys again next week the ice little

one but two cakes i ordered one from a one star bakery and another one from a five-star bakery what cake shall be the tastiest of them all place your bed the battle is about to begin hi guys i am more and today i am all ready i'm all dressed up i'm literally about to match my cakes because it's a great day i get to eat two whole cakes but before we could sit down for this glorious moment i had serious matters to tend to i had cakes to pick and the bride has options honey if you're looking for wedding cakes there's just so many i went on pinterest and i was a very confused bride because there was just too many cakes going around so i needed to narrow it down i decided this time around i wanted a colorful wedding cake because hey i could probably pass that off as a regular cake and pay less money because when you put the word wedding in front of anything that immediately just drives the price up so first we have this beautiful cake with bright colors just a flower here and there it's very glamorous and very tropical at the same time oh and are those some churros i see on the side oh this cake winning we also have this beautiful garden cake like you just left it outside and some random weeds started growing on it this cake that your grandmother would 100 approve of this refreshing grapefruit cake i just look at it and i immediately feel fresh this cake that low-key looks like a kindergarten project but one that went right you got yourself a real arty kit man and this beautiful galaxy cake it just has little balls and i love balls it's purple and i love purple and they got a little bit of a drip and honey i love a good drip so our panel of judges decided that me myself and i decided to go for drum roll please the cake with balls on it yep that's what i'm gonna call it so first we're gonna start with the one star review cake and you are not ready for this are you ready okay here she is oh my gosh she's everything i've been dreaming of so let me tell you i got this cake from the same one star bakery i went to on my last video where i tried different cakes and i'm sorry but i just had to this cake was also 15 which says a lot about them this time around i didn't say it was a wedding cake i just said it's a cake man and you know what you might be out here saying that doesn't really look like a wedding cake and don't let nobody judge you if you want this to be your wedding cake then this your wedding cake girl but it was still 15 which i thought was great that means they didn't up charge on my other cake i mean i think it's kind of difficult to up charge on 15 and let's look at her i feel like they did a really good job with the color it even has the little stars the material i think it might be cream so it for sure has cream on top just like the cake i sent them but the sides so far i haven't stuck my finger in there but i'm just gonna do it i'm gonna see what it's made of oh it's cream for sure that's tasty i get my fingers still blue whatever coloring they're using it's strong i honestly cannot believe this cake is 15 it's so beautiful the drip is the only part where i'm like it doesn't look as well done i guess it doesn't look as straight but this 15 dollars you're doing amazing sweetie i did realize she's kind of falling a little bit to the side but that's all right girl you're 15 now for the taste if you watched my other video you know we had issues with the taste so i asked for a different flavor i gave both the one star and the five star bakery both the same exact instructions and that's for the cake to be vanilla with chocolate mousse that's what i would have about wedding real sophisticated now so let me try these stars i wonder if these are edible these are so cute mmm oh they tasted they also have the little balls but they're actually pretty small balls they're not big balls but they're beautiful i love that they were able to do this kind of shower star looking thing and she came all dressed up too this cake really got me feeling bad because 15 i'm like ma'am you're overworking yourself 15 for this whole cake i mean this must have taken hours just to place the little stars and the little balls but now for the five star cake i'm sorry ma'am out with the old so let me just give you guys a little bit of backstory i did another video like this and for my five star cake i paid 260 dollars and honestly i was feeling like that was a bit up there you know a bit on the expensive side but a lot of you said that 260 dollars was perfectly okay or a cake of that size and that look and i mean i don't want to insult no one but now that i got this cake i'm not so sure girl so let me just tell you all about this five star cake so i did everything by phone i just ordered the picture via email it's a really cute local bakery it's a really small place and they have amazing reviews danielle says that he made her wedding cakes multiple danielle got a budget honey and she could not have been happier they did a fantastic job the cake itself was delicious and her guests raved about it another person says this is one of their favorite places this place is amazing they drive out just to come and get their cakes so they got good cake now i did not say that this was a wedding cake so i don't know if this affected what happened but let me just show you guys behold the five-star cake here she is alright this cake is absolutely beautiful and it looks exactly like the picture i set exactly everything is perfect i feel like they did such an amazing job it has the little stars it has a little sprinkling the material it has cream on top but this is definitely fondant because i could just touch it and it's not melting or anything oh it's not as pigmented i'm looking a little bit scared why was the other one so pigmented there's no eye shadow don't worry i still love you now i need you guys to go right now drop a comment and tell me how much you think this cake was go i see you go y'all better be sitting down this cake was 40.40 forty what sir this whole cake i feel like i gotta go and do an internship at this bakery i gotta help them out washing some of those dishes this beautiful cake for forty dollars is really making me reconsider my one star bakery because i'm like girl you're great because you're only 15 but then you can also get this for forty dollars how this cake has all the little balls the little stars and it has them on the top as well so you can see how it's like full of cream and little things this one's actually empty which is fine because in the picture you couldn't really see so it's okay i mean they could take creative liberties with us let me just eat one of these little balls let's see okay you can eat them i'm like they're sweet mmm they're chocolate oh wow that's delicious and the stars come back star come back this is so tasty those balls are delicious honestly i feel like it's unfair to compare these two because i feel like both of these cakes are just absurdly underpriced and i feel like i should have paid more but i did tip girl but now it's the moment of truth time for the taste test so first i'm gonna cut into my one star cake and don't judge me for the way i cut into my cake just let me live my life i'm not judging you for watching cake videos on the toilet so all right here we go this cake is so soft it smells good it smells really sugary but i kind of don't trust this cake i'm like your sister already betrayed me all right we cutting in the slice it's really really soft oh no not again wait stop what is that it has some white liquid on it but why there's nothing green only white so that's much better it looks like it's vanilla and then it has the chocolate but between the layers of chocolate i guess it has some sort of cream or something i don't know if that's just to make it stick maybe so let me give it a try this cake feels like it has some sort of liquid on it i don't know if you can just see it it's so hard to describe it it's almost like wet hmm oh god you guys this is gonna sound very strange but that tastes like mint why mint it is sweet but it has a minty aftertaste why would vanilla with chocolate mousse have a minty aftertaste it's just not good i really wanted to give this place another go because i thought maybe they had gotten confused and they put salt instead of sugar on my last cake but i think there's some problems going on in that kitchen okay now i'm gonna cleanse my palette hopefully with a five star oh you let me down just like your sister literally my mom hopefully this girl does better do better cake so i'm just going to cut into this this cake is much much taller oh it also feels really really soft honestly it's softer than i thought it was gonna be oh there we go and now i'm gonna get my slice out help some of y'all professional cake slicers come help me oh no why is the whole thing lifting cake oh i think it has a base oh it has like a cardboard base okay okay i'm just pulling this out oh this is different so this actually looks like chocolate mousse because i asked for chocolate mousse i think the one star place just put some random chocolate in there there's no white stuff on this cake it's just vanilla and i love that it has quite a bit of chocolate this actually looks delicious please jesus let it be good it's good but i will say the cake from the other video the one that was super expensive was actually better this one's good though it tastes literally like vanilla and chocolate mousse it feels very like homey the chocolate feels really rich like it tastes so good but it's like milk chocolate it's good and for 40 yes so i hate to be the one to bring the bad news i hate to be the one to have to pick a cake usually with food i just have no favorites just give it all to me but this time i will say this cake to me is the clear winner i mean it has a great prize it tastes so good it looks exactly like the picture she's just a beauty she has looks she has inner beauty and she affordable i mean really we can't ask for more but yeah guys thank you so much for watching i hope you enjoyed this video and don't forget to check out the other video i did with cakes like this and yeah i'll see you on the next one bye", "gVrKDmJZEX4": "[Music] hi guys welcome back to my youtube and sorry for the slight absence a lot has been going on in the world of Georgia escapes all good including this new kitchen and so this is gonna be a little test because I will do more YouTube videos for you and so I'm gonna do them here so I'd love to know what you think and write in the comments below and don't forget to subscribe and share with all your friends now this video is one of my most requested videos it's how to stuck a wedding cake or a tiered cake it's actually a lot more difficult than you think it's not just about stacking cake on cake on cake because it will obviously collapse and then here's a clue of what the video is going to be about so let's get started so what you're gonna need is a drill and you don't actually have to have a drill and jung-hwan be careful but we're basically going to be drilling a hole through a cake board so you can kind of dig in with scissors but it's just easier to do it with a drill so what I've done is I'm going to use an 8-inch cake board and this is for an 8-inch cake so usually you go for a slightly bigger cake boards for the cake to sit on but we want it the same size because when we stuck it we don't want to see any capable so I've got a piece of paper here that I cut out and I need to find the center of it so like my lining team trick I'm going to hold it in two sections and I'm going to cut just the very top of the cone and when I do the power I get the center and that is what I move to line up with just intermarket I did say not to really a citizen's but this is how much i've actually marked at the center of the keynote now the reason why we want to hold in the middle is because we're going to put a wooden dowel through the whole cake and you buy these online or in pink specialist shops but they are basically going to hold the cake up so it doesn't go anywhere especially if you're traveling with it on it you don't want it to do that so we basically want the hole to be as big as the down which is why I have the drill so just get a container a bowl or something like a dome door and place this a bit at the top and our fun part like to drill up and just drill through so as you can see through the tape bullet now that's not big enough for the wooden rod so I'm going to make it slightly bigger I'm just going to go up and down a bit with the drills first and then I'm actually going to use the scissors kind of just open up all of it so while it's centered on the board people the hole slightly bigger than the rod just checking though it does go through yeah there's a bit of space as well reason being is because as accurate as we wish you although it might be slightly out of line so it's better to have a slightly bigger hole for when we stack it out so I'm just going to neaten up the board by cutting off this excess and don't forget the other side as well especially because this is going to be sitting on another cake and there we go so nice hole in the middle of the cake board so now we can put our drill aside but you want to keep this for a later stage and I'll show you anyway and now you're gradually going to use this to build up the cake so we want to put it on a larger cake board like we usually do and I'm going to flip it upside down and now I'm just going to put some double-sided tape around the bottom I don't actually have any double-sided it so I'm going to loop it around and just stick it like this so it doesn't actually have to be too neat it just has to have enough of sellotape on for it to stick on the cake board like this press it down so it's nice of stuff and now you can build up your cake so remember this top cake board is the same size as your cake which actually makes things easier because when you scrape around you hit the cake board you actually get a really nice size there's a little trick if you want to try that anyway so I thought one prepared so again this cake was built on top of the cake board and we just show you it's the same size and the idea is nothing going to lift this off and it will be on its own cake board so I think is time for the stacking part okay now it's time to stuck the cake I've got a 10 inch cake and ancient and a 6 inch having already head to this banner and go and watch my sponge cake tutorial they're all the same sponge it does make a six inch but if you want an 8 inch mm and if you want a 10 inch triplet and cooked in two pans is most simple recipe and as works perfectly so each of these are on its own sized cake board including the base because when I get to a venue and deliver the cake I slide it off and you don't want the bear cake on the cake step so even a tenant has an extra board on to me I also put large cakes on a cake drum just because my not transporting a tiered cake the very thin key cards are too thin and they'll start bending so let's go what you'll need for this is the wooden dowel which was talking about before which is going to go through the center of the cake and then smaller dowels but I actually use jumbo straws now it's a cheaper option but they're just as good you're not going to use it this tool but I'll just show you we will cover and they are very strong and it's bees which are essentially supporting the other tiers now just a warning make sure your cakes are cold because it will just think your mic so much easier these have been in the fridge for a few hours they are pretty solid even put them in the freezer if you've got space not too long but the last thing you want is buttercream or maybe a hat but you couldn't gonna get anyway it's just make things a little easier so I'm going to get my circle from before and actually fit up on top of the 10 inch and try and find the center once you're happy with that you make a hole with the wooden rod and now I'm just going to lift the paper back up I'm just gonna do around double-checking that is the senator when lining the rod up roughly measuring yeah that's pretty central so now we're going to put the little rod through the whole cake okay now I'm going to go round the wooden rod with about five or six straws again just to enhance the strength of the structure so I'm going to place the straw in the cake I'm going to give it a little wiggle just so a little bit of buttercream touches so when I put it out I can see where the buttercream is and then I can trim it to exactly then push it back down I'm going to repeat it some of the five times okay so I've chosen to do six straws I would suggest five or six if they're doing a 10 inch cake and obviously reduces the small of the cake is so now it's time to put the 8 inch on top and just before I do that I'm going to put a little bit of buttercream just so the cake instead so here's the scary moment I'm going to use a palette knife and take off the cake so I'm holding it from the cake water underneath and facilitate may stick to the cake board such as feared around and take it off and now I place it on top of the cake find the center slowly lower it and the stick will come out - off the top let's just clean that up and just double check but you're happy with it but it's nice and straight now as you can actually see there's quite a big gap underneath and I'm going to fill that with a little bit of buttercream again as ten times easier if the cake is cold so the outer layer but we smudge with this very slight and then I'm going to meet up with a palette knife and I'm going to go around to the side screen I must admit naked cakes are not easier more forgiving doesn't matter if you scrape a bit about expunged okay so now it's time the mole strolls before we add the second layer and it takes a little buttercream and now thanks to the cake on top it's insane again compress it down slightly I'm just going to fill the base with a filibuster cream just to fit in that gap again and scraping today we have it my stucked wedding cake or celebration cake just to remember that each tear is on its own cake board with a window down inside and straws supporting it to just remember that when you're traveling with a tiered cake make sure it's one aspect or word like this and you don't really want to go to other than this I may put a four inch on top but I also decorate it at the venue it just saves the worry also if you are delivering a wedding cake just make sure that the cakes must know that there are all these straws inside cause it'll be a little bit of a surprise if they don't know they usually do I hope you enjoyed this video please leave your comments below let me know what you think of the new video format as

awesome it was really really mind-blowing i mean it was awesome awesome awesome that was the best wedding i've ever been to that was like oh it all started okay i have known the couple since 2019. uh back then the bride dealer called to other birthday cake for a husband then fiance right so that was my first encounter with them we made the cake she was she loved it and the husband also loved it so um that's how i got to know the couple so fast forward to i think december 2019 meanwhile after we made we had made a series of breaks for them in the bakery and all of that so too myself and my team were praying for them to get married you know because uh that was the first time i got to know about them about their love about who they are and all of that so we're praying for them to get married because they come across as couple who is really really in love i mean they are love tryptops everybody in my bakery we were tripped by their love and you know people will go to any mile to express love and affection to each other so in a subtle way we're praying for them to get married when i got the phone call in december 2019 that the wedding was going to happen oh my god i was happy you know we're legit happy for them and then she told me it's a real theme wedding and i want a castle cake okay in my mind i'm like okay castle cake oh yeah now we'll do it she told me to send inspiration and all of that so i went online to like search for like elaborate castle cake you know because she had stated she wanted to elaborate so i sent picture and then she kept saying nope nope nothing no fun i'm like okay where are we going so you know eventually i think after a few days i had sent up to like 10 pictures also of elaborate castle cake i just got that picture from uh and i'm like omg it was indeed an elaborate one but i mean my first impression was somebody did it so i can do it you know like all through my career i've never thought that uh there's such a job so big or too big for me to handle you know yes it will take a lot a lot of brain work a lot of challenges and all of that which i'm going to get into later but i mean immediately i saw it i knew i could do it hmm understanding the design of course i studied the picture for nights for days and oh my god did it literally it became stuck in my head so um first of all i knew i wasn't going to do it alone obviously i i wanted perfection and of course it's a it's a building it's a castle you don't just say oh i'm going to add this plus this and it's going to be it's going to be perfect you know i knew i needed somebody good in mathematics or um an architect so to speak right to be able to execute the project so you know first of all i looked at it counted how many pillars i could see you know because looking at the picture is different from actually bringing something to life you know because when you see a picture you see it from just one dimension and of course to this cake there were four dimensions right so i had to bring my own creativity in we had to do a lot of calculations we had to think of um the the best things to do the best you know way to go around it that the weights will not be too much for the cakes to bear how to incorporate the cakes in between the the long um pillars of sugar work and all of that so i mean that took that took weeks that it took weeks and of course i had to add like a one-on-one chat with an architect we also come up with a plan every structure and every item you see on the cake was calculated it was a lot of mathematics you know because um there were like different layers and different dimensions to it at the end of the day you need we needed to be able to stand in front of it and say okay this makes sense structurally you know and all of that so hmm challenges as you may of course i'm sure if you look at the picture and you think so deep about it you would know that such a project like that cannot go without challenges ha where do i start from i have a long list of challenges where do i start from okay the first was uh initially the wedding was supposed to be in april but because of the lockdown that couldn't happen so they shifted to december so i had ordered for a lot of things that i'll be needing um for the cake online and then i mean the lockdown things never came things did not come about six to seven items i did not receive them i could not trust them because uh when the lockdown started you know all my thinking was you know because i was tracking and all of that it will be with the local post office here and then after the lockdown i can just go there to pick it up and all of that so after the lockdown i went to the post office to receive some of my items and it was just about two that came i followed and followed up and you know they said they didn't receive it i went back to where that from the city i delivered to nigeria i mean about seven expensive items got lost in uh in post stage because challenge number two oh my god this is a very funny one so looking at the wedding cake of course you would agree with me that they cannot cut it with a knife so in my mind now ah let me know that is sword you know because i of course you can't just walk into a store and get one around here so and i'm of course used to ordering things online and all of that so let me order a sword for them to cut the cake i mean it was part of the items on my list of things to order so i mean i do a lot of ordering online so i'm already used to how diotine works and all of that so i went online i saw a nice one i read the description if you know past it um passed every uh mark and all of that i placed another it was expensive as you may think when it came low and be old i received foam i mean like plastic see like i mean when i lifted it at first i'm like okay like i didn't expect this thing to be this light so i sort of broke it you know because there was so much uh disbelief for me right so i broke the tip and it was plastic inside foam like layers of foam and plastic so that was like a little setback for me because i thought you know i've ordered my sword and that is it i have it now so i had to like made other plans you know i mean thank god for one of the grooms that i did a wedding cake for funny enough the wedding was a week to this wedding he told me oh i'm going to cut my wedding cake with a sword and i'm like oh are you in the military and he said yes and i'm like please can i please borrow it you know i have an event i really need it he was skeptical it was like ah no i can't give you if he gets missing i'm gonna get in trouble i had to show him i had to beg him i had to plead with him with i mean everything i it gave me the most fancy sword i've ever seen i mean it was gold and black it was really really nice so that's the story about my number two challenge number three was uh the water fountain i mean i prepared though i prepared a lot all this all these challenges is not even as a result of lack of preparation so i mean i was looking for a miniature water fountain that could fit with the structure of the castle i searched and searched i found it was an american product so i ordered it from america so when the fountain came i mean it was in the box it was nice it was intact and everything so i kept it in a safe corner that's a day to the wedding i'm going to bring it out and we're going to put it on the wedding cake so um i think a week to the wedding when we were doing i mean all of the calculations of the spacing and all of that i was thinking the space i left for the fountain was a bit small so i was thinking of adjusting that so i had to unwrap the fountain to see if it would fit with the space that i provided so that's how i poured water i followed i mean it came with a manual i followed all the instructions fought the required amount of water and i powered it and then it went boom like it literally went off everywhere was smelling of buns electricity stuff and all of that it was burnt i mean this was a week to the wedding exactly a week to the wedding first of all if i want to order another one where do i start from it's not going to arrive on time secondly i couldn't it's not a product that i could find around so i had to make it work i started panicking i i was all over the place and you know we had to call an electrician to come and check it out for us so uh well we're hoping that what got burnt in it would be something that we could easily replace like buy a replacement for and all of that apparently with american electrical products you need to i was supposed to use is it step down or step up for it you know because the electricity currents over there and the one here is not the same thing so you can't just buy something from over there and plug it directly to the to the socket which was what i did and of course the thing went off but luckily after i think after a day we discovered that what went wrong we could buy a replacement then we had to do like a rewiring of the entire thing to fit in with the nigerian standard and all of that challenge number four was the door well i mean i knew the cake was big and you know i have always known that the dog could be a challenge but i mean it's easier planned than done so uh when we started decorating we had to even before we started decorating we had to take measurements of the dough to make sure that whatever we are making is no bigger than the door right so we had to literally fit everything to to the size of the door the ones that were going to be bigger we had to make it like a puzzle so that you know we just put it together at the venue even at that we had to still remove the dough because it wasn't easy to lift because it was a lot of weight and it required a lot of people to carry so we had to remove the dough we had to remove the demarcation in our bakery we had to remove the front door to be able to get the cake to the car everything we used on the cake was sourced from five different countries we did a lot of buying from the uk we did some buying from america china uae and of course nigeria so five countries i was most nervous about the delivery the delivery of the entire thing i mean how what the bride would think of it how people would see it if it's truly going to take my business to another level mostly especially how the bride would say it's because she's my client and i mean one thing stood out with this particular client she's never seen me do something that big she's never seen me do something that elaborate and yet she was she had peace of mind she believed so much that i could do it she never doubted from day one she never doubted so i was nervous about meeting up with our expectation basically i wanted people who are easy to work with people who could work without supervision that was very important to me because sometimes i get tired and i would need somebody to take over and all of that so i wanted somebody who's whose work is equally nice and flawless people who could work without my supervision basically so that when i'm taking a break they'll be able to understand the concept and carry on with the decorations and all of that and oh and god blessed me with the best team ever i want to use this medium to say a big shout out to everybody from abubakar to phil to kayla to shifty taste to kicks by cece mr bubbs my team or kicks violence staff they went over and beyond everybody two kids like it was their project like not even for one moment did i think i was in this alone like we were all in need together up until the last minute it was it was incredible the first few hours i was trying to keep up anywhere this cake goes i will follow our comment oh my god okay so when bella naija posted the cake and then they said of course we wrote facts about the cake on our page you know i wrote the number of days it took to accomplish and all of that and then they said oh it took uh four months so a lot of people read it they read that statement wrong i went to the comment section to read you know because i wanted to see what everybody's saying and all of that so a lot of people really got that wrong so you know when they see that oh you started planning or you started putting things together like i walked on the cake for four months they thought i had baked the cake four months ago of course that's not possible somebody would not pay so much for a cake i won't even make a cake that huge even if it were free and deliver a still cake i mean that's that's ridiculous the major process of the entire thing we had to do planning we had to do a lot of planning we had to do architectural design which took so long this is included in my calculation of the timing right we had to make sugar flowers oh my god for every sugar flower that was on that cake was individually attached like petal by petal i'm going to post a video of it it was individually attached petal by petal and we made thousands of sugar flowers that took dish making the sugar flowers alone took four months and that's not even the baking you understand sugar flowers is just icing sugar that's like one of the hardest things to do in cake decorations you know because we made thousands of them and they were hand made by us by my staff by me you know so the sugar flowers alone and sugar flour is not cake it's not baking it's just made of icing sugar the cake itself was baked maybe like a little a little less than two weeks so they were like maybe some eight days to the wedding i mean and for him as a matter of fact so we baked over 36 layers of cake right and i mean of course for a project like that you don't go baking red velvet vanilla and whatnot it was fruit cake fruit cake has like a really really long shelf life no chemical was added at all if anybody knows cake by elena they know i don't put a preservative in my cake nope i don't the preservative that comes with um fruitcake is alcohol and uh i'm also going to put put up a video of that like a lot of alcohol to keep the cake really nice and moist and you know it also helps keep the cake not going bad so if you know a lot about cake of course i'm sure you understand that fact or even if you don't know so much about cake you can check it out online a fruitcake can last for as long as you want to keep it like for as long as you want to keep it and at room temperature free kick can last for up to six weeks at room temperature that is not even putting it in fridge at all you know it lasts that long so of course the cake was not baked four months ago like who would do that sorry fast forward to two weeks earlier i was thinking oh we all wake up at 4am in the morning the day of the wedding we go to icc and start our setup by 4 am and then somebody in my team suggested oh why not let's do an all night at least even if the cake is standing by 12 a.m we will all have peace of mind and know that everything is going smoothly and you know instead of being rushed and all of that that we should do an all-night setup so of course i bought into the idea and i'm like oh okay that's nice the best that will happen is by one am midnight our kick is standing tall and we all can go and sleep chill and then look good for the wedding and all of that little did i know like it's as if i underestimated that part a lot so first of all we started moving from the bakery so i'm moving all the items from the bakery four o'clock on friday that's 4 p.m on friday lift carrying the kkk alone the bottom tier took 16 people we had to go and look for like 16 powerful people to lift the cake that part i was really really nervous you know because after months and months of walking you don't want things going wrong at that moment because whatever will go wrong you cannot fix it i mean and that would be a very very huge blow i was never you needed to have seen me that day when they were lifting the cake i was so nervous so they lifted the cake it was challenging we removed doors it took more than 30 minutes from inside my bakery my workspace to the car and the car was packed as close as possible you know because they had to like deliberate when they started moving they had to pause to say turn it this way turn it that way i mean that took a lot so um i think we we used five cars we used five cars delivery took five cars including a bus and a tundra and the boss had to do four more trips after the five cars so you know finally we got to icc we had to set up the crates that's the the foundation of the structure that's where all the weight is going on and all of that we set up the crate we lifted the bottom tier i think by 8 30 p.m my calculation was the setup was going to take four was going to take four hours but on the fourth hour we had only lifted the bottom tier so we lifted the bottom tier i mean that took a lot of effort i can't even go into the details it took a lot of nerve-wracking effort to lift the cake on the platform so we lifted the bottom cake we lifted the next one and then the smaller ones and then you know we had to put the castle together the pillars together as at the time we were putting the pillars together we realized that five of the lights was not working lights that we had test drawn in the bakery before leaving everything was nice and shiny we got to the venue and that's how five of it would not work it won't come on so we had to do a rewiring for that i mean finally at i think yeah finally at around 2 30 a.m that's 2 30 a.m saturday morning my castle was standing we are not finished but i mean you could see the old thing everything was nice and bright my fountain was flowing all the details and all of that was on it so we just needed to do some um adjustments finishing touches arranged flowers and all those like extra little touches dotting the eyes and crossing the tee which we did and finally by four year we finished oh my god that was my winning moment that was my winning moment it was my winning moment oh my god that's like one of the best feelings in this world oh my god i was so excited like almost a whole year of planning and everything turned out so beautiful i'm still trying to process it i'm still trying to process that it was so beautiful the decorators everybody in the all every present and they all at that time came close to look at it i was happy happiest person in the world i was excited my team felt like i mean we felt relieved i can't describe it it was magical reactions people's reactions like i said the reaction started after set up 4 am after set up i mean i got a little reaction i was like just the tip of the tip of the iceberg you know i went to i rested i think i rested for like one and a half hours i didn't sleep that night oh my god and you know i got dressed i went back to the venue i got to the venue before the event started to take proper videos and pictures of the work and all of that immediately people started coming into the all everybody like almost everybody walked up to the cake to take pictures to express how amazed and how they've never seen something that big and beautiful the photographers everybody they were just taking pictures it was celebrities you know you know big people you see on instagram now everybody was walking up to my kid to take a picture with the cake like i've never ever experienced such people wanted to take a picture of me with the cake i'm like okay you know i enjoyed the spotlight my cake stole the show like literally stole the show if you stand at the back at the entrance of isis see you can spot it clearly from the entrance and you know how big isis is quite a very big venue you can spot the cake everybody was happy the bride oh my god our reaction is priceless it's something um to get a task done and it is another thing for the client to love it she loved it she loved it i was so happy i was so happy she loved it everybody loved it all the celebrities before i could bling the cake was everywhere online every like i mean everywhere everywhere it was everywhere i was so excited it made everything worth it the sleepless nights the troubles the nervousness the stress oh it made everything worth it and already in fact as i'm speaking i have a lot of messages i've never i can't even keep up i've not responded to i've been getting a lot of messages a lot of calls on wedding cake you know what something like this does for your brand is on a good day people would hardly walk up to you to order something they haven't seen you do before you know i mean my bride was kind enough to order something she has never seen me do and i pulled it off i'm happy so you know when some when people see something like that they don't have any doubts like all doubts erased number one so like imagine somebody is working on an elaborate wedding cake and they're thinking oh who can pull it off they won't even think twice before they come to you that's number one already i'm already in talks with two people who also want an elaborate castle cake for their wedding one is even in ghana you know i'm hoping like all things being equal you know if we agree and all of that but i mean even aside that you know we've had so many others like a lot of others between then and now we have people sending them sending us um pictures of big huge elaborate wedding cakes you know we have people in fact even at the venue i have people who walked up to me to say can you come to lagos can i can i bring it bring you to lagos for an event i have you know so things like that people believe more in my brand people believe oh there's nothing there's no tax we give this uh company that they cannot achieve you know and that means a lot to me i slept and woke up 24 hours later i have ten thousand more followers even i think twelve thousand twelve thousand more followers that that is a lot that means a lot it's going to add up to more customers it's added up to more recognition and every other thing that follows the story is on all the blogs that is what all nigerians like everybody is talking about and you know i've had people call me even distance friend like some distance friends you know they call me to say oh my god you did so well i'm so proud to know you i'm so proud to associate with your brand you know everywhere they go they let people around know that i know the person that did that cake i know the company that did that click and i i mean that's that is what any business would ask for what i will do differently not much not much well i mean we learn every day this project was a learning process for me and of course i will not admit that every everything went perfect i will not say everything went 100 okay there are some things that would have done easier actually that would make the work faster and all of that so i think when next time handling projects like that i would avoid baking like really huge pieces as a single tier you know because the lifting was challenging so it's going to be more like um smaller bits then fitted together at the venue or maybe walk walk at the venue that's not so easy anyways you know so i mean i would avoid making a very huge cake as just one cake to be lifted that's for sure and that's about it every other thing i'll do the same i don't have any regrets hmm my favorite detail on the cake i would have to say is the entrance i mean if you look at the cake from any angle there's a story to it there's a feel to it you know it feels like you're if you're by the side it feels like you're by the side of of a castle of a lifestyle sized cat okay not the life size of a castle and all of that then um in front at the entrance we have a lot of detail and then you know where we have the fountain to the entrance we have like the cherubim by the side of the fountain and then the us carriage and the horses running towards the entrance i think that's my favorite part you know because you just have this feel like it gives you goosebumps you know and for everybody that saw the cake they actually took a picture of that part right the entrance to the castle my message to the newlyweds i'm a fan of their love like i mentioned earlier when i look at them when i look at their relationship they are crazy about each other they respect each other so much they are happy with each other like i see when i look at them either physically or online i see nothing but joy i see nothing but love you know and it's it's amazing like what is she is amazing you know there's nothing i want to say that has not been said by people who are wiser like pastors and all of that but um i wish them a lifetime of love i wish them a lifetime of happiness i wish them favor god's favor in their marriage their children will make them happy they will conquer the world together they will break new grounds together i wish them more success because they have touched the lives of many through this wedding like i'm a living witness i was dead so there's there's even know how somebody like that god will not choose you to favor you i'd like to say very big thank you finally to everybody i mean everybody will repost that everybody will shed this either on their story on their platform everybody will send messages so everybody will call in every way i say thank you and i would also like to say thank you to my husband you know he stood by me through all of this i mean we we literally did that kick together till the end we stayed all night in icc together so i'd

Shop and welcome to an episode of fail Friday so have you ever been in the situation where you really needed a cake and you wanted it to be custom or you just wanted it to be a bit fancier than the ones that you get from the grocery store then this video is for you this cake was a steal of a deal it was only nine dollars and for all the additional supplies that I needed to decorate this cake it was under 22 dollars if you tried to use store-bought icing straight from the can then you'll notice that it's a little bit floppy if you try to pipe it my little trick is just to whip it up for quite a while until you get stiff peaks whipping up the icing also makes it a nice bright white instead of ivory I never buy grocery store cakes but what I did learn when I bought one today is that they're gonna give you a cake board for free if you ask for it the first thing you're going to do is to scrape off all of the excess now this cake was a little bit more on sale than the other cakes because I think it was falling apart a little bit so I'm just going to do a little bit of reconstruction here and just try to get that icing nice and even and get those layers even as well the cake is falling a bit sideways and the layers aren't stacked on top of each other perfectly evenly so all you need to do is you need to fill in all of those gaps with frosting because the crumb of the cake is a little bit loose I don't want to scrape off too much of the cake so I'm actually adding on a really generous layer of frosting this will make it easier to finish up the crumb coat yes we are kind of re crumb coating the cake this cake is a turtle's cake so I actually want to keep all of those yummy little bits on the top so I'm just going over with a little little thin layer of icing if your store-bought cake has a lot of roses or other type of piping decoration just be fearless and kind of crumb coat that and scrape everything off [Music] what's most important during this step is making sure that you get the shape that you want if it's not the shape that you want now the cake will never be the shape that you want it to be so just keep adding frosting where needed and take away where you don't want it I chose these little chocolates because they kind of looked like the color palette that I was going for I wanted to go for all types of kind of pinky purple ease so this went really well if you want to keep costs down then you probably want to have a particular color palette in mind for the decorations that you're going to be buying I made sure that I only bought one or two things because I knew I was going to pipe most of the decorations anyway if piping isn't your thing then using flowers or fake flowers are a great option as well I am using food coloring that I already had on hand but again if you're trying to keep costs down and you don't want to buy food coloring that you're just going to never use again then you can go ahead and purchase icing that is already colored for you time for the final coat that crumb coat stayed in the fridge for about 30 minutes I don't know how store-bought icing really reacts to the fridge so I thought better a little bit longer than I normally do what's great about this drip cake option is that you don't have to be too perfect with the swipe here because you're going to be adding trips you're also going to be adding as much detail as you would like so it's going to cover up any little imperfections you might have [Music] I took that white chocolate and I added a bunch of vegetable oil to it so it's really really thin because I love it when it drips down in this manner if you like it a bit thicker then add less vegetable oil and then I added some purple coloring to it as well now if you don't have those things on hand you could easily just melt regular white chocolate [Music] [Applause] [Music] once you get to this stage with your cake it's already done such a transformation that it's a beautiful blank canvas to do whatever you would like with it I think putting in some fake flowers at this point or fresh flowers would look really really beautiful but if you are comfortable with piping then you might want to try this as it is a very cost-effective solution so I just took a piping bag fitted with a large star tip and I did have to add about a quarter cup of icing sugar to the frosting and then I reworked it just so that it would be nice and thick and everything would be well defined it also helps me to stick that on to the side of the cake like that if you don't add the icing sugar it might not stick as well these sprinkles that I'm adding are not factored into the original cost because I already have these on hand but that's the beauty of this cake if you have anything on hand you can go ahead and use it and make it work I'm splattering on some gold luster dust mixed with a little bit of vodka because I always have this on hand as well but you could totally skip this step [Music] [Applause] [Music] just a few last golden pearls [Music] factoring in all of those extra things that I already had on hand I would say you could definitely make this cake for under $30 Canadian most cakes of this size and this detail would be a lot more than $30 at a bakery whether you forgot to order your cake far enough in advance or maybe you were just looking for a more cost-effective way to get a beautiful cake without doing too too much work then this cake tutorial is for you and I hope you try it out thanks so much for watching guys don't forget to like share and subscribe so you can be part of this sweetie fam right now I'm uploading daily so make sure you hit that notification bell so you know when I upload also be sure to submit your baking fail and it could be fixed by next Friday [Music] you", "-FQQhKVKPM4": "hey guys welcome back to my channel but today's tutorial I'm gonna show you how I stack my five tier cakes so it's a second tier your cake you're gonna need scissors spatula your cake of course dowels and edible pen and buttercream so to begin I'm inserting my dowel marking the height then I'm gonna cut that down to the height of the cake and since this bottom tier is a twelve inch I'm doing 10 dowels so I'm gonna cut the rest down to the same exact height when you're adding dowels to your cake I like to add a few on the outer edge and then a few in the center and I feel like this gives it a lot more support versus just adding them to the outer edge and I inserted a little guide to show you the amount of dowels that I use on each tier [Music] so after you've inserted your dowels you're gonna add a thin layer of buttercream and you want to make sure that you're making this buttercream flat if you just kind of do a big glob in the middle then you're next here will sit uneven on top so I'm just spreading that out then and then I'm going to add on my second tier when you're adding on your second tier try to Center as best as you can if you're using American buttercream like I am once you refrigerate it it gets super firm to the touch so you have a little wiggle room to move it around if you need now for the rest of the tiers you're just gonna repeat the same process now once I get to my third cake I'm gonna add in a center down and the center Dale is just a sewer just two regular skewers you can find at the grocery store the skewer isn't as tall as all three tiers so I'm just gonna push it down to just about the center of the very first tier and that'll make sure that I get coverage between the three tiers now for the center day I've added another guide you can either add in three centerdale so you can just do one for this one I just use ones but if needed you can add three and that will give you even more support and then once you've added in your center Dale then you can just continue the whole dialing process [Music] I'm adding on the fourth tier adding downs to it and then this is all I'm gonna do now once they get to the venue then I'll add on my last year so after I've stacked those four tiers then I'm gonna go in and fill in any gaps that I have and for this I'm just using the same buttercream that I frost up the cake in and I'm taking a damp brush and lightly running the brush over okay guys so when you're going on deliveries you always want to take a little tool kit with you so I have some skewers on there you always want to have skewers just in case you never know when those will come in handy so I just take a few I always take a napkin some toothpicks whether using flowers are not I take those some spatulas scissors your buttercream I had more in here but this is what was left and some gloves just in case you can't find a sink to wash your hands there I also take a paintbrush the same one that I use to fill in all the gaps on the cake I just don't have it in here now once you're at the venue you're gonna just do the same steps a little buttercream and then stick your cake on top and then fill in the gaps and that's how you stack your five tier cakes I know these big cakes can seem a little intimidating but they really can be so simple just don't overthink it and don't try to over complicate things", "Ba47tnvK-A8": "hey everyone its Jill from today's creative food and I have a big batch of American buttercream because I'm going to be making a wedding cake today but I want to show you how easy I stack at these cakes I'm just doing a two tier wedding cake and then I'm gonna bring it to the event because they're using fresh flowers I don't have them here they're actually gonna be at the event so then you're gonna see at the end what the cake is gonna look like when it's all put together at the wedding venue by the way it's raining right now I am a hoping the rain stops for this beautiful couple that's about to get married this afternoon all right let me show you how easy it is so first I have the bottom tier right here I'm going to reinforce the bottom tier because this cake is going to be stacked on top of course I don't want a heavier cake to then sink so I use these boba straws but you can use dowels anything that you think is sturdy believe it or not these boba straws are really really sturdy so I'm not going to put it in the center because I'm actually going to put an actual stick all the way through so I don't want to put it there because I don't want it to hit that so I'm just going to show you how you're just gonna bring it down press it as far as you can take a marker and mark where it was bring it up then make a little cut take that back and pop it back in there now when the cake sets on top you also want to make sure that it's within the diameter because you don't want it out the side because that you don't need the reinforcements there alright now I'm going to show you how to ice this cake and then we're going to go ahead and stuck it so the way I like to ice my cakes is I like to put a lot of icing on the top of the cake first and then I'll use a lot of the reserve of that to go on the sides this allows me to get a nice flat edge that I'm looking for and nice and smooth if your buttercream seems a little tough you can actually get your spatula a little warm and kind of it softens the butter up a little bit okay now that I have the top then I can kind of take a lot of some of that icing off but I'm actually going to take a little bit of icing from the middle part because that's the part where the cakes gonna set on okay now I'm ready to start icing the sides you just want to keep your spatula vertical as much as you can so you have a nice even so now that I've got my kik mostly iced I'm going to now take a straight edge cupcake cone and I'm just gonna kind of glide it across ever so slightly I tell people it's kind of like ice skating if you want the edge to just be slightly on the on the side of the cake not too hard and if you have a turntable like this you can actually even just use a lazy susan which I'm using or by one of the cakes wheels that you can get at the cake store and you just kind of go keep going around till you get the nice smooth edge that you're looking for as you can see it was really nice that I crumb coated the cake ahead of time because this is a chocolate cake and I wanted to make sure that that crumb coating got all those crumbs sealed in so that I don't have any nasty crumbs to work with once you got it to where you you like it then you can start bringing the top across and of course with the top tier I would be doing it all the way across but since there's gonna be a cake stacked on top here I don't have to do that now the person that wants this cake they want just a real simple design using a spatula which I'll show you in just a second so all the design they want is just a very simple design using this spatula like this do you just start at the bottom and you just slightly press in and when you hit the first part then you slightly move up and you just basically go around and you just get that nice pretty edge to look and just keep going it's a really simple design but it's very elegant looking when it's all put together especially with flowers or other types ornaments that you're going to put on top okay so we're ready for the fun part we have to use a guide I use the actual pan that I use to bake my 8-inch cake I'm just gonna use it as a guide and make a little indent that way I know where to place my cake on top I also have a wooden dowel that I cut that I've measured that the to the both of the heights so that I can actually put it through so that when I transport it it doesn't move around so now I'm ready so I'm going to take my cake I talk to you okay and very carefully bring it up and I want to kind of look at at the guide that I have and make sure that I and you just have to trust it and let it fall all the other parts like if you have any little indents from your fingers you can clean up very easily using a spatula and then just wearing it around now I'm going to take my dowel and I'm going to carefully poke it through it should go through the cardboard very easily because I sharpened it a little bit and then I forgot but I'm gonna go get a little hammer that I have that actually brings that down and goes farther down so now that the cake is stacked and I put a little hammer I hammer down back down because I do have this as a cardboard plate so I was able to get that dowel actually into the cardboard but will make it dirtier for my ride and but if it's a plastic plate or a metal plate or glass plate you'll still be fine with securing it down to the bottom just making sure that it's attached to both of the tiers now I'm just gonna take I have a little 22 tip here with some my leftover buttercream I'm just gonna do a design to clean up the edges so that the this is just a little swirl as technique that I do to kind of make it look really and then you don't see the size of the cardboard and then I'm ready to transport I hope that was helpful I'll see you at the venue and I'm gonna show you what it looks like with all of the flowers propped up on top so this is the finished cake all stacked with fresh flowers turned out really beautiful and I made some cupcakes to go along with it I hope this helped you get an idea of how to do a stacked cake and transporting it to get it there and by the way the rain has stopped you", "xghfT44DKj4": "I ordered two wedding cakes am I getting married nope do I love cake yes so of course this video is the perfect excuse for me to eat all the cake I why actually double the cake I order one cake from a one-star bakery and the other cake from a five-star bakery what cake shall win place your bets tell me in the comments one star or five star the battle must begin hi guys I'm lost so for today's video I figured I needed any excuse to eat a whole lot of cake ideally two cakes now before I went over and I ordered one star cake versus my wife's Star King I had to pick what cake I want to base this off ooh decisions decisions this was a hard one so I would on Pinterest and I had all kinds of options like this cake that's not really a cake or maybe it's just a cake with a million tiny little points inside of it also this lower rainbow cake adding a pop of color to anybody or any party this magnificent cake seriously she's way more put together than I could ever even aspire to be oh this marble flower cake girl but you know what I really love about her even though she might look flawless on the outside she's showing you she got some texture on the inside this fluffy puffy masterpiece I'm not even sure what's happening there but I know I wanna take a bite and after careful consideration this was hours and hours of deliberations we finally don't scratch that I finally came to the conclusion that this will be the one the cake to roll them on my lawless kake that also embraces its imperfections I figure we should start with a one-star cake first you know keep our expectations low so I'm just gonna place the capable right here okay let me just tell you guys a little bit about my experience with my one star Baker you don't learn to not really trust reviews but here's a couple reviews Sadie has a lot of things to say I was surprised when I show her the pictures of the cake she said yes the next day I picked up and there was something else my daughters didn't like the cake oh no Sadie what ever shall you do well luckily I ordered them another one from a different place Sadie came prepared with her extra cake on her one star review another review says this place was unsanitary another person says she used paper figures on a 70 dollar cake and the vanilla cake tasted like pound cake no vanilla flavor I feel like pound cake kinda tastes like vanilla is that just me so I call to place my order and this place they only spoke Spanish which to me honestly is a plus I mean listen now if US immigrants don't support other immigrants who's gonna support us and they sent them the picture of the cake they said yes they weren't able to do it no problem and that it was gonna be fifty dollars fifteen or a whole wedding cake that looks like this I gotta tell you I have never set the bar so low in my entire life so keep in mind that this that you're about to see is a fifteen dollar cake are you ready Kyra's our one star kick [Music] and here's the cake I am pleased it looks so similar to the original cake I mean at least for $15 this is such a good deal there's cakes at CVS that are more than $15 do they sell cakes at CVS I love les you put this little paper bottom it makes it look really put together make it till you make it nobody got a no your $15 cake I'm not really sure what this cake is made out of though cuz I have to stick it in the fridge right away cuz I think it's just some cream mm that's yummy that's tasty and we got all the flowers the flowers are also made out of cream does she put these little Leafs in there but these things are just a prop and this little sprinkly sparkly thing in there I love that the leaves are everywhere they just stick on and off irremovable honey you can save them for later at this price point I look you feel like I should return the leaves to her be like ma'am you spent too much of my cake here you go here's the Porsche back and then what I feel is the most difficult part of this cake is the low-cut inside because it's supposed to be the crystal type thing and the original picture the insight is kind of pinkish this one's like yellow the entire cake the color is kind of off because it's more of a white cake oh that's fine something that's on point is the flower placement there's a big flower right here just like in the original picture and the cake set has four flowers this one also has four flowers I feel like she did a great job with the marble design I just gotta go talk to this bakery cuz yes sure there's the budget version but it doesn't really look like the budget version I feel like they did a lot with the little resources that they could use that's such a good thing to do this part I'm pretty sure it's gonna be made out of cream and I don't want to stick my finger in there I'm gonna set up I have to oh that's for sure cream they out here sculpting cream for $15 I'm telling you this cake is good best $15 I've ever spot I really want to taste this but first the five star changer [Music] next to each other I'm like but still you're $15 I love you so this cake the bakery husband really good reviews they're pretty much all five-star this person says this place is amazing I had a last minute cake order and they were able to accommodate my wishes they did a beautiful job on my sister's 50th and the other 5 star says I ordered a cake from them for my daughter's first birthday we did everything my mail and they were always quick to respond they made the cake exactly like the picture so I also do everything by email I even paid by email I don't know if I told you guys but for this cake I had to pay cash that was the only method of payment they took so I went there and I tipped on top of the tip because you can do that when I kick it's $15 now this cake this was ten hundred and sixty dollars ma'am this better be delicious this is gonna be some life-changing experience so just from looking at it the color is really good it's pink the flowers look beautiful and they're made with a different material they're not soft so if I leave it out they'll be fine it won't melt I feel like the flower placement is just a little bit off they took some creative liberties here they gave me two flowers instead of one because more is always better I do like that they have this darker color because it really makes it pop and also these little leaves can I eat that mmm that's real tasty mmm mmm look at me being so healthy this is smell it oh that fan tastes like almonds also I feel maybe that's not edible but it's taste you can we just poke you back up right back here the cake overall you see you can touch it and your fingers will not sink into the cake now for this part this is the hard part whoo this made of actual crystals this is beautiful I feel they did a great job with this middle design I love that they have the gold kind of going all around it it's just a little detail but you know details matter when you're paying 260 dollars for a cake of this size I just want to try along these crystals oh you can just rip them right out just like that there's your crystal mmm it's just for the ice to do this for sure has a lot more detail but to be honest I don't think that makes this cake better to see who's the real winner here we gotta taste them isn't that what this whole video is about that's a good place so I'll be cutting into my $260 that'll be worth the cake better be worth it both of these cakes are made of chocolate I love that this one's tall it kind of feels like it can serve more people but honestly not that many more let me just give myself a baby slice that flight was actually pretty big just because it's so tall I'm terrible at this how about to destroy my $260 it's just not coming apart okay oh we got a piece of cream coming through where's the chocolate though oh here we go that's beautiful so this cake is chocolate but they also put just layers of a different chocolate double chocolate yes ma'am let's see now I want to take a bite with both chocolates at the same time see how I taste I know you want to buy too technology just isn't there yet but soon mmm this but it's real good this feels really spongy it's really soft and moist but I feel like you need both chocolates to give it a really good balance this one almost feels like it's too dark of a chocolate mmm it's good let me try the other one by itself this one's more of a mousse type of chocolate mmm that's also good mm-hmm I see you cake I see you and then the little border they have some cream as you can see over the cream is where they put this material that's what makes it really smooth I just know I'm just destroying my one star cake so let me taste the top layer that's good just tasty and now for our one-star cake I've already kind of destroyed it by accident with my fingers we're just gonna cut right in feel so soft everything about this cake is soft Oh No if you just kind of touch it it falls apart I guess the leaf is coming down with me I'm scared to try and get this out this cake for sure gonna destroy this different this is sort of an it has a green thing inside oh hell no it's that green thing that ain't talked alit I'm not sure that's some sort of fruit I feel like that's supposed to be there I don't think that's an accident oh gosh look at this but here you can kind of see that there's more where that came from so I think they put it in there I will say the definition of chocolate at this bakery that's different from my definition of chocolate but let me just try this part where there's no green stuff or no I believed in you paint we all believed in you it's salty Wow don't even taste like cake why I can't really describe the flavor it almost tastes like a burrito or something like that it does not taste like cake oh I'm gonna go in again just give it another try it's also really moist but almost two looks like wet it smells like cake it smells really good and really sweet that's not good I honestly feel terrible because I was like this cake is for sure winning I mean this just beautiful it's so affordable then I guess that's true if you're not planning on eating it but I guess the lesson here is don't judge a book by its cover or out of it don't put salt in your cake or green stuff and talk like I wanted to pick a winning cake but to be honest I feel like there's no winners here there's only one loser and that's me for paying so much money on this cake and for eating this cake if we could somehow combine these two that's where it's at in the three star bakery that's where you gotta go", "r_X8jvFh6Dc": "my team and I have made three cakes for the presentation which is a kind of an installation and we're confident that that will be the right amount it's it's obviously as I said it's such an honor to be asked to do this because it's for me you know I've been baking since I was a little kid and this is my dream to do and to be asked to do kind of one of the most exciting cakes is really fulfilling and wonderful and as it may or may not boost my business that's obviously a bonus so but I can I don't really know what will happen so I'm just pretty happy to be involved my team is six bakers past and present I've had to bring in some old Lum knife from the bakery because we're still open and running as a bakery so in really good taken us six days to five days excuse me with six people it tastes delicious I hope I think we have a lemon sponge lemon curd filling and then an elderflower a Swiss meringue buttercream which is a buttercream that's very light and fluffy kind of satiny super delicious oh the textures really love lovely and the flavor is quintessentially spring and British I declare before you all it's my home life whether it be long or short shall be devoted to your service and to the service of our

you're probably thinking that seems a little bit basic but I'm gonna build a super chic cake with detail piping white on white with some white chocolate molds let's get started I'm going to start by breaking down to 10-inch square cakes with my vanilla cake better by the way if you want any of the recipes or the tools you see you can click the eye above me or it's in the description box below let's guys sticky let's do the same thing to this guy this is going to be a shorter tier so I'm just going to do two layers and then the top three tiers on top of it will all be round all right again what crumbs cleaned up here and then we'll fill it with some vanilla buttercream now I'm gonna get her in the Kolar and she'll be ready for a come Co now that our cake is chilled I'm gonna cut the sides down a little bit and actually the corner so we can get more of a softer look and I give her a crumb coat cutting the crust off your sandwich for you Brandon shrimpie scored you better watch that naughty do you see this shirt that does not say maybe I will cut you I'm just gonna soften it a bit cuz the top three tiers are round so we don't want it to be like a hard-edged box once we saw those we're gonna cover it with a ton of molds now we're gonna give her a crumb coat Oh dear me to clean this up right my house I'm sorry sorry oh it does kind of like mayonnaise doesn't it mm-hmm it's gonna be looking like a pillow here in a minute all right we're gonna give her a little bit of a chill put on a final coat whoa we're going to cover our square tear and white fondant I'm going to roll this to an eighth of an inch thickness a little corn charge so you use my arm here slide her in laughs I went a little far there we go bubbles out of the top edge I'm making some white flour molded decorations with some melted white chocolate for our bottom tier I put it in a squeeze bottle so I have a little bit more control over it squeezing in the molds and I'll knock it down a little bit so it spreads out I really love these molds because they have a ton of detail there's really no work on your part just squeeze in the bottle I got a shaker I got a shaker shake it girl all right I got all my molds filled I'm gonna pop them in the fridge for a few minutes so I'm set up and it will pop them out I'm just pulling the sides releasing the chocolate that's birdie I like her she's she's classy it's like her big sister or maybe the babysitter I make up stories about all my sugar decorations they're like real people to me baby cousin all this one broke I'm gonna have to report this one I can probably use this though but if I cut that piece off and then I can use that as a leave alone these are the really intricate ones they're gonna look really awesome come on girl it's show time ooh it's nice don't name them like real names oh they were just all like cousins that's like that's a cousin this is gonna be the mom I think she's huge that's not man I mean she's an adult she's awesome look at that that detail now the decorations are made it's time to put the cake together okay for the top three tiers we're gonna do some piping so when I first started piping or learning to pipe I would make a ghost paint so basically it's just a little bit of black gel food colour mixed with some water make like a really really light gray color like a ghost ghost ghost gray they can be gray like in the movie sometimes right yeah yeah grayish I could handwrite better than i heiped then I could come and sort of plan out what it was I was going to pipe and make these little ghost worlds so it's face them out evenly around my cake and then I would pipe on top of that after you do it for a while though you can just freehand it so that's what we're gonna do so I've got a small star tip here and some royal icing in white because this is white on white cake I'm gonna make really funny faces when I do this I can't control it just want you guys to know anyone makes fun of me don't forget it's right there like a badess and this shirt a little bit so the key to piping successfully is to ground yourself so I like to keep my elbows actually I'm gonna get myself a little bit lower down excuse me only go damn it get yourself level get yourself grounded and use both hands so I'm gonna guide with this hand squeeze with this hand in the middle here I'm going to taper it off I'm gonna go back in and white in it so it's a little bit more dramatic it's hard to talk and pipe with the same time and now through the magic of television I'm gonna do this really quickly all right now we're going to stack our tears using bubble tea straws twist that guy in so they say straight and then what song would you guys like to hear good all right we're gonna stick this top here using a little bit of royal icing now I'm attaching my chocolate flowers with royal icing so I'm anchoring my big flowers first and then I want to go back and fill in with the smaller ones I'm mixing white flowers with Ulf white flowers to add some dimension I'm accessing the cake with some gum paste flowers I made plunger cutters I'm finishing the flower tier with some royal icing leaves for the last step on a pipe of border around each tier alright our white monochrome cake is all done I think she turned out pretty good thank you guys for joining us on our new manna Belle cake channel don't forget if you want the tools or recipes click the I in the corner or you can get them from the description box below subscribe to the new channel like the video and please leave me comments and let me

outsider tart in London and american-style bakery and today we're going to show you some tips and tricks on frosting and finishing cakes I'm going to show you how to make wedding cake frosting we put in our bowl already one and a half cups of granulated sugar we are adding six egg whites into this we already have two in here and what I like to do myself is when I'm making other stuff in the kitchen you always end up with excess yolks or excess egg whites when you're separating stuff for various cakes I tend to use a welcome give Ziploc a nice plug a ziplock baggie a freezer safe bag put in your egg whites and you can freeze them until you need them just bring them if you know you're going to be making something bring them to room temperature and then keep track of how many hit quites you actually have in a bag and you can use them and they're good for up to about six months from the freezer so bring it to room temperature you add that into your bowl so we have six egg whites a cup and a half of sugar and a pinch of salt the salt helps break down the albumin in the egg and make it a little less Peggy for lack of a better word so just a little bit of that in there all the sugar mix those two things together we are going to heat those on our stovetop so now we're going to put our mixed sugar egg white and salt over a pot of boiling water and just keep mixing it keep the egg moving in the bowl while the heat is absorbing through the bottom of your pan and it'll take approximately seven minutes or until such time as you actually feel the heat coming out of the egg whites it's gonna as you see now it's very gloppy it'll become very thin and you'll feel the texture change under your whisk okay we've now brought that up to the temperature that we want on our water so we're going to put it on our mixer and you want to whisk it to the high speed until it calls all right well we've been beating here you can tell that the beaters themselves have started slowing down and struggling if you look in your bowl it's a nice thick consistency we're going to take that off and test it the best way to do this is to take off your whisk and look at the end of what you created and it's a thick shaving foam like consistency but that is a finish Boston stem to stern it took us about seven minutes and that's how you make wedding cake frosting", "To2i3z8kuHc": "[Music] so [Music] you", "7jTWNXHviA0": "[Music] hi thank you for making pasta bake cream today I'm going to show you how to beat a tiered cake with a full separator so to start off with these are all the equipment I'm going to need to make it so I've got my cake drums here and they are the same size as my cakes that are going to be sitting on them so I put a 12 inch a 10 inch and 8 inch and a 6 inch round and each one has been drilled with a hole in the middle of it so it can fit over this then I've got my wall separator so I put it here this is a 10 inch and again I drilled a hole all the way through it this one is just sitting on this post siren hey I've started to ruffle it and the back here but I'll go into detail about that later and then the most important bit for this cake is the structure you're going to need this you will have to get specially made or if you're very good with metal work you can make it yourself so I've got these 16 inch base then the cake is going to be sitting on this and made out of twelve millimeter wood and I put another one on the bottom as well surface it doubled up then I got this structure made by a metal worker and it's the pole here which is going to be the height of two tiers and the wool separator and then the top two are going to sit here on this plate so there's going to be no weight of the cake the top two cakes on the tiers below although be resting on this plate and to slot the cakes on this topic can be unscrewed like so so this is how you will stop me bottom two tears and thus 50-odd then you will screw this back on and put the top two tiers on this now because this is metal it's not food safe so you need to make sure that before any of the kid comes into contact with this that you wrap this whole structure in cling film or you can use aluminium foil as well just to make sure it's too thick so let's get started also a quick note that I forgot to thank for your separated here and either needs to be made out of polystyrene or if you're making it out of cake the bottom half of it needs to I'll post Irene just to make sure that it's really secure and it's staple otherwise you could risk it falling apart so for their separation make sure this post I read or the bottom half is fast ironing and the top half is kink now to start the cake I've got three top half of the metal structure unscrewed and I've covered all in cling film and I'm just lifting up the bottom tier and trying to see where the hole is drilled into the board and I'm carefully just gonna slop that down onto the pole now it's good if you have another person with you just watching to make sure that you're holding the cake straight and level while you lower it down [Music] to know where I'm placing my dial that just made a guide out of some baking paper which is the same size as the tear that's going on top and I've just cut a little hole in the middle so it fits over the pole so I've put that on top and I'm now marking with my scribe tool just outlining the circle just so I can see where I'm gonna put my dolls inside of now I've got these big thick poly dowels because this is a very heavy cake and these are nice and strong but we're gonna put my first one in and I'm gonna mark with an edible food marker just below where it lines up with the top of the cake slightly twist that to take it out and then I'm going to use my pipe cutters to cut where I've marked it with the first owl I'm not going to use that to mark all my other ones so line it up with another piece of darling I have market and then cut that again so you want to cut as many as you need for the support for this key I think I put six in and then just push them into the cake evenly around making sure you stay within that line that circle you drew oh yeah what I didn't show is putting some royal icing on top of the dowels to make sure that the top tier is stuck down and then you just thread the top tier on the same way as we did the bottom tier now I'm marking the dowels for the sphere the bull separator as it's heavy cuz it's got a lot of icing ruffles on it so I'm just using thin wooden dowels for these and again I'm measuring them exactly the same way I did with the previous styles I'm gonna cut them to size and then put them in very close to the center part as the surface area that's of the ball that's going to be touching the cake is very small [Music] now for the bull separator and just carefully lifting it off where I haven't put the ruffles and this was quite hard to fit it over the pole you know just because the hole wasn't too big so I had to use some force to push it down on it but again it's exactly the same principle as the other two tears that we did earlier you're just lining up the hole with the pole and then pushing it down and then I'm sticking it down as well with some royal icing here so now at the venue I'm gonna stack the top two tiers so there is some real ice thing just on the plate I screwed on the top half and I'm just carefully using my spatula to lift up the tier and I'm putting my hands underneath it again trying to find the hole and gradually lowering it down onto the pole and then so it sets on the plate and then the bit of icing that has been pushed up I'm just gonna cut that off with my spatula and that will be discarded for the top tier putting some more royal icing on the bottom the top of the tier below it making sure that tier is dulled as well [Music] sliding my spatula underneath to keep making sure I'm not taking any of the non-slip mat with me that's underneath it carefully putting my hands underneath it and very carefully lifting it as is top-heavy with all of the flowers again finding the hole in the board and slowly lowering it down and then anywhere where the icing has been picked up by my fingers I can just go back and use a smoother just move that all down the sugar flowers on the cake are on wires and therefore the wires are not allowed to touch the inside of the cake this is the same for fresh flowers the stems are not allowed to touch the inside of the cake or the cake itself and so I'm just putting them in little plastic holders they're called Posey pics or flower pics and this is just to protect the inside of the cake from the wire or the stem and I'm just putting each flower stem and one of those holders and pushing it into the cake and just using my scissors as well if my fingers can't reach just to push it in so once you've arranged all your flowers are you happy with it that is the final cake I hope you enjoyed this

[joshua] so i'm gonna start with my largest tier in dark chocolate. [joshua] i decided to go oval on this because it's elegant. [joshua] it's a little bit more elegant, right? than a round? [joshua] by the way, if you guys want any of the recipes, click the i at the top or you can get them in the description box below. [joshua] i'm just gonna chop these guys up. [joshua] the shark is dying for cake by the way. [joshua] i didn't realise sharks like cake. [joshua] apparently they do. maybe that's why they beach themselves. [joshua] cos they heard there was cake by the ocean. [crew] that's a good point, yea. you're gonna hear about a lot of beached sharks/ beached whales. [joshua] i saw it on youtube! [joshua] it was on the internet, so it was true. [joshua] now we're gonna fill the cake with chocolate ganache and chocolate buttercream [joshua] so we get that triple chocolate feel. [joshua] YUM! [joshua] that looks freaking delicious. [joshua] put our next layer on. [joshua] this cake is gonna be so rich. she buys anything she wants. [joshua] she wears designer clothes, she goes on holiday/ [joshua] alright, i'm gonna pop this baby in the fridge, let her cool for a minute [joshua] and then we'll cut her, crumb coat her, final coat her. [joshua] crumb coat's done. i'm gonna get her in the cooler, and we'll do the final coat. [joshua] whoopsie. [joshua] alright, now we're gonna get her in the cooler, let her chill completely, then we'll be ready for the ganache! [joshua] she's so delicious! [joshua] while my cakes are chilling in the fridge, i'm gonna start on the modeling chocolate roses. [joshua] so i made a batch of my modeling chocolate- by the way when you guys make this, it's really really hard, [joshua] so we kinda have to process it so it gets softer. [joshua] but don't be alarmed. [joshua] it's gonna be really hard cos it's set. [joshua] so i'm just going to cut a couple pieces off, [joshua] and then we'll knead them. [joshua] so i'm just using the heat of my hands to process this and make it a mouldable clay. [joshua] you can actually pop this in the microwave just for a few seconds. [joshua] if you hands aren't very warm. [joshua] mine are like two little ovens. [joshua] alright, to make this we're actually just gonna do everything by hand. [joshua] and we're gonna use just a regular old ziploc bag. [joshua] so i'm gonna roll this into a log. we roll a lot of things into logs. [joshua] it all starts with a log. [joshua] and then i'm just gonna cut equal sized little pieces. [joshua] so to make this rose, we need 9 petals. so we do one for the bud, then we do a row of 3 then a row of 5. [joshua] it's 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. it's as high as i can count by the way. [joshua] i don't know what comes after 9. \n[crew] i've seen you do better. [joshua] eleventeen? i don't know. [joshua] so i'm going to actually break this guy down, then i can make like a flap. [joshua] i took the thing off, now i can't zip it! [joshua] i'm just gonna rip it open like a caveman! [joshua] that was much easier. [joshua] alright so we're gonna put our little petals in here, [joshua] then we'll fold it up, then we'll mash each one down. [joshua] so i'm just taking and thinning one side of the petal here [joshua] we're gonna thin them all out, [joshua] you know, i had to do this when i was in culinary school, [joshua] and i was in college so i didn't have a whole lot of money. [joshua] i would do it with tootsie rolls to practise. [joshua] works perfectly. [joshua] and they're a good snack. [joshua] that and microwave macaroni and cheese is what i lived off of my entire college years. [joshua] now we have our petals made, we're gonna build them around a little cone. [joshua] so i'm just using my fingers to make what's kind of like a little christmas bulb. [joshua] like a tiny fat little carrot. [joshua] or like a turnip. [joshua] so we're gonna use our first petal here, to wrap around. [joshua] this is going to create our bulb. so wrap this around, [joshua] so there's our bud, so the first round we'll do is 3 and then we'll come back and do 5. [joshua] and i'm just pinching the top to make sure it's as thin as i want  it to be. [joshua] it's like the cheapest decoration you can make. [joshua] there's no tools! [joshua] use the tools that god gave you. [joshua] we're gonna wrap these around and tuck them into each other. [joshua] so i'm gonna leave this kind of open, and i'll take my next one, and he'll tuck into there. [joshua] wrap that around, and tuck my last petal into this guy. [joshua] so then we'll just close it up. [joshua] she's looking beautiful! [joshua] we could leave it like that if you wanted a smaller rose. [joshua] but now i'm gonna put the last row on the 5, [joshua] and then you can get even bigger, you could do 7 after that but you wanna stay in the odd number round [joshua] so if you do even numbers, it tends to get more square. [joshua] no square roses on my set. i only want round beautiful elegant roses. [joshua] alright, so we'll do the same thing on the outside here. [joshua] just tuck them into each other. [joshua] one last one, and i'm just gonna hold the bottom here, [joshua] and kind of make it look a little more rose-y so some of the petals can point a little bit, [joshua] if they can open up. [joshua] now we're gonna cut her off, kind of like we're cutting the top off a cake. [joshua] you gotta be delicate, cos she's elegant. [joshua] don't cut your finger either. [joshua] there she is. [joshua] ta da! [joshua] chocolate rose. [joshua] now i'm gonna make a zillion of these cos we're gonna pack them all around the cake. [joshua] okay, now we're ready to ganache, so our cake is super cold. [joshua] and then our ganache is warm as you can see. [joshua] drippy and then i also have some melted white chocolate ganache and some melted milk chocolate ganache. [joshua] ready for the elegant-ness? [crew] it's gonna be so elegant.\n[joshua] it's gonna be the most elegant thing you've ever seen. [joshua] pouring ganache, [joshua] gonna make it all the way over. [joshua] some of this and some of this. [joshua] that's kind of fun. [joshua] it could have been a little more marbled but i kinda like it. [joshua] we're gonna leave it. it's supposed to be suddle. [joshua] not like the marble cake, we're not like super-marbling. [joshua] alright, now i'm gonna get her back in the cooler and do the same thing to the other two. [joshua] good lord, she's heavy. [joshua] alright now we're gonna coat the milk chocolate tier. [joshua] so i got a little milk chocolate, and i got some dark and white in my bottles. [joshua] Jackson Pollock had so much fun! [joshua] so elegant. such a wealthy cake! she's so rich! [joshua] richest cake in town! she's got a pool, [joshua] now we're gonna do the same thing to the last tier then we'll stack em. [joshua] she's so heavy i can already tell. [joshua] alright, we're gonna ganache the last one in white chocolate ganache. [joshua] and them i'm gonna marble it with a little bit of dark and a little bit of milk. [joshua] boom! [joshua] now our cakes are all set, to stack these, i'm gonna do it with bubble tea straws. [joshua] let me see if it tastes good. [joshua] this milkshake is so thick! [joshua] there's no easy way to do this. [joshua] good lord she is- that's a dense cake right there! [joshua] i think this is the one i gotta taste [joshua] good lord! [joshua] well, i'm not going to the gym today. [joshua] could you imagine if that's my workout? [joshua] i would be so skinny and elegant! [crew] you should make workout videos.\n[joshua] pushing bubble tea straws into cakes? [joshua] come on guys, feel the burn! [joshua] just throw it on there! the good thing about it is the chocolate is set so you can kinda handle it a little bit. [joshua] does it look neat? [joshua] let me see, can i see> [joshua] alright, now we're gonna glue on our chocolate flowers with  a little bit of chocolate buttercream. [joshua] so i'm putting all of the dark roses on the bottom tier. [joshua] then i'll put milk in the middle, and the white on top. [joshua] for the middle tier, i filled marble cake with milk chocolate ganache and then coated it in chocolate buttercream. [joshua] for the top tier, i took white cake and filled it with white chocolate ganache and coated it in vanilla buttercream. [joshua] so she's an Elegant Triple Chocolate Explosion, and i love her!

[joshua] i feel so elegant!", "YPTOqUWiZY4": "hello friends welcome to ellen cooks and bigs today we are going to see the making of a three-tier wedding cake from ellen cooks and bakes it's a peach colored cake with rose theme the top layer is a chocolate truffle let's see how we make it taking half cup of butter whipping it till it is light and fluffy to this i'm adding half cup of oil and one and half cup of powdered sugar [Music] mixing all of them together till all the sugar is dissolved this i'm adding three eggs it is all uniformly mixed now i'm adding one tablespoon of vanilla essence and mix it up thoroughly now to this i'm adding one and half cup of all purpose flour or maida 1 4 cup of cocoa powder half teaspoon of baking soda one and a half teaspoon of baking powder and sieving all the dry into the wet sieving gives us a lighter and fluffier cake so this is really important now let's mix it up i'm using the cut and fold method as i mix i'm gradually adding half cup of milk cut and fold to get a thick uniform mixture once the mixture is almost ready i'm adding two tablespoons of curd or yogurt to this [Music] keep mixing till we get a real creamy soft cake batter just like this and a cake batter is ready now i've taken two six inch pans and i'm greasing them because it's a chocolate cake i'm dusting it with cocoa powder all purpose flour leaves out white patches so cocoa powder gives us a uniform brown cake [Music] transferring the cake batter equally into both the tins tap gently to remove all the air bubbles out of the batter [Music] i am baking them at 160 degrees celsius roughly for 40 minutes in a preheated oven let's make the cream now taken 2 cups of whipped cream keep whipping till soft peak appears to this i'm adding half a cup of caster sugar my peach color few drops and one tablespoon of vanilla essence keep whipping till stiff peaks appear just like this and the sure sign that your cream is ready is to topple your container and the cream must not drip down so our cream is ready now let's level the cake the cakes have come out well i'm slicing the cake into two halves and i'm adding sugar syrup to keep the cake moist [Music] this is a chocolate truffle cake so i'm adding an extra layer of chocolate ganache and here we go with our cream see the stiffness of the cream this is how it should be [Music] level the cream gently around the top layer [Music] placing the second layer of our chocolate cake [Music] and i repeat the same process sugar syrup be generous with the sugar syrup because this makes the cake soft and fluffy [Music] chocolate ganache [Music] and a whipped cream placing the third layer and repeating the same process all over again [Music] now it's time to apply the cream on the sides apply cream generously and we can level it later i'm removing all the excess horns from top this gives us a sharp clean edge [Music] and with this our chocolate cake is ready i'm ref i'm going to refrigerate this for around two hours to make it stiff so that it'll be easier now let's decorate the dummy models for the bottom two layers i'm applying cream generously over this dummy model [Music] after covering all the surface of the dummy model i'm leveling it up now let's apply extra cream on the top of this model [Music] covering a dummy model is much more easier and within few minutes you see that the dummy model is completely covered by cream repeating the same process of removing the horns here too this gives us real sharp edges and gives a good classy look to our cake let's clean the cake board of any excess cream i covered the second layer also with the cream i've applied some sticking tapes on top of it so that when i place the top layer it doesn't slip down placing the top layer and here we go i put it straight on top of the bottom i'm covering up all the other exposed areas with a cream now this is really important to remove all the excess cream and smoothen the edges [Music] a tip to get sharp edge is to dip your spatula in warm water when it is slightly warm you can slide it over the cake and remove all the extra cream that is attached now our models are ready they are clean and neat i've put in some artificial roses i've made a bunch of them tying to a piece of string and have inserted it now it's time to place our real cake on top of this model and here i go now to secure a cape say cake safely i'm putting in dowels here dowels are nothing but wooden sticks i'm putting three doubles here to secure my cake tightly with the model below this is really important or else the cake may slide off during transportation [Music] and here goes the third double inside the cake three doubles are enough for a cake of this size so this is a 10 inch 8 inch and 6 inch cake now this is the final step i am decorating the cake with sugar crystals i'm using two sizes of sugar crystals white beads the bigger ones and the smaller ones now this adds a class to the cake and i'm finishing off this wedding cake by roughly sprinkling these sugar crystals all over the cake and look at it now isn't it beautiful the bride liked this cake very much and i hope you also liked it too follow ellen

"gx_qcrBaRUo": "you know what's funny about this I don't know what I'm gonna really make so I'm gonna make an Easter themed pinata cake because that was the theory I know what I wanted to fill it with this is a really special edition and I hope you guys like it I hope buddy I hope I do good [Music] so I'm back and I baked me a rainbow cake here and basically what I did is I just filled it what it didn't layer buttercream I took a circle cutter and I cut out little cake slices and then I just kind of filled it up and now I got this nice hole here let me show you and I didn't do it on the bottom slice because you want to be able to have you know kind of like a bottom slice of top slice and then all that Candy's gonna go in the middle so I got some little Easter Egg candy guys here and then put these guys in here and butter bowl already maybe a couple too many yeah so what I'm gonna do now is just finish ice in my cake here so I'm gonna put a little bit of buttercream on top just to kind of smooth it out it's springtime so I want to do something that's kind of a EE and floral and one of my favorite favorite techniques to do is pipe buttercream flowers it doesn't always got to be a rose it could be succulents it could be little daisies it could be these little like fantasy flower things that I have a lot of people or using these new things these Russian tips right so these Russian tips are pretty cool I got a bunch of them here I never really used one yet so we're gonna experiment here basically what they are is they have these like little cutouts on top and I'm assuming that with the right pressure I'm gonna be able to make it look like flowers so so we're gonna play around with a couple of these and see how they work there's always the good old-fashioned way which is the way that I've always done it and might be the best way still what I love about today is you you see the cake boss being Cake Boss for real this is kind of the creative process this is my canvas I'm gonna kind of play around with the colors and tones that I want to use and then I'm gonna make it happen so now I'm making my base color which I like green because I think that it kind of reminds me of a of like the springtime it's gonna add a lot of pop which is gonna make my other colors really set off against it have some great contrast on it this is gonna hurt me more than it's gonna hurt you that's what the doc used to say I was a kid all right can you use a spatula yeah but there's just something about getting your hand dirty and getting in there and really mixing the color and honestly it just takes a lot a lot shorter time to mix it by hand but if you don't use the gloves then your hands will be purple probably two to three showers to really get it off so this one I went on the bluer side right so I added a little more blue to the purple to make it more like a I want to say it's cool this like for my eyes and everybody's got their own opinion this is almost like a dark periwinkle all right so it's like a bluish purple look at how this is gonna pop off of that you already start to see so it's about finding the white color mix and the right use to really make things pop off one another and the true-true great great cake decorators they're masters of color you know one of my favorites is Ron ben-israel he's a friend of mine but when you see his cakes you're captivated by the colors I mean the flowers are beautiful the cakes are beautiful but this is something that draws you in with the colors first and you know it's something that comes with time it's something that you weren't alright so I got another color to mix okay we got that we got that that looks good see these like cousins they're all the same family but they different so you got your periwinkle your lilac and your violin all work beautifully together against that green right off the bat you see doles call us together are gonna work gonna start with the green I want to ice my my beautiful cake up in this beautiful green the first thing I'm gonna do well Chad is making me yeah so I'm gonna put I'm gonna put the dots two drops in Chad's just gonna mix okay okay so you know that all right oh yeah ready oh we're gonna do it right is we need like a really punchi punchi punchi all three and we're it's hardcore we're looking to make like Barney okay my cake is dirty-iced so now I'm gonna put the layer of green again you see I'm using a turntable and I'm just kind of going around and around and I'm just gonna kind of get enough of this green okay a little bit more from the top bada-boom butter bowl and I'm gonna take my knife I'm just gonna gently go around the cake this cake was refrigerated and for people who don't decorate that much at home that's a good way to ice a cake is by icing it a little bit putting the refrigerator taking it out back and forth because it gives you more control of what you're doing when it does come out of the refrigerator it makes it easier it's almost like layers or they call that one I call her dirty ice they call a perm coating some people actually crumb coat their butter cream layers like this and they'll put it in they'll pull it out they'll get a hot knife and they'll start to kind of like work back and forth with it to make it better you've seen me do this a million times on Cake Boss I just feel that edge on my finger so it's perfectly smooth now I'm just going to kind of use this to smooth out my cake so I get almost like a fawn don't like finish out of buttercream okay see how smooth that side is pull the top in get it like it's fond on esque the advantage of buttercream over fondant on something like this you can get a very sharp look with the buttercream so I can make it look like it's you know plate really a sharp edge with the fondant there's always gonna be a little bit of that roll off that you're gonna get the problem is but this is not forgiving so this you have to be perfect at the fondant definitely more forgiving if I put my finger in it it's going through the ice and if I put my finger on the fondant it's gonna be okay okay you look at that cake but I want to make this edge sharper I was refrigerated it again and I would go back and I could make this like guaranteed to be exact but for what I'm doing today it's not gonna really matter because I'm gonna cover a lot of it up look you already see that it's green it almost feels like a beautiful springtime Easter pillow that my flowers want to go to sleep on I'm going to show you how I make flowers the old-fashioned way okay first thing I do is for I like using the yellow or the the lime green or the sage green for a center because I feel like every flower needs to have a center they take a rose nail take a little bit of schmutz I take a piece of parchment paper which I already cut second we're gonna make her a little stalk okay now what I'm doing is I'm going right up to the top with the petal but I'm just going straight up okay so the first layer is they go up right to the top I spin it I do one right next to it right to the top right to the top right to the top as I do it I know how much to squeeze in my hand okay so we have that first row right you got that first beautiful crown now I'm gonna start in between the two petals I'm gonna go up and then I'm gonna pull out I'm gonna go up I'm gonna pull out up and out up and out so you see it starting to give it that shape okay up and out just when I'm getting to the three-quarter length I pull out and then by me just snap in my hand the end it pulls it and I pull in the buttercream the way that I want it now I go back in between but I'm going halfway up going halfway up and then we're going out going halfway up and I'm going out halfway and town now I'm gonna go back in between another one just to fill it it okay so let's put more schmutz on my paper okay so now what I'm going to do is make the flower where I'm bringing petals around we're going up and around [Music] okay then we're gonna go like this boom boom boom you know what buttercream flowers for a while roaring on Trent like people weren't doing they weren't popular I was scared if that it was gonna be out of a job cuz I'm one of the last dinosaurs that actually they had to do it but like everything else things do come around this is a dying art this is a skill set that you know I feel is just so important it's so beautiful whether you're using it with fondant without fondant I think that you know people want to see it this is something where you hone your craft okay it's not a mold it's not a quick fix you have to practice to get good at this you have to be doing this for years you have to know what you're doing you have to care about it you have to want it like when I wanted to learn how to make rows I was a kid and I stood in front of that buttercream bucket with the rose now I made it it didn't come out right boom I put it back in the bucket back in the bucket until I was able to master it okay like that so look at this this is a cool one we can go where I change your tip just the angle of the same tip and I'm just going up and down in it [Music] same exact tip just a little different hole little different direction and you have a different flower okay just to show you the differences just by angling the bangle a little bit and that's what you got to do you got to be able to play it's gonna make you a better cake decorator inevitably all right listen it's very simple practice we're gonna use these Russian tips in here which I think are brilliant I think are trendy but there's no Russian tip that's gonna make this flower I don't care how good it is so you it's about you getting better at what you do everything with piping is about angle in your hand so looks like almost like natural there's no pattern there's no rhyme or reason so I'm just gonna kind of you know this have some fun with it what I'm going to do is get the first batch of flowers hopefully they're frozen so you put them to put them in the freezer I'm going to look for a front of the cake and I'm gonna angle my flowers kind of around the cake remember you got to be quick here because if you're not quick here these flowers are gonna melt in your heads so again I'm taking the same flower or the same color profile and putting them kind of around and sporadically in different locations and use that as like a little left now I want to take the other high flowers or taller flowers this one is a little stickier okay the flatter ones are going to kind of lay on the sides here [Applause] [Music] [Applause] this is where this tip comes in handy because so I'm going to kind of pipe on the sides on us this coming ice [Music] you guys like these Russian tips let me know in the comments once I add the foliage here this cake is really gonna it's really gonna pop again so I'm just going back to and this is a good trick you could open your your petals on your Russian tips by just going with the tip of the rose now it's kind of making sure that they all conform and doing what you want them to do it's pretty happy with what I see here foliage is gonna do it here and we could also you know what else is gonna help this cake come to life its improvised it's going these Russian tips and the reason why I can't add a little yellow to these to make them come to life the way I want oh I got eight balls all over the place [Music] all right so now we got any more razzle dazzle pop now watch how this colors gonna tie it all together now we're just going to go with some leaps right [Music] I got these uh little candidates that gonna kind of sporadically put on the bottom here alright check come on down we're doing a bad guess that's why they call you the Cake Boss huh no babe I improvise in this paper I really didn't know what I wanted to do but I wanted to have some fun with it I'm digging I'm digging it I didn't like the combo of the Russian tips with the wit my flowers and the cool part is is you filled this cake right did this is a pinata in here baby ping you out of time who doesn't like a good pinata [Music] [Music] [Music] so that's my easter cake leave me some comments in the comment section so I know what you guys think about it but um yeah this was just really just created this was just kind of like free-flowing I hope you like that version of me like share and subscribe thank you guys so much for watching we'll see you next time", "oG-YtooFzto": "what's up guys and welcome back to my channel so today we are going to be trying wedding cake hey i'm excited and we are actually on our way there right now we're going to be trying a whole bunch of different flavors different frosting flavors and different filling flavors for the wedding cake i've been pinning some wedding cakes that i like on pinterest so i will pin them on the screen right now to show you the ones that i like [Music] i want like a really tall cake they're really basic in like their colors but i think they're really pretty all right we just got here platinum house of sweets here we go oh my gosh it smells amazing in here it does smell really good alrighty guys this is gina and she set up all the cakes for us and the frostings to try all right so the cakes we're tasting today are red velvet cookies and cream chocolate chip vanilla raspberry slaw and then our fillings we have um cannoli we have cream cheese raspberry peanut butter oreo chocolate vanilla so what you usually do is you can just grab like a piece and you can cut it in half and start trying different variations in the fillings in the middle okay see what you know how you like that because with the the raspberry sprout you can try a couple different things you can do raspberry you can drink cream cheese or just buttercream so we can mix and match yeah any of the cakes so if you want red velvet with chocolate icing we can do that it really is very really coming out right that's good i could take like 10 bites i'm gonna eat this whole plate right now but i really like the raspberry filling yeah yeah that's always the winner i go for a second and god's like no you're not because you just said you weren't you know so this is cream cheese filling on raspberry cake yeah i like creme cheese you like this better than the resume no i like that really i like this better so with your wedding cake if it's several tiers each tier could be a different flavor really oh i didn't think about that yeah that'd be so cool we could have like one tier red velvet one tier chocolate chip we could have that'd be cool yeah how many like tears can you do on a cake um we can go up with one of the six yeah have you ever done ten no that would be insane that would be the first yeah vanilla cake with vanilla frosting these cakes are so moist we usually have cake tasting for five rooms and they eat the whole plate it's like their dinner and then they they're gone honestly that's what i want to do right now i want to eat all of it but like the whole thing okay that is good [Music] i'm already starting to get a sugar rush drink some water because we've been eating super clean yeah so it's up so anything is soaked right now yeah and i have to detox and cleanse again chocolate chip with cannoli filling hmm wait this is oreo i think you grab the cookies and cream that one's a chocolate chip they look very similar i was confused so this is actually oreo with the cookies and cream with the cannoli do you like it yeah this is good i guess we can try very vice versa yeah so far my favorite is the raspberry yeah i know you like red velvet a lot oh yeah do you want to try that one yeah i'm not a big fan of it typically but let's see so this is red velvet cake with cream cheese frosting that's always so good i love it it's red velvet just chocolate like what is it it's like yeah it's a it's a form of chocolate yeah and then we add um the dye in there yeah so it's just dye it's not like anything special yeah really because i don't like chocolate cake but i like red butter i think it's all on our head so this is cookies and cream cake and cookies and cream frosting that's so good is that one really popular it is oh my gosh that's so good i'm excited for the peanut butter yeah oh what is going on here i can't even get it i love how you eat it with your fingers i know she's doing it the proper way i'm doing it the man way yeah you can't go wrong with peanut butter that's good could we have like a layer of peanut just peanut butter yes oh that's so good i have a stomachache do you not yet now what were your um what are you thinking for your favorite flavors what do you think do you like the raspberry swirl i like the raspberry yeah the raspberry cake and the they're my favorite i think the cookies and cream with the cookies and cream frosting or something else do you want to do different layers as like individual cakes yeah cookies and cream with the cookies and cream frosting do you like the cannoli chocolate chip but the cannoli yeah i do and i really like that peanut butter can we have another one of peanut butter yeah yeah well nobody just goes and eats like one big giant slice right where they get each layer or they kind of pick out their own layer like how does it work so what the you know what i mean so what they'll do is they'll take each layer in the back and they'll cut it up and then they'll they'll play it out on the table oh okay i got you and then so it's not like somebody's just going up and slicing the whole cake down and picking up their layers they're not gonna cut their own cake yeah so you said um the raspberry the cookies and cream the vanilla did you think you think about um oh and the

flavor of the day of china [Music] so you also need to go through a bunch of cupcakes how many do you go through a day um we make anywhere from six to eight do you usually sell out oh no we never seen them we make them if we do i picked the pink lemonade and the wedding because i figure a lot of people ask about wedding cakes and birthday cakes in our group so i figured i would taste the wedding and see how that tastes and what did you pick mikey i got the chocolate chip and red velvet the velvet's always my favorite their cupcakes are four dollars a piece find the coupon books we do a lot with the coupon books if you find the coupon books then you're going to find a coupon in there that when you buy three you get one free so we actually got one of those free so for four cupcakes it was 13.35 that's with tax and everything it was in several of the different books they do wedding cakes they do birthday cakes and we're gonna post the prices of that what about the birthday cakes and is that birthdays and weddings yeah they do both they've got a just a regular old circle one they've got a square one and a heart checked one so that's the size that's like the shapes of their cakes yeah they're they're limited i mean they're not like a full-blown bakery where they can do everything and anything in the bakery they don't do they don't do anything with fondant they just do a buttercream yeah buttercream or cream cheese says frosting flavors buttercream cream cheese chocolate buttercream and strawberry buttercream a three-tier one for the round one is six ten and fourteen that's four hundred dollars that'll be 68 to 90. um that would be like a wedding cake yeah and all shapes have got the same price for the size like the six to ten inch is 240 dollars that's 28 to 40 people um eight to 12 inch is 40 to 50 people and that's 310 dollars and it's 76 to 10 inch 16 and 14 inches [Music] she said they needed a 48-hour notice yep two-day notice um when you order them just give you a heads up and we'll post we'll post their uh post their email and their uh their phone number and any other links that they've got out there you know the information out there down in the description for you to check into it and she said they they make about they make them fresh daily the cupcakes they make those fresh daily okay guys i really don't like in-car videos but it was so loud out there that's just what we have to do right now don't look at the back of our car we've been traveling but um she said they make about 600 cupcakes per day she said six to eight hundred cupcakes six to eight hundred cupcakes so that and they were very steady as we were in there i mean she was selling cupcakes wasn't she left and right selling cupcakes these people come in here i don't know if they're gonna spoil their dinner if they're getting dessert [Music] i love cupcakes so if i tell you this is a good cupcake then i probably know what i'm talking about i am just i'm a cupcake freak i've lost 54 pounds but i cannot it's still sugar sugar i love sugar i love cupcakes cupcakes are my favorite thing in the world if i could eat cupcakes every meal i would do it so i know that i showed you already what they look like but i mean really guys look how big these cupcakes are like these are super big cupcakes with a lot of icing they were really generous on the icing i can't wait to try them we had a hard time finding gigi's it the the direction said that it was on taster um and it said sweet i think it was 103. so when we when we pulled into where we saw the sign out front we couldn't find it all those suites up there are 200 and something so you have to come back here to the back beside the blue moose and there it is right there so it's i think suite 103 and it's in the back of the building off of so you're actually going to find it behind the smart bank so when you pull in just go straight back behind the smart me and then this is the rest of the building ggs right there on that side yeah so which one are you going to try first red velvet you know you gotta give me some can't believe you picked my favorite red velvet i'm going to try the strawberry lemonade all right strawberry lemonade let's see what happens oh look what's in the middle of yours [Music] oh that's a lot of icing right [Music] so to me it's hard to find a good red velvet because a lot of people will make it too dry that's not dry at all that's really good [Music] yeah we actually bought these last night but we were too full after we went to eat so this is day day number two of having them and they're really good well red velvet is anyway that makes you want slappy grainy it's that good so i love cupcake shelf it's my favorite thing cupcakes make me happy all right you ready for the strawberry lemonade so this one is got a yellow cake base cake is good or no frosting it's good but it's a little bit the cake is a little bit drier than the red velvet the icing is really good so which of those is your favorite red velvet i like the red velvet too is that strawberry it's really good for this one i picked the wedding because we have a lot of people on our group ask about wedding cakes where can they get a good wedding cake so i thought i might as well try the lemon i mean the wedding cake chocolate chip that looks really good it's like a put a cookie on the top yeah the cupcake has got a little chips in it it looks almost like a muffin a chocolate chip muffin it's a nice dirty box too it is a nice dirty box so we didn't lose them because they're in little trays you know how when you pick up cupcakes and you're going to take them somewhere and then you get there and they're all just turned all over the place this box has yeah this little tray in it so they didn't they didn't get messed up i like that especially i mean because if you're here on vacation and you're trying to find somewhere that has a good um place then you're probably going to be taking it somewhere thinking about your hotel your resort your cabin got the chips in the middle too it's like a chocolate chip cookie chocolate chip first try just the cake yeah i'm thinking to me this cupcake tastes more like a muffin but it's good chocolate chips or dark chocolate they feel like it which is better for you [Music] still not as moist as the red velvet but it's still still good what do you think about that icing [Music] it's good hello i like the eyeshadow [Music] very kind of it's rich in this i'm gonna have to take a drink after that one the wedding cupcake looks like a white cake you trying to cake first [Music] oh no that one's moist pretty good oh wow wow this is going to be hard now i had my favorite picked out say red velvet no it's kind of hard then this one [Music] strawberry lemonade i agree i like the chocolate chips icing the cake was just a little drier i don't like that cake i mean it wasn't dry dry but it wasn't as maybe it was all the chocolate chips red velvet wedding fish strawberry lemonade and then chocolate chips that's mine [Music] but they had tons of other flavors so i'll have to go we're back we have more cupcakes from gg you like cake i love cupcakes i've already said in this video that i don't even know how to tell people how much i love cupcakes or cake i just do i know that she's gonna eat all 40s tonight we might taste for so we have we went and got four more i did see so unfortunately y'all know i don't ever really say negative stuff but i'm a little frustrated how do you okay you're frustrated no i'm frustrated because i thought okay i'll buy them i don't have to remember what i got because it'll be on the receipt so then i pull out the cupcakes for us to try them and guess what what we got four cupcakes there's only three listed on there because i had a coupon so go find your coupon in one of the coupon books you buy three to get one free but apparently we bought three lemon berry bliss cupcakes three i smell a lot of caramel but i don't see no lemon not one of them is a lemon berry bliss so we only know what two of them are maybe we know what the third one is but we have a we don't have a clue on one and it's i'm just frustrated because we can't tell you what it is but we want to review them so we got some mores [Music] i mean first off i love some [Music] no i do usually put peanut butter like my favorite s'mores is i'll put i'll get two graham crackers i put a marshmallow on one and i put a reese cup on the other one i pop it in the oven and put it on broil and i'll watch it until my marshmallow turns dark you know almost on fire and then i pull it out put it together eat it it's so good greasy cup on a s'more in the oven on broil is a game changer this is um german chocolate yeah okay what did you so we looked online to try to figure out what the other two are what did you say this one was that one's probably a candid maple pecan candied maple pecan guys look at the icing on this cupcake that is that's amazing you know looks like it's got a sugar cookie on this cookie i don't know it might be and that's and that's caramel caramel yeah so this one has caramel on it it might be i wonder if that's [Music] gingerbread maybe so there's i don't know what this one is because it says that it's a lemon bliss then i'm very blessed i'm gonna try this more let's try this more oh that's a real hershey bar like they don't skimp on fake chocolate look it's real chocolate cupcakes i don't know what that icing is but it tastes like a small one maybe it's because it has the graham cracker crumbles on it i don't know oh wait oh that was dark chocolate i don't like that i had a dark chocolate piece yeah i don't i'm not a fan of dark chocolate [Music] so i like the cupcake but i don't know what i had that was dark i don't know where that came from okay you can have that i don't like the dark chocolate and it wasn't all through it i don't know where that came from this one looks like it's more of a like that other one looks like it was dark chocolate i'm just really not a dark chocolate fan [Music] yeah look what's inside it's got extra goodies inside german chocolate has coconut in it wow [Music] that's really good and that one is really moist i like that a lot like i said i'm not a fan of chocolate really but this one looks really good maybe you think it's because they put the icing on the inside it makes it [Music] now like this one yeah this one would be a dover for me [Music] that's six that we've tried so far what did you like best what do we have the first time first time we had the wedding cake red velvet strawberry lemonade and the cookies and cream my favorite so far would be the red bell mine too i like the red velvet a lot and i like the wedding

that little place [Music]", "j3CRe2-R8Yg": "cheers this film [Music] [Music] yo what's up guys Ronnie ray back - true so I have another training review for you guys in this video actually a concentrate review we're going up with a brand trip and we're going over the the wedding cake chatter so here's the package for you that's pretty simple so I'm really not gonna go over it because it's just just a [ __ ] envelope but if you want um there's our social medias right there so you can go check them out if you want to do some more research on know more but every what I mean so there you go on that um besides for that you guys know what [ __ ] wedding cake is I'm sure like everybody does by now she smoked weed I've got one gram of shatter gold wedding cake that's what it says the harvest eight six twenty seven nineteen which is like two two months ago from the day I'm recording this so not too old they have a size four that there's really just and what I mean so let's it's sealed by like a little sticker right there so I dropped it so let's go ahead and like take that stick with I'll crack the steel and open this [ __ ] up so yes oh I didn't open this thing up so so so we got it open Ned pretty self-explanatory pretty simple packaging I mean it's [ __ ] dope it gets the job done like it definitely gets the job done and it looks [ __ ] dope with it I mean just not really much to say about it like it is what it is you know what I mean so yeah um inside that though he's in parchment paper and your shadow right there so go ahead and open this up oh yeah just looking fire I'll get some close-up shots for you guys in a second here you guys go it right off the bat that's just looking [ __ ] fire so let me get some close-up shots at my phone real quick for you guys and then tell me down below in the comments where you guys think of it like looks-wise on then we'll get the [ __ ] spoke initiate you know what I mean so yeah just give me one second and then we'll get into this [Music] I got like 30 seconds recorded on my phone so I got some close-up shots for you guys but oh but yeah I want to start smoking on this channel I'm trying to get high right there for a second but not for oh I'm trying to focus on this so the TAC you're in though I'll give that sugar rating already I mean like it could it's [ __ ] dope for like for what it is you don't mean like a lot of companies issues like rebel envelopes and like they finally just white and boring you know I mean I always say if they went out of their way like to like put that like whole 3d and not 3d effects but like um what do you call that shiny effect on it and make it look oh I like make their own car inside its cardboard - it's not like plastic paper so yeah it's cardboard it's not paper - that's a plus but besides for that like it's nothing really too fancy there's definitely like wait [ __ ] more cool like I mean like the packaging is whatever I mean like you're gonna throw it away anyways it doesn't really [ __ ] matter but there's some companies that like that go out of the way and it makes it go faster packaging you know what I mean so it's just even though it doesn't really matter it's just kind of cool sometimes but on a scale of one to five I'll give that like a three out of five maybe a 3.5 out of 5 just because like like I said it's dope as [ __ ] for what it is like it's just a [ __ ] envelope or like for being just like a generic envelope it's not like them just a plain white one that they did their own thing I mean so look at that like half a point for being like creative and unique but they can get something more unique you know what I mean but besides for that it the next thing the looks of it looks of the shatter on a scale of 1 to 5 this shit's looking [ __ ] fire it's looking I can see like a lot of that you can see the Terps in it's looking like a little saucy ass definitely looking [ __ ] fire I don't know tumble down below in the comments what you guys think of it good you guys already [ __ ] seeing it but here's another look at it definitely looking [ __ ] fire now I constantly pick up this leg trip I pick them up all the time this isn't my first time trying them because I've worked in love their products probably they're an arizona-based brand but if I'm wrong and down below in the comments but I already know the kids are gonna be [ __ ] high quality all the time and especially for the price point so I believe their grams like normally like $40 45 50 and they chorus and like better like THCA like tops up shelf [ __ ] that goes for like more like 60 80 but like this stuff was up 40 dollars a gram yeah that's just 40 bucks a gram so but 40 [ __ ] dollars a gram that [ __ ] is [ __ ] fired and they're constantly like I would say like at least once a week or once every other week they have a buy one get one free deal so you can pretty much get it for like 20 bucks a gram you can't [ __ ] beat that right there like that's not [ __ ] steel you know what I mean fire uh so the price point I mean not the price point oh I guess we could do both with the price point I'll get that [ __ ] like a when they had the buy one get one free deal five out of five laptops but even like forty bucks a gram for this [ __ ] that's still like a five out of five for like a four and a half out of five that's this isn't [ __ ] fire like I mean just off looks and then like the looks of it like just like I'm having I mean I've smoked their [ __ ] product like their products before but in this video I haven't smoked any of this yet but it's based off the looks this [ __ ] looks [ __ ] fires it based off the looks I'm gonna give it like a in between a four and A four and a half out of five so like up one two out of five that makes sense you know what I mean oh yeah enough talking I feel like I've been rambling let's get into [ __ ] smoke now so I'm gonna get a little smaller not a small dab but a little a little decent dab you know I mean because we're getting a little taste test first see how this is so look you guys can like show you guys how well it's gonna be kind of hard for me show you but like you obviously see how it's melted on the side it's just like super saucy you can just like screen that up I don't know how well that's the cameras picking that up it's like the sides are like super turkeys like sauce you know I mean our room is cold as [ __ ] so it looks like there's no weight like noted but that's [ __ ] fire um but yeah my good at like a little decent dab nothing crazy big get a little taste test going see what this just isn't like and then other we take this would take a couple of bigger dives and get a little high test going see how I'm feeling you know what I mean so that's not Vince's it's a little bit like um shatter sugar flats like kinda has like a little bit of a sugar texture to do that that makes sense but say here's the dab like I said it's nothing [ __ ] huge nothing too small but it'll get the job done mr. Bellamy smoking that up for the nothing too fancy that's like a generic rigna didn't like name-brand but to recyclers that's where you do a pretty dope right but now so it's good this tastes though it's going to go one the pot like I said yeah [Music] my card caps so I'm just gonna use this um it'll work it'll get the job done just a [ __ ] little empty box containing you know what I mean so yeah where's that that here it is so if you guys are smoking on long cheers I hope you guys have smoked with something dank and let's get this little piece that's going because I want to take some [ __ ] fat dabs and get high so yeah let's go choose super smooth super clean the fire honestly on that first not really much flavor like it was just super clean like super smooth with Jonah man the guy didn't even call I didn't even have the urge to off like some correct wedding cake is like a cross train between like your spell cookies and what is it a trick chirayu pie right if I'm correct it's kind of shut up like a sweet earthy taste to it I guess I've been since I guess that's what I could say I had I got a sweet earthy taste to it cuz it didn't really have much flavor um it just tasted fire like some pure wax you know what I mean like I don't know maybe on this next to I'll taste it a little bit more of it'll go on for a fatter Deb multi-hit alone I don't know my rate is probably gonna change after I take this tab but just based off that first hit the this taste I'll probably give like a four or five yeah that's going for it fatter dad now sir yeah all right so I'm take a pretty fat dab right here so yeah let me take a little snake and that [ __ ] looks far like I don't know like you could just see like a little of the Turks in it like yeah like a head like that sure your wax texture to it I don't know like I don't know if you guys can really see you okay there's some oh my finger take my thumb but I don't know how I can get the camera to focus on a little bit better maybe you guys can see it I don't know it just has like the [ __ ] look I don't know it just has like it like some like a turf texture to it but I don't know if you guys can see no oh yeah that's a dive about the tape pretty [ __ ] fat so I guess this would be like a little high reading if for 40 bucks a gram line it should have [ __ ] fire there whatever seals like dripping in our area definitely pick it up yep and if you have like a buy one get one free deal definitely don't miss out on that which is called the quarter twenty bucks I don't even see how they're like I don't know that makes me wonder like how cheap they're getting it for like they cost them to make it like this sign it for 20 bucks a gram you know there's still probably like making a hella profit off but and it's [ __ ] fire sign above you know what I mean but I don't know it's just [ __ ] weird but threat of smoking along I hope you guys are smoking something thank you you guys are cheers Cheers [Music] [ __ ] bro [Music] so I don't know how well that uh smoke showed up on the camera because I think he brought us lights and a makes it like alright for my camera to pick up the smoke sometimes but I took that dad but like the perfect temperature is so light I mean like you think I got a lot of smoke but for like the size of the dab it wasn't as much smoke as a room only thing but like inches because I [ __ ] took it at like a low temperature you know I mean but like I definitely [ __ ] got all that [ __ ] in my lungs oh my god that [ __ ] [ __ ] hurt I'm not gonna lie and I'm definitely [ __ ] throwing highs [ __ ] out so if you guys can tell but not like I've been saying that [ __ ] is definitely [ __ ] fires [ __ ] I got some more [ __ ] on blue dream crumble rhythm comes in like this little box a little bit [ __ ] different I'm gonna be dropping a review on this [ __ ] soon so if you guys want to see that stay tuned but I'm gonna get the [ __ ] high four point three out of five fire is [ __ ] but this I think some more fire wife's out there but you gotta [ __ ] pay the price but for being 40 bucks it's Stephanie [ __ ] dumb fire you're not I mean um like I don't have any complaints at all in fact uh but um uh yeah overall score I'll give like a four point two out of five I know that's like a weird score but I feel like it deserves more than a four but it's not all the way up for four point five yeah I mean so yeah four point two but yeah if you guys liked this video after the big thumbs up comment like subscribe do what I could show you you know what to do how many if you guys liked them down below in the comments give me video ideas suggestions suggestions anything anything you guys want to tell me you don't blow in the comments that's what the comments are for it but besides for that it's been Ronnie ray P so", "SoFksOhGCes": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you", "67IPSLrXqf0": "[Music] welcome back to the abbey cakes youtube channel today we're going to be making a wedding cake which is our specialty however we're putting a twist on it we got all of the ingredients from the 99-cent store uh you can definitely make a beautiful wedding cake on a budget okay so this box mix calls for one cup of water half a cup of oil and three eggs and like i mentioned it's not going to take us very far as far as how much batter we're going to get so we're gonna start by extending it okay so the extension to get more batter is going to be us adding one cup of flour and one cup of sugar in addition to the mix and that's already mixed together in here to make the cake more moist and a little bit more dense we're gonna do four eggs instead of three one cup of sour cream that the box doesn't call for one cup of milk which it also doesn't call for and then a whole cup of oil instead of half of a cup and no water we're gonna just skip that all together so it can be really moist and then i want this to be flavored lemon so i am gonna add three tablespoons of lemon extract to the batter and because this is already a yellow cake we don't need to add any food coloring it's going to give us the right yellow color that we need for lemon cake so for today's wedding cake we are going to be making a two-tier cake six inch and eight inch rounds three of each i have already baked them so that we can just get started decorating but i will note that i baked my cakes for about 35 minutes i started with 30 checked them and then added an extra five minutes until my tester came out clean i didn't pour a ton of batter into the pans it was probably about a little less than halfway full because for whatever reason the box mixes they rise up really well and they do a lot of doming on top so 35 minutes is right in that time frame of 34 to 38 minutes since our cake is baked and now that it's chilling let's make the frosting so now we're going to make our buttercream and i am using a recipe today that is very easy and really delicious and it's from sugar geek show and you can go to their website or their youtube and you can find it and all the ingredients i was able to get at the dollar store a little note though about the butter it was really expensive i thought at the dollar store it was 3.99 a pound and that's pretty high sometimes on sale at a local grocery store you can get it for 99 cents a pound so just be mindful of that if you are really on a budget for today's ingredients we are using egg whites powdered sugar unsalted butter vanilla and salt all right if you do not have unsalted butter and you only have salted just omit the extra salt that we're going to add in but know that it is going to be a little bit saltier than it should be alright so let's start with our egg whites pour them into the mixer followed by powdered sugar [Music] okay we are going to use the whisk here and we're just going to mix them together on really low so it doesn't go flying everywhere i put in here six ounces of egg whites and 24 ounces of powdered sugar and we're gonna go on stir just until it's combined and then we'll kick it up a notch so this is like the easy version of traditional swiss meringue buttercream but instead of cooking the sugar and the egg whites together we're just going with powdered sugar and mixing it with the egg whites right off the bat still not on high yet i just want it to come together a little bit more now we're going to whip on high for a minute okay so our minute is up and now we are going to start adding in our butter in small chunks i did warm my butter in the microwave a little bit it's pretty cold here right now and so even though it was sitting out all night it was still a little bit too firm and i want it nice and soft so we are going to incorporate each little scoop and chunk of butter before we add in the next [Music] so this will just take a few minutes to incorporate all of the butter now that all of our butter is added in you'll notice it almost curdles not as much as traditional swiss meringue buttercream but it does go through the curdling stage and you'll let it keep mixing and it'll smooth out over the next few minutes but before we finish let's add in our vanilla and a pinch of salt and then we'll turn it back on and whip it for a few minutes our buttercream is all made and it's mixing on low right now and we will start trimming our 99 cent cakes so we are going to use um an eight inch board which is the same size as the bottom tier and i am going to cut it just a little bit because the semi-naked cake isn't going to have a full quarter to a half an inch of buttercream around it's going to have a lot less so i don't want the board to be exposed i could have grabbed a seven inch board but i didn't so we'll just trim it okay let's start with our first tier here the box cakes really have a nice dome i did flip them when they came out of the oven so that they're a little bit flatter and it's easier to cut but we're just trimming the dome off so that we have a really level cake once we start filling and icing okay so there's our first one move it to the side i'm just using a serrated knife to cut here i feel like i have the most control there are actual cutters that you could use but i just prefer this because it's what i'm used to and i have a lot of control over it and that looks pretty level to me these cakes are very very chilled which i like for any cake that i'm doing but in particular the semi-naked cakes because we don't want crumbs all over the place so these have been chilled for quite some time in the cooler we've got one more tier and then i think our buttercream will be ready it's been mixing on low for about 20 minutes and hopefully most of the air bubbles are out by that time when you whip the buttercream on high to make it come together you get a lot of air pockets and we don't want those when we're icing on the cake so mixing at a really low speed for 20 minutes will help with that all right let's start building our 99-cent store cake so i've got my trimmed first layer here and i'm going to build a well so that we can whoops we can put in our fruit in the middle so it's a lemon cake so i'm gonna do a little bit of vanilla buttercream in the center and then add in some fresh fruit [Music] let's add our next layer flip it upside down lay it on top kind of secure it a little bit to the buttercream and i'm going to seal up the edges here before we move on to filling this so i'm going to add a little buttercream around the edges and then take my spatula and seal it in this is just a really rough seal before we continue stacking we're going to go back and tidy everything up in a little bit next well [Music] this is going to be i think my first semi-naked cake from a box i'm excited i think it's gonna come out beautiful when we're all done [Music] all right and our final layer [Music] oh that looks good okay let me fill up my bag again and then we'll go around the sides once more seal it in okay now i'm going to add a amount of buttercream that's the same as if i were going to ice this completely and it would be fully covered and then we're going to scrape off to get the semi-naked look i'm going to start with a huge dollop on [Music] top [Music] semi-naked cakes are one of my favorite and i think they're probably one of the most ordered too from our shop they can just go with any occasion they can be dressed down for a rustic look they can be dressed up and made very classy and elegant this one we're going a little bit rustic wedding which is why i'm using this birch base here okay now we're going to add to the sides all right so i'm adding a full layer of buttercream here because if you don't add enough and you start scraping you're going to have so many crumbs it's easier to work with a lot and then pull off and get a little bit of crumb as opposed to a ton of crumb everywhere all mixed in the buttercream if you refer back to some of our other tutorials like the fall inspired cake you'll see all of our techniques for icing a cake [Music] okay here we go it looks pretty good time to scrape off [Music] for being a 99-cent store box cake it's holding up really really well better than i thought so it's going really smooth okay so as you can see we're finally starting to see some cake um i love a really clean semi-naked so i'm gonna pull off more so we can see a little bit more cake but i'm not gonna get too crazy and take off a whole ton more like this is looking really good yeah that's looking awesome you clean up the top a little [Music] it is coming along nicely we're pretty close to being done with this tier and all for about under 20 bucks i think the most expensive part um or the most expensive ingredient as i mentioned was the butter the cake itself was around 11 dollars um and then buttercream total maybe around eight or nine so for how beautiful this cake is already coming out i think that's a pretty awesome price [Music] just cleaning up our edges here so they're nice and sharp [Music] that looks really nice it's really really good i'll go around once more i think yeah i love that okay let's finish up the edges so i'm just looking really closely at my edges here to make sure we're pretty level i can't go back later with a leveler and make sure it's absolutely perfect but i think i've got a pretty good eye for it and it looks looks pretty good one more scrape okay i like that okay now we're ready for the top tier both of our cakes are iced and chilled and now we need to start building some support on the bottom tier so that we can stack so i'm just using straws from the dollar store i'm gonna put four of them in here and then we'll trim them so they're flush with the top of the cake [Music] and that'll be enough support for the six inch tier so i just kind of pushed the straw against the buttercream kind of as my marking pull it up a little bit [Music] and then trim and push it back down this is going to support the top tier from sinking in to the bottom tier so that we don't have just a cake sitting on buttercream as the cake gets softer it would sink in if we didn't have these straws in here to support the top tiers board and cake okay we're ready to go let's grab our top tier and stack it all right here we go this is the most nerve-wracking part set it on okay and we'll push it back a little bit and then we can dress it up with flowers okay so all of these flowers came from the dollar store and they were in bunches um i think we probably spent in total about four bucks on flowers in addition to the cake i have just trimmed them here and because they're not fresh flowers they don't need to be wrapped in floral wire or floral tape or anything like that so let's see where we're gonna go i think i'm gonna do three bunches on the cake as i'm looking at the cake right now i'm really looking for the best view of the cake which is obviously the most level where the cake is peeking through enough that i love it and then where the buttercream is smoothest and the edges are sharp so i think that this is going to be the front of the cake and we could do a ton of things with the flowers we could do a full arrangement in the front we can do little bunches throughout the cake and i think that's what i'm going to do i want a little bunch here a little bunch over in this corner and then opposite on top but i think i'm going to start right here see how it looks and then kind of finish it out however i feel looks best these flowers from the dollar store actually come already with wire that's bendable and flexible so that i can move it how i need it which is perfect because when you get fresh flowers you have to add in floral wire and it's just kind of a pain and these are ready to go so i'm just looking for a little space here i kind of want it to slide up the cake not too much pressure um this wire is pretty sharp and it's sliding in very nicely [Music] i want this flower to have a little bend in it so it looks kind of like a natural curve i'm going to take off the greenery though because you won't see that [Music] so i'm actually going to use i'm going to cut off some wire from another flower that i don't need right now and i'm going to use it as wire to move this flower in place where i'd like it to stay [Music] there so instead of it leaning all the way now it's sitting up really nicely [Music] all i'm doing is just creating a cute little arrangement [Music] oh i love it so cute a little more greenery i was initially going to do little bunches and opposite corners of each tier but as i finished the first arrangement in the center i noticed i had a lot of space down here on my board and i really like the idea of just putting them on the same side and doing a larger one here and then a little bit of a smaller one but very similar arrangements um on both sides so that's what i ended up doing and this is the final product for our 99 cent store wedding cake i think it came out perfect [Music] so that's it for today guys thank you so much for watching don't forget to like and subscribe and turn on the notifications so that you

"what's up guys this week I'm going to show you how to tear a cake so that way your cake is structured and you don't end up with a crumbling pile of a mess my name is Laurie and you're watching the icing artist to start off I've already layered up both of my tears I've done an 8 inch and a 6 inch round but before I start I Singh them I need to add in one of the most important components to tearing a cake a cake board that is the same size as the cake that we're gonna be tearing now I'm just going to add a little bit of buttercream onto the cake board and then place the icing side down onto the top of my cake and flip it over that is half the structure for tearing a cake but we're gonna get to the other half in a minute I'm the icing of cake on a bigger cake board I'm just gonna add a bit of icing into the middle so that way my cake doesn't go sliding around when I'm trying to ice it and I'm just gonna get both my cakes a nice crumb coat and then a thicker coat of icing of course if you guys want the recipe I will leave a link right here to my back-to-basics playlist you guys can also see how to cover a cake in fondant and how to ice cupcakes and my buttercream icing and a bunch of other basic videos to get you guys started a cake decorating now that both my cakes are perfectly smooth I am just gonna use a cake board that's a bit smaller than my top tier to mark out the center on to my bottom tier and that's so I know where to put my dowels when I'm putting the structure so we don't have one kind of sticking out the side of the top tier where you can see it it is time for the second half of our tearing structure I'm gonna be using food-safe dowels as my structural pillars that are gonna hold up the weight of second tier I just marked out the height of the dowel that's the exact same height of the cake using an edible marker and then cut that using cable cutters I just found out a tube store now I'm only using three dowels for support from my top tier but that's because it's only a six inch round if I was gonna do the top tier it's like an 8 inch round or if I see me doing a three tier cake or something you're gonna want to use more doubles for the bigger cake you use think of it this way the heavier the cake the more support you're gonna want so that way all the weight doesn't go crushing down but if you guys don't want to use dowels you can use other things to tear cake as well I got these straws at a cake decorating store and they're really nice and thick the nice thing about these is they just cut with scissors when you mark the height you don't have to use another kind of tool or anything for it but personally I've just been using dowels for so long so that's the way I like to tier tape but no matter what supports you use for a cake you want to make sure all of your supports are the exact same height go into the cake otherwise when you put the top tier on it's going to be tilted or angled and as you can see once I put the cake board on top which the cake is gonna be sitting on no matter how much weight I push down on that cake it's not going anywhere because it's fully supported so the weights no longer on that bottom tier the weight is gonna be just on those pillars and cake board I'm just gonna add a little bit of icing onto the top of that cake then I'm just gonna assume the cake from that bottom cake board using my offset spatula but that small cake board is still underneath the cake now if you ask anybody this is the most terrifying part about tearing a cake everything else is easy other than this part you just want to carefully pick up the cake and then place it on and it it looks kind of easy just picking up the cake and placing it on but it can be kind of tricky especially with a buttercream cake but once you get used to it it's not as scary and I'm just gonna shift around till it gets centered hard part done now to keep that top tier from sliding off we're gonna have to structure it by putting a dowels straight down the center so I'm gonna cut a dowel that's about I've been sure that in cakes so it's not sticking up through the icing and then sharpen the one end with a pencil sharpener I'm doing this that way I can hear it right through that cake board that's in the center and you can use another dowel to help kind of tap that right in and I like to give it an extra tap that way it goes right into that bottom cake board so this cake is not going anywhere is fast and right down to it if you worry about the cake kind of twisting at all you can add two dowels straight through and obviously this method kind of leaves that hole in the top of the cake so I'm just gonna fill that with some icing and cover that up but most case usually has some kind of topper on the top of them so you're not gonna see it anyways I'm also gonna add a little bit more icing on the edge of that top chair to kind of clean that up and finish it off with a trim but if you guys don't want to see that hole in the top of the cake what you're gonna do is once you've added the supports into the bottoms here you're just gonna add the middle support at the exact same time that's gonna stand up straight and we're doing your top tier you're gonna do that on a cake board that has a hole in the center so you can drop it onto that dowel a little bit more tricky that's why I prefer this method of course guys there's so many different ways of tearing a cake this is just a method that I've been doing for forever you got to find what works for you and if you guys are doing more tiers you're just gonna repeat the same process of structuring it and adding the different tiers and the most important part of Tyria cake is that all of the weight is not on that bottom cakes that we have not crumbling in that all the weight is on the different towels and the cake board I would love to know in the comment section down below have you guys tier cakes before what is your method of tearing do you have any tearing cake disasters let me know and that's it you guys know how to your cakes no of course don't forget to come back here again next week so we can make something else indicate together bye", "UsbmHm4Xw8s": "we got a wedding cake live resin strain review right now on the stream show [Music] what's up and welcome back to the strange show the adults-only marijuana channel where i teach you new fun facts about weed every week don't forget to subscribe and you can put some nuggets of knowledge into your stream brain today we're gonna be trying some of this wedding cake live sugar from natty realms extracts it's testing it seventy one point two seven percent THC let's see what we paid for this it's thirty dollars and forty nine cents for two grams of live sugar this was on sale for a forty percent off so I think I got a really good deal and I'm pretty stoked to try this wedding cake so let's open one of these up and see what she's looking like we've got the little natty rims logo oh you have a great endocannabinoid system sick come on mat here it's stronger than a child oh wow check it out nice and chunky alright let's scoop one of these guys out and see what it's talking about it smells good like oh it smells like a cush so hard sort of has that Girl Scout cookie smell but it's fresh out of the refrigerator so it's doesn't smell very strong yet but I assume when we dab this guy it's gonna be hella flavorful okay I have this step perfectly balanced on this stick and you see it sort of got ahead of myself oh don't fall don't fall okay and I got the right carb cap for these pearls this time this little spinning guy right here but it sucks it doesn't really spin the pearls very well it doesn't work for a carb cap very well either so we're just going to stick to this guy cuz it works really good but it doesn't spin the pearls very well so oh whoa wedding cake strange Oh [Music] oh yeah [Music] very nice very nice mMmmm no it's good got me I has a very indica taste very reminiscent of a cush or maybe a Kim dog so wedding cake is Girl Scout cookie crossed with cherry pie and I'm pretty sure that Girl Scout cookie is a Kim dog cross and I can really taste that Kim og kind of flavor in here real strong and it tastes real good I love in because I love pushes above Kim I love Girl Scout cookie I love wedding cake this is right up my alley it's a real strong kiss flavor with like citrusy hints some kind of hands it's got like a sweet also maybe that's the cookie coming through that sweet sweetness with the citrus so it's like the main flavor is boom funk funky og Kim and then it's like ooh sweet ooh a little citrus - yeah this is good I'm glad I got two grams of the same strain once I don't do a whole lot but I was like the wedding cake for the 40% off so grams was alive for 30 bucks um I'm about that all day all day and I wasn't sure about some budget hair so I good but then I looked at it and I was like I'm fine although and it did me right I'm glad I got this okay stranger who'd sometimes in slow Tim Tams go forever [Music] still so little pump left Oh still still straight phone what is that taste I would call it that super Citra Funkadelic oof yeah that tastes good quality hash indeed all right so we're gonna do the usual piece out for 20 minutes and then we'll come back and assess the high from this tasty tasty live sugar I will see you in 20 minutes and boom to the powers of multi-million dollar Hollywood special-effects 20 minutes has elapsed and I return so this high is very nice it's a really strong indica heavy hi and I'm just real chill right now super duper chill and if you like in because you will like this a lot this would probably be real good for nighttime too like for going to bed ebed my eyes feel super heavy I'm sure I look super stoned very pleased with this for 30 bucks for 32 bucks for two grams very pleased my live sugar that's what I wanted to look like and put some wedding cake that's what I want it to taste like so I'll give the wedding cake from natty rooms a nine out of 10 I want to give it a 10 out of 10 because I feel like that should be reserved for something spectacular which this was really good but I wouldn't say spectacular so let's give it a 9 out of 10 highly recommend but I am partial because I love live resin and I love indicus and I love wedding cake so you know who knows but I bet you would like this if you like it because if you like getting stoned do you like live resin give it a try thanks for watching buddy I'll see you in the next video", "ceUn2lo76nE": "i order two of the exact same wedding cakes one from a one-star bakery and one from a five-star bakery in today's episode we're gonna compare them and see which lump of delicious moist creamy cake will come out on top and into my mouth on this episode of Cake versus cake so I've done this video before and we have compared the one-star cake and the five-star cake and to be honest all of you guys and Nick said the 1 star cake was a steaming hot pile of dog [ __ ] in this episode I also wanted to get my sweet little granny involved so I went on Pinterest and I found 10 of the best most interesting cakes send them to her and she replied with her two favorites let me show you the options I gave her first we have this lonely girl kind of like I don't need no man even in a wedding vibes then this carousel horse cake fit for a horse girl like me this beautiful pastel paper cake this ice queen blue butterfly cake this Marie Antoinette let them eat cake this cake that every girl in high schools whose parents were rich cake had for her birthdays cakes and finally this granny looking cake with the flower on it and of course my granny picked a granny looking cake but she also liked the one that looks like paper so I ran off to the bakeries to give on my order for a cake and this is what we got let's start with our expectations very low no.1 star bakery I'm so excited for this video this cake is literally from the 1 star bakery let me tell you about it before I show it to you I walked in there it was a cute little grandma they didn't have many reviews and I was like ok could be okay I showed her the picture of the cake she took a picture of it she said no problem I paid 90 Bulgarian leva for this I am so excited to reveal it to 3 2 1 look at her she's cotton candy dreams she's everything I want to be like I've never been so excited about a food product in my entire life I'm not gonna talk over it because I want to spit on it for the price I am very impressed I was not actually inspecting the little butterflies to fly I was not even expecting them to really be here she said she would do her best they look like they're stuck on with some kind of string like no a little paper q-tip thing you shove in your ear and then eat it that is what this looks like it's made from I like the balls they have a pearl essence on them but I like any kind of ball so not really a surprise here and let's talk about the ribboning around the actual cake very beautifully done really well constructed although I would say the front flaps kind of look like my regime but you know finally let's talk about the construction of the rock layer beautiful amazing it has like gold sparkles all over it and some gold flakes which I'm so [ __ ] impressed by this I hope she actually ate the piece she cut out I will have to say like this is like a nonsense critique because if someone brought me this cake I would be very impressed first of all I'd be thankful that someone loves me enough to buy me a [ __ ] cake hello but then I'd be like this is so beautiful like I get it my only critique because I'm looking for something to critique not because I would actually care is the way she cut off this piece of cake is not like even it's like a Kylie Jenner cut but who [ __ ] cares like at the end of the day this is a beautiful cake the next thing is we have talked about how close it is to the actual original cake so I'm gonna pull up the photo that I sent them drink my coffee I'm drinking espresso by the way cuz I'm me and I literally hate myself let's talk about how close it is to the original in the original cake I feel like the original cake is a lot more expensive than this one let's start with the way this cake is even photographed like she's got a nicer setup than I do when I'm photographing myself like this cake is a queen and everybody knows that she's laying there all aesthetic and naked and [ __ ] like she knows she's a rich [ __ ] so let's start that this is probably a very expensive cake if this one is probably a lot cheaper than the one I showed in my photograph I cannot expect the same quality and appeal in a cake that is a lot less money than the one being photographed second of all this cake you desire may be that this is their specialty so it's hard to compare someone's like specialty versus someone trying this for the first time you know like if you made a YouTube video and then you compare it with my I've made like 200 YouTube videos it's not fair if you like my videos aren't as good as Blair's I'm not good at making videos no it's just cuz it's your first one keep doing that [ __ ] keep making your videos okay okay so let's talk about critiques just cuz that's what this videos for not because I'm actually a huge [ __ ] the layering like these little squiggly vagina looking things these ones are cut way more thin they're so thin they're skinny [ __ ] [ __ ] and because they're so thin they look more like paper my other critique is the colouring of the rocks in the original cake are a lot more yellow and they have like a depth of color so it looks like an actual rock formation they'll have like yellow on the inside and like this one as you can see it's the same powdery white throughout finally let's talk about these little butterflies I wonder if these are edible we're gonna try one actually fell off ovary they met on your mouth but they're not very delicious they have more of like a popcorn flavor not really sweet they're not like sugar they're just like it could be paper we don't think paper melts in your mouth but I haven't eaten in a couple of years I'm not sure I'm so impressed by this cake this top layer that has like a marble effect to it is so [ __ ] beautiful I imagine like in my dreams this is what I like bounce on look I don't walk in my dreams like when I'm having like a fairytale dream I think of myself and like these marble pillowy clouds like I guess skipping I'm a [ __ ] skipper I like me on top of this cake I'm like you know what because I don't wanna eat this cake yet because I think it's like too pretty I think I'm gonna reveal to you guys a five star cake on the outside and then we can look at them both on the inside you know I'm gonna see their outsides first and then look at their insides tell them how beautiful they are asked for consent may I please eat you [Music] so this is the 5-star cake let me tell you about this cake experience first first of all this cake was a lot more expensive than the other one this one weighs 280 leva which is about one hundred and forty-five dollars it was just very easy for me to order off Instagram DM I really appreciate that I really like that but I understand its you don't have to always be able to do that for a place to be good but I'm so impressed by this cake I cannot even begin to describe the talent of the people that I have ran into today I'm going to reveal it to guys in three two one the talent so actually when I went to go pick up the cake we talked to the person who had created this cake and he was like to be very honest with you the amount of stress your cake has caused me if I hadn't known it would have been so difficult I would have never accepted to even try to do this cake and this is a man a cake artist who makes these cakes that turn that swivel that do things and I'm like a whole like I journey like I felt that I don't know anything about cakes I'm not a baker I don't know how difficult this is to me but I genuinely like felt a little bad that I made a stress in his life because that's not what I'm here for but I'm really happy to present to you guys this cake I feel like I'm on a cake presentation show right now let's start at the bottom it is given to me on a Styrofoam and fondant plate was also a ribbon on it I took over off the name tag of the cake I actually ate it I took that off so that's why there is a lump in the fondant and they didn't give this to me I did this so blame me for the lumpy fondant okay this is me I did this do not blame anybody else okay okay let's start critiquing this baby girl first of all like I said in the original the little side things look like paper also I like that he tried to do almost the exact same gradient as a photo that I gave as a reference they are a beautiful pastel coloring there's a lot more of them than the one start cake they still don't look like paper like the original cake but like I've said before to compare someone's specialty and talent to someone who's doing it for the first time isn't really fair so I'm not gonna do that let's talk about the inside rock layer this rock layer has a lot more dimension than the other one I would say it's pretty similar it has like the marbling of the silver and gold on the side it still doesn't really have the yellow inside although I'm pretty sure they both skip back throw it in that's probably not gonna look good it would look like more cloudy and like yellowy and then let's talk about the placement of the balls really close but you can put balls anywhere near them you know I'll eat them so let's talk about this top layer of fondant actually I really complimented that one star bakery of its use of this pillowy marbled fondant I will however say that the original photo did not actually specify what type of funds it used so this required like imagination let's talk about the floating things now the colouring of these floating things is exactly perfect the placement is not exactly the same the shape of this cake is a lot different than the cake I had sent a picture of my cake is like taller but when I was ordering this cake he asked me how many pieces and I originally said 8 because I figured if it was like a tall cake it like this to me looks like 8 pieces but he said the minimum I can do for you is 16 sorry that's just like my minimum order totally fine with that I still wish it was like a little bit taller so it could have like the same shape of the cake my only critique is this ok this is so stupid like I feel like critiques are nonsense but like we have to have something to say right um this side goes this way and this side also goes this way I don't like that I wish it was like these were either straight like both of these ended like straight or they both ended like out so it would be like ripping this open the way they're both pointing this way does it make sense to me I don't like it but it's just because I had to give a critique let me know what you guys think in the comments do you think this cake is worth 2 times the amount of the cakes I'm gonna put on side by side for you now and you can see and really tell me do you think it's worth 2 times as much money or would you have been fine with paying half the price for this type of cake here's the other cake and you guys are more than welcome to text my opinion at 7:02 9:30 24 36 I do text back but I do get thousands of messages per hour so I do my absolute best a textbook everyone it might take me a few days but like I will eventually get to it I also sound like merch discounts notifications for new videos asking what kind of videos you want to see what type of cake you wanted to see so it's another way to get more involved and you're welcome to just leave it I'm subscribe any timing out will never text you again if you lose your number I don't know who you are so don't worry if you don't want me to text you like I can just never have your number again don't worry it's not like a thing forever it's just like if you subscribe then I see it and I can text you but if you leave you left to me I don't know what to do these are the two cakes side by side to be honest with you on camera this one's looking a little bit better but in real life this one is you see the more professional one on camera I think this one looks a little better because she's got more colors let's put him like she's got more colors in her you know so she like it she looks brighter and more bouncy I try to match the cakes today do you guys like my outfit so I think it's finally time that we cut into these cakes also if you do want a faster version of these videos I'm gonna put it on tik-tok and also on my Instagram so if you want to watch my videos except in like ten seconds go there I hit something something very hard uh-oh what's in there oh I see there's a whole layer of plastic in here any of my bakers out there can tell me what's up my critique is that if you were at a party and you were trying to cut this cake and that happened to you it would feel really awkward um I'm not really sure why it's reinforced me because it gets really heavy this is some of the best chocolate cake I've ever had it's so fuzzy and chocolatey it reminds me of the chocolate cake from the movie Matilda mmm it's really light and creamy and fresh it's not like a thick flavor I probably could eat the whole cake I'm not gonna like it tastes a little pearled they're just fondant let's taste these little ribbons just Monda it tastes like gum a little bit but like not minty obviously but it's got like the same kind of chewy texture the rock crystals are really good if you had put like those like sour the ones that are like rocks and that sour Rock there so it'll be like a nice the fun flavor probably wouldn't go with the chocolate nevermind my ideas are Dom don't send me don't put sour candy in the chocolate okay okay watch the knife with boiling hot water so maybe it'll cut through easier cut ooh this one's cutting down a lot faster there's nothing stuck in the middle oh this is so good this cuts so good beautiful I love you it's got like an interesting flavor it looks like okay three two one reveal your insides okay got like a weird slice up so I was trying to make it look pretty so we're gonna have to like really finger it and go under I am speechless it's very rare in my life that I'm speechless I've got nothing I say except perfection Beauty excellence the actual cake is a bunch of different flavors I can't really pinpoint the flavor exactly because I'm stupid and I think I'm something called like a super taster or no I'm a nun taster whatever the one where you like your tongue isn't that sensitive and you need a lot of flavors like I could put Tapatio on my tongue you just leave it there for an hour and that would be like good flavor to me so I think it's like a coffee chocolaty flavor with the creamy but it's more developed than like you know like vanilla frosting it's not vanilla frosting it's like actually flavor development it's got like different nuances of like almond flavoring or like something like that's where it's like a complicated cream flavor I know another complicated cream flavor and it tastes it like almost every other night fell mmm I feel like he handmade these which actually would take so long so what how I think you make this type of sugar is like you melt sure you Mel okay I'm actually stupid I think you mought sugar and you put it on a sheet pan and then you let crush it up kind of like the myth from Breaking Bad I think it's the same kind of vibe the fondant tastes the exact same I think bond not only has one flavor oh I do see a toothpick though that's good to know they stick things in with toothpicks okay that is very good to know I'm gonna stick things in myself with to pick next boob job toothpicks overall I would give the other cake a 9 out of 10 and I would give this cake a 10 out of 10 its beauty its grace its save the human race [Music]",

baker co uk I'm going to demonstrate how to ice a wedding cake this would be the finished article this is a two tier wedding cake obviously half black and half ivory so I want to show you how to flat ice to the base icing for any wedding cake or indeed any birthday cake I tend to use a white marzipan the natural marzipan and you need to cover the gap that usually sits at the bottom there because you've turned it over you've got the uneven bit on the board so you just need to ring to roll out sausage shaped pieces and then plug the gap at the bottom one hand on the cake and you're the one then can push the marzipan in the gap you then need a standard pallet knife again one hand on the cake and smooth it all the way around so it pushes it into the gap and you get a smooth side then for the ice and then the marzipan to sit on you need to then roll the marzipan out for the top knead it a little bit so that the smooth side comes to the top just needs to be evenly rolled out and enough to cover across the cake and down the side so you just need to roll it quite big thin layer of jam on each side this will just help the marzipan to stick to the cake the jam just helps it to slide a little bit and you can just maneuver it into the right place slight pressure on it not a lot of pressure they can just feel when it's smoothed over and then just start working around the sides then start to trim the edge and just go straight in line with that right we're going to ice the cake now we've covered it with marzipan we've got it all register ice and we're going to cover it with rollout icing so we're going to cover the cake we're also going to cover the ball if you need it slightly bigger than the marzipan that you roll down as it else to come down the sides of the cake and have enough to go on the board so that no board will show and you need to just place it start at the front over the top and then just let go and then you smooth it wear it for so again more ice and sugar on the top and start working down each bit you need to just trim around the board then so just feel for where the edge of the board is and a nice smooth knife not serrated just a smooth one and start to work all the way around the board then using the through the tool again just roam the very edge of the board just tie there's any loose ends up once you've iced your wedding cake you can then turn it into really any design you like this is just one tier bottom iced in white with black hearts and again round the base drum we've put black ribbon on the second tier is on a separate thin board in between and you just ice that as a separate cake put its literalist at it straight on the top of the other cake and you just join then with just basic be dicing ribbon decoration very simple design and again quite effective but that just gives you some idea of what you can do when you rise the base then and there's not an awful lot of work in that and it looks quite effective when it's finished", "DDxzXJAbxOw": "[Applause] hello everyone and welcome to cloneville is HP and today it's masterclass time and I know that stacking cakes is sometimes the bane of your life a lot of you asked me what the best ways to do it is obviously crimson doilies makes a lot of stacked cakes here in the bakery and we've had lots of years of epic fails and massive successes so I'm going to teach you everything that we know here at quandary is about how to stack cakes [Music] and you might think that stacking cakes are simply a case of putting one cake on top of the other well down that road lies disaster guys that you definitely don't want to just do that cakes really heavy so anything that you put on top of it it's going to be wearing it down slowly over time you might find that stacking one cake on top of the other works just fine for two minutes or three minutes but after say half an hour to an hour you might discover that the bottom cake is absolutely annihilated and that is no good especially if you're making a wedding cake or something really special so it's really important to support your cakes and also we found at crumbs and doilies that having a central pillar through the entire cake is vital especially if you're transporting the cake any length of distance if you're assembling the cake on site and you don't have to move it too much then you could probably forego this bit but if you have to drive your cake anywhere or anything like that or even move it from one room to another I highly recommend following all these steps so with that in mind and I know to talk about the cake boards so as you can see we've got three cakes here and they are all on what's called a cake drum but what you can't see in the two smaller cakes is the fact that they're actually ice directly onto a thin cake board such as this and this cake board has a hole in the middle and the reason that we ice our cakes directly onto a thin board like this is not only because it helps us to handle it better so we can have something between the cake and our hands moving it around but also it's something solid to sit on top of the pillars which are going to support your cake so it's really important that you do that this one has a hole in it in the middle and you might be thinking how do I get a hole in the middle of my cake board well there's a number of ways but the first thing to do is to cut a piece of greaseproof paper at the same size so I'm just gonna draw around one of my cake boards here and then cut that out using some sharp scissors and then with your circle you can just go ahead and fold that a number of times and obviously that is gonna now be the middle in that corner and then using a scissors again just cut a tiny piece out of the middle and then if you open it out you have a hole in the middle and then you can use that to put back onto your cake board to mark in the middle of your cake board and now there's a number of ways that you can make a hole if you have if you have to do a lot of cakes if you're you know making cakes like this regularly then I highly recommend clamping some together and using a drill to go through all of them that's actually also quite satisfying if you just do one at a time you could do this with a really sharp knife obviously be very very careful or the point of some scissors here crumbs and doilies we have this amazing thing which I believe is for actually probably something to have clothes maybe belts but it punches the hole out so I'm just gonna do that [Music] [Applause] all right so that's a nice hole and if you are doing lots of cakes I'd recommend having one of these for every size of cake that you're ever gonna do just just to be the template because it really does help finding the middle of your cake it's just very useful to have moving on swiftly so now we need to put the central pillar in now obviously the biggest cake is going at the bottom it's gonna be my big cake and I have ice that directly onto a cake drum and that is gonna be the cake board so this doesn't need to be lifted off the skateboard ever I also have a paper template here which I made earlier and to find the middle of this because we want to put the pillar in the middle obviously because we're then gonna use that as a Center for everything else so just go ahead and put your template right on top of the cake which is chilled by the way make sure your cakes or chills are they're much easier to handle and then put your pillar right in the middle and it's a good idea as you push down to twist as well it helps to make it continue to go in straight and once you've hit the bottom you can carefully take away your paper template and then you have your nice straight pillar in the middle and that is going to stabilize everything so you can move this bad boy around now the next thing to do is to put the supporting pillars in and these are gonna take the weight of all the other cakes so this is very very important there's a lot of things you can use some people like to go and use like bobbity straws and if you can get hold of those for free then by all means do they're pretty good these are actually specifically designed for this purpose so they are I got these from a cake decorating website and they're super strong and sturdy and they're really useful for this now hopefully you have given your cake a nice even level layer of buttercream or even sugar paste and if you put a spirit level on it it will be nice and straight but you know sometimes that's just not possible guys because working them so give it a level as possible when you're decorating it then have a good look around just to see if there is a higher point or a lower point so you want to look for the the highest side if you have one this one's actually pretty good because that's gonna be the height that we measure all the supporting peles against so grab one of your pillars or your Baba tees rules and we're going to put three in so using your central pillar is like the middle of a triangle and remembering that your cake is slightly smaller than this one put your first pillar in just somewhere in between the edge and the pillar so again just twist it as you push it down to help it to stay straight and once you hit the batter obviously you have now got a very large dowel in your cake which you don't want to have because this needs to support stuff so I've got my edible pen here and I'm going to mark a little line just above the surface of the cake because what we want is for the next cake to be supported by the pillars rather than the cake because you don't want to have any danger of it kind of squishing in any way so here we go okay so with that marked now you need to remove this pillar very carefully so I would also twist it back the other way just so you don't like drag any massive chunks of cake out in the process because this is now going to be our template for the other two pillars and I am going to be using a pair of secateurs which are these guys these are the things you've probably got in your shed for your gardening and they were also really handy for cake decorating if these are pretty sturdy things and scissors don't always cut it if you don't have literally cut it if you don't have a pair of secateurs you could use a little saw like a hacksaw or something but these are really handy and quick so now you then need to mark the dowel with this one to get them all the same length so now we have three identically sized pillars which we now need to put in the cake so put your first one back in and then put the other two in evenly spaced like a triangle but all my three pillars in now before I move on to stacking I want to make sure that everything else needs to be pillared so the middle tear of my three-tier cake also needs killers so they basically support the top case so once you have your three pillars before you put them into your cake just stand up against each other and make sure they are all the same size and if they're not just give them a little trim but these are all perfect so you might have seen already when you put your pillars in that some of them raised a little bit higher than the cake and that's absolutely fine that means that your dowels are level and maybe your cake isn't don't take it personally because we're gonna fix it all up and it's gonna look finely so what you need next is royal icing and I like to use royal icing to stick each cake to the next cake just because it dries really firm and yes I could really solid glue you could use buttercream but again if that softens it's not gonna really have the same sticking power so royal icing will always be my preferred option and you don't have to use a lot but I would I would say this is to make it a little bit stick so that it actually doesn't sort of ooze out the sides of your to sandwich cakes and I'm just using a flat pallet knife to put it on and I'm going to put a little bit on over the top of each pillar first of all just spread that around but make sure that you don't go past the area where your next cakes gonna be otherwise it will look really really messy but I think that's it so now comes the scary bit I mean it's kind of scary but once you do so you need to get this cake off this cake drum I'm gonna use a palette knife this one is a cranked palette knife just to give me a little bit of extra leeway and I'm going to run that under the entire cake just to loosen it so once you've loosened it from the board gently slide your fingers underneath so get rid of your palette knife and grab it with both hands and take it over to your cake and just feel with your fingers for the hole in the bottom and find your central pillar line it up with your hole and just lower it down gently it'll burst through the top but don't worry and once it's halfway down just gently release your fingers and let it fall so just tidy up any little bits that might have kind of burst out when you lowered your cake down and it's time to put the next one on we're gonna do it in exactly the same way but before you do just check that your central pillar isn't really high you don't want it to burst out of the top of your top tier because that's gonna really ruin things so mine's alright but if it's higher than the top then obviously just use your second toes again to just lick that the next bit so it's exactly the same [Music] now that went well I'm just pushing down using a little piece of greaseproof paper make sure it's not crinkled at all just so that I don't have fingerprints at the top of my cake and just to kind of stick it on even further that looks pretty good now there's a lot more to go on if there is fixings and holes to fill and drips to do let's get cracking hello welcome back so I've got my cake and I've put it onto a turntable now the reason I didn't start with this on a turntable is because well not only do I not need an extra five inches of stress and height to add to this equation also the turntable is a little bit wobbly so that is also stressed which I don't need so I have completed the stacking and then transferred onto the turntable and this is gonna really help with this last bit so it's not just the end to just put it on put one cake on top of the other as you can see we have some gaps and we have some raggedy edges and I'm going to show you two really neat tricks to fix those after make them look really good the first one is the simplest and that is simply the filling so I have some yellow buttercream exactly the same color as this top tier in a piping bag and I've got a nice Brown nozzle this is a number four but you could probably get away with a 2.5 or a three or anywhere between really and I'm going to start by filling that gap a little bit and then the next bit is really simple you want to use your finger or a paintbrush to smooth that out make sure you keep a clean cross next to you all the time so you can just wipe your finger or your brush it's a little bit like Ceylon when you do your bathroom sealant but it tastes a lot better so just use your paintbrush to smooth out that bit of extra buttercream you put on and remove any excess that is an incredibly satisfying thing to do I think you'll agree when you give it a go it's just so so fun especially when your tears are the same color and you get a completely flawless smooth join oh it's just really satisfying but there is another way of joining the two pieces and covering up any wrongdoings and that is by doing some piped beading and it's really simple and you use the same bag with the same piping nozzle again and it's very straightforward you start with a blob pull it over and then you have a little fish and then start your next blob in the middle of your tail of your fish carry on [Music] and once you're confident with it you can do all of that in one move [Music] and that is beautiful I think you'll agree and it really really easy and if you wanted you can even use like a small star nozzle to make it a little bit more fancy but I quite like the simplicity of this I put one last trick up my sleeve and that is to give the middle tier a drip just to tie all these colors together and just make it look even more awesome and I've actually done a drip cake masterclass how-to on my channel so please go and check that out I'll tell you how to make all the right consistencies of ganache and white chocolate and how to color your white chocolate be this amazing color pink and I'm going to go ahead and drip it right now [Music] so I've pipe all the way around with these lovely drips and now I'm just gonna fill in that gap between the drip and the edge of the cake actually loved this cake it's really rocking my world so hopefully that has answered some of your questions about how to stack cakes yes it can feel like the most stressful thing in the world but I promise you if you've done it a couple of times it won't do all that stressful anymore and once you have all these little tips and hints under your belt you should be all right so I look forward to seeing some of your stacked cakes over on Instagram and please use the hashtag cupcake Gemma or cupcake Gemma bakes so that I can see your work if you have any questions about this masterclass then please do pop them in the comments box below and I'll do

Billy in Kendall their young couple engaged to be married so we got to talk about the wedding cake so what are you guys thinking for the cake well one thing that you may not notice about us but we are actually professional Lumberjacks so go big rejoice Lumberjacks well we chop wood for a living we chop wood saw wood I do it for a living but we also compete almost every single weekend all over the country I've seen the one where they stand on top of log and it is choppa choppa choppa choppa Billy that's actually one of my best of them would it be cool that's the underhand chop we use a six pound axe and it's all four-time the fastest guy wins my specialty is single buck sawing and you have to cut through a log anywhere from 16 inches to 20 inches also for time so how did you guys get into that I studied forestry at the University and Hampshire and so I got into it through their college woodsman's team and then pursued it professionally and then Billy had graduated a year ahead of me she has the same school yeah yep and then he asked me well the the lumberjack equivalent of asking a girl out is I'm asking them to saw with you nonchalantly one day asked me if I would go train with him and if I would saw with him that was it you know since lumberjack sports brought us together we'd really like to have a cake that kind of says that yeah yeah actually one of the first gifts that Billy gave me for the first Christmas we were together is an axe so that's kind of like our symbol together I give my wife an axe you might hit me with it yeah Billy and Kendall really want the Kate to be about their sport something like a tree trunk maybe like an axe coming out I think it's gonna really represent lumberjacking I would love to see I mean again I've seen on TV but I get seen it live and like when we come to pick up the cake I mean you know we would love to bring down some of our equipment some wood and kind of show you guys what what we do I'll be awesome I would love that yeah I love the fact that you guys are rented a sport and you do it together and I can't wait till you show me how it's done yeah all right whenever I have a bride and groom I want the cake to represent them and if they're Lumberjacks and they want it to be predominantly about that and that's what we got to do we got to figure it out I'm gonna have Ralph make a board and we're gonna have a pipe going through the middle of the cake so we have something where we could attach the axe it's gonna kind of like stand up let me put some flavor in there now so pancakes so we're gonna add maple syrup to our buttercream which to me feels very lumberjack II never feel like doing that sometimes like going up to like the Yukon and become a lumberjack just go out there not have to answer to anybody I will love that to you the squirrels morale is gonna stack and fill this tree stump with vanilla cake maple syrup filling and toasted pecans for a little bit of crunch it's outdoors eats woodsy smells good he's a nice Pete constable Ralph and sculpt in the accident he's gonna get the wood grain by mixing light and dark modeling chocolate it works [Music] you know I never made a lumberjack slash wedding cake so I'm excited to do this I think it's gonna be fun maybe a couple different mouldings Debbie cools things over here a little bit like this they came up with this like pinching technique to give it like a real rustic barky look hold it up you know I wasn't sure if I was gonna do like a realistic stomp or something stylized I went with you authentically authentic stump one more should do it that's how you make a tree cake you know it if we put a ribbon on it then we could just finish the whole board with with just just brown or you could do like those little flowers that you did on that other cake you know the little ones that's cute just I think we should put some fudge maybe put some crunchies to make it look like a little dirt the only other thing we could do is it flat easy no it is nice for the ribbons would you look can I say my idea before we over the mouth eat me can I say one more thing for now okay if we put the water cool if you cover in potatoes I'm sorry I just had to say one more I'll leave [Music] this is pipe grass - time to get back to this lumberjack wedding cake we got to do it chop chop we decide that we're gonna make grasp on the board rather than dirt sometimes you got to go for something that's gonna look prettier just because these guys are Lumberjacks it's still a wedding what is these peoples names Billy and Kendall do it is just doing B ed k be hard K be hard K be hard K Roth is gonna carve in a little hard with Billy and Kendall's initials so it looks like you know like it was carved into a tree slide it in there you know so looks like it's under the bar that's a cute I liked it want to make the Rings in here if I put her in a turntable I could do yeah that's true I might even be cool yeah a comb a little bit of the top to kind of give it like the rings would be let's good put the axe on there and looking sharp now that made me laugh really hard I gotta say this tree stump looks awesome with the axe it really fits the theme you know we're looking at this cake and it's all finished and like it's just missing something you got a big like butcher knife let's sharks so I said you know would be cool some wood shavings so I take a little bit of modeling chocolate and I take a knife and I just start shaping it it looks like grated Parmesan cheese you know what it's that bad also it's fun

long to try out heavy hitters but it's never too late you Cheers it's [ __ ] delicious", "fVIclho0GoY": "[Music] yeah see i understand the purple lotus was started up you know quite different than i think a lot of other dispensaries and especially dispensaries in san jose were established it was just established by my by my wife and i was in a situation where i had a lot of money that i was coming into this with a huge investment or anything and just lost you know money doing in a business venture um it was kind of my first forte into business that lost a lot of money was credit card debt but we started up the shop with a very small amount of money about fifteen thousand dollars when i opened the shop i had you know just four jars of marijuana about a little less than two pounds of marijuana i mean this this place over here really set us off i mean you would have people flocking from all over this area to to come on a daily basis it became a community of people the landlord that i was leasing from was leasing to another dispensary upstairs so we had we had competition up there and all humility you know they were closed within about three months of us being there um you know we just my motto was to reinvest that product you know i sold the original product and then i made the sacrifice didn't hire anybody i worked for a year straight just myself right there every day all day and just put all the money back in the product and that increased business and so many people were such strong advocates because they saw what we were about which was first of all people love great cannabis they love great wheat so we had great weed at the good price and then we were good people we got more involved in the community and because people came every day we became you know they became part of our lives we became part of theirs also when we first moved in here i mean i would park up here every day and then at night time i would take the bud with me inside ikea bags for the first maybe three months because i didn't really have a good safe situation so i would take it with me at the end of the night bring all the cannabis back with me the next morning i said this was popping up here as much as i like to at the time say that they weren't you know people smoking people you know a lot going on up here in the parking lot we ended up needing to get a guard up here to ensure that everything was all cool everything was all cool but they came from every which way they came by car they came by bike scooter walking because these apartments right here and all this area around here you know the bus stops right there this was a community right here people are proud to say that they came here to jackson you hear people say oh i've been coming here since jackson great great great memories from this place fought hard to stay here you know didn't work out but uh this will always be the original [Music] spot we barely squeaked into our next location over on lundy it was it was a rough move i mean it was not a successful situation at all it's very tough to get somebody to lease to us during that time it's not like now it's still very federally legal and people are really concerned we paid six months in advance and got the place over here and once again from day one we had issues um you know just especially in this place this has a shared uh it's an office building uh as a shared air conditioning unit by this time we were carrying a large supply of marijuana and uh the whole buildings just stunk like even though this is not far away people felt like it was far away so this was always a place where we were waiting for white road this is you know we had white road that we were building out while we were here so we struggled through this place they wanted to evict us from day one we fought through that and ended up staying for six months while the business i don't think grew a lot of customers during that time what we did is we grew a lot of resilience during that time we used to tell them hey uh you'll find this over by the loading dock you know you know that's i believe at one point we ran an extension cord from way over here down to the street just so that we could sit there and put a light out so that people could know that we could tell them that there's a light down there because it was so dark you would miss this because this is a building that closes at nighttime except for if you're selling wheat up here then it closes a lot later [Music] this was the nicest place we had built out beautiful place it was formally been a bar and we just made it really nice restored the bar had it all set up to serve it was really right in the middle of where at that point a good portion of our patient base was that opened up people were lined out everybody they were fighting to be the first person to say that they were the first person to come through the door um you know my mom came to pictures of all of us so happy to be opening up this great location we have been working for months to get it we didn't have a lot of money evicted from the other spot this other spot unlucky wasn't working out so you know we got this set up big day our biggest day ever still had the other location open but pushing most of the people down here feeling great eight o'clock sheriff's come tell us we need to close this it just happens to be this whole area is san jose and this corner right here out of all this area annexed to the county and the city had given us a business license for the address but it still fell underneath the county zone and the county at that time it had a ban on all cannabis activity even though san jose city allowed it this was a beautiful place we put all of our resources into and they closed this place down right here it was a big blow it hurt especially after only being open for about 10 hours [Music] you know 903 was was a blessing i didn't see it at the time but blessings come hidden and you know looking at the spot there's only about eight parking spots assigned to us but see how you can make that work especially with the employees and you know us needing parking we ended up uh leasing a little spot next door for parking um and making it work we put four or five security guards there at about a 50-yard uh uh distance and they just funnel people in and out in and out in and out it was a 4 20 weekend hey what year we moved in over there and uh it was actually it was a convention there's a big hemp con or something in town and uh we did 42 42.8 you know out the door and by that time we had built our our our venue up to 30 or 35 strains good bud 42 out the door and it you know it worked so well that we just kept it moving from there we just decided hey this works and we just kept on doing it and we kept on selling at 42.8 and it became just very popular we got to the point that it was you know we were running five six hundred people a day in through what was a 600 square foot retail sales floor with eight parking spots i'll tell you man one christmas day we're the only shop open man lined up from here all the way down to the head man waiting to get inside the

welcome to man about cake I'm your host Joshua John Russell and this week I'm tackling a hand-piped frame cake I'm going to build a three-tier cake with an inlaid diamond pattern and finish it with a hand piped border and some colorful sugar flowers let's do it [Music] okay to start we're gonna break down an 8-inch chocolate cake my favorite love chocolate cake what's your favorite cake let me know below chop this kind of hat this is a lot of layers I don't know if I'm gonna use them all but I like to have options and you guys keep the rest win-win garbage cake yeah yet Nate I'm so disappointed now we're gonna fill the cake with chocolate ganache so this is a new ganache recipe I like my ganache to be a little bit firmer this is a little bit more soft so it's spreadable right out of the buckets look at that delicious this recipe is all yours if you want it just click the I or you can go down there and get them in the description box and while you're down there hit subscribe we'll have you subscribe if you subscribe I know what does happen then you're part of the family well you can hit the notification bell and then that is when you get like the alert that I'm doing something stupid on YouTube we're gonna leave one for garbage cake yay garbage cake alright I'm gonna get this guy in the cooler then we'll cut them climb Cottam final coat let's go buddy [Music] all right now we're gonna cover the cake and a little bit of teal fondant I'm gonna roll this to an eighth of an inch thickness blues know what bird did that come out of it's like a robin's egg no Robin's eggs are very very pale this is like teal more teal or turquoise aqua well I actually have taught this cake a bunch of times live so I'm not going to show it live anymore because I'm giving it to you on YouTube when I normally teach this class live the colors are very like soft and muted but I had a student in Toronto that made this like really awesome Bollywood looking cake with all these bright colors the student thing was Johanna Romero so Thank You Joanna for the color story inspiration we're going bright with this one [Music] let's make a sugar rose so I've got a little bit of pale red gum paste we're gonna dust this a really vibrant red later but to take white to red is really hard so I'm gonna start with a base color we're gonna roll this out and we're gonna put it through the pasta machine so we can get the petals really thin get a little snow here but I just got to roll it so it'll go through on the one setting the dial on here okay let's feed it through lasagne that's two let's take it to like maybe a number four there's three it's getting longer four last one this is aggressive I don't need this much it just kept rolling out okay my scarf alright so we're gonna take our circle cutter and make our petals so we need one to wrap around and then we need three on the outside that's four because I know how to be mad that's the only math I can do okay so I needed four petals and I rolled out all of those oh I'm gonna make some more flowers so I'll still use it but I'm gonna put it to the side okay now we're gonna stretch our petals I'm actually gonna stress she's with my fingers I have a friend who is a cake designer and she told me this is the way she stretches her petals and it actually works really well so what you do is put a little bit of cornstarch on your fingers and then this will stretch them out this is gonna thin them make them a little more realistic because all rose petals are a little bit different they're not all circles and then I take my cell pin and just thin the very top now we're gonna glue it on to a cone so I have a styrene cone here that's kind of like the start of our bud that I just hot glue it on a wire tree and then we're gonna paint it with a little bit of flower glue this is just water and a little bit of tyler's powder it's a gets thick like a gel kind of like piping gel but thinner we're gonna coat the entire cone so we're gonna wrap it around covering the whole cone make it a nice little bud here like so alright now we'll add our three outside petals alright so we're gonna put a little bit of glue kind of in the corner here where it's gonna stick to the rose or first petal we're gonna tuck the second one into that one so it looks spirally like a rose so while I'm holding it I'm gonna go back and sort of glue and tuck the pebbles in I'm just kind of noodle it now we're gonna give it a little bit of life so I'm gonna take some of the petals here and sort of pull them back and then give it like a little pinch there we go that's our boys now little rosebuds you could keep going you could put five seven even nine petals you could wire some to the outside I'm gonna make some smaller ones so we're just up there now we're gonna make a second flower for the cake this one's gonna be more like a fashioned flowers just one that I kind of made up so I'm gonna start with this styrene sphere here and we're gonna paint it with a little bit of our gum glue maybe just the northern hemisphere right we're gonna dip it in glittery sugar JJ sprinkles you ready for this so that's gonna be the Center for our flower put that to the side and now we will roll out this purple color that I'm going to thin out and we're gonna wrap it like kind of like a monocular looking thing it's gonna look ranunculus Lee awesome that's so dumb I'm gonna take an exacto and kind of dissect it down the middle then I'm gonna do it in like a wavy pattern that way when we spin it around the flower kind of has some dimension to it so this is for two flowers I'll put this into the side for another flower now we're going to thin the top edge so I'm gonna take my cell pin and do it first and then they'll take this little guy and get some more detail in there okay now we're gonna go back with our ball tool and get a little bit more detail in here actually it's a little tall for me I'm gonna cut cut down a tiny bit put flower glue on the bottom here so we're gonna dust this later with a darker purple I'm keeping the glue just on the bottom edge because when I go to dust this later if there's a glue on a place where I'm gonna dust it then it's not gonna stick so I'm just gonna get the bottom edge and then we're gonna roll it up I'm not gonna worry about the bottom because I'm gonna put a K looks over this and then we're just gonna open up there we go now we're gonna stack the cake with bubble tea straws I'm gonna use a little bit of a lift here so this is just a piece of styrofoam that way we can put all our sugar flowers underneath the bottom tier [Music] now it's time to create our inlay design I created a template for you guys for the frame you can get it in the description box below so I printed it out and I'm gonna cut it out now I've got a little bit of pink fondant this is gonna be our frame Joshua this is the season finale this is the season finale it's the last one not forever though we'll be back in a few weeks tell us what you want to see for the next season and while you're down there hit subscribe he's got to say that why not you already down there OOP okay alright I'm gonna cut this out with an exacto knife all right and then I'm just gonna take my fingers and smooth the sides down this is where we'll pipe the frame around here so all this would be covered up but I want to kind of look a little more bulbous embossed if post is not the right word at all bossed is like when you create a design by pushing into something jeez Brandon okay I'm gonna put a little flower group on the back of this and it will stick to the cake all right now we're gonna add some texture I've got this texture mat I would have done it on the surface here but I do it on the surface here and then I put it up there and may warp a little bit so I'm actually gonna like lightly emboss the design and while it's on the cake I'll go back over it - with a Dresden tool but just to get my markings here kind of line it up so now that I've got the design kind of embossed in there I'm going to use my favorite tool in the world The Dresden tool on one end and a sticky tool on the other end I think we use this like almost every episode it's the best tool now we're actually gonna put some pearls where the different diamond pieces joined together but I'm gonna make it look a little bit like fabric all right and then I'm gonna come back and put in a little bit of detail kind of make it look like it's stretching fabric all right now it's time to pipe our frame I'm gonna free him pipe this with a small star tail [Music] all right that looks good so now we just got to let it dry a little pinochle now that our icing is dry to the touch we're gonna paint it gold with a little bit of gold dust hydrated with some vodka [Music] all right now I'm gonna highlight all of my little pincushion holes with a little bit of pink dust it's gonna make the color really pops [Music] all right so now our flowers are done on our leaves are done I also have some filler flowers because I really hate making filler flowers that I bought a couple of my dusted gold and a couple of them I added a little bit of extra dust just to make them a little bit brighter by the way if you guys want to learn how to make filler flowers I have a friend named Jacqueline Butler who makes really awesome flowers and she has a tutorial we'll put it in the eye or in the description box below let's decorate we underneath you mean or whatever the song is that you decide on [Music] our hand-piped frame cake is complete I think she turned out super awesome but it's the end of the season and I'm really sad but thank you guys for joining me every week thanks for commenting because I actually read those and thanks for subscribing so while we're on break guys find us on Facebook and find me on Instagram I'll put everything in the description box below and by the way while you're down there let me know what your favorite cake was of this entire season next season we got some really awesome things coming we're doing the Mac fan challenge and we're also doing James's wedding cake I cannot wait it's gonna be super fun let's eat mmm now that deserves to be framed I don't know why I'm jumping around trying to get the energy going I normally like mica nosh to be a little firmer but I figured maybe not let me start that over and this week we're nope we're tackling a hand-piped frantic that's a wrap you [Music]", "D_AvUQbcEWU": "hello everybody and welcome to totally trendy my name is Sam and we actually I just want to show you guys like the office cuz there's been a lot of change at the studio so we're finally getting there here's my desk and then this is gonna be my little craft table and then we have the cloud still hanging up there a little kitchen area and what what's that oh that's what we're doing today I know you guys saw those cakes over there and you're probably wondering oh what are we doing or you're not because you read the title of this video you guys know one of my co-workers her name is Catherine or you guys probably know her as Rose and she got married like a little over a year ago which is crazy what's also crazy is that I wasn't invited before we like get too upset insulting cat and I barely knew each other when she got married so I was not personally offended when I wasn't invited to the wedding but that's not gonna stop me from making her still feel bad about it Tanner woods Patrick they were all there but I wasn't fine I get it I have noticed this money-saving hack trend thing not only in like the wedding community of Pinterest YouTube Instagram etc we all know that weddings are expensive so this is a money-saving hack that you can use for wedding cakes birthday cakes any cake you want I am going to see today if I can take a store-bought cake or cakes and transform them into like wedding level cake you might be seeing the connection now about the story with Katherine I'm gonna give her a wedding cake because I don't know what the other one looks like this is one that I can be a part of so let's go look at the cakes that we are gonna try to make and pass off as like a wedding cake stuff we have this longer rectangle cake I think it's like an inch tall I don't know and then I got one the same height but square so my plan is to cut this one almost like the same size of this stack them on top of each other I think I'm gonna do square tears because apparently that's like how you know if someone is rich at a wedding is if the cake is really tall we'll figure it out but the great thing is that these cakes are already made and already iced so I didn't realize that these would have so many sprinkles was not really accounting for that I don't really want sprinkles on this wedding cake so I think I'm just gonna scrape them off because I already found things from Hobby Lobby and that I want to decorate this with so this is all gonna be on a budget these were $10 each I truly don't remember it was pretty affordable though all the videos I saw they made it seem really simple the goal of this video is to one yeah I get a cake that looks actually really cool for like a wedding birthday party whatever with as little steps as possible I'm trying to do this as someone who like does not decorate cakes I don't want to make this too complicated I am gonna scrape off the sprinkles cuz that's just like not the vibe of this cake oh wow honestly the sprinkles are scraping off pretty well so now we have that huge thing of sprinkles icing I've scraped most of it off of the sides and now my plan is to cover the sides with more just vanilla icing and then to smooth out this blue on top in kind of like an abstract form you'll see what I'm talking about I have covered the entire edge in white icing now I am actually I know I said I was just gonna smooth out it smooths all of this part out but I realized I should probably cut a part of this cake on top of this one first because I want it to kind of go in tiers seems like a decent plan right okay well let's get to it so that's about the size I'm going for like the first full chunk of this cake now how will I measure this from like there to there oh no you would think like Oh a ruler a measuring tape well guess what I don't have either of those things I am going to take one of these little cake boards there that line and then to light there what's that an even square I don't think so don't know this is kind of the amount that I'm gonna cut it out of this cake I'm just gonna set this on top like so and cut the cake [Music] so before I put this on the other cake I got these little wooden dowels just for three dollars from the craft store if you need to break a dowel like this snap it in half that's fine but sand it down then I picked up a nail file at the store and it sanded it down like perfectly because yeah you don't want people getting splinters from eating cake so I'm gonna put these in kind of like the center of this cake so I've officially stabbed to the other cake so now it is just time to transfer it over I really hope this is all gonna be worth it so far this is pretty simple but I want this to look as expensive as possible okay just lifted the cake oh I'm gonna kind of grab underneath and it's all moist and wet that's great and I'm just going to drop it are they going through there we go all right that's not bad that's not bad at all yay we did it we got a second tier on there so now obviously before I start decorating I just want to go ahead and make the other tiers I am now going to kind of like cut off this end to make it even and then probably take these two pieces and put it on top too but let's just construct this and I will see you guys next when I am done constructing so then we can get into the fun part which is all of the decorating and then finally giving Rose her wedding cake that you know I'm gonna get to be a part of I know it's not finished yet trust me this is the constructed cake now what I'm gonna do is just smooth all of this icing out fill in all of these little gaps ice all of it and then when I see you guys next it'll look so much better trust me welcome back to day two of me messing with this cake now I wanted to let the first little layer of icing really set we call that the crumb coat huh then I came back today and I wanted to like smoothen it out add like the final layer of icing and try to make it all white it didn't work out so we are just gonna cover our problems with fondant font fondant fondant I feel like any time I say fondant and everyone's like oh yeah nothing is a fondant but we're just gonna cover this entire thing because it's like another just easy way to make everything to look way more expensive like that's so smooth and pretty so we're just gonna do this to all of the tiers so I just finished covering it and fondant obviously didn't do this in the most even of ways but this is where my true skills come in I have a bunch of greenery and flowers and even some luster dust if you don't know what luster dust is it's essentially just edible dust you'll see it'll really elevate this I think now we just need to kind of like try and hide this mess [Music] [Music] it's time to give Kat her wedding cake guys I think it turned out really good considering that this was originally two cakes from Walmart I'm going to get it set up in the kitchen and then have her come over I'll tell her some lie to get her over here it is all set it is hey Kat so I was just taking a trip down memory lane with all of the viewers talking about all the fun we've had here on totally trendy and well remember what I wasn't invited to your wedding I know like I get it do you I get it we were not friends men I know but I just like you know wasn't there so I don't really know what everything and that looks like and come with me see or do you know what's happening cuz I'm all right I feel like I'm being pulled in what is it is it Kat Thank You Mia Sam did you make that I did it's a wedding cake dude are you this is actually two cakes from a Walmart cut and stacked on top of each other you know wedding cakes can be really expensive birthday cakes can be really expensive the total of this was 50 bucks wish I minded my wedding now yeah I don't want you you could have had this well enjoy your cake thank you that's you're really late wedding gift so there you have it you definitely can turn a store-bought cake into something a little more fancy obviously it'll take a little bit more time and dedication but I'm really happy with how it turned out I think it's really cute really pinterest e and grand total is only 50 bucks and that's a lot less expensive than getting like a custom-made birthday cake or wedding cake for sure I highly recommend trying this if you do it tagged me and Instagram at high five totally trendy so I can see it I like it well maybe repost it thank you guys so much for watching I will see you guys in the next", "10BUWA5B6to": "listen i've been seeing these videos been getting recommended to me of people taking

difference between edible paper or regular paper so for a while like i was just eating paper um hello editing me yeah um can you just cut to when we have all the icing off of the cake and scraped off and everything yeah yeah yeah okay thank you this is as good as it's gonna get i think this is all the frosting i was able to kind of salvage from it we tried our best here okay also chaz got bored

faster before this collapses everywhere does it look exactly or alike or what i mean did we waste twelve hundred dollars or what yeah but you know what i mean i mean technically we got our wedding cake for 600 because we got a black broad idea on it so we kind of lucked out with that also i know we didn't do like the lace bottom we only have three layers so we just did the first three okay we forgot to cut the middle layer into a hexagon i like completely forgotten i put the fondant on already but let's be honest i wasn't gonna be able to do that anyway this is my great value wedding cake

"xSagsP9hLyI": "hey guys so today I get to work with genius kitchen again they asked me to create Megan Merkel's wedding dress and turn it into adult cake so that's all we're doing today did you guys watch the ceremony I'm in Los Angeles so I had to be up at 4:00 I was a little late though I woke up at 5:00 because I was just too sleepy I loved the ceremony I think Megan merkel looked gorgeous so let's get started let's [Music] create this cake the first thing I did was bake my cake in my Wilton's doll cake pan now I'm just using a lemon box cake and I had to use two boxes of lemon cake or you can use like an original recipe I see you over there being an actual baker with your tested recipes you do you good job I've had time to test any of my recipes so I'm just using a box cake now leveled my cake in my cake pan and then I just removed the top as well as a heating rod in the middle of the cake just make sure that it bakes evenly because the middle is so thick that's what she's I flipped my cake over and sliced it into three equal layers I read that their wedding cake was a lemon elderflower cake in elderflower I've never heard of an elderflower I think it's when you like go into an elderly woman's garden and you pick as many flowers as you can before you get caught and then you run home and then you just sprinkle all of those flowers into your cake what is another flower small white flowers that grow on the elderberry bushes oh now with a round cookie cutter cut a circle out of the top layer of cake big enough so that my dolls legs could fit into it and then I started to stack my cake they using a pastry bag I added some buttercream in between each layer of cake and just spread it out using an offset spatula my buttercream recipe is really simple just one part butter to 2 parts powdered sugar and then the reap arts of love Megan and Harry seems so happy even in their interviews it seems like genuine happiness and love I'd be so happy for them if I wasn't so lonely now I just continued stacking my cake adding buttercream in between each layer then I gave my entire cake a crumb coat and then placed it into the fridge for about 30 minutes just so I think it's stiff enough after took it out of the fridge I realized that the dress doesn't have as much volume at the bottom so I took a serrated knife and just started to shave away the science I've tried to be as true to like this shape as I could there's even less volume than what I'm actually like shaving away but I wanted to make sure there was still like a good amount of cake using my serrated knife as well as my sidekick pair knife that odd named meatball I cut out some grooves and slits into the sides of the cake so I could give this dress a little bit of texture the design of this dress is extremely simple which means that I couldn't use like more fondant to create some fabric texture the one layer of fondant that I added on to this dress had to do that on its own my favorite thing about the royal wedding are all of the hats they're so extra where's my hat let me go get it there we go oh I should have been wearing this the whole time all of those hats looked super expensive and this was so much money you guys I used probably about like $6 at the 99-cent store not recreating this hat for this video I should have just snuck into the wedding with this hat I could have been chilling next to Oprah and one of those pews once I gave my cake a crumb coat for the second time I took my Barbie which was a soccer player Barbie plunged her legs into the middle of my cake and I only cut a hole into the top layer of cake because her legs are really thin and the rest of the cake just sort of supported her body now this cake only goes up to her waist so I filled the gap between her legs and her waist with some white fondant using my fingers and some sculpting tools I just blended the fondant into the rest of the cake now for the top of the dress I added a piece of fondant just wrapped it around her waist leaving her collarbone exposed I was just trying to copy the style the dress as much as possible and then again I just blended the bottom of it to the rest of the cake and I didn't even worry about the back of the dress because I knew it'd be covered by her hair now I wrapped a very large piece of white fondant around the rest of the cake and just hid the fondant seam at the back in one of the grooves I created now using some magic sauce vodka I just blended the bottom piece of funding into the fun and that's around her waist that way it'll look like one piece the way that it is on the actual dress just pushed my fondant into the grooves I created with some sculpting tools to make it look like fabric I wrapped a small piece of fondant around each arm and just follow the design of the dress making sure that her wrists were exposed and then the top of it left her shoulders exposed and when I'm creating a sleeve for a Barbie doll I always take the arm I bend it the way that I wanted to look on the dress and then I work with it that way when you place a fabric on you don't have to move it as much you just have to turn it down I can't stop staring at myself that once I finish with her sleeves I took my exacto knife and very carefully just removed the pink ribbon as she was wearing then using an old doll crown that I had lying around because apparently I'm some sort of a doll collector now and some fabric tool I gave her of and voila my meghan merkel wedding doll cake was complete oh I thought that she looked stunning in her dress and she wasn't even wearing that much makeup she just had this like really natural looking glow I feel like the world that we live in right now is so divided but like for a few hours on Saturday I felt like I was just watching this couple build a bridge Jeannie's kitchen thank you so much for asking me to make this cake I'll leave all of their social media links in my description box so you can head over to their YouTube channel and subscribe I feel like I'm gonna be doing a lot more with them so fingers crossed I hope you guys enjoy this I hope you're ready for one more doll cake I was already planning on releasing a doll cake for this week but this video is kind of a surprise and it took the place of that doll cake which means Friday I'm going to be releasing my Princess Leia doll cake in honor of the solo movie I made this cake a long time ago and it's finally being released I love you guys and I'll see you very soon please", "oKHilQbo64c": "[Music] a [Music] [Music] a", "lZ8s5sZIr8U": "hi everyone in this video I'm going to ice and stack a three-tier buttercream cake and this bottom tier is a 12 inch round I'm just using a traditional buttercream to ice that as you can tell I'm just kind of throwing it on the sides not too concerned about it being perfectly smooth I am gonna go back and add a texture to this cake so that's why I'm not too concerned about it I'm using a cake spatula here to pull in those top edges of icing and hopefully bring it a little smoother towards the center and now I'm gonna use a large acrylic cake scraper from cake safecom which is one of my favorite tools and I'm gonna scrape the sides B I love how tall it is cuz it really gets edge to edge on every single tier and again I'm gonna continue to smooth this out until it's as level as I want it to be and then I'll go back and add the texture and you'll also see me using an actual level I'll lay that in the center of the cake to make sure it's nice and level so that every tier says perfectly straight and there isn't any kind of topsy turvy look to the cake and I'm gonna do that to every single tier you're also gonna see me cut some dowels I just use simple plastic dows from Amazon and you're gonna see me cut and measure those here shortly [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] now I'm going in with my angled small cake spatula and adding the texture I'm pulling up at an angle so that the lines aren't perfectly straight up and down they are slightly at an angle to the right almost a diagonal look the customer really liked the idea of this it's a little bit more modern than what you normally see on a texture but I like it cuz I think it that it adds a little extra height to your cake so again I'm pulling almost straight up but then I slightly go to the right and it just is a little bit of an angle all the way around the cake and then what you get done those little pieces that are kind of coming up toward the edge those little like texture pieces I do smooth some of those out because you don't want too many of those and then once you're done then you're gonna stack the other two tiers and my other two tiers do not have a texture they are smooth buttercream the second tier you'll see when I go to ice it that it actually is a little see-through like it's not a perfect icing but that's okay because I actually go back and paint that with a luster dust and it covers up any imperfections [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] on this second tier this is the 9 inch round and you're actually gonna see me go back and try to smooth this out over and over again and I'm really just trying to level it for some reason sometimes when I go to ice a cake or a certain tier it just does not want to cooperate no matter what I do so you actually saw me going back at height and a little bit of icing to the extra on top and trying to make that a peer level and now I'm going back I'm having issues with the edges of the cake so no worries if you have issues with one particular cake sometimes that just happens it is very frustrating but usually you can make it work so just continue to go back scrape down where it's too tall and I see where it's too short and eventually you'll get a smooth mostly level cake it's not always perfect but usually you can get it enough but it will appear nice and level and normally when you're doing a wedding cake depending on the decorations and depending on the customer depending on the style of the cake there's a lot of things to consider but if you're adding flowers and there is one side that you feel like is just slightly off you can usually cover that up now it does not mean you can cover up a completely unlevel cake but if there is a slight edge or corner that you just feel like will not cooperate with you you can normally cover up those small imperfections with your decorations so I finally got it to where I think it'll work and I still I'm adding more icing to make it nice and level so you see it really was an issue it was so frustrating but eventually and you'll see in the end it worked out just fine [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] now this will you see me using here is what I use moments like this when I am so frustrated I can't get the cake level it's not ideal to use it on cake that's already stacked like this but because my bottom tier was textured I felt like I couldn't damage it too much it actually clicks into a certain height at whatever you want and it just goes around the entire cake forcing your cake to almost level itself to give you a nice smooth edge and you can see I don't know how many times i've reaiized at the top of that cake and then scraped it back off and redid the top edge and scraped it back off it was so so frustrating you're also gonna see me go back once I finally get it halfway leveled and where I want it to be I go back with a couple of Eva paper towels one in each hand and just kind of go around the top edge of that second tier really just I was just trying to create a crisp edge and kind of show that nice smooth edging instead of it looking like it was off center or unlevel in any way [Music] [Music] [Music] here's what I was referring to with the two paper towels I'm just barely pulling those edges together and I'm I wouldn't even say maybe even pulling just barely pressing on the edges both on the side and the top forcing it to have a more crisp look to it because I really want it to be nice and crisp on the sides and really come to a nice clean finish so when I went back and painted it it didn't show even worse imperfections or look shadowed on certain areas if that makes any sense and there's top tier you can see is just as smooth as well but I actually went back and added some fondant work to this top tier once I got it all stacked make sure to add that Center skewer all the way down through three tiers and then after I got it stacked I went back and added that rose gold painted luster you see here and the lattice work out of fondant on top thanks for watching [Music] you [Music]", "fHcm5JX_ax4": "hello and welcome to Crimson's early dates cute where today we're making something super duper special we're doing a five tier wedding cake for a very special couple and they have given us a really fun brief and when couples give us briefs for their wedding cakes there's a lot that goes into planning it so Sally's been very busy planning this cake and I think it's gonna look awesome what are you done yes so started with the brief which was past all rainbows and glitter so that's pretty untraditional but awesome and it's the kind of thing that we just love doing here it comes in daily since we're not that traditional with our wedding cakes I don't think and so started with a kind of sketch coming up with different ideas and then because it's really hard to actually visualize what it's really gonna look like from a drawing we've mucked it up on some grease prepare just so we can match the colors later on when we get to it using actual buttercream yeah actual buttercream orangs glitter everything that we're going to use basically so that we know exactly what it's going to look like and we've also got a massive load of different flavors as well after we want to get the rainbow in there so we've got to tease it gonna be rainbow it's got chocolate and white chocolate and rods we layer we've got salted caramel and chocolate and lemon as well hmm so you're gonna get a bit of everything at this wedding so yeah bet you wish you were coming I wish that I could stick around to help but I've got loads to do today so Sally it's gonna carry on this amazing cake and you're gonna hang out with her and see what's up I'll see you later feeling like thanks right let's get going come on so Rudy got my 12 inch rainbow cake and my 10 inch chocolate and white chocolate cake in the fridge chilling out with their crumb coats so I'm gonna move on to my middle tier which is a chocolate and salted caramel and remember because this is a stacked cake there needs to be a board the exact same size as the cake so I've got my 8-inch cake board here with a hole in it we need to put a pillar all the way through it as well so this is eight layers of chocolate and salted caramel sponge alternating between the two it's one of our sort of old cakes here at crumbs and boilies it's been on the menu since the very beginning because it's just such a winner so the best part about this cake is that every other layer has a pool of salted caramel in it so I'm just scooping out a little hole so my caramel to go in and then I'm going to pour it in right so that's my last layer of salted caramel and chocolate now I'm just gonna give it a quick Karma go I'm gonna do it in white so that we've got a nice base to use later for our rainbow design and I'm gonna get it in the fridge and then we'll move on with the next layer of cake which is lemon meringue and that's gonna have four layers of amazing lemon sponge full of zest and juice but lemon buttercream meringues and lemon curd all of which is made fresh every day of course and again this is another classic flavor [Music] so that's the four bottom layers of our five-tier cake down and gets in the fridge and then the top one is our little rainbow cake so - but they're so hard to ice when they're this small and this cool but I'm gonna give it my best shot right so that is all five tiers we've got 12 inch 10 inch 8 inch 6 inch and our little 4 inch on top they all just need to chill out in the fridge with their crumb coats and then we can start from the bottom to the top decorating so we'll start with our 12 inch rainbow cake okay so this is our enormous 12 inch rainbow cake which is going to be decorated with these really lovely pesto hearts here there's going to be a lot of hearts to cover this so I have enlisted the help of the lovely Rosie here who's gonna start cutting the hearts out and the reason we cut them out now is because we need them to stick to the shape of the cake which is ever to see slightly curved if we did this in advance there'd be too hard and it wouldn't sit flush with the cake first of all we just finished replace them around the bottom just to see how many we need because I want to make sure that we don't have like a big gap at the end okay so now we can just start sticking them on and this might take a little bit of time [Music] so my final two hearts are going on and that did take a long time and we calculated 180 hearts went on this case there it is there's a little gap there for something special which to see at the end but now it's on to the next year so I'm gonna pass that to Nicky and roses giving me this one thank you so this is a 10 inch cake and it's four layers of chocolate sponge with white chocolate icing and rice resource and we're going to decorate this one with white icing and then use these really beautiful pastel rainbow sprinkles and a pick up a little handful of firms and brush my hand upwards along the Cape so [Music] at the moment you can see it's quite a big divide between sprinkles and nun sprinkles and I want to look make it look like this sprinkles kind of fading outwards so I'm actually just gonna throw the sprinkles at the sides of the cake now we've got the bulk of the sprinkles on I'm gonna go around and put these super-special massive jumbo chunky gold strands on so that tear felt relatively easy to ice with the sprinkles the next two tiers the 8 and the 6 inch they're going to have a full rainbow ombre go across the two whole tiers so I need to start by making 10 rainbow colors [Music] that's my 10 colors made and now it's time to apply them to the cake I've got five colors per cake so my 8-inch is going to go from this really nice purple through to the mint green so I'm just sort of gently blending each color so that it's a bit more of a smooth transition between each one not like a really sharp line [Music] that's the bottom half of the rainbow done and now we can recover so what is left to do now is our tongue in an orange cake so first of all we're going to cover this in a nice smooth layer of white buttercream and then we're gonna make it glittery but service league Lister was in our brief I'm going to start by spraying it with this metallic pearl ice spray [Music] and now for actual glitter I think that's suitably glittery so I'm going to have a quick clean down and then we can start stacking this cake [Music] okay so this is our five finished cake but obviously it's not much of a tiered cake yet so now is the hard and scary part so because this is such a big cake we're actually not gonna stack the whole thing here we're gonna do some of it on site so now I'm just gonna stack my ten my twelve my ten and my eight and I'm gonna take the six on the floor with me so in the star by putting the pillars into the cake because obviously we can't just put cake on top of cake because it'll just completely collapse and Gemma did a few weeks ago and a master class on how to stack cakes so she'll put that in the description box below and if you're interested you can go and have a look at that video at another time I'm just marking on the top of my pillar with an edible pen obviously where the top of the cake comes to and then I'm just gonna cut this pillar and I'm going to measure four more exactly the same height of it before I put my five pillars in I'm just putting this one long pillar through the center of the cake and that's going to go up through the next cake as well to help it stay together [Music] and now before we can put the cake on top I'm just going to spread some royal icing around it just going to act like a glue it's really great because it dries super super hard which means that the cake on top it's not going to go anywhere so I'm just releasing the cake with a big cranked pallet knife and then get my hands right under it's as a board under there remember and now I need to try and get it over here so now it takes nice and firm I can get on with filling in some of these gaps that we've got from stacking them and I'm just going to do that with some buttercream some sprinkles and I've got some really pretty custom meringues that I made here the case that's everything packed up Cakes all in parts and we're ready to take it to the venue in the morning to set out so I'm back at the kitchen and it's the day of the wedding so before I leave I'm just going to make sure that I've got everything because obviously I've got my three layers already stacked here then I've got the two smaller tools that just need to go on top so I don't want to get to the venue and realize that I haven't got enough equipment so I make a nice long list of everything I need and beforehand and I'm just going to run through it so I've got things like every possible size pallet knife you could ever imagine lots of spatulas some gloves blue roll hand wipes because you never know what's going to happen you know fingers crossed it's all gonna go smoothly but you don't want to end up in a situation where something goes wrong and you don't have the tools to fix it so top tip for me is to just take everything that you think you could need like even more pillars bowls and piping nozzles and toothpicks some piping bags and apron of course we don't get messy and extra sprinkles so hopefully I've got it all and just need to get all of this into the van and then we can head off [Music] so we've got to the venue and luckily the cake is in one piece and it's looking great so now we only need to do get it out the box get it in position and then we can start setting it up so [Music] although I've got left to do is put the finishing touches on and I'm just going to put lots of meringues around this top tier and in the join here and then I think we're done [Music] so that's it that's our finished wedding cake I think it fits the brief of past all rainbows and glitter perfectly I absolutely love it and I really hope that Tamsin and Jamie the bride and groom are going to love it too I hope you guys enjoyed watching this seeing how we do our wedding cakes their outcomes and doilies Gemma we'll be back next week with another video so she'll see you then bye [Music]",

beautiful bling wedding cake stamp I looked that stand up and it cost $300 for a 16 inch one so I recreated my own and it came out really nice it looks really expensive really blingy and shiny plus my stamp can rotate so I want to show you how you can create your own wedding cake staying like this 420 bucks Czech descent so after examining this piece this looked a lot like a wall mirror to me would have really deep framed so if I could find a simple inexpensive mirror that was shaped like this I would be halfway done while I was out searching I couldn't find any mirrors that fit the description but there were a lot of interesting clocks with really deep frames and then bingo I found just what I was looking for a 16 inch round with the perfect base for my stand now this as a mirror would have been perfect but it was only ten dollars so I can figure out how to make it work so to recreate my stand I'm using this West clock 16-inch wall clock that I found that Ross a silver metallic poster board that I got at Hobby Lobby not a regular price for this was $4.99 but I used a 40% off coupon so it was just three dollars Hobby Lobby did have other metallic posters for just a dollar and some change but not as brilliantly shiny as this one and I wanted to have a mirror finish I'm using a foam board poster you can pick this up at Dollar Tree also from Dollar Tree you'll need about three rows of diamond robbery and to cake pans now because I don't want the clock to show I'm gonna start by taking this apart I'm turning this over to the back and I'm removing all the small screws when you remove the back be careful to keep track of all the screws and set them aside next I'm going to turn my clock upside down and trace the face of my clock on top of the metallic poster board then cut the circle out I'm also cutting a circle out of my foam board but I want to make this circle one-inch around smaller than the metallic circle so that it'll fit inside my clock since there's a glass piece on top of this and the inside of the clock is hollow I want to have a pattern so that the glass piece will have support in case there's a lot of weight on top of it so with the rest of the foam board I'm cut in pieces and I'm inserting them inside the clock and I'm making three layers of foam padding underneath the foam circle that I cut out I want everything to fit inside and be pretty much level with the top face of the clock so now I can put everything back together I'm gonna put my silver circle on top and then my glass piece make sure you clean the glass on both sides and remove all the fingerprints and dust now putting this back together is not as easy as taking it apart you have to make sure the screw holes from the inside line up with the holes on the outside since I won't be able to see this when I turn it over I'm gonna use a ruler so that I can mark where one of the screw holes is right on the edge of the cover then I can place my finger on that dot and line it up with the hole at the bottom you should feel it lock into place and as long as it doesn't slide back and forth it should be in the right holes then you can turn it over and put the screws back in now it's time to bring this up using a hot glue gun I'm gonna glue a roller Diamond wrap ribbon around the side of the base starting at the top edge right before it starts to curve to take care of the curve edge I'm going to cut the strip in pieces I'm cutting four rolled pieces then I'm going to hot glue those pieces around as a contour it to the shape of the curve and try to line the Diamonds up to the rows of the Diamonds below it now I have a really beautiful cake stand with a blingy diamond base metallic rim and a mirror like surface and after the wedding's over I could always take it apart and use it as a very blingy beautiful clock now I'm not sure if you want your cake to rotate but you can very easily turn this into a rotatable dessert tray and all you need for this is two cake pans now I know you've all probably seen the lazy susan trick where you take two cake pans and you put marbles in one of them and the top one will rotate on top of the other well you don't actually need marbles to have the pans rotate if you just place one pan inside the other the top will rotate and I like to slow smooth motion of not having the marbles in it so to make this a rotatable stand I'm going to glue the rim of one pan to the bottom of the piece but if you're going to use this for your wedding cake or something heavy I would use a strong glue like e6000 but since I am not having a wedding and I want to turn this into a blingy clock afterwards I'm going to just use some hot glue to glue this piece on right now so that I could pop it off later for the bottom pan I'm going to cover the sides with Diamond wrap starting at the very bottom of the pan and since it angles in a little I'm going to cut strips so that it'll go around nicely now you can just sit your stand inside the lure cake pan and just that easy you'll have a rotatable dessert tray you just have to remember that this is two pieces when you're picking it up but it will definitely make a spectacular cake stand or a really beautiful rotatable dessert tray at your wedding or event so thank you guys so much for all your facebook posts and suggestions I am looking through all of them and you guys have some really great ideas so I am going to try to do as many of them as possible for me to do someone asks if I could do a wedding series so for the rest of this month I'll try to create as many bling

this rustic wedding cake tutorial you\nwill see this three-tiered cake construction from creating the sheer\nlook, doweling, stacking, decorating with fresh flowers, and finally the bride and\ngroom cutting their first slice. Hi it's Lorelie. Welcome back to my channel and\nif it's your first time welcome to wedding cakes for you cake tutorials. If\nyou want to build your skills and confidence to create beautiful cakes and\nmemories subscribe and ring the bell. Starting with very cold or frozen cakes\nis key. These cake layers were baked the day before, cooled, wrapped and then\nfrozen. This seals in the freshness and makes the cake much easier to handle. A ring or damn of buttercream is piped\naround the outside edge of each layer and then filled, unless of course you are\nusing just buttercream. This is coconut cream cheese filling with English lemon\ncurd and fresh Raspberries. Seal the fresh fruit with more\nbuttercream and cream cheese frosting. Oops I did the opposite here I started\nwith lemon curd, but that's okay, it still works as long as all flavors are there\nwith each bite. Wrap your filled cakes and then\nrefrigerate or freeze. This center tier needed a little\ntrimming and had some large crumbs. Ideally you want that nice brown color\nbut for this tier it just wasn't happening. You can still achieve a rustic\nlook. First you want to cover your cake with\nbuttercream and then scrape gently using a bench scraper. Use a spatula to smooth the edges and\nthe top keeping in mind that most of the top will be covered by the tier above.\nRepeat that whole process for the other tiers. If you guys want to see the live\ndemonstration of the very beginning of this cake i will leave an end card for\nyou to click through and watch. There's always good tips within a LIVE STREAM The bottom and the top tier had a really\nnice brown crust to work with. This is a great example of the rustic\nlightly fasted natural look that so many brides are asking for. You can use a pan to mark the cakes for\nbetter placement and plastic straws. Although they are becoming outlawed in\nmany states, are the easiest of dowels and they work beautifully. You can use parchment paper cut to fit\nto help prevent the cardboard round from sticking too much to the tier below. You\ncan also use coconut or graham cracker crumbs. A sharpened wooden dowel works great to hold all three tiers together. Gently press and turn the dowel until it pokes\nthrough the cardboard. You may want to use the cardboard that already has holes\npre-made or you can make your own pre-made holes. In this case I used a\nhammer to make sure that the dowel went all the way through the base which is\nmade out of foam board. Tip number 366 leaf makes a really pretty\nborder and it's super simple. A pearl round tip would also be really nice with\nthis cake. You basically just want to cover the cardboard edges. This is my Italian\nmeringue buttercream. I use it for everything. If you're having trouble with\nItalian meringue buttercream or Swiss or French or any kind of style of\nbuttercream, check out my master buttercream course\non Teachable. The link is below underneath the video. The bride and groom chose Hydrangea and a little greenery for their rustic wedding cake design. The florist provided\nthese for me so they would match her bouquet. Praying to the cake gods as we\nalways do before we start the car. We got this!!!  Enjoy the rest of the cake\ndecorating.

yours now [Music]", "Are8_PlW1Fg": "hi I'm Dan Stringfield I'm with twigs bakery in San Diego California and we're going to talk a little bit about professional wedding cakes versus like a wedding cake somebody would do at home the main difference between a professional wedding cake and a home cake is just the the design detail that a professional can do rather than most home people are comfortable doing also just the size of some cakes I think you know if you're working at home you know there's a lot of equipment you would have to buy you know 16 inch pans 18 inch pans I'll know a lot of people really want to make that investment for a one-time cake whereas you know a professional bakery would have those in stock all the time and one of the great things about going to professional is you can get something that's sort of unique for your wedding a lot of people would like to do something that's based off of their invitation this cake here for example this was taken off of their invitations their invitation sort of had these red leaves with a brown stripe down the side so basically we just use that as an inspiration to come up with this cake that was unique for their wedding this little cake here was done for an Indian bride for the wedding everybody had all the bridesmaids the bride and henna so the cake is sort of taken off from the henna design that they did on their hands right now these days square cakes are really really popular and last year silver was one of the big colors for weddings so this is a design we do quite a quite a bit actually this sort of this sort of scroll and lace design with a triple Swiss dot you know that's something that you know a home decorator may have a little bit of trouble and executing but it's something we've done a lot you can do pretty quickly so the great thing about having a professional do your wedding cake is that you can take some confidence that they've done many cakes in the past because it can be pretty intimidating to do a wedding take the first time but if you go with somebody who has experience you can sort of rest easy knowing that your cake will arrive in one piece and look beautiful", "eFWV11RjbhE": "[Music] hi we are doing a lot of wedding clicks every day some of these others is really unusual like either they are just a very interesting shape for something really large in size and one of those orders came just a few weeks ago from our regular customer Maria and her mum is Helen and money are getting married and they want to have something really special something this large I like to take the opportunity during this event during this doing this cake making this cake I want to share with you all those individual sessions individual part of the production with you and hopefully that it will be something that you can enjoy first of all maybe talking about this kind of wedding cake we make sure that we have to follow up at customer request this they cannot exactly describe what they're looking for but they can give me sort of informations that I can start working with it first of all the size they won't have it at least a meter but not too high not not more than maybe 1 meter 10 they want to have the color concept of white ivory probably more dominant and a little bit of gold but also not too strong and they like to have lots of loves on the cake so a cake surface is a certain amount of kick surface we have but I cannot just really fill up the everywhere with flowers I have to still come out with it instead of just checking the flowers on the cake I have to come up with a certain concept and some certain design that it's really match together with it with the concept of the cake and they like to have the cakes in different height sort of like they're not everything in the same height different in different height and the biggest challenges this reading is happening in Adelaide we are in gold coast so it's about 2,000 kilometers so I have to be very careful what I'm designing not to forget what they are looking for and I hope to also be careful every single component can be packed separately and I have to decide what I'm doing here at home and what I'm going to do over there after dinner I would like to make a drawing which is not fully in detail but when I look at this drawing I want to see the actual concept I want to see the heights of the cake and I can refer and measure this drawing where do I put flowers whether I type my decorations etc it's a this cake is asked to prepare for 300 portion but I will exceed a little bit more because if they're looking for such a size number of portions then it comes in the second important thing that is we have to disappear to reach the height even that goes over the number of people so I have to start from the heart so as you see I put over here one spot there one spot here that is one meter all right so it has to stay around this area that's the table table surface tabletop that's begin end of the cake I like to have an oasis in this area about this size that I can put my flowers about this much then the top tier will be definitely about 150 millimeters something it's very very roughly and after that we're going to see maybe we can just make it thicker lines this clip will be about 125 height so that's the one the top tier and after that I will put 200 this will be awesome 25 then I need to 250 you know if I put 250 that means the cake will end up probably time is 60 times 70 because we're going to put all those all those icing and everything on it [Music] that's the three layers of of the first three days then comes the 300 as I remember that the customer wants their different heights I'll do this one a little bit lower maybe about 10 cm then I like to start from the base now I will have an extra 5 centimeter that will be my board I believe the square board and probably should be around around 65 for comfort to decode the legs will be just stretching out the legs will be stretch into the corners you will see very soon okay that's the center of the take approximately then I will have I think I should make another at least at least two layers here which is about completing the six layers first year I want to make it about 125 feet gate and that should be around 40 [Music] forty and I like the one layer here it's in gold-plated in between so I'm almost there but as you see that is the height is not correct so I'm going to stretch this one a little bit longer there this one got a little bit more and then this one goes here this one's a bit lower all right this is my cake basically the main shape of the cake is already dead okay now we're gonna use peonies you're going to use large peonies beyond your roses we're going to use a small little flowers it's a Phillips so what I like to do is I'm going to make imaginary that I'm going to arrange the flowers on it first so this is going to be no flowers there will be a gold level I'm going to use 24 card code go which is come from overseas edible 24 craft code it will be plated on the cake alright what I like to do they have to request one request is they're using a lot of flowers another request is having ornaments like a sort of like a vintage style and also a little bit of gold touches so what I will do I will start from here turn around to the flowers exactly opposite side I'm going to start the other decorations go opposite of it and I just end up somewhere around here so the flowers on the top will be look like the let me do students with a black point moment so this is the peonies s is smaller this [Music] I don't have to do it exactly I just want to see that you main shape okay some little flowers is a pillars [Music] okay then I will stretch this one to this area I'm gonna go like this go behind go here again go behind and go here again so this is my flower bouquet will be so let me just draw this one quickly by doing that I can also count the count flowers approximately decide how many flowers I need all right this is going behind starting you again [Music] and then flowers actually sitting out here and then coming from this corner games and this bit will be a little bit more sort of like a little bats finishing off [Music] all right the main shape of the cake is all right there that's the main thick [Music] [Music] and this is my boat [Music] that's gold but that's gold but alright then what I like to do I want to put some ornaments which is I'm going to after a touch up with the gold so it comes from here today so I don't see it from its comes from behind and comes from here so it is actually starting from here and turning like this alright turning behind again like this and then starting coming in okay in this level I like to use different concept I want to use the one dime on T's here done Monte sort of like a joint joint piece to piece of diamond T's and I want to use the ivory satin ribbon comes over here and then just combining in this corner going behind [Music] I want to do one more thing here what I'd like to do to make this cake a little bit more elaborate I want to lower this this space little bit till here all right I think this is a very good idea I'm going to put one then visible it's visible but you don't see because I'm going to cover that board and this one exactly same material so it's it's an illusion that is not there then after that I'm going to do a sugar ornamental legs in this four sides okay so that will be look like look like this I'm going to make it more detail later on and then this one comes in here like that I think this add a lot of flair to this design [Music] [Music] before I do the sugar part I'm going to make a more detailed picture to actually stenciling to cut this properly this is only the concept but yet that you see that is a bit sort of like darkness behind it looks like a empty and you see that this is what we look like that the whole cake is standing on this little little legs but actually standing on this one in this other platform underneath all right what's missing here there's always when you put cakes on top of each other there's a little gap over here I have to cover that so what I like to do if I have a flower bouquet here and gold ornaments here I like to put exactly the same color of the icing more decoration here where Dean piping's so you don't be conceived from far away but you only see the shade and I'm going to just join this one here this area and then continue the smaller ones in this area you would see it later on when I'm doing it I'm going to share with you every little every single steps of this cake I think this is looks pretty complete because we have to also know where to finish so if you just continue doing things are you overloading the tip so I'm I'm I'm as a cake decorator I'm quite happy with this one if I look at this whole design and compare the which I've been in both places like Europe in America so this is a bit more classic American design it's quite a heavy sophisticated look a lot of so like vintage shapes on it and then also plenty flowers in different sizes and then comes to the like a really classic beautiful-looking cake once i have the design and all concept is finished that is time to decide what is more important to do earlier what is more important to do later on certain part of the cake it will be out of sugar so because of the transportation and all those things I like to make sure that every single thing I produce out of sugar it dries completely so that means I have to do it even that I have another week to go to the transport I have to do this certain parts now what what is more important is this legs these three decks these four legs will be out of sugar then I like to do them as early as possible and I want to draw down exactly the shape what I want and I'm going to produce a stencil that I can use that stencil put it on the rolled sugar and cut them okay this parts will be out of sugar so when I look at this direction I cannot exactly know how big is it because it's standing like this that's why I go to this side it will be starting from here and then touching through surface of the cake going like this and its end up here so when I it just still bend it when I make it straight will be around from here till there okay I have to stretch that design from here till here and if I look at the the surrounding of the first layer that's probably the corners in 45 degrees so that this is the quarter part so this is the quarter part I don't want to make it from here to there I want to make it inside here and then make some other pipe things in between here so that means that is my that is my height okay and that is my actually the amount of space I have to use to this area centralize it so I'm just drawing that according to just my fillings just to I want do something here like that that's the classic vintage design I'm going to do something like this alright then probably it goes goes like that and I like to get this part is like a barefoot it is just four pieces for just 5 pieces 1 2 3 2 3 2 5 and join the sparks with that yeah I think this coming up quite good I won't go here here then maybe just go like this again all right once I get this pencil of sort of approximate look I want to do it again with a thicker pen take a marking pen [Music] [Music] huh [Music] [Music] and and I'd like to create a lattice in the middle all right so if I like to get this one out of sugar and I like to have all those all those shapes in front of me I have to cut stenciling from this so this is my design but I want to make the this is not the line that I can cut I have to do another color in between so what I like to do is do that I don't want to do other side because I wasn't just going to one side and I'm going to fold it and cut it together so go around here like this like that like that then like this then here [Music] that triangle I want to cut and this Iraqi cut and this I like to cut I wanna get one more piece over here I want to join this one together that's or the in zero don't have to go around of it and in this part I didn't for anything everything is fine so what I'd like to do now for this into two [Music] [Music] we call everything out [Music] every time I do another another step just go refine it again in the game so because I think I can fix my mistakes every stage a little bit more and more [Music] I'm going to cut this out of a flat sugar let it really dry and I'm going to pipe on top of it again so makes it much more elaborate looking I make sure that 2 layers is really combined together doesn't move I use the tin paper it gives me the possibility just go with it small scissor really in every little corner it doesn't matter that little that tin paper it gives me gives me enough possibility to cut out of sugar [Music] I actually take up this one some small pots make sure that using the Inspector Gadget [Music] what some parts like into that are actually a some part I prefer the river season [Music] it's pretty good so imagine what I try to explain all the way so this cake is standing on about about 10 centimeter from the from the bottom and this gun goes this car goes around with it like this and create that lake that it looks like the whole cake is standing on these little pieces [Music] after I finish my stencil cutting I want to know exactly how do I place this around the cake so this angle is important and this angle is important and I have to create something because the cake is not ready yet so what I do is I I create the kind of imitation cake here this size is approximately right and the height is approximately what I wish to have so because this paper is only can bend in one direction cannot be in three dimension so I can just place it over here and see exactly how I bend it so then I decided not to use it two ways twisting that means not like that and often like that so I just want to keep it this way because I want to carry this click 2,000 kilometers away so if I would have chance to do this biscuit here and serve it here I would probably put this 'ready cake here and then cut this out of pastillage gum paste and place it stick it over here with it with a bit of water and I will have exactly to turn what I wish but now I decided to use some sort of hold I can cut those pieces which I cut or three of them and I take a plastic container cut little pieces like this I like this this part because it's excusing the turn and stays like this and this one is a bit flexible so imagine that is already bandit this way it's standing here like this and I can use this one as a holder this is an original board and it gives me actually right idea what I have to do here so I already did three of them I want to do loss loss on video I already finished three of them and I also decided in the middle to put some sort of letters here and this is different height that is a ticker and this is much more thinner so actually places underneath so I want to start doing this letters first I kept that this little piece actually comes from this stand something out so this will give me the idea how big that lettuce should be I passed it already was in the microwave and I just cut small pieces here to get the lettuce done this picture I have here originally round nozzle I twist it with the plier make it square I love it so because of its shape I can cut the pieces very easy and to create that methods very easily everything I cut it goes in and reliefs that in the middle so I can keep on cutting without removing that piece I'd like to cut this slightly bigger than this because I want to go underneath and then overlapping each other so I practice right in the middle here and I use this cutter and cutting about four five millimeters outside the line let me replace this over here in the middle just to get ready for the next stage now that was you guys with Tina now I'm going to I'm going to go the rest of it a little bit thicker [Music] ritum starch [Music] [Music] I flex my stencil here to see that the size I need a little bit bigger should be right now I place this here and I put two needles here - left and right - stop that stencil moving around [Music] take my scalp belt and always clean this is very good because I can turn it this way every direction every couple of cm you have to clean again and I'm holding this couple right 90 degrees down [Music] once I finish the outer frame I'm not going to remove the the sugar from outside I'm going to leave it there to keep things in place I'm not going to actually nothing at all before all cutting business is finished [Music] sometimes the scarf will get a little bit sticky it stops making nice clean cuts but it doesn't matter because I'm going to use the other side as a front [Music] [Music] [Music] for the little pieces you have to lift up a little bit and push it to the other side all right okay now we can take this one and place it on top I have to use that aside that's it I just want to leave it now completely dry just going to get this one also done now once this is one completely dry I will pipe this a lot more details here on top but it's not here I will do it over there and ugly [Music] all right next thing is let this one completely dry a couple of days it has to be really read right sometimes pasteurized rice but it's on the outside I have to make sure it's completely true the dryness is to be 100% all the way through inside what I'm doing now is the hidden boards under every cake so basically if I can't put the cake on top over straight away on the wood so I have to get gritty with the boards every side of the board the top and the bottom coated with a hygienic lee with a cap off so the way how I do that I just sprayed it glue on the cup board and applies the boards on it and cut it so [Music] take a break and then let's go around with it like that I'll make sure that I'm cutting on a wooden board so I don't cut the other piece underneath I have a 400 350 300 250 200 850 [Applause] this is just the basic white boards white boxes cake boxes I'll use and once I deserve Matt and I start shining I just make sure that I glue it over the matte side once I are done so later what we going to do we're going to send image the cake on top of the sport exactly flash on the side so there has been no cake patching to the hood it will be quite good to have it like that so it's nice and firm so when I when I built the clip together these boards will help me to keep the cake exactly straight and ready so now at this stage I am sending reaching this wedding cake this cake has got six layers starting from the 400 millimeters that is about 125 millimeter height the second layer is a little bit less probably about 75 or about 60 and the third layer is another 125 and this is a 25 centimeter that will I'm going to do it now then we have a 200 150 so starting from the 400 gradually degrees reduce the size 5 centimeter 400 350 300 250 250 that's a good reducing the size it's just got a good good shape at the end why is this case I have actually draw this lines on paper that I can see how thick I have to cut the sponges I am here dark mud cake sponge white math expunged and islands much in between I have mocha white ganache I have dr. nasch and I have whipped ganache with nougat which is you can call us a chocolate truffle cream or chocolate nougat truffle cream I also put some orange candy cubes and there's some caramelized almond pieces inside so yes as I go with this sundae with you I would like to explain you how the seeds end up so it's starting from the layer cake here and I call it the plane I'm going to put a little bit of mocha ganache yet that is white chocolate ganache with mocha paste motor paste means a lots of Nescafe a little bit of water [Applause] I always try not to get the cream on top yet ok firstly it's done then followed by white magic she's despot I'm just pushing it I'm not worried about the size because I'm going to do this later on another layer after that is dark ganache as you see all my creams are in the perfect condition they are basically in room temperature and they are sort of spreadable at the same time not too liquid the cake that I've done son division is not going to collapse while I'm doing it [Applause] which advisable if you feel that the cave is not holding itself because of the everything is so room temperature after a couple of players you can put in the fridge this guy has got so many layers in it like if you if I come to the top icing and crumb coating everything is end up around eighteen layers after that ganache I'm going to use almond sponge I put some bits and pieces together there's nothing wrong with that because you just have to join it together in the way that it's built and so actually when you cut the cake later on down even realize [Music] [Applause] I'm going sponges in place after that I'm going to put the chocolate truffle cream which is yet as you see that is a whipped ganache little bit of nougat and that's why the color is a bit lighter because when you whipping the ganache you're exiting getting areas [Applause] okay I'm going to put some candy orange chips which I did this myself it is a fresh fresh iron skin it's bought the with water and remove that first water because I don't want to get the bitterness of the orange skin then after that I I mix it with the sugar and leave it there for a day and next day boil again and you end up like beautiful beautiful fresh orange skin kids there's a lot better than what we buying from outside from manufactured items is actually nothing less than the orange but a little bit more strongly cooked to get a bit more firmness nothing I use it like a crunch which is a caramel sugar mixed with the AMA nibs and after I break the pieces so I want to achieve their bite like crunchy parts William eating this cake if I put the sponge on top now it will be not sticky because it will be just that not so good so I could just push all the things into the cream again mixing our views is the market [Applause] a little bit of sugar syrup with almond flavoring and that's my favorite a little shop a lot [Applause] which that moisture into a sponge after that we start over again so take a game then mock up white ganache not too much more higher the cake upper layers should be little bit less screen [Applause] good Wright's punch [Applause] high-temperature game [Applause] then is the last layer of almond sponge [Applause] how much sponges got almost no flour just a little bit of flying side basically almond milk being used to for purpose of building your cake into a nice firm texture almond will subsidize the D flag then comes again shows the blue got free [Applause] orange again almond crackling [Applause] push this into texture again last layer is the cake Weiss is the chocolate Dartmouth cake as you realize that these different heights on each level the fresh level 125 second level is 75 you smell a little bit less than the other ones because this these two combined is a one kind of block and the these other ones is 125 class probably about 150 so again I take a little syrup this time I go everywhere because I didn't do this one yet [Applause] [Music] and the color [Applause] so that is the rough Sunday routine please finish after this this cake goes into the fridge and we'll be starts getting all those crumb coat chocolate layer double masking again fill to the icing level you have lot more to go [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] at the moment I'm worrying about the construction part of the cake as you see all the cakes are finished so I can take the measurements how high are they individually and I can also look at the drawing but I will not rely on this drawing as much as that I can measure the case itself so first of all I measure the base it's around 40 millimeters and I measure everyone from the beginning of the cake to the top of the cake so I will ignore this leg part because I'm going to remove all the next year so we have fourteen hundred and ten one hundred and thirty and other six measurements all together this end up one meter and twenty five millimeters okay one thousand twenty five-millimeter just slightly over the middle which is actually what customer looking for after I took all the measurements what I do is I put a place of masking tape on the table and this is like the actually the individual part of the cake so that is 40 millimeters from the from the table to the top of the base then I have 110 millimeters the lift up in the middle hence the first cake 130 second cake is 90 which is going to be covered with the gold nine hundred and twenty nine hundred and fifty hundred and fifty 935 the top cake then I have a process here that I decided to go about six seven centimeter inside Darcis with a metal so I can I don't have to worry about any other construction I can just plug it in and stay there that around the 100 millimeters so altogether is 1025 all right now the Hydra cup is I can't just take one thousand twenty five millimeter of a long thread screw and then take somewhere in the back in the in the luggage and expect that this will be accepted so I will make it three different three shorter ones and I will also join them with this joiners nuts which is like longer than necessary then you can put two together and perfectly join together so with this drawing with this drawing it helps me whether I stop whether I start again so I don't want to start in the middle of the wood construction inside so I decided to stay from the base to the middle of the cake I can place this way in the middle as you see there are some PVC pipes inside this will be completely protected nothing would touch to the cake and then this is the second one between here I also end up middle of the cake then here join together like this then what I will do I will put one nut here and then one nut and there is the last the last wooden board will be around here so I have to place one nut here and then tighten up the ball of them the whole cake will be quite secure so I can pick those things because of shorter and I can also make the cake very very secure with this kind of concept in this project in this order most important thing is the packaging because the Kansas the gear is traveling 2004 matters and be arriving there and the cakes all all broken and we don't have time to start all over again so that's why I give a lot of attention in great details of packaging I look after that so I'll give a box which is exactly the same size of this wood but I already pre-cut exact same size of the box and I put some legs underneath so I have some space to power the nut distance over here so I have a little hole here I put a piece of plastic here and this cake is ready with PVC in the middle that little pipe in the middle so whatever I squeeze on top here it's not going to squeeze the cake only squeeze it on tip on top of this area so what we do now the extra Center light it we make sure that the hole is exactly the same that's fine and I don't want to touch any wood on the cap that's why I like to put first a piece of cut part and then another piece of food almost the same size of the cake on top of it then just take a discharge all the way down then I have I have a piece of long track here [Applause] and the second nut [Music] [Applause] so I'm going to squeeze this one it's such a weight not too much that can break PVC but gives you a little bit of pressure enough pressure to hold this cake in it in a place like that so next step I'm going to put these boxes these cakes in the boxes and then fill this area with some sort of instant form that it feels exactly the right amount of support on the side so I have something new we are trying this is a kind of a form that liquid form a you spray it in the mtrs and then it will harden up to hold that area properly nicely I'm just making a kind of like pressure test I spray this into a little box if this wall doesn't really push up like that in the next half an hour I will use this material to protect it a large [Applause] now if I put already the cakes which is already completely tighten up with the nuts and bolts inside the box so I have still this empty area if I if I just have a soft landing this box on on a summer that when they when the leg each hand baggage handler is like throwing around with a bit it will be fine but I like to get a little more security on the empty area so therefore I like to use this foam film which is triple expanding filler I just take it I didn't know exactly how much it's going to grow I fill up this book actually half here half here it grows so much it's still going it's still there is some soft pieces inside it's not either soft that means it's growing so you have to be careful when you when you fill this interiors with that you have to not go completely because if you feel this company is going to grow up like this like the big mushroom here so I just feel a little bit only at the bottom maybe just about just about this much and I'll grow about that it will be fine and then restart to dressed up the box I will fill up with it is bubble bubble pack [Music] that's really good this would be grow up till here it will be good enough from [Music] growing up inside in this one get get hardened it's completely hardened it's still soft and you can knock this cake quite harshly it's not going to be much damage in this clip so after all that I do my best to practice properly the when we arrived at lit and something is goes wrong basically cake cannot be disappeared from the box it will be some maybe some cracks or something and I will take my extra material to fix it over then I would have still one and a half days Christy okay we are just about taking off to airport all the boxes are attached there's one large one so affected the base of the cake and all those tools and the equipment's that I needed over there of course it really going to this kind of adventure you have to really take proportions they can always take something more than what we need to end up like this big boxes so these are the boxes and these are the two languages that we have filled with all those flowers inside and all the small parts that they bring part of the kids [Music] good morning to try to lose guy - title the entity okay there you go see it seems I taste it we are the estimate the Volks rate kiddo and now we just realized that the actual rate is 1978 oh it's a I think it's a very good estimation [Music] we just arrived to pick up points and it looks like the boxes all in tech this is only three it's going to get rejected thank you very much they're just a live to hotel and checking in and this is the boxes it looks pretty good doesn't have any external damage and they will see very soon the moment of truth and we can open up the boxes and see what happen inside I think looks exactly like I packed in I see no damage at all okay click the close and then we're gonna start tomorrow morning at time o'clock putting everything together so some parts of it there's no chuckles got things for them okay let's go get the tools first step is complete no damage everything is unpacked I just want to show now is the room setup before we just put things together these are the all the cakes and that's the whole damage but we have noticed and this is very easy to fix it all the flowers it's ready to pick up individually and placed on the cake I believe this is more than what we need but it doesn't matter and that's the table to start with that's the main lifter in the middle and this is the altar that I'm going to use probably will touch everyone the bit of music that probably doing it and show you something more interesting that's the all leftovers after packaging that's what left that's the most in this piece all right second tier of the wedding cake has to be coated gold gold sheet on it so if there we use it 24 karat gold sheets and which came from overseas and Joanne is just putting that cake with God so first thing what she does is spray a little bit of moisture water and then take bits punch all this drops oil and make it just a very sort of like a little bit of work then on the the surface voltage gold actually comes with a piece of paper behind so you can all the paper and then stick it on the surface make sure that you apply enough pressure everywhere that the gold is completely touched with the surface and remove the paper so it turns out partners so that's my next thing to put on the cake so I have to write Delta to finish our breakfast [Music] [Music] I couldn't ask for the long track screws in debt one meter height so I have this jointer in between so what I put that I put a little hot glue gun here and stable this one all the way up my children then I'm just going to go in there and then you now as you realize it there is a throat long term school coming from here tails to the bottom so I have to place this nut inside a cake I cannot put my finger inside that's why I used a little contour like this so I the country is just holding the nut and I'm going to go there now and put in journey turns the to this level which is the hidden northern side it should be come in here today so it should be come to there we already tilt to the bottom and I'm not going to force more so they're not deserving around here now so I just have to I cannot tighten with this but I can type from the bottom but now then you can see that should be enough I think [Music] they think it's my poor sister it's a real losses and you just covered sugar it's one only use for the purpose of holding the flowers not for eating purpose [Music] so that's beautiful total bases perfect I can just put my flowers in it [Music] Roberta's finish my next step is the piping this lower position little ornamental piping yet exactly same color as the is the cake but I want to make this pointing in different kind of white somewhere will be tickers on my Ruby Tina and somewhere higher and lower so what I like to do but I don't want to make the flowers first and piping after I want to do the piping first because the flowers comes on top of the piping so I think this a good idea to just place kind of wire around the cake just to see the positioning of the flower then I can decide whether I pipe higher in long that's the wire that I place in it flowers here they can show me where I do I also need to have a positioning of the gold pipings that in between the flow of flowers I take this fund as a this flat ribbon because I'm going to partner on this is thickness so this to our spiral position will tell me where is the area's left to pipe rest of the cable so that's what I'm doing now and then I am starting out with just a border I think if just piping like a small from zero to go little bit thicker and go a little bit in a cake [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] at this stage I'm arranging the flowers on the surface follow-up this mental water I have a couple of different designs of flower different type of flowers so what I do is I just go very slowly and every actually making smaller arrangements on little areas like this and then continue to follow the line so I don't want to just spread around on knowing you what's going to happen at the end so I'm just concentrating on that 10 square centimeter first and then continue on the next lot so all what we do is just like this every flower here is handmade and they're wired into one one bunch like this and the I decided to put in here so I make a little hole very so that very small hole then holding that with a plier on the very very bottom of it and then slowly pushing it and once I satisfied with the position that I open up slowly all the leaves and I can see now here something neat here so then I will use more smaller flowers and put it here and once the all the garland is finished I'm going to start using in some fillers leaves and of course I will decide that time certain gaps to fill the the pillars and also I have to see that the individual RS to see where to put the leaves [Music] it's almost 11 o'clock tonight and the we're going to now take a break and have some sleep I should be the less tired and fighting tomorrow golden ornaments in between the leaf flower lines so far so good that all the flowers finish and tomorrow I'll just maybe another three hours and then completely [Music] [Music] today is Saturday this is the winning day we have finished already the cake almost completely the flowers in place and now the last step that we promised actually to decline the that we have to make some piping in between the flower lines this is a bit risky risky step because we can just do we can easily overdo it and then kills the everything else around of it so it has to be a filigree piping and very subtle that should not be overpowering everything else but you see on the cake so it just has to be implemented the rest of it so we have already some totes and I drove some couple of little sketches I even actually simulate the situation with the gold painting everything we have just sort of like thought about it that is really the limit is very sensitive and you cannot go too much so I decided to even less than that we draw here so I like to do something really really simple and small and that's a classic of piping like is true to a double line in left turn and right turn and after that another another line err shape another right and left turn so then I like to repeat that all the way and just add a little bit more sophistication here just go like a little bit of like a zigzag piping around of it what I like to do this in this stage now I like to draw this or pipe this on on it on a piece of paper and put it on the cake and I let my wife Joe is like work on the gold brushes and then see how it looked like before we start [Music] pipe active filigree work on the paper and place it on the right position and join is just painting with gold and before we take to risk and we just want to do this step and see how it looked like [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I also declare that this cake is completely fish did I achieve or did we achieve the whole success I'm not so sure yet this is what we go to achieve when Mariette see this cake and say you know you guys did more than what I expected so we will know that tonight [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] they're just putting the disability just on the room is magnificent all the decorations are fantastic crystal chandeliers greater not 500 flowers [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] okay [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] we are just about checking out from Adelaide Hilton we came here on Thursday afternoon today Sunday so the wedding was yesterday I had to say that was the best wedding I ever been involved in the kind of disk I know comment we have seen a lot of weddings you know profession but that was really did something spectacular I have to thank Maria and Helen for that wonderful opportunity for us to excel ourself in such a grand event and it was in a kind of like unforgettable experience and the four days of generosity what they were they given to us what we receive in this hotel it was it was just sort of like enormous and we wish Maria until a wonderful happy life and a lot of children that we can make some more birthday cakes for them in future [Music]", "iOAowxiDBNU": "[Music] hi guys and welcome back to my kitchen now one style of cakes i love whether it's for a birthday cake maybe a baby shower or even a wedding cake is the waffle cake now one thing i love is by changing the shape of the cutters that you use you can create a really different effect on the cake so for this week's video i'm gonna be using different sized cutters to create different effects on your cake also don't forget if you enjoyed this video tutorial you can subscribe to the case when there's youtube channel you can also hit that notification bar next to the subscribe button and this will just alert you every time we upload a new video ok let's get started so the things I'm going to use in order to make my ruffles is first of all I've just got my cake you know this is just a six inch cake that I've covered in at some pink fondant now I have separated my cake into three so I've added these lines in just so I can do the three different examples of my ruffles I think that the cutters that I'm gonna be using for the different examples some pink fondant that matches the one that I've used on the cake now for my fondant I'm using the red short extra and this is just slightly firmer than a normal fondant and then got my rolling pin and you just want either a small boat or or a Dresden tool and lastly I've got some icing sugar that I've mixed with water now all this is gonna do is just create a sticky glue to help me stick my ruffles onto my cake okay for my first example of ruffles I'm gonna be using this circle cutter now the one I've chosen just measures a four centimeters in diameter but you could make them smaller or larger if you'd prefer now this cutter is just by fmm and I'm gonna use some of my fondant and roll this out so that I can cut out some of my circles now if you find it that the fondant you're using is quite soft then you can always add a small amount of gum paste to it or maybe a small amount of tylose powder just for it slightly ferma to work with so that those ruffles are gonna keep their shape now I'm gonna for my fund an hour as thin as I can so this one is around a millimeter in thickness and then going to cut some of those circles out now a waffle cake does take quite a lot of a circle so this is just gonna be the first lot but I create now I'm gonna keep a few of these out and just pop the rest in a plastic container so that that fondant doesn't dry out now to create the shape of my ruffle I want them all slightly different but I'm gonna start bending that ruffle but stop in before I completely push it in half and then taking the sides of the circle and ring those round in different directions creating a kind of s-shaped want to pinch that back so that you get a point that's gonna attach on to the cake now I want to have a slight variation in some of my ruffles so I'm gonna Bend some of those in half and just bend those in half again instead of creighton but yes shape so you're just trying to create some movement for those ruffles now for my first report I'm just going to place this at between the marks I've created on my cake and starting with some of that water is mixed with some icing sugar I'm gonna add that to the bottom and we're gonna work our way up the cake now taking my first ruffle you want to place this against the cake and using it your small bottle or your dress until I'm just gonna use this to push that against the side of the cake and I can then go in with the next one for directly next to that and just continue to push those into place I can then take some more of those disks that we've created and just bend these around creating that ruffle shape and you can just use your bottle just to push any of those ruffles to close up any gaps and that gives us our first row now if you were doing the whole cake you would just continue along the bottom but I've just stopped where my line is now the next part we're gonna do is the next row up now taking some more of those ruffles I'm going to use that point on the edge just to push in that gap now these ruffles are coming away from the cake around one and a half centimeters so if you didn't want them as big you could just use a slightly smaller circle cutter now we're really starting to get that ruffle effect at the bottom so I'm going to cut out some more circles and just work my way all the way up until we get to the top now if you wanted to do an ombre effect and going up the cake then you just want to lighten your fondant so maybe you might have the first two inches in one color and then you just might want to add some white to your fondant to lighten it slightly for the next two inches just growing up the cake [Music] [Music] along the top I'm just gonna place some of that glue and it just stick a nice neat row along that top edge so once your cake or in this case the panel on the front has it been covered here we have the ruffles that we've created using the circle cutter now for this panel so 1/3 of the cake I use 134 circles of fondant to create this effect and with the circle cutter we just get this nice pretty classic ruffle okay so for my second of ruffles I'm gonna use a square cutter now this is just a cutter that measures of 4 centimeters across an is also by fmm now for my square ones I'm going to do these in exactly the same way as I did my circle ruffles so I'm under my fondant out until it's around a millimeter in thickness and I'm gonna cut out some of my squares so just taking my square of fundin I'm gonna start to bend this so that the corners are slightly separated and again just bring those two edges in different directions and pinch on the back so we get this ruffle effect now whereas the circle was quite smooth on the outside what I'm trying to do is create my ruffle so that we've got these points sticking out and I'm gonna do the exactly the same so bring my cake back in apply some of that glue just to the bottom of my cake and start working my way up is in my bottle or again your Dresden tool just to push those against the side of the cake now I really think that using the square cutter makes it look a bit like tissue paper [Music] [Music] now again you just want to finish off that top edge just making sure that you can't see any of the best I've been pushed against the fondant so just use your ball tool just to bring some of those ruffles up so here we have the finished ruffles that were made with the square cutter so as you can see instead of this circle one we've got the smooth edges we've got all these points that are sticking out now for this third of the cake I used at 128 squares so for my third ruffle I'm gonna be using this five petal cutter and this one is just by PME now I need these to be slightly firmer so I've got a large bore of my fondant never also got a ball of gum paste now this one is about 50% of the size of a larger ball and I'm gonna mix these together this is gonna make the ruffles at dry slightly harder but we need these ones to be able to keep their shape a little bit more yeah I've got any gum paste you could just add some tylose powder to your fondant so once those have been combined together I'm gonna roll out my fondant and gum paste mix now I'm gonna leave these for a few minutes just they firm up slightly before I shape them for my petals I'm just gonna pick them up and just in the center pull all of those together into a point I want them to go in different directions and instead of just leaving them on the side to dry so that all the pieces can fall down place it on my work surface with the petals facing down to dry for a few minutes so that they'll keep their shape but not so long that they've all completely dry and so I've left all the shapes I've carl's so far for around five minutes just to sits there holding their shape and then take in each of the shaves I'm just pushing that edge against the side so with these ones as I push them against the cake I'm just puttin that ball tool into the center just secure in those single petals in place and making sure that they're all stuck down and this also allows you just to put any of those petals just into gaps [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so here we have the finished ruffle technique using the five petal cutter now it just looks like you've got these individual circles all attached to the cake and I used 126 cutters okay so here we have the three different ruffle techniques for the circle and the square they took me around an hour to do each of the panels but the five petal cutter this took a little bit longer did cause I had to leave them to dry to keep their shape slightly so this took me around an hour of 45 minutes to do this one panel I really hope you enjoyed this video tutorial and will find some of these techniques useful in your own cake decorating if you have enjoyed the video as always don't forget to give it a like just so I know and why not leave a comment below let me know which style cutter you prefer whether it was the circle the square or the petal cutter or maybe you have another shape that you tend to use it for your ruffles so

and I hope you guys are all doing well I just want to share a quick story about this wonderful couple who are supposed to tie the knot today Saturday April the 21st today's they told a very special place in their hearts because they met exactly five years ago as we all know in the light of Kobe 19 a lot of couples are forced to postpone or even cancel their wedding and of course everyone in the industry are all affected as well including myself as a cake designer so going back to the story I was asked to make a small cake that is somewhat similar to the design of their own wedding cake to commemorate this day and this will be purge delivery by the way seriously this couple could not wait to be married and I cannot wait to bring their real wedding cake to life so without further ado I'll show you the wedding cake for two or at the mini cake [Music] did you guys like it if you like this video please give it a thumbs up subscribe and comment below thank you you", "CyAewqiuj2s": "it's a fantastic day it's a good day to be alive come to think of it every day is a good day to be alive what's good ladies and gents and if you're new to the channel my name is shaka and your boys back here for another video um i want to start off by saying shout out to all the freaking people in the live stream man shout out to the people in the live stream man for real because you guys went ham we went ham on a live stream we had hella fun and it was cool having all of you guys there more live streams coming soon and shout out to all the people that donated to because there were some people that donated because i don't make money off of youtube so it was cool to have people donating and that was [ __ ] lit but um thank you guys but if you were in the live stream you saw that your boy's empty pretty much i'm gonna take a hit off of this but this card is pretty much done and it always feels good to get some new freaking cards and if you were on the live stream you saw that your boy he got some new cards so today we're doing a versus raw garden refined live resin versus bloom farms live resin so let me just put my camera down all right guys how to switch up the location let me take one more hit before we get into this all right babe so we have a freaking raw garden refined live resin purple flame shout out to raw garden and then i have a new cart that i've never tried before but a lot of you guys wanted to see me try this on the live stream so i got it boom farms and this one is la kush cake it's an indica dominant and this raw garden is a indica hybrid so it's probably an indicate dominant hybrid so let's pop them i'm gonna put the raw garden on the honey stick bat hopefully it's done charged i had it on the charger for a little bit but whoo let's get a let's get a close-up guys so i always put everything up against raw garden because check that out man look at that good ass oil so i always put stuff against up against raw garden because raw garden just tastes super good guys like it's always a consistency of the taste the taste is always good no matter how they made it it's just you know it's [ __ ] fire so we're gonna put it up against the taste test against the balloon farms and um i might have to do a blooms farm versus bloom because there's a bloom company and it's crazy so the package for the freaking bloom is freaking dope it's a nice little cardboard box and then it comes in this little packet that you have to actually rip open [Music] and then as you can see i'm gonna get a close stuff real quick as you can see guys the tip is way different it's not oval like the um raw garden they got the bloom name on the bottom that's dope the oil is a lot more darker way darker it's a nice it's a nice oil compared to the raw garden it's compared to the raw it's pretty light like i've seen darker live resin but it's pretty light and then you know the raw garden is always almost like clear so on the back of the bloom it says taste the terpenes the bloom farms live resin which is named for the freshness of the plant and which is made this savory sweet cannabis concentrate contains high level levels of native terpenes an ultimate vaping experience and um it says bloom farm is a one for one company for every purchase we donate one healthy meal to an individual or family guys so that's dope and all these companies are from the bay they're they're from california at least this one's from oakland this is the oakland brand and raw garden i'm not sure where raw garden from but i know you guys can tell me down in the comments where is raw garden from guys tell me down in the comments so i'm gonna put the raw garden on this bat and i pick purple flame because you know usually you know you pick name certain names you get you get certain flavors this one's probably going to be super earthy it's because it doesn't have really much of a fruity name it's called purple flame i'm not sure what strains it comes from but let's test it out guys [Music] oh so actually the purple flame is actually kind of sweet guys like [Music] and then i'm gonna put the uh other one put the bloom farms on on my other bat and this is the alpha pin battery so let me take another hit [Music] so sorry if i don't take any blinker heads guys but if you guys seen the live stream you guys see me taking hell of blinker hits and my throat is freaking killing me man so no blinker hits for this video today but dude this raw garden is pretty damn good guys hella good so let's try this out and i've never tried one of these guys man so i'm kind of juiced about it oh and now both of these compare off the jump the bloom farms is the closest to live resin is going to get the raw garden it tastes good it tastes earthy but this one tastes more like the actual concentrate like it tastes like the actual concentrate like you're taking an actual freaking dad [Music] oh it's dang it tastes hella good though this is not bad guys indica dominant and the bloom farms guys the bloom farms is 81 and the raw garden is 88 so the raw garden has more thc but you know it doesn't necessarily mean the potency isn't better this po this could still be more potent than the raw garden but you know you guys got to test it out and try it but i i tell you guys man you guys should definitely try this bloom farms it's definitely worth it guys i think flavor wise if you're trying to get flavor the raw garden the raw garden definitely has more of that flavor that tasty but if you're trying to get that nice like like you're taking a dab off your nail then or off your banger or whatever this is what you want right here this is what you want this is what you need but today guys we got we got the best of both worlds we got the best of both worlds um i got more cards i'm gonna have more reviews coming guys man you already know if you've seen the live stream you saw that i got it um i got like two more cards so i can do a review on so we're going to be getting lit for a while but i also want to get some flour i've been want to get some flour so i'm probably going to do some more story time so if you guys want to see some story times put that down below uh more car reviews are definitely coming though man if you guys want to see cart cart reviews tell me what carts should i do should i do that new stizzy man i heard stizzy

bring up the best of the much-awaited centerpiece your wedding cake dream it we make it [Music]", "SS1LlMz_E7Y": "welcome back to fYI weddings today we're here at delicious cakes talking to boots divers about wedding cakes let's tell us the history of the wedding cake well it's a great question John I'll tell you I'm going to try to remember because it goes back a long way it goes back to around 776 BC Wow that's before Christ and it was the Romans we can give this credit to and that what they would do is they would bake a cake I guess you could call it a cakes baked out of wheat and barley and then they would break it over the bride's head and then the guests would pick up all the crumbs and kind of use it as confetti and that was for prosperity during the 17th century the people in England decided I guess to be different they wanted to make a bride's pie they spelled it P ye and it was made with horrible stuff like oysters and all kind of other ingredients it didn't last very long what very festive no wasn't very festive and tried to break that over but anyway that developed into the wedding cake and now here's another bit of trivia for you the wedding cakes now this is 17th century no refrigeration cakes were made with heavy syrup fruit and alcohol well that won't make for a party yeah so I mean they had the shelf life of a Twinkie then so they were supposed to take the top tier if they had to wrap it put it away and then on the birth of their first child bring it out and eat it that was for good luck well in America gets a hold of it and they said now stick it in the freezer for a year and eat it on your anniversary so I guess Americans like stale frozen cake but anyway we don't adhere to that we like to give our Brides a fresh top tier or their wedding cake or their anniversary yeah so it's kind of the history of that and they were small cakes really one or two tiers up until around 1947 now this is where I start to remember because I was about that time in 1947 you might know Queen Elizabeth Prince Philip got married well their wedding cake was nine feet tall Wow weighed 500 pounds oh my god and that kind of started the tradition that well it's time to start having bigger wedding cakes so you know wedding cakes are sized we'll get into that a little bit but it's gone from 1947 to elegant elaborate tall wedding cakes to today where you know you can see they're basically all shapes sizes colors well butch this is all been very very interesting I'm glad you had the time to sit down with us on fYI weddings join us next time when we have talked with somebody else about what a bride needs to know about her wedding [Music] you", "L5ba6mFdjCE": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you

do a cake and but can you tell us about what is our plan for today okay so today we are actually going to decorate these dummy cakes yes I'm gonna decorate my with of the sugar flowers Jeannie is going to decorate okay I get that more natural few going to take this sharpening right and we're going to cover the foam this requires a little bit of aah you want a nice strangle well how much muscle she has actually made of sugar you can use this hopeless Wow so and but is this how you do your gym every day yeah-huh every day you have to make sure it's a nice like a square looking getting there so am I getting there I don't think you'll get there Wow I'm feeling very badly at this but it's okay looks delicious it gives people motivation not to do this dish thank you it's on wedding don't don't don't try it out don't try I'll give you this no this is a low look at Wyatt cakes are so expensive well it's because it's labor-intensive it's not just like flour and sugar and slap them together and you get something nice right my energy level is about 20% left already Emma just to let you know like it's not very tiring it's like okay I don't feel tired at all one later and now we're done with our four tiers Samba how is it so far okay very good decorating this Oh like my facial expressions how long does it take for one kit to be done like UJ we start with foot tasting first so after for tasting were actually design the cake for my clients then the whole baking and the decoration itself is actually done on the week itself for painting on the cake like what we are doing right now you only have maybe maximum of one day to do there is about pricing point and when it comes out to wedding cakes just think about when you're going to Starbucks or somewhere eating a cake a slice of cake is usually around six or seven dollars and think of it as this is your wedding cake especially meat for you so how much would it be that that's a pretty good gauge right so amber yes I want you to see and rate my design so far can I lie lie really well no tell me about this flowers how long does it take for you to make it so to make one usually takes around two hours the time to make one depends on the intensity of the work like see that's a lot of small petals going on it's crazy looking at and it's all edible yes decidable oh I actually learned a lot of the flower arrangement from Sarah from poppy flower yes I know sir she's my friend yes so in essence or so like what I'm decorating right now is also lessons from car insert clip and applause so rate it on a scale what don't man amber how would you rate my design can I be honest sure [Laughter] one eventually hi guys will come to the end of the video and then below on who did a better job where I was Ember Oh Jamie why you

it look round to you now it's pretty good just do me the car for you my design starts with a very huge pumpkin base at the bottom of the cake and then it moves on to a very creepy looking tree like form and from the tree we built up our two topsy-turvy tiers that ends up with the very top with a rotating bridal topper so man I'm going to start with the figures okay perfect and I'm gonna start the tombstone the cake I'll be creating for Mardi Internet is based upon the things that they love and want to see in their wedding cake we took some pumpkin spice cake and created a tombstone with two jack-o'-lanterns and then a giant moon and then we have this tree that's whimsical and all over the place and it gave them a nice place to sit and from the moon on their swing dude she's like sculpting ready wow the cake that I will be designing today is a 70-year Halloween meets traditional wedding cake the bottom tiers are gonna be really Halloween based and it's going to be topped with a creepy hand holding up a traditional three-tier cake the flavor of my cake is going to be a chocolate cake with vanilla bean buttercream and a creamy milk chocolate ganache in between I feel like they have so much done", "2ajzEKKg71Q": "hi guys I'm Jen Jones welcome back to the show if this is your first time here make sure you hit the subscribe button and join me for weekly videos now this week I'm super excited to bring you a geode cake tutorial if you are a Pinterest or a Facebook user you probably saw this cake over the last couple of months and I know that as soon as I saw it I had to remake it and it's turned out and it's absolutely beautiful and it's one of my favorite cakes that I've ever made I can't wait to show you guys how to put it together so let's start this tutorial to make the cake we're going to be using an 8 inch round cake for the base and a 6 inch round cake for the top now you could use any size of cake that you want to any shape for this technique now I'm also going to need a lot of clear piping gel so we're going to need probably about half this container we're also going to be using fondant we've got two different colors here I've got white and a sky blue fondant now for the rock candy to give the crystal appearance we're going to be using this is string rock candy and it's kind of like a larger size of crystal then the regular rock candy on a stick is I've got a recipe on how to make your own rock candy on a stick if you're interested link will be in the description box we're also going to be using edible gold leaf this will be the first time we've used this on the channel so I can't wait to show you guys how to use it so the first thing we're going to be doing is working with our fondant we're going to be marbling the fondant that's going on top of the cake so I've just got these little pieces of fondant rolled out here you kind of want to squeeze them together as you're going to roll you want to roll it out like this so I've got two pieces of white and one of blue just to have more whitish like I want it to end up as a blue a light blue there so you can see how to switch that there cut it again and then or straight twist it again and then start to roll again and then do it again just keep doing it a bunch of times keep rolling out squeezing it together it's going to come up with like a unique different pattern for every one that you do so your top and your bottom will look slightly different but that's kind of the cool part and then remember to twist and it's almost forgot that part there roll it just work and play with your fondant day this is kind of a fun way to use it as you guys know I don't use a ton of fun and I have been using a lot lately and I'm starting to almost enjoy it don't no no don't say that I'm not enjoying it yet no I am so I'm rolling this out continuing to twist there we go and I think it's almost ready to go so what I'm going to do now is you have to decide whether or not you're going to cover your smaller cake first or your larger cake first it's totally up to you I'm going to work on the smaller one so I'm just kind of get it into a little bit of a circle to start off they're taking my long rolling pin and I'm just going to start to roll it out till it's a 14 inch circle in diameter so I've got my cake here sitting on a glass bowl or a glass plate on top of my turntable and you'll see underneath that is sitting on a cardboard plate we're going to need that for stability I just wanted to point that out before I covered it and found it and you couldn't see it anymore so now I'm going to take my fondant and cover my cake here and so what's nice about working with the little cakes is that you don't need a ton to roll out now I'm just getting it off of the mat here peel it gently off it's going to come off and it's that beautiful marbled look here looks awesome so you'll do the exact same thing with the top layer as well so I'm just kind of placing it like that and then taking a fondant smoother just go around the outside edges here and just gently place it just gently get it to touch to the sides and then when you get all the way down to the bottom you want to trim that off with a pizza cutter or a fondant knife after you have both of the cakes covered in fondant you need to take a sharpened dowel and I'm going to put it into the cake and why we're doing this is to give support the cake is going to be quite heavy because of all of the type of cake I'm using and I'm just using an edible writer here to mark the top where I want to cut it right there and so like I was saying the cake is going to be heavy because it's quite dense and it's also going to have a lot of rock candy on it once you've marked it you can take it out cut it with like either a saw or like a really sharp knife I've already got some cut to size here so I'm just going to poke them in and I'm using three and I'm just putting them in kind of like a v-shape here or like a triangle actually so poke those in calm down and these will act as support you can use straws for your support but the wood dowels are a lot more sturdy and for such the heavy cake they will work better for that so then all you have to do is take your top tier and I've got it on a cake lifter here and I'm just going to slide it off on top here carefully moving it off just like that so I've drawn on the shape that I want my geo to be like I found that it's like mostly it's kind of like the best shape that it can be when it is almost like I like a pointed oval so I'm going to take a knife nice use an edible writer for that and what I'm going to do is just start carving the cake so I want my deepest cuts to be down through the middle here now when you get to the cake board you will feel it in there and what you might have to use after you've carved the cake kind of around the cake or around that cake board there is you might have to use like an exacto knife or even a pair of scissors so you're just going to carve away the cake here in this little little hollow here and we're going to make a really deep little spot for all the crystals to go so now that we have the hole carved out here for the geode we're going to take some buttercream and I'm just put it in a piping bag and I'm just going to put a thin layer all around here this is going to be to help the geode crystals that we're going to use the rock candies it's going to help it stick if you happen to not work fast enough to have the buttercream stick like the rock candy sticking to your buttercream that's where we're going to bring in the piping gel so I'm just going to finish covering this off so for ease of use I've got the piping gel in a piping bag here and you could also just use a like a paintbrush if you want to I'm just going to put it in there the first color we're going to work with is the darkest blue and I'm just going to work from the inside out so I'm going to doing the darkest color first here and what I did was I just broke open all of my rock candies and I just like snapped them in half and crunch them up and then you get all these nice little crystal pieces here you want to put aside some of the larger pieces like from the top and we're going to use that later on piping gel is like the stickiest known to man and pretty much anything is going to stick to this it's awesome for projects like this so I'm just going to build up the inside here with the darkest blue so now we're going to move on to the second darkest blue color so I guess the next lightest blue these chunks are a little bit bigger so they're kind of easier to hold now what I did was I already put on the piping gel that time and I'm just working away and whew whoopsies if you see that I've kind of deliberately tried to make the dark blue jagged around the outside or like I didn't want to have it be uniform because I wanted it to look more natural and I found that when I was practicing if you lined up all of the rocks like in a single line it does not look natural at all so you want to keep that in mind and make sure it's like kind of jagged so now I'm going to go around with this next color of blue now we're moving on to our lightest shade of blue here and it starts to become a bit like putting a puzzle together you want to find the pieces that are going to fit in those gaps that you've got and so what I'm trying to do is build as much of this light light blue around the outside I want to leave a little bit of space for the white and then we're going to be putting the gold leaf around the very outside right on directly on to the fondant I'm just going to go around with these this light blue rock candy now so now I'm putting the clear Rock crystals here the rock candy along the edge of the cake here and I'm just pressing it into that spot now I want to make sure that I've got enough of the candy here that I'm putting it kind of bumping it up against the fondant here I'm going to put the gold leaf right along the edge here and then afterwards after we've got the gold leaf on I'm going to come back and put another layer of the clear crystal so it kind of overlaps the gold leaf so it looks more natural so I've got the gold leaf out here now when it comes to you it comes in little sheets like this and it comes like in a little booklet I just like to keep it covered it's easiest that it sticks to absolutely everything it flies away I haven't put it on while I've been talking yet either so I'm a little bit worried that it's going to something's going to happen to it while I'm talking so what I did here was just sliced the little gold leaf in two little slices here I'm just going to get my tweezers and I'm not kidding it sticks to every single thing and so I'm just trying to peel that off like that so it sticks to the tissue if it breaks it doesn't matter because what we're doing is very casual so can you see you're getting an example of it sticks to everything we don't need that part so what I'm going to do now is take my paintbrush and I'm just putting a little bit of water on to the brush here and I'm going to put the water on to the cake and right where I want the gold leaf to go so I'm just putting a little bit of water the water is going to help the gold leaf stick so now I'm going to take that piece that I had here and I'm going to lift it up and I'm just going to transfer it to that area where the water is like that and just press it on like that now once you've got it on there take a makeup brush you can dab it on there like that and you can also take your paintbrush and you can kind of like frill the edges and give it a little bit more like dimension to it so it's not so strict that piece looks pretty good we'll go on with the other pieces going all the way around the outside of the cake well just keep going now that I've finished off the gold leaf we're going to finish off the geode here by placing those extra white crystals or the clear crystals on top here just making sure that its meeting up from the ones that we had inside and that they're meeting up with that gold leaf on the edge so I'm going to go around and just finish this layer off so I'm adding a border here between my two cake layers and I'm just starting with the darkest colors at the bottom and I'm then I'm moving up the lighter blues up towards the top just like I did on the inside of the geode and what I really like about this part is that you can be like as precise as you want or you can be totally random I'm just using the gel paste to get the piping gel to get that to stick like that and so I'm just going to go around the top here and I'm also going to do the same on the bottom where the cake meets the cake board so our final step before the cake once we are finished the border is to take our large chunks of rock candy the rock candy on a string and inter place them with some of these pieces of the other rock candy the rock candy on the stick and just kind of like change up with the color a little bit of a difference there so just arrange it so it's really nice on top here now I got all of the candy on Amazon and I'll put a link in the description box to where you can get it yourself now if you are having a little bit of trouble with these guys sticking you can always use piping gel to have them stay there and I'm going to finish off the top and then be ready to show you guys the finished product so there you go everybody the completed geode cake I hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial I absolutely loved this cake and like I said in the beginning it's one of my new favorite ones is one of the most favorite ones that I've ever made I love the way that the inside is just that dark deep hollow in there and it complete it's completed around the outside with this border of the rock candy and the big giant chunks on top I hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial as much as I did thank you so much for watching remember to subscribe to the channel and I will see you guys all again next time", "0CZ4j_sYlyI": "now we're going to fit the marzipan layer to the cake we're going to cut it around

about geo cakes you guys have left a ton of comments and umcg a we're gonna do it today did you see G is this this is my friend Miss Rachael trooper who probably made the most epic Cheerios cakes ever and it went super viral last year how much you helped you win unique one today and I could probably feed a possum let's go [Music] all right we're going to start by chopping up our 8-inch chocolate cake wait wait before you get started I have something special for you okay I know once you get your hands all messy I know how much you love your shirts so I had something custom-made for you I'm gonna get it in cake suza is also Mac Daddy sugar mama it works right should I put it on okay I think it looks pretty awesome Mac Daddy all right let's make this cake okay do you like garbage trick right away boy yeah who doesn't the boys love garbage shake you're gonna have to you guys have to fire for it she gets first garbage a good thing it's really good okay it's on board all right you want to really tell to you right I do okay so we're going to do six layers all together by the way if you guys want any of the tools or recipes you see click the I above Rachel or you can get them in the description box below [Music] all right we're gonna fill this cake with chocolate buttercream and actually put in some candy rocks gonna be delicious because it's geode right well it sounds like a fine addition as well yeah it'll have a little crunch component to they kind of taste like a minute little surprise inside by the way Brandon ate one of those before he knew they were sitting here we could have bought them to shoot l know [Music] that isn't epically talking it is it was awesome to be perfect let's get her in the cooler will shave her chrome cutter come on let's show you my cooler [Music] so now we're going to cover my fear okay because part of the covering process is part of the technique so I'm going to marble so pawn it together and we're going to paint on top of it to create my version geo Rachael's would be a little more three-dimensional I'm digging to the case so I've got some plain white I'm going to roll into a log and then I have a little bit of this nice purple really glad you chose purple by the way yeah and then we're going to do a little bit of blue that'll be my color alright so I'm just going to twist so I kind of want to get as much color as I can here up on top like that and I'm going to roll this croissant looking thing out with some cornstarch my tears a 10 inch tear here's an eighth time to roll it a little bit bigger look how cool that looks I like how it's like starting to show through yeah we have that my bag so what I'll do is when I cover the cake and fun it these are my geode I'm going to use this as a guide and we're gonna paint on top of it with some confections because it would get really shiny alright you grab my cake at least beautiful oh do you have vanilla bean in it yeah and I'll bean in the cream the butter cream here we just right in the middle I don't want too much white space I want to get some of all of this my stuff [Music] I'm pretty close episodes I love the color combo it's cool right beautiful geo okay alright so now we're going to do my interpretation of geode oh the marbling is actually going to be my guide so I'm gonna start with this little area here this blue piece I've got a little bit of confectioner's glaze and I've got some different colors so I'm just going to kind of test out some things this one I think is probably too color I want because it's really dark see how dark it gets me to pretty awesome and so that's the difference between using like a vodka versus yes this is Beetlejuice literally Beetlejuice uh it's made from you see those are delicious people eat them all the time we didn't really don't need them so I just hydrated a little bit by the way when you're when you're doing this your brushes will speed up so you have to have the center as well you put this in water it will see don't need it so I'm just going to start by tracing and I'm putting kind of thick and then we're just going to move it around like a larger brush and then convection great is also really shiny mmm that's great to do yes so just start with that part and I'm just going to take regular glaze with no color and then I'll come back and sort of wash some of it away this one's a really thin line like the edge of a geode and then the rest of the color can kind of come into this area so the confectioners glaze is almost like an eraser sometimes to then say okay yes I mean we could sort of manipulate the color around and then it sets up pretty quickly but if you go back in with a little confectioners glaze it rehydrates itself Colette make sense it does so then you can change colors if you want I'll just do a little thing here I like how it almost gives like that ombre effect - yeah we're really happy videos yeah and then some of this color will be in the actual generic but the rest of it actually just paint with the glaze okay just so this section is really shiny yeah so then we'll come back undo gold on the outside and then what the goal we'll just come on the outside here and you stipple it a little bit should you see sniffles I don't know what he called it depends what were you doing with it daddy sure sorry I have a 9 year old at home so we dabble up let's see what am I don't I do the Charleston and we've never done so we need you re and your dude was amazing to it you're wrong come on you go a different direction okay ready this is what about cake Roman about okay that's right and I'm taking off for about 10 minutes so Joe over here what am i doing this is fun okay so what I'm going to do is actually use a cutter this is going to be a guide so rather than having a really organic looking geode we're going to go norton metric when it gets cool okay so with the cutter I just want to push and indent a little bit this is quite a cold cake we have here okay that's okay no  it's good so then what's nice about using the cutter is it allows to guide your knife so now you have this like till you're doing I'm sorry we're going to go find those rocks over there okay that's more fun okay so you just want to make sure you're going in at an angle so that all of those meet at the same spot you're cutting and look they're cutting in at another diamond so it's almost like making it for you no no okay so then once you have just sort of a general outline of it then you can come in and start peeling away so I know I'm sorry I'm going to really no no no I trust you okay trust me so see how most of that you can yeah that's good garbage right there so then you just want to make sure that this is nice and smooth in here okay right it's no it's just a diamond chase but inside can't believe you're eating cake without me oh geez once I licked all over the forest okay so then once you have once you have that cut then you can just use this again same color same cutter okay it's going to be a little bit different this time because what we're trying to do now is go in and fill this in oh sweet so you might be able to like fill in half of this right okay and then you'll come back and you can always see the other half but the goal is just to cover up whatever cake you have in there and now with this one I'm going to cut it because I know I don't need all of that so this one just goes and snugly in here so since the Geo cake went crazy right how many have you made a lot a lot so I think I did four last year and I already have six on the schedule for this upcoming year it's kind of crazy okay so that's all covered and we're going to put some crystals and some paint from some other things in here so I'm not too concerned if isn't like totally pressure okay right you're just what you're covering up Brown I'm just covering up Brown and again you could just use buttercream here too if we wanted and then I know it's really neat and it's so easy to I've never carved a cake after I covered it in fondant you're doing a tracking backwards I know I'm sorry it's a little backward so then just a little bit of gel and honestly we don't need much gel in here we're just going for tacky okay now this here comes the fun part right I'm kidding no other Rose is throwaway fun oh my god so I just write you know get a good handful use your fingers and just please you know I know creme to stick in there [Music] so this is kind of like what you do in your tutorial very lutely can we put the tutorial not that rachel has and it's really awesome sweet so quit the eye and you can see how she does a bunch of different ways right yes all right so now I want to create this like little frame around okay but this is the largest cutter I have so I'm going to show you a little trick so you do the same shape that you just cut and now you're going to just use your knife on your photos I'm faking it because if you don't have a cutter that's bigger you just kind of cut right around it okay and then we'll put this up animal painted cool okay and so I I mean you could use whatever a little bit of gel or a little bit of well I saying yeah lots of hot water and then just right around the outside edge shove those like that yeah so now you have you got a hit in your need well good and we'll paint it gold alright so when you're ready to paint Kendra's using alcohol and again it's delicious it is delicious and you know the alcohol won't affect the sugar at all that's correct so you want to use an alcohol I will just use powder will you cut you probably could but I don't think you'll get that like nice shiny right you like shiny or colors right and you won't get that nice shiny effect and then you just kind of go in in dab we learned that we just you just dab wherever you need you oh my go yes it's over your face oh sorry yeah like I'm exhausted boom exactly just for Nate Oh My so you just want to keep painting and usually I'll do something a little bit darker in the middle okay so now you're just going to paint hold all the way around we'll go cool that look now miss rachel is going to show us something that's gonna blow your mind we're going to make some agates out of ice and off yes I'm excited Pete you are you ready I'm so excited okay so what I want to do is make one of those agates and that's a slice of Geo yeah she's really question on this one I mean they do they look really cool there's a lot of ways you can do it this is a way that I have found the work the best this is just wait for paper remember there's a shiny guide globe or its shiny side up shut up this is silicon with just a little bit of shortening oh this is shortening why is it showing yeah here's the reason when you put alcohol or get wait for people why she wants to riffle right right so this is one way to stop it from rippling this hip right no it's from what your opinion so then a little bit of alcohol into our powder and then you're just going to do whatever shape you generally want to make because I normally like kind of spirally right like the rungs of a tree yeah sort of like that how old is this I guess he's one right now minute yeah so then you just want to use like some darker colors to come in with either a thinner you can use a thinner paint brush or just tip now I'm just using alcohol but are you charted with confectioner cool I have not and that's experiment I don't know that I want to I think you all do you want me to do it on this size so then I'll be responsible oh yeah nothing an idea why you do that okay I gotta go okay so I'm gonna make another shape for you just with the powder look at that Oh turned out good okay you have container okay yes right you're just little line if this doesn't work I'll totally take the plane will the flame Brennan I think okay I guess leave everything okay superbaby that's great so I'm going to add a little bit of hello [Music] awesome I know it's great look good so then the next thing you want to do is take sparkling sugar and you're going to stick it right in the center so we'll put a little in here these are our diamonds we love those on the show so then isomalt and then all I'm going to do is pour around four I'm starting first around the edge of the crystals and then you can make it as big or as small as you would like do you want to pour you a minute I want to do it okay I'm totally gonna screw it up why is so nervous don't burn yourself while you're doing that I'm just going to use my paintbrush and I'm pushing the crystals to create that hole and if you have any bubbles that are forming like on the top anywhere then you can always torch it behind you behind know I have these teeny tiny just little bubbles on the surface so I'm gonna be careful not to get the crystals what I'm moving us around uses yeah just move on into Oh baby how it's like create a little light you can even put you could put rock sugar around here oh you all right yeah absolutely watch after so I'm just a Joe hi I need to torch a lot I'm just using I liked it sir guy just when you put the torch it just get on the road a little bubbles so that that's how you're just gonna leave it perfect we're gonna let them cool until they're hard and then I'll show you how to do some awesome episode again okay cool we're ready to take them out yeah we're there now so I'm sorry I was going to say by the way we said that the connections glaze worked but if you look closely and everywhere I put the confectioners glaze there's little bubbles I'm thinking is probably reacting to the sugar too - so okay we'll stick with that okay boys alcohol and powders go or you could use like a gel color with short-haul or near brush colors anything that old that this will soak up right okay yeah okay let's do part taking your part okay super super easy you literally pop it off shut up no way that's right I got a watch and they're just complete this break your paper off is fine the child thank you okay so there you have just yours always if you have any excess like peeper megaphone and then just for your finishing touch then you want to use a little bit of alcohol okay and your gold color yes and then you can just paint the edges [Music] who's that let's go our cake together sweet alright now we're going to stack our cake using all the teeth rolls do you think that thank you yeah I use purple ones oh of course [Music] all right now it is time to add our agates with piping job I'm going to start by cutting into the cake so I can slide and a get inside so I think we should put one over on this side just for a little balance we're going to add a few modeling chocolate diamonds to add a little more color and one last I get to the top I'm going to color the rock candy with the same dust we used to paint and then we'll use piping gel to place it onto the white tears our geode cake is complete thank you guys for

where Louis [Music]", "hTiLompbHF4": "becoming an entrepreneur just doesn't happen overnight we've worked in the industry for multiple years we have the same workout yet we have the same idea for quality taste attention to detail things that are important to us hi I'm Nancy and I'm Gina and we owned the vintage Kate in Atlantic islands it's kind of like creating a little mini work of art that's very specific it's custom to somebody it's nice getting to know each customer each client and connecting with them every client is a little different so that's where every single cake is a little different we can create whatever our clients want you're going through this process of making a big decorating the cake and then you're delivering the cake and all this this whole time you have this wherever that pressure but the way every step of the way from the first email to tasting to them dropping off their toppers and then us putting it out there and putting those fresh flowers on the cake the things that they want in and making sure it's perfect like we would want it exactly so we treat every client as if how we would want to be treated", "Hy1V51nyvts": "welcome back right now of course we are in the middle of a wedding season it's kicked up into high gear and that usually means of course the big fancy cake it's not your mother's or your father's a wedding or groom cake anymore kicking it up notch bride and groom's they're going all out on all different kinds of designs and themes that we're seeing these days yeah and hay cakes aren't just even for weddings though cakes are a great way to celebrate any kind of special occasion and joining us in the studio this morning we have Desiree Kellis from Makery rather than bakery I see your shirt there it's got to be crossed off maker eat cake company we're so happy to have you here and these are some beautiful cakes that you've brought with you these are amazing and I can tell you I have only made one of them myself my staff are amazing so Bobbie Nicole and Megan I just have to give a little shout-out to them because they are phenomenal I mean the geode here with that that is very Colorado yeah I know so many friends that love G here in Colorado absolutely well the wedding cake is kind of transformed over the years and you get some pretty wild requests yes what's the what's say the strangest requests for her wedding cake they've gotten I would have to say we are in Colorado and it sort of goes along with the theme but the one person asked me for an outhouse on top of their wedding cake and so I said okay I made it out of white chocolate and I made the tumbleweeds out of hot sugar and it just it looked awesome we put a bunch of sunflowers around it it was great well if someone is shopping for a wedding cake what should sort of their first steps be well the first thing they need to do is figure out what style they want so they have to go online they have to look at a few pictures they can go through my album but chances are you know there's a particular style may not be in there so I have our brides bring us two to three pictures that they really like and then we kind of compile oh you like this design this design let's put it all together into something just a unique for you the detailing is amazing especially on the displays that you've brought in what's the longest it's ever taken you to make a wedding cake to make a wedding cake so minimum a wedding cake is about a 20 hour endeavor well so if you're gonna talk something that's more competition quality such as like the steampunk up here that one took almost 30 hours to produce that brings me to my next question the heck would you transport this like isn't that not terrifying like I don't want to drop the cake I don't wanna be the one that ruins the special day like a big van yeah we did have to rent a u-haul about a week and a half you're kidding order yes it was that big how do you keep it safe you can't put a seat so we use a lot of precautions and cakes like that and the chandelier cake over there we actually put together on site because you want your cake to look like it's falling over you don't want it to fall over before you get there yeah so we usually send one or two decorators on the job and so for instance the chandelier cake takes two people two hours just to put it together much less definite man labor yes it is and so it's very time-intensive something that not everybody is up for all right and also with wedding cakes if you have sort of the design picked out but you you don't know what kind of cake to put inside or the frosting and the tasting like how you go through that whole process so we realized early on that brides and grooms are very overwhelmed with the whole wedding cake process and so we have an open house every Sunday from 1 to 3 or you can just come in try some cake look at pictures ask all the questions you want we always have a sugar artist there for you to answer all of those questions then once you've had five different flavors you're kind of more comfortable you kind of got an idea you know we sit down one on one and we say okay you want this flavor this flavor and at that time when you make your appointment you can request a couple flavors so if we didn't give you what you're looking for at that appointment we give you a couple more and we just take you through the whole process kind of hold your hand because most people haven't done it before I'm so enamored by the detailing and so interested in in the process from start to finish if you mess up do you just start all over again well luckily it's just sugar and you can rip it off and do it again but it is artwork and if you aren't happy with it you can't rip it off and do it again depends on how far you're into it though I mean if you have four hours then you don't want to rip that off and start again yeah so usually it's a lot of just creativity I love to hire artists and teach them to decorate cakes because you can't hire a cake Dekker decorator and teach them to be artistic okay so it's it's a very different thing well thank you one last question if somebody does want to order a wedding cake how far in advance they do that before their wedding yeah it depends on when they're getting married okay so if you're getting married in like May through September you want to order six months in advance if you want the Baker you want if you don't really care then you can walk in two weeks ahead up to a bakery that you don't really care about but if that wedding cake is really important to you and you want somebody to do it right and do it well and make sure nothing's gonna happen then you book your person six months in advance well that's very tell us about an interesting unique event coming up if this is what your interest if you're interested in making wedding cakes yes an event so the sweet times in the Rockies sugar arts show is coming up September seventh through ninth it is at the Colorado Convention Center and it is in conjunction with the Colorado Home Show for the fall so they have not only competition we're not only people of our level are competing but children starters everybody is competing and so then there's also classes there's all the way from a beginner class where you just don't even know all the way up to people making busts and using make your paper Larry this little flower amazing that's right thank you so much we're gonna enjoy the cake that you've got an amazing cake by the way yes it's so good oh my gosh thank you so much well we take a break from our job send it over to your on this Jessica LaBelle who's crunching numbers working really hard one of us around here doing something hey save some cake for me will

wanted to be a pastry chef all my life I wanted to do it and then say it's always been a dream come true really now we are the new phase of the business where we just move our studio and our punishment kitchen to this new place in the papacy week where we got people who are now able to walk in taste all the cake eat them here or buy them to take home I'm gonna same time we're gonna start doing poufy classes if they want to make their own wedding cakes they can learn how to do it as well I should be fun revenue but no stuff we all been to weddings you know maybe remember what the cake look like but definitely we can't remember what it tastes like or because it was not nice to taste like oh you know we're drunk too busy dancing or you know or doing or having a good time and then you don't realize it's been served and either the following morning you found some dried slices on them on the top of the counter or wrapped in a paper napkin the new pockets so people come to us and they say right I want to I'm going to spend so much money that I want the cake would taste nice I don't want my guests to go like wow it's nothing wrong with them we were you know food cakes I mean I love a good slice of fruitcake and I think that the main problem is people are so used to have some bad ones and there's so many bad food cake arounds in a very dry crumbly with no food inside so that's what people try to keep away from it and then but you know these days there's so many option from carrot cake to lemon cake to raspberry and cream with the chocolates I mean you know it's stopped to your imagination really and of course you can do different layers so you know if you want to please the oldies with with the food cake let's do it you know I've won tiered a fruitcake on you know surprise all the others with something much lighter so here we are I never exciting day in a kitchen you know Friday's the big day because because tomorrow Saturday is always the busiest time for wedding wedding cakes and I'm just doing the finishing touch of his design here with a double layered marbled effect cake with chocolate cigars mixed together especially when you design we've just created and I'm just going to finish the both the bows are actually made of chocolate as well it's a mixture of stop every three coats so you can use it like like what you put like play-doh really but of course it's edible no like I do the clipping a better cake like this it will be able to serve it as a dessert inside you know like on the bottom we got a mixture of milk and dark chocolate movies and the the white chocolate white chocolate tears Ashley's got like a layer of raspberry on some cream with a mixture of cream with mascarpone cheese it's a lovely dessert we should buy a coulis to serve with it so it's really you know complete is a final touch with just I think they found here on a on the top with the kind of marble effect we managed by just pouring some dark chocolate ganache on white chocolate ganache together a little bit wave together mixing to get this at the stunning look a budget is always a difficult part part of the wedding you know everybody wants something spectacular but you know if you're on the budget his way to make it to make it work one with more more fashionable anyway but anybody who is not even in the budget is to use the cake as a dessert for your reception you save the money of the of the wedding cakes with the dessert so you end up with them you know kind of larger budget for your cakes or the other way to do it as well it's you know good do it yourself and wedding without the cake either nose like the bride without the wedding dress I suspect you have to have it some people on some people now is trying to do some kind of cheese wedding cakes and anything and to be honest you know do you want to sit in a room where for six hours with like a block of cheese on top of each other which is the smell no stick to the cake or in

firstly we are going to create the marble I've got some white paste and a tiny amount of black you want to just need that together if you want a dramatic white and gray marble then you only need to do this step but I want a more subtle transition due to it having a painted name on it if the pattern is too strong it will overpower the name so I'm mixing together a white grey and small bits of black start kneading this until you get the effect you want be careful not to over knead it emerge the color together too much as you start to roll it out you'll see the pattern emerge the best part is if you don't like that side you have an alternative just flip it's over this side is too strong for the name to be painted so I'm going to use the softer side cover your cake like normal this is a seven inch if you new here and wondering why I skim over some of the steps it's because I already have a more in-depth tutorial on each section so I can point you there using the iCard above rather than keep repeating the same steps over and over because that would get super boring I have a video on ganache in how to make ganache how to cover a care can get the sharp edges and how to cover the board around the cake feel free to check those out for a longer look at those steps the top tier is a five inch cake which is covered in white sugar pest and it's elevated on a small top as we are painting this we don't want to accidentally stick the cake to the acrylic board with all that wet paint so any wet paint should hopefully drip off as its elevated now rose-gold that's subjective everyone has a different idea on how it looks just as some people will say one color is near there and two others it's purple and don't even get me started on that stripy dress that went viral it was clearly a navy and black but I'm going to show you how I got this rose gold that was similar to my iPhone color and not to heavy copper looking like most can be what we're going to have to mix it ourselves as it rose gold it makes sense to start with gold so I've got Rambo dust metallic gold treasure of this to a ball next I have metallic Moroccan velvet which is a pinky red torned luster just a tiny amount of that we also don't want it too dark so we can lighten it with white I suggest a white luster but I only have this which is snowdrift white powder then you need liquid I actually recommend lemon extract for Penton but of course I have to run out of that too so the next on the list is vodka add that to the ball of dusts and mix it together with a large flat brush roll out a test piece of sugar paste and give it a quick try this one is too gold so we're going to add more Moroccan velvet so this one is darker put too orange we are now getting towards copper so we need that rose element again I would suggest a luster version but I only have regular pink this is dusky pink rainbow dust now we are getting closer we've got the pink this is the topper I ordered in rose gold but actually looks more pink told you it's subjective after a few more tweaks of dust to lighten it up with white we have got the iPhone rose gold color paint the mixture onto the set cake if a sugar purse is soft you risk creating slight dents with the brushstrokes try and keep your strokes the same whether you go up and down or left to right now leave this court to completely dry don't be tempted to pens over it yet as you will pull off patches of pent once it's fully dried out on other courts it's looking a little less patchy now then add a final layer yes rose-gold Dow all your marbles here again I always use one more straw than the size of the tier going above so the kick going on is 5 so I use 6 straws I've left links to everything I use in the description box below I stick the tiers together with ganache if you get any paint transfer you can clean it off with vodka on a parent brush and some kitchen roll to dab it off I've traced the name on to grease proof paper with a pencil and you just want to hold it into position with acupuncture needles follow the name with either a pencil or a Dresden tool to leave a faint impression the impression makes it easy to paint the near mom with the same rose gold mixture paint the near mom with a fine paintbrush you might need to go over it a few times for this cake we are using artificial roses arrange them on top of the cake how you like them and then push down so the stark parts makes an impression in the pest What's Left Behind is a ring of circles so you know where to add some of the soft sugar Pierce to act as a support attach a lump of Pierce to the center big enough to cover the holes and then pinch over it to make it less obvious then go ahead and press the stems of the roses into the lump of pest the topper I got online has quite a short stick and it's not really long enough to keep it secure so you can add your own longer one with some hot glue and a kebab stick insert this down into the Keck and fill the remaining gap with the rose to up the rose to the board use a small ball of grid pest hold the Rose in position so you can see where it needs adding push the stock into the balm luster is the ribbon add a tiny blob of royal icing to one end of the black ribbon and stick it to the front right of the cake snip the ribbon to size and stick a gun with a blob of icing now for the ball tie a regular knot into the middle of the ribbon then loopable as usual pulling the loops as big as you want them next we need to attach it here I've inserted a pin the head of the pin is just hidden behind the knot you just pulled the front not to one side and push it in I suggest a smaller headed pin but I only have these large diamond ones now if you see my ganache in video you'll know I stacked my cakes on drums so behind this black ribbon is a character um that you can securely push the pin into so no need to have a heart attack it's not going in the GECK the tails of the ball can get a little unruly and stick out where they want so you contain them a little by adding blobs of royal icing and sticking them to the sides of the cake much better and we're done a modern rose gold or marble cake fits for a birthday queen hope you enjoyed this tutorial if you did please consider sharing it it's free or leave me a comment below thanks guys bye", "qjV0bkv9qx4": "when you think about a wedding reception a towering wedding cake inevitably comes to mind besides your down it's what everyone remembers the wedding cake to me is a showpiece next to the bride and I think it should be honored that way so make it extraordinary first look through the magazines and search online for ideas then go ahead book your cake designer and get creative look for somebody that is actually going to be able to create something spectacular for you and create original designs and pay close attention to detail because after all it's those details that make your cake unique well the details that make a cake stand out that make a distinctive would be number one of course the sugar flowers which are botanically correct and they're very beautiful to look at you can save them they last forever when you step back a little it really looks like they're real genuine flowers it's absolutely extraordinary colors are very important pink is the color of love yellow is the color of friendship white is the color of purity and red is the color of passion it's actually quite fashionable to use red in weddings and some of today's trends are fast becoming wedding cake traditions the ribbons are something that's been popular for the last couple of years and it just keeps going I think it's gonna be something that stays with us a long time and don't be afraid to add your personality into the mix if you love shoes make them your cake topper love your dress bring the design from your wedding gown onto the cake when it comes to customizing your cake anything goes one of the biggest trends that we've noticed in cake design lately is customizing with monogram jewelry and other accessories Krystal monograms hearts flowers butterflies dragonflies and all kinds of accessories all of which can be personalized we offer multiple fonts and different styles and 14 colors are Swarovski crystal no matter how you style your cake what's more important is that you have enough cake for everyone Atticus they should have at least one slice of cake for all of your guests so based on that you can kind of get a rough idea of how many tiers you'll need based on the number of people that you're going to have to feed dessert to if you're having a small wedding but still want a big cake there are ways to take any cake to new heights our cake stands are one of most unique things in cake bakeries right now because the cake stands and the platters allow for a tremendous air space in between the tiers not all the tiers have to be real cake you can build up to whatever height you want on the other hand if you're feeling generous some of those tiers if they're left uncut can be donated after the reception but each tier doesn't have to stand alone when it comes to taste flavor is every bit as important as the way your wedding cake looks and don't be afraid to use different cake flavors or fillings for each tier of your wedding cake not only can you have an abundance of flavors but you can even have an abundance of cakes I think that's really trendy right now is actually not cakes a little mini cakes and cupcakes I think they're absolutely fun and interesting and it gives each guest a reception a paper they can either eat it or they can take it home and they allow you more freedom with your cake design you can make each cake different but you may still want to be sure you have a smaller traditional wedding cake so you don't miss out on all those fun wedding cake traditions", "bxlwcOCefGc": "[Music] do [Music] do [Music] do [Music] do [Music] so [Music] do welcome to community cannabis review today i'm going to be reviewing some corova extracts so corofa has um unrivaled they say which i can actually agree with unrivaled is their little tagline and they have a reputation they have a reputation for sure um particularly in california i think they just moved operations up to oregon um i haven't seen kerogen stuff around here very for very long at all but um in california they have quite the reputation primarily for their edibles that's actually their website just corroborateedibles.com even though they make more than edibles but they're known for doing 1 000 milligram edibles and i've heard someone say two thousand milligram edibles as well don't know if that's true but either way that's crazy um i would love that because i really like edibles but all the edibles here are 50 milligrams that's maximum so i it's just too little for me so i end up having to just eat raw oil or capsule it or something and that's never fun or it's not nearly as fun as eating a brownie or a cookie so these people can make some seriously good edibles um we'll see if they make some good extracts i saw some of their pre-packed flour and i've seen pictures of the same stuff from california it looks great and um a lot of the strains that i saw on the flower they have the exact strains in this x-factor i'm thinking that it's cured resin um i gave you a close-up of all of it and it looks great it smells great it's really exciting and i managed to get this for super super cheap it's i want to say rec price is normally like 18 to 20 bucks but i might just combine a couple sales which usually don't let you do but i don't think i was supposed to be able to or whatever but i managed to get it for 11 67 a gram each so it's like 45 46 something like that 46 bucks or something like that for all four grams um yeah it says 1667 here right um regular so that comes out to 20 rec so that's my um talking on corolla really interesting brand i'm glad they moved up here excited to try it out which they have edibles up here as well but just not the same because they make 50 milligram edibles up here to comply with our laws and now that california has um dose limits i think corova has also had to drop their doses in california as well so that's kind of a bummer anywho um i wanted to start i'm going to try and do two in these in this video because i got four strains here that would be too long of the video um i want to do two one that i know and then one that i want to try wedding cake is one that i know this is a very classic you'll see that i have a couple wedding cake videos on my channel already and i've tried it a couple times even before i started making videos really great um middle i call it a middle of the ground string because it has a lot of just basic terpenes but it exemplifies them very well let's see if this seems to be a good take of um what am i trying to say a good example of wedding cake here we go okay so yeah that smells just like i remember that's very like cardio filling i want to say cardiophiline dominant just from the smell but i don't quite remember it might be miracin but it really does just have a good combo of those two i think limiting as well it's a really good combo of all three of those and they don't nothing stands out too much it's just a very good mixture of these let's see taste wise the extract itself looks nice handles nice this one comes in i didn't even read the cannabinoids but i showed them to you um so you should if you want you can go to the beginning of the video and pause and check out how much txt and cbd each have but i'm pretty sure this one has i want to say like 71 i can see right here actually 71 point 13 um 13 and there's little tags on the side but i tore most of them off because you need to just open them and i i don't know how much cbd it was but none of them have too much cbd there's nothing see me like no cbd heavy streams it's got i think two percent it says oh yeah it tastes just like it smells a bit stronger oh i burned my nose with it don't exhale dabs out your nose that tastes so good though holy crap all right i'm just going for taste so i'll call it quits there's excuse me that's my first dab for the day and so that effect is also very good man it's not lacking an effect or anything that was just like my preliminary let's see if they're getting their strains right and whatnot and it seems like they're probably just um extracting this it looks like it says on here um letterman ltr mn or something like that which is a company out here they're probably having letterman extracts their the flour that they also prepack or something like that but i mean it looks the flour looked really good and this is definitely tasty and the effect is very good so all right so let's try out a stream that i haven't tried let's see if we can get some interesting flavors in here there's mango rose and golden pineapple that are speaking to me mango rose being big bud crossed with white widow golden pineapple being golden goat with pineapple kush so i'm going to go with one of those i'm going to look into both them real quick while i cut the camera and clean this and i'll come back with one that sounds like it'll taste interesting but that one was a very very good example of wedding cake that's how it should taste so they're doing everything right that's the first thing i'll say and that's great all right let's move on all right um so i've actually done this twice now two other times and something's happened two times in a row so both of the times after i've already heated up the dab so i'm taking both dabs because i'm not going to waste it some good ass concentrate and then i got distracted and did my laundry and i i don't know i'm just hoping it works this time and my video doesn't get screwed up cause i'm violently high okay all right so um i chose mango rose couldn't find much about this strain and um the other one uh well to be fair i guess this is citrus so i was going to say the other one is like mostly like i said here seeing cardio filling but also has some limonene in it and that's kind of what gives it some of that tang so i didn't want to go for something that's probably just going to be heavy and lemony and this one also will just mix it up so i've tasted it a couple times now but i'll try and pretend this is my first time um so it works from mango rose as well pineapple the pineapple strain was very similar in consistency to wedding cake um and this one is much more saucy so i figure that's uh that gives you or gives me as well an idea of what both types of consistent both ranges of the consistency are oh man yeah so this one really is so good it's very interesting when i got this originally um i got one of each strain to be fair so i wasn't really picking and choosing but mango rose i assumed it was like mango and rose and wine that's i'm pretty sure that's what rose is but that really really does just smell like um like lemony rose it smells a lot like sticking your nose in a rose so um that's very interesting let's i don't know what terpenes are involved in that but it smells very good very fresh and clean as well all right so i'm going to stick you know no i'm going bigger going home doing a normal size dab again let's be gone but yeah so well i already showed you a close up this is a lot more saucy like just nice like it reminds me of applesauce it's like that perfect consistency where the other one was a little more like um i don't know what you you kind of saw it i guess uh a little more chunky but um it's still solid so yeah i'm not sure what it's what i would call the other um consistency so let's see let's get some notes on the taste here this is truly one of the better concentrates i've had in a while so it amazes me how cheap i've gotten it and to be fair i've been buying a lot of budget concentrates so it's a low bar to break but it definitely broke the bar oh yeah right right off the bat getting citrus notes that's really good that's like um what is that i mean that's like straight um lemonade and pining which is a very interesting combo man that's good though that that smell and taste is actually really nostalgic back to just like christmas it's like faintly piney so you definitely get like that pine tree smell but um man that lemon and i feel like there's something else that's maybe terpene because it's just so good um i don't know if i'd quite say yeah i guess i could see some mango but it's closer to some type of citrus mixed with pine and that's like that might be one of my favorite strains which i've never heard of this string and i swear this is one they made themselves a big bud crossed with white widow making mango rose oh yeah lemonade and piney that is a great combo i suggest you all look for that i'm very excited to see what i have in store and the other two strains i haven't tried then because that one's really really good and the other one i knew what to expect because i'm familiar with that and they pulled it off well so corova well done i see why your reputation is high or highly regarded or whatever however you should word that um it will stay the same here i imagine um in oregon so thanks for bringing the business here um to everybody who watched it i recommend you try it out for sure um edibles or extracts or flour really it all looked pretty good and i've only tried the extracts but i'm assuming it was made from their flour so that says something about their flour so to everyone viewing thanks for watching like and subscribe stay tuned for more videos and keep talking have a great day", "t3pHVcgFFyU": "so today we have Brian from Baker boy brain I actually have to say thank you so much for taking time I know you were twelve months of the year seven days a week the last holiday is this but Brian yeah cuz cake I've been excited I love eating your cake obviously butter what goes on behind the scenes when I'm actually just standing there robbing your cake usually the show like I always bring hexagons for customers and suppliers I went to my mom's house on the way home and I had cake and I take my I've got some cake she was like I have that one would take it was so funny because they have to get permission to take the cake off me all the way it would be free frogs do that fair yeah twofer and actually before we go any further because I my friend is going to and to get back to me if I don't say this so I'm supposed to say asking for a friend whose name is Alice kidney what is in your white sugar only question Jesus I like that you put whatever you want into my signature one would be the role as munchies Marty's hey I should get the caramel make some children but ice and that's for research and Marta fight make sure we put this on Instagram later on Alice kidneys welcome back to cake I'm I suppose when it comes to picking okay grace so you've got like the aesthetic beautiful looking cakes then there's the taste what would you prioritize taste taste yeah it's food yeah I mean I suppose like Oh more or everything yes your cake and look amazing you might have it but you want to taste as good because you know as much as people would say like when you're at the venue might have been drawn about the meal yes they also taste the cake and like if that cake is bad don't mean if it falls a pair of just crumble just dry or whatever that goes out as well and it'll fall back on you and it'll affect everything so you want to taste and there's one thing I'm very proud of with my reviews when I have your people always say the cake tastes better than it looked and that's what you want that is a really good compliment your cakes look amazing yes I suppose that is I mean when it comes to actually tasting your Baker's cake I suppose before you book the way like obviously there's a couple of ways are on like for tasting cake like a majority with let's say German when you're doing your wedding fairs on one habit yeah I always bring samples you know I mean it's not general that a cake will bring samples because I know all those that don't but I do bring samples and when I'm doing it I also and I'm killed over that the portions are too big but like always a wedding and your cake has caught up its inch by inch that's what your portion control goes up so I haven't caused death size or the node and the size of the cake they're going to get on today and that's my thinking behind it you need to taste the cases you can't taste your cake if does that size so that's why I always have the bigger sizes you can taste they you tended with a pretty wide range when it comes like I suppose the most popular you get asked for is that kind of what you'd bring yeah in a sense fibers and pop or ones like it like the white chocolate and you mentioned chaotix mm-hmm I know this seems like a sure you just cut the cake and people take pictures and it's as simple as that but there's actually it's it's when you cut the cake with that like in changes and I suppose like traditionally it was I suppose when you go order actually mediums cut the cake and service right but that and I don't see that anymore here from the point of view I said there was so much places it's a cake like you're after a big four or five course meal and then they're putting cake in front it's not gonna be eaten you know I mean so now the couple take a photograph just for the cheering in to get mortified and the testa photographer has the photographed on at that stage already and then the cake is tends to be served later on okay what does different ways are on this no yeah because there was a wee thrown a couple weddings together where I think it was not so much summer before it was nice they had and you caught her naked cake words and when they arrive to the venue and this would have been like to have to read four o'clock in the day they actually cooked their cake yeah right there and then and then they served it to people in the drinks reception before they died lovely yeah more more deaf no let's say with people they said are having in-house ceremonies especially with an 8 UK because they said that's me it fresh that morning and you know I mean it could be the moist this cake in the world but the lumber that cake is out there because just know what I say like buttercream around it to keep it from drying out or whatever it does dry out it that's inside in a room full of people I mean it doesn't matter but it's all like people are doing like the afternoon tea star party and they're serving is having their under invites let's say like that so many two o'clock yeah then you might seek a coughing ceremony at 3 o'clock and even though the lads are coming in board with it and they're doing their speeches are on there as well so it's changing speeches and the drinks reception a lot of people are kind of just bringing a shmore into the daytime rather than the nighttime you get parts of you that make sense because there is a lot to it and I suppose there's the day to them as well some people today - a lot of people in one from last year I've seen a big trend last year let's say like that the food cake was there that night but again because the soul food when they do tend to starve the cake at 11 o'clock that night you already have all a finger food that is included in your package whereas day - no I'm finding is becoming nearly as big as day one where the still having parties of like 100 closer might have it so they're not cutting behavior wander saving it for day two and like they're having a case and couples I always find like the baking I'm finding is let's say like on day one like it might be the case of the the granny or the mom or the end while happy with sit down have a source of energy to keep going for days I mean and that's what I'm finding what colors are like that again this age I mean like I never just say at 3 Theo will do 120 to 140 for portion control Wow okay and like a lot of weddings I'm finding this year like they're open to 222 I have it they've gotten much bigger haven't English numbers have gone way because if there was trend of a Honda 220 yeah and I find this year asking people it's all over 200 sure it's not creeping off the tree on trips it's changed again doesn't it but just didn't staying with the three or four tier cake and I mean like to see that amount of people you know eating family I've done like three and four tear cakes for everyone here tier was cake yeah it's just a rotten Cake Eaters and they were just doing it front photographs or just to keep family members happy and stuff like you know that means that like this and I suppose where you place the cake as well in your venue be it day one or day two it's it's so important as well but it's good because you put so much thought into the cake yeah it should be a bit of a focal points yeah no changing around they say from this let's say the cake shop in the corner today from Verizon I'm gonna share my passion is my pee pee feeler hints and tip you go into a huge voter and its stomach and the only coroner that was that free is under the emergency exit door the emergency exit sign it's your wedding cake don't put it by the to be they're going is anyone looking right you get that side I got this tarnish into the room so that because you think about these things yeah cuz you've thought about how your case gonna look where do I put it we should be part of your table plan this is yeah if it's gonna go with your banker you should be really thought about you know some places have a grease kind of they have their area for their cake and it's beautiful yeah stage and is all draped lighting behind it and they do it like camera working yeah but these things are all things to think about anything because generally you've put sausage Reiki attunement - where are you gonna put it cuz it cuz I know when you go in my cow have to say I'm gonna talk about this a bit more you'd have to set off where you just at the cake off but you've been told that's where the case going set the cake up there you can't really be like in the bride and groom when we sit at the consultation we'll sit down and like because I've done so many but I suppose for use well like you were saying about like a naked cake since you know drying it this is not like you took this abuse for window on us a summers day not gonna put your cake and again they said you have to take that into consideration or an under ahe's er yes in here in here like you're setting up the cake that's a which I mean what were you wanted on how you're solving is time for serving you John I mean and yeah let me suppose when I cook will kind of before we go away from the taste side of things it's important when it comes to tasting a cake a lot of people they might have an idea like what I think I think chocolate biscuit cake is something that just comes into my head I love chocolate escaped that's me but then there's other cakes as well the wait a cement all right actually like us and kind of a deeper self into possibilities and think because if it came from like this endless possibilities out several flavors a cake okay like I used to do a multitude of favors but I just find that the same time like I know it's the corpus big day yeah it's what they want to might have but I'm still finding them more coppers when they're going to do their consultations yeah you're still trying to think what K could be used well this is true the other 100 or 200 people are pointing with lavender and rose water or something in it it might be your flavor yeah so like what I'm finding like people who are going like two tiers of generic cake okay isn't not generic but of it and then they might have that top tier that's their flavor that's we're not cutting that we're taking them for ourselves I guess that's the flavor they like you know I mean and it's not been touched and that's where people are coming around I mean like the champagne cakes and stuff like that again gentlemen it could be the bride's favorite cake but not everybody would like you know I mean so that's pretty room could break groom groom could have opposite talks as well half of its gonna be yours and half it's gonna be mine exactly like you can still do a lot of flavors whatever I'm going to try and consider what flavors will be used up cause you won't be easy all three tiers of the cake it's okay be easy yeah I think second people don't realize this some people say oh you've done I mean I want to treat our cake you might have you what I have enough cake okay because I know the whole way of like it was like was it fruitcake food cake and white icing and then you just freeze your fruit cake for the first job is done in dusted like the first best thing okay bizarre keeping it for the first anniversary is what I figure hearing now with a moment like and any because I said device your biscuit here lemon they all freeze they worry sir oh yeah once they arrived in Greece roof [Laughter] it was in between like a remembered the day before like between texting people from an airport I might have you finish are very good at what they do but you know okay now I must say my wife may be a 40th birthday cake which is fab you know the kids you enjoy the difference between I have to do it okay this times are three to four o'clock in the morning like when you're finishing a you know like job as these always says I get a power nap if I get my half hour per night and we can't do that I can't do half hour like a dream today yeah Energizer Bunny issues has not forged organs you can't be like right okay I'm gonna bake all my cakes today for the house refresh from weddings like it's always I suppose it's always a three-day that's kinda like the way it walk it so they say oh if you're starting this example if your wedding is on a Saturday yeah if the statute week on the Monday you're sitting down doing your list and you're doing your planning and if you can get ahead with decorations you're getting that prep or throwing up scale on the way in Salinas always my pen is always on a Wednesday it's baked a in the morning but before you go to bed that night they're like they're layered and organized and ready in the fridge and sitting overnight so they settle over knives and then the next day you're I see em because I always have with a treaty or four-tiered I always do it at home i assembly with home know I know what a cop is Assemblyman sight and it's just I mean well I suppose you can get a completely 100% we want to catch it before it leaves the house just so used to be that is just my wings what they always have to be standing and settled the night before so that would in there's no fear anyway they're dulled and support and my head was it's almost like a three-day process yeah for one waiting game yeah I can see what you're before yeah so make you do listen I mean you're stifling from as I said from the wins it to bake-off but like on that Wednesday every day they're baked off fresh no money as I said they're layered and it's gonna act ready for icing then for the next for the throne so on throws it in depending on your decoration like you get a mice forcely yeah and in your structure declaration or whatever big-ass decoration that's where I mean just for example there's a one decoration it's called freeze it's like ruffles is so fun a cake yeah you can go friend that could take anything from 48 hours to do office and a button here so is that you need that time the day before to start and getting your Walker and a few two or three wedding cakes undergo for one week so you won't be adding a layer going to the next cake heading set and then you're coming back to this end was like can have you know people say how can I justify spending money is the same where everything that was money in abandoned or if that was money on a wedding cake I think you've just justify do if you're making flowers like for a cake you know ya like to do X amount of prices for your cape or flower line or additional add-on because like I suppose I'm kind of known as well from flower concave what I mean and that's what every every role doesn't take anything like you make a row sum up to 15 minutes per rolls like there's another fleur-de-lis and that teams over the later time it could take up to two hours to make one flower or a peony you know means so that's what you're claiming stuff comes involved in the play because you always deliver the cake obviously then to the venue they're getting married in and then you have to make the commute time then there's the set-up time because it's not just like you know we don't get to see that side of things and then in between they say like you've you've the emails and they all the admin that goes along whatever you yeah before they're at the point where they've chosen their cake a consultation or something that you would do with a couple and so they might have tasted it already but would you is there like a tasting consultation just before the wedding yeah it's kind of the several ways I walked at Lee yeah they say like first of all I say if you've been like at a wedding Fair or a hotel feel I always have said was there so they get to know the taste before they actually say here's the booking fee exactly booked you for a consultation and then coming on for a check from the way I walk things then I would have specific dates yeah and time as I said that the couple they say on Saturday is there an X and on Monday evenings there and why there's different time starts and you can hook into your time so call me there and I have a load of selection favors I'm always Kilda like too much cake there but that's joining you need to taste the cake which I mean you need to know watcher this is why you're purchasing it isn't it's it's the it's the taste factor it's like sort of sit down and eat whatever cake they want and they can discussed in about their designs of might have a consultation it's the ones who may all see the groom's oh I see the groom's I'd like you mitigating my conversations are really boring there's no cake at mine yeah exactly and I do a final consultation and once they've booked in okay I do another consultation and that can be anything so there's quite a lot of process to it yeah okay and then from three months to a month a month I mean sometimes I make poppers Monday they might on the Friday and that's just just time constraints that they eat raw meat very traveling one habit and to me that's not stress okay before the Wednesdays I mean like beforehand if it comes down to on a Monday we'd have a fair idea where we're going with a design it and CASAC to make flowers yes the actual design side of things so many different types of candles and I know some things sometimes like things can be a little bit on training that certain certain color yeah I don't find I mean I know painting put up this big color every year but last year I think I don't need two wedding cakes for the whole year that had this car a color okay like the blues and the greens and Hunter greens they're in white color isn't the raise my score is it's a team of their day like they bring it into their cake a bit as well and they say sometimes like you had to blush pink gosh peaches and all this kind of little pastel shades of colors and yes they'll bring them into the cake with navies what have you like it's quite there know you can and I've done it a good for your time I mean even let's say having a partner Navy and then you might do a navy and white mare built here and then a voice talked here that you can equate you know bringing outbreak so more often the time I suppose it depends on your theme for the wedding where you want something classic a little arrogant or something like as at the end the day like in 20 years time you'll be still looking back at your cake it could be Pink's that are on trend in Lake in to you why don't you just because it's not trendy second it should be what you love exactly yeah I mean and to fit your styling as a wedding I've seen brights I'm going about two years ago I did this mad Kate was all like a drip cake okay right but I mean the colors for psychedelic I'm really like luminous pinks and blues and Red's on my hair and like all dripping down and like they look as if the icings almost melting down like John mixing it together such as like rainbows in fact it was a mad cake it was after invites thirteen white you are all this big splashes of color and then she for bridesman and they were all different colors so it was all about college the name okay but they're setting them as a castle so I thought oh my god like such a modern like when you do something like that then people that's mad so I've done the cake several times it gets out to the portfolio this is possibility because I've seen my god zou so I think the caller can be a big thing and then I've seen quite novelty cakes as well a big thing oh stop when the men to say they're gonna have it when they can't decide I suppose I don't know whether the cat's idler and then half the cake is like this really pretty like wedding cake and they you turn it around and sit the package like one from your movies time and the bride is actually as mad as the groom distally compromise that two tiers each so I think it'd be moving like there's a Harry Potter there's a Batman and I'm still trying to the second tier which would I know there's a stair wars here there and then she's pretty sight on the front and it's nice because it almost looks like the cake is almost like you're like opening a curtain yeah and this is what's going on inside like that's it in right now like I would be rotating turntable so like it rotates very slowly so yes we'll get to see you this is crazy cuz that before like ethical places whatever wouldn't have been a rotating and you're kind of you the cake is obviously situation for warden position yeah use your quite close to a wall and then you're they're trying to yeah but it's great because there is endless possibilities I didn't go in there in cats America there last year yeah like with their cuz I said the cake is in the middle of the room as a session room to say when you're walking and that's why like Avengers is doing that as well like like yeah yeah yeah and when you're walking past of not a sudden you come into the back of the gate and you see this old big cake again like it's talking from the front of a mr. goodnight surprises when like and because should make a personal nice to the couple you know whether you're painting silhouettes on at listen to their hobbies are dog this olbes dogs on cakes an actual drawing all those do and that's how they want intruder yeah so it's kind of a mixture between you'd have a lot to show people to inspire yes design and then they can bring in forget all lastly one this is what I want and the couple did their whole story from when they first met at a disco so we did the disco city it was actually in eighties disco that's what exactly's are like they waited disco ball and jump in the heart sorry my pocket was a 70s disco castle remember they had flares because I depend make sure there was flares of banks and with the disco ball and then we did the the days of the year they mix and the next one is going to be okay okay you don't have to go through here people they just want the talk and all this is my wedding cake but I'm not gonna go into the cake would be there not be Cake Eaters yes and they could be having a cheese wheel tower and stuff like that so like people doing that as well and then they're just having like a single cake or something beside it you know I mean and I think that's I suppose like this q20 dish in fact of it alive what's cooking already Kansas so they still had that bit of it there you know so you think big person you see cookies I don't find it as big knowledge if there was two years ago yeah but they're like it's personally to me I just think they're a waste of cake because I mean at the end of the day like as we said when we're talking about yeah I think they're calling it that night like when you're cutting your portion size it's an inch by inch size okay you are getting a lot more portions are you oh yeah yeah and they say it like okay you might sit down and eat that size of a cake you're an up-and-down City either full cupcake that night like one or two bites into zombie done cake and she is too many ways and I remember actually the same Wilton the next day they said just 4p don't come too many cupcakes Thursday that 110 cold case left stop yeah ten use no no she wasn't my forcing cake of the next day okay takes a cupcake home there's a family like you know that's because they know when they caught off the gate they usually don't cut the whole cake up that nice they've called parity they don't give that out to the evening after the dinner and then I suppose you can give it to family members as well to bring home good yeah if you want to tell you skip these little boxes like your way and cake box whatever but I haven't seen them I don't want people actually looking form at the moment cuz they just want to do it because they just want to give our members gonna save a lot of a family they would have unless an American couple Irish copper and I want to give some family members go back to the states let say some cake when you're going to venues like that at one heavy I mean which are wedding coordinator yeah with them like they're like as much as we have an idea but they're on site working with the weddings all the time yeah so they all know that nice I want the question exactly so they have it say like it's harder to talk to you have the bottom tier just to want to talk to her and leave the other ones loads of different ways and disorders in different ways and of displaying it in as well like I'm some let's say hotels to say window to name the food at night it's a buffet style yeah so you can move in here itself leave the cake there have a little name I said this is your Red Rover this your lemon is your liam help themselves so like you can control your portions better going out that what cake or look the cake is gone I use more on the table at nobody seating where's having it bite that way you can keep an eye on things and and you mentioned a minute ago domi tears and I know this is something that like it's very obvious to you and why you've seen it before but to some people then we never heard of a dummy tier yeah and to another kind of will elaborate starting tier like okay for anybody did is made me at wedding showcases oh yeah wedding fairs any cake that's starting don't use so like you get your polystyrene dough me and then you said ice it and decorator the same as a cake I mean it's only and you can get those dummies and different heights so like your matching like my on average size of the cake is about five inches in height per tier okay so like I get five inch dummies nice it in my heavy so you're just getting that extra high surf to the cake just more I suppose just a bit more kind of like wow they wanted a bigger fighter they can go 12-inch tummy and have ten eight six week and then back to four again or you can go in between like your dummy cakes can go wherever you want it does make a bottom layer and then stock up because you can support it that way in spaces and which again Apollo starting told me it's like you getting into each other sizes yeah and they between the tier so you've added height to the cake and they'll just show me the illusion of massive cake I put there's no cake in effect great the stay that's at the cost that's yeah yeah yeah the people have just preconception debts but you still have to buy your dummy you sit up to buy your icing you still have all the work that goes on too much all the decorations you know what wait if you've only got 80 guests going here why don't you want to 4-tier cake yeah you know it's consultations on today and we're doing too real and too fake okay just because they're not great cake eaters and are only having small their tool that's way and they're actually coming back I'll to get married again shortly after so it's two to two and the cake to be gone cuz yours the couple that they when they know the dummies are in it and they're kind of going they're having the discussion each other it was just you don't want to be like right we're going to cut the cake yeah these are all things that I think people just aren't aware is was I'm - until you go to design your wedding cake sure would have also people they say don't have no interest in Cape Cod server and hire and you can do that you can just purely for making the fool take in the kitchen as a closing cake and it comes out and and then when it comes to toppers I know that like you're a baker so the Cure Kate decided to take you wouldn't really do toppers I personally don't do talking yeah it's just big I suppose a there's too much time involved in them which I'm kind of like leach I mean I don't have time for them but they do cost you know I mean less I mean you could be doing like a bride and groom but they want to found you my favorite like sculpting a exactly yeah okay I swear people don't realize that and we it is big money like there is a couple of companies out of their doom and clay and we still harvest yeah I always recommend because they will last forever more I have a liking they can really personalize it like I've done I'd won the election it was so funny like he was a doctor so didn't doctor got ahead okay let's go she was a nurse so she had her hat not that two dogs involved in it and he I think was a kook any Jersey down on the ground beside him you don't I mean that we could right here yeah because they don't know the clay let me yeah that makes sense because you and if they're great the way they look as they look like they're major you're sending it like you do not know it's clay it's great questioning him off the pictures they say here's a picture of my dress and what the room is wearing pictures of the bride and the groom so they literally just says mr. and mrs. companies out there as well there's one a particular I use here and they say like she can personalize them and she can match him with the front of your invites yeah she can do your colors you know I mean and that's it okay keeping your team with the wedding following tour rightful from the cake and when you're sending the cake open the venue then would you would they have the topper there for you toppers always there for me put it on and the cakes complete them before you leave whether in best-case scenario than it's available that's available to you just never got put on the cake was like at the consultation everything I have my consultation list assigned everything and it's don't like toppers yes at the venue and Jenna means okay see you know exactly what's needed I have everything there so this list comes with me to the venue so I took off my here B and C a B and C is they allege oh yeah and you know because when it comes to displaying cakes I was well there's like this diff there's always different trends but this did this does crazy ways to display cakes i everything from putting your cake on a swing that's something that's c1 race I was dying to see this I was expecting it to be this slicks dad fixed hole or something with and it like a base for cake but it wasn't it was a moving swing like is I suppose when it comes to things like if you were doing a swing cakes under stuff with our crawls I said there would have to be marks on the way and the way around that would be they say just for heaven's sake if you went to the big fire cake oh yeah do your dummy cake yes and then have your week in the kitchen is a coding cake so the way the fear thing is where you hang the cake upside down that you actually lists more the smallest shear this I it's mad it's mental that the smallest hairs on the bottom on your cake gets bigger as you go up and it's suspended for you this has to be dummy I've never fired it so I can't but I have ice watch the law and I'm waiting for so to order one there's wires spin like a different term supports two it's a structure you get far as like structure almost is like incorporated into the cake to hold chandeliers hanging all the way down yeah okay yeah it was a big like how shaped and structure with all greenery leaves around it was dangling in the middle hanging upside because there's so much you can put around your hip with with a flower walls and lanterns and it's endless isn't it like where the K can be yeah I mean let's say like the pictures of given like mr. Smith's the signs of giving stuffing I know a photographer nine times out of ten they always end up with the bouquets but just think if it's a big table it's on yeah sometimes the tables are very lucky how did they reach the cake like there's so much stuff as I say you don't mean your candles like in life do people do not with the candles like the battery even operated candles there looks at Wiener wedding glass vases ingredients does the world stands you can get this height your cake is well rather than just sitting on a your normal silver stand that you see in the hotels and you know that nine times out of ten and I lost ends are actually hidden under the tablecloth also very much in there can I get your affections yeah yeah flower was yes you can do what's wrong yeah I'm not particularly big it's just because I think sometimes because if if you were your cake and get lost in us would have taken photographs with a similar color yeah exactly it's almost like it's kind of flat decision ya know if it's different it's great there's a little bit extra distance I think put it when it's wrong yeah I'm photograph even why you might one thing is I always set up the cake does it hit photograph taking and your friend take photographs where is it like yeah yeah and for you then I suppose it's kind of you know what they're they're planning on their setup you don't really have to get involved in that but you know the setups gonna go on around the cake see you can come in and get yourself set off yeah and then whoever's you're the jerk or kids are dodo yes a lot of couples know these days will have their deco company coming in a little bit on the site places have decor yeah some places have their own hoops know everything they have so like hazard a standard there just make it easy for couples I think it's just you see motels no actually I suppose they're coming on board now with the idea like the cake needs to be a bit more of a focal point subjugation as you said like the likes of coupon irrigation different stands are getting different decorative around that table as well like in making like before it was a tablecloth run over a table so now we're getting the pleated things are getting the lights and really making it super hot in speaker we won one day and the country and they had the cake incitement was lovely and it was a real ugly Spartan fingernail I never forgot the two of us we're having a quick break and they came in to us they said we're gonna because they were very very good in this venue and so they were gonna be cutting the cake soon it's really lovely evening would you like us to bring the cake into the garden for photo op the two of us were like will you bring the cake into the garden somebody brought the cake goes into the garden set it off by this like it was kind of a game a Orangery yeah outside and it was like and they caught the cake I'll never forget it because the venue were just so accommodating they were at they were and they weren't afraid to come this will be amazing Mike yeah it was obliquus like this this will be lovely for the couple and for all the other guests is where to be lovely for their photo op and doctor just make a deal not suddenly I find as well when we go in as cake was going to set up the cake Umehara as you say sometimes let's say if desert decided here what have you our minutes I find sometimes hotels will bring that cake into the central table to bring the couple of and quarters yeah this is the box of my cake they know where's my logos there at the back of the cringing I got one day reasoning and the cake I really love Turkey your naval goals and lays on my heaven and and I took a photograph of envelope and I got two photographs out of it oh yeah one was on display okay and they brought the cake out to show the couple that night to cut cake and it was actually had all flour coming down the front to this okay there are so many the back of it yeah you could only see two floors all see how we don't happen though because in that moment that also the muscle of the 200 other people in the room they're gonna complicate they're all lined up already with their phones yeah a little bit of pressure in there let's there I suppose when it comes to the more what's the nice tasting in the pretty sight of cakes and the display but there's a lot more to it when it comes to you know allergies look there's a big thing because I know you were saying like knots you just can't but not to know I know I'm no more more people are putting out with their invoice they're like energy content whatever but you still can't be like I don't do not store any cakes it's just so I mean the only ones that I will hear is a carrot cake yeah and because people generally except with the carrot cake there's one attends okay I mean that's kind of like widely accepted and like when you're delivering to a venue and we have a virgin labels okay so all your cakes have to be laid your box has to be labeled with all your labels so tier one top yeah it just Carrie okay so you take off for you Vegas and you've carrots and pneumatics and your flour and stuff like that so you have to have that done and then I always do it anyway like I'd see about the wedding coordinator and specifically but this is this this is this and this is this especially sometimes as well if you've gluten-free cakes oh yes yeah biscuit cake more so than cake and I think because the textures yeah you don't know the difference of doing free biscuit cake you can still mix in your marshmallow crunchies or stuff like that into input and you're getting a texture I know excitation it's just with the normal cake you will notice to put the flowers scoonpooh flower would like that you always tell your wedding coordinator so like even they know what the kitchen is to be cut separately separate cutting knife you can't think of separately yeah because I was there according it you can't even use the same knife because it's and aware that their energy to it yes that guy Pfeiffer story people have kids and you know that they've never eaten a peanut and they're six and they've had the first peanuts and suddenly they realize they're highly alert but it's kind of I suppose it's for the bride and groom but it's not as kind of a very obvious one we've a friend she lives in America she's highly allergic to honey as in she can't even like use a cream or in think I'm someone talking about it and actually seven congratulations use like a cream that has a trace of honey in it because her skin will react and it's like a case of it's not like a small allergic reaction it's a life-and-death situation it's terrified who were i reaching with her I'm like are you sure there's no one in that fish she could just not raspberries I think that relieves them for the couple they have to inform me of this like yes oh yes because North is obvious yeah pony and raspberry and white chocolate cake are arising Tommy hey goodbye Jack chocolate and raspberry so you just these all things I think about and then I suppose like when we're on the safety zone things like you have to be certified as well with the headboard of money you have your registration number yeah and like I'm registered as and Lopez bases don't mean like there's different classes so I'm low class with waiting some whatever so you have to do like you're you're not like a shopfront spontaneous yeah okay so you have to constantly you still have to do your courses you Senate have your paperwork community and you've to keep records there's more paperwork involved and there he is in kicking janata me and then you have your inspections so like your hydrogen inspector will come down and shoot place your she will come you should go through your place the fridge temperatures you cuz you're either said they test the water once a year I want to come to the actual funny because I remember using this year before and I never would have registered this so I know a lot of people would have a family member that's you know they behind you making a cake and they're gonna call auntie Joel made the cake and you know you get Artem for the picture with the cake and a snowflake and some places then allowed the cake is it be in the banking rooms and it's on the premise they were hygiene routine relations whatever and like that I mean like for me let's say sometimes and I need copies right because I wants to make through cake she's made every food cake for the last time it's a family tradition yeah yeah and you know that kind of cider thing because they say you niches to grandmother's grandma term I admit talk to you wedding cakes are yeah my aunt makes every cake for all of our family every occasion she's on and she's making a cake yeah so like I will take a cake in are you an ice at the father I won't have Imperator's the wedding cake actually I realized that far and it's in the kitchen and but it's separate to the case in the kitchen has a cotton candy store tell no I didn't make it I just I stood firm and like again to say what allergen layer was I'd have to get off the carpet what we did to us is a form your scientists I didn't make it it's just it's they are for the couple but it's not packed the wedding cake like I know more and more or tells now let's say if you're going in like that I've even know this couple over tell is now started doing that you have to sign this game a form if you bring in your own wedding cake you can breathe easy but if it's not from a registered company or whatever or bake or you can't cause it you can have it on display it can be there all day and you can bring it home with you and cut a whole preferences it's just covering themselves not full place in home cake wouldn't be tonight it's not a big thing [Music] if you say this is what's in my cake you know for factor and your kitchen it's always the way you prepare things you very kind of clear about like you know I'm using this exactly but no but that's good for people to know anything okay for the week off they realize well that's fine but we're not we have to get something to check with your venue when you go with the wedding cake guess again they sell as people would have to copy at the end when sue the cake and go to the venue and a friend or my aunt's making the cake because they're having defined in consultation with the hotel on my level me nobody says if you find out in that situation your Kremen always gonna take out on a negative for Jerry let you know you're not gonna see the positive push you look it's okay it still displays you can still say you made it will each of the day to that's the positive way look at that reaction yeah better off to be prepared to do prepared comes to know the same into so many options out there when you're searching for wedding cakes and I know like we touched on waiting shows are a great one because you have to see your designs going on you can taste the cake but as much as they're with me the color is brain here and I go I get to talk to us that's been there do you see Benny's are they were like where are penny to talk to him like it's so funny like I have couples like I've been doing this now for and a half years so I've had couples from their engagement cake wedding cake Christine consider again to engage I'm on one particular cobbler zone four and a half years on your with them they're your clients for the step forth their relationship and their friends are getting married so like you're getting recommendations then Dennis well and also like when you're doing the wedding and if you look closely it's mostly the suppliers just try to wrap something up or Brian Brian is here but we're just to the left of Brian if you want right here but I'm being a booth and this was a nobody showed that's a great one because you get to take all three boxes when it comes to design taste nice yourself yeah but those are the ways as well of researching okay you don't have to go to weddings all the hotels had to recommend the suppliers they say like that I know like when hotels are sitting out there Paxson might have a yeah recommend suppliers want to consider it's all because they're they're working with these people leaking and we go there they're getting and the feedback as well from the cops there and they're at there in the moment they're watching how do people react to when they saw the cake how do people react with a or each one particular Hotel they say and I know when I do a lemon cake okay oh there's a couple slices goes with their wedding coordinator cuz she just loves the wedding cake you mean like so that's how you get recommended reviews reviews are reviews are a huge thing you know and it's it's not just the quantity reviews it's the quality of the reviews general if it's the cake was lovely it's yes you know and some people like are great words are naughty behind and the genuinely Miki was lovely thank you take the time to you know put a long enough review about every aspect from the first meeting to the consultations to the actual and yet the cake and it's that's all positive and that's something to really awesome afterwards I obviously because that Christmas times I do like these biscuit puddings yeah the groom's I'm always like the goons are booking in for the biscuits look at the Christmas pudding the traditional bishop wedding coordinators keep temps we Israelis and it's kind of like because you said like we were saying way to go with this if not a wall behind you're taking the picture yourself cuz you would like you document like this is today's cake and it's just saying that somebody's out actively baking actively supplying wedding cakes and general going to different venues and you can see when you're doing you know I mean like just examples the monster wedding like I really planned a big spread this way and I would have anything 10 12 13 cakes there but some people then will come in and they'll actually think is that all you doing that design was you're limited to I mean so I goes no coach no I'd like to you could do the top of this at you'll be you you'll personalize the design twerker on the team of your wedding and that's always like John I mean yeah Justin go that's what you're doing that's it whereas if you're constantly with your social media in constantly like you're posting stuff they'll get to see portfolio exactly when you're seeing all the bride's in like posting up just often they're tagging you and then you're oh I seen such and such a person thank you last night can you get I mean yeah one celebrity wedding cake there last year and she's hanging on made there recently and like my social media yeah and then you're getting inquiries same as I seen you did such and such a case which will do something similar but you know no meaning to your oh yeah he actually made amazing I suppose once you've kind of say found yourself and you look into book there's always gonna be a booking fee or something to say that you're genuinely this you're going to be my baker my wedding cookie yes I don't you take X amount to cakes per week you would have to just to ensure any lecture I suppose like that as well book wedding events like it already I'm going this is 2022 weddings and then which I just find as like I had a copy later so you can miss it we want to book you for 20 to 22 inches around we'll get somebody but I think a lot of people like they they want they call it the big three the venue the band the photographer and that seems to me now we know this other there's other variations to that but when it comes to like its I always say to people as odd they go oh we've got those don't know we're gonna sit back I'm gonna we're good now for a while I also hang on Oh since next year 2021 no I'm like my new year 2020 my Christmas 2281 is fully booked oh really and that's where people like are getting into the we do have to book them if we want to like what okay cuz they're out there we're going to do one cake we a day depends on your venues are as well that you could possibly do two cakes out also provide to Baker last year and that took the whole they didn't because like you would you would you kind of what's your radius would you kind of like this is a hunger for winter radius is this [Music] see me online they're like my started working on whatever and they even consultation they actually drove down from Dublin consultation is yeah I think that's something for people to make when it comes to wedding cake don't think it'll be fine like he's what you're kind of a 12 to 18 months for you sleazy seasons are you and also I suppose like that as well with people you know mean like when you it likes of people coming to you to book let's advice of carrier clarity that are a good distance away like all wonders or hundred twenty cows eat more weight just consider your cake consider what type of cake you know mean like a border in cake it's somebody that's local to you like I have copies are coming to Mueller for looking for naked cake and but like it's a hundred and twenty kilometres away and I would have people of these and local to you yeah maybe I see that's pretty good of you to do that that you're not just saying I'll take it'll take the business because you know be realistic about the fact that I can't deliver what you've seen because this was it's just too far away exactly would like you want to keep like okay I could say looking age cake all right I could go with that and I said oh yeah just two and a half hours in the cake I know what my heart and soul that's not feasible and the cake wouldn't taste as nice as if I money traveling half an hour as fresh as possible it's your reputation is alters when at the end of the day so things get somebody local but you know the cake will be fresh somewhat happy life you don't want to come back and saying like no just two and a half thousand oh man it didn't taste nice yeah it's all about like you're as good as your last job and I went cuz you you've mentioned before you've always been into baking it's a good it wasn't just like you know I'd love to be a wedding cake me because you do all sorts you could [Music] yeah okay yeah yeah yeah but thank you but you've always loved making Disney you told me a story before I was literally the only boy surrounded by women yeah yeah not back then but when it was then it was a big thing it was like yeah you would you would work if you were a boy listen all the lads they say because like they were like 13 14 15 year old yeah and they had the girlfriends and uncle are at a convent I was like the local postman as well Brendan love letters up and down to the school and I was like and like some of my best friends are girls it's just because like we've been friends day like German and we're still friends of my heavy I've done their wedding cakes and winter weddings might have a lichen I mean I've one particular friend I'm Jimmy she's actually in England my heaven okay we're always missing each other friends and that's like it used to be Joe and if you bake something then by the time you get back to the school like the less in your class you like you just get hammered like you'd have nothing gone home actually I mean maybe treats you worse so since you've been a teenager you providing cake to friends and family non-stop then I went to Birmingham I did three years I went to college in Birmingham and did a diploma course in bakery over there and then I came back here and I worked in a bakery for supervisors in a bakery over the past 15 years and when you decided race I said my cakes of paradigm just to give it a shot he see what we would go over because it is a mixture Oh gorgeous so what if you don't think going at your own is always I'm very scary and you know you work hard and you put your heart and soul to do and you really hope people see - there's a chance it's nothing like nothing is definition it's a hundred percent in life I walked off for two years practicing first okay and then what you do is you said like you baked from home yeah see you are it'll be there for the kids it was never like a scene from Matthew I suppose because like he's the oldest gentleman he had the rest of moral that's yes I was walking when they were at school so like is this hitter one good picked up something or where's not a lie Iverson is she's a saint either yeah and because you know I mean it's just so unreal I supposed in the support because I think they okay it's you that you're trying to put yourself out there yeah but they have to put up with you than at home Chocolate Factory German with chocolate everywhere she's everywhere like if I lived a Jew brain yeah yeah I miss ferocious sweet tooth okay just and no you have to taste your cake because you still want annoyed the washer would any other book like it's the tiniest it's a sign you spit like because you still have the taste of you still want to know what's right once is going all directions you know mean why pick one of my pet peeves is listed like if I do a Bailey's talk to biscuit cake or a Bailey's cake and my pet peeve is like if you go to a restaurant can you order Bailey's cheesecake didn't even see the bachelor babies I mean you're always taking to make sure that the flavors are correct orange juice it is on to private did you need to taste the stuff with it like coming in tasting the stuff was way electron and me nice to be off cooks like yeah what you love every day which I love I love like I know the consultations like are you like I did a cup was not a Saturday the consultation and it's a long ways yeah it's a lot of like talking in information to in would like you're going into dinner and you're having the crack with the yeah so funny let's say when it comes to watch the dress like they're taking the lens oh yeah show you picture the dress so you're able to see so you're getting all that information before they get it no you're on the inside seeing it but it's and I love it I think the dimple is what I love most about it yeah yeah he's you get to meet the most amazing characters but you be in my kind of a bit of a tired mood or like pressure up stress and then you meet someone they just put you in the best mood because there's just so excited about their wedding day it's truly what you're feeding off their positivity to achieve yeah like kids yeah and don't worry like everything I want to know then everything like what they're doing you know you watch the dresses the color and like bekasi I suppose when you're the design indicate yeah to me everything comes into play from the wedding dress the bridesmaid dresses the flowers even don't--if does lace and dress pearls diamonds how can you brought it exactly like you've noted their invoice so listen if they have a particular font under invite so if they want to inscriptions on us you'll work with that or sometimes I've done I've seen saying on invites might have sayings the couple would be in the same so they say in their invites just saying is under a place name yeah stuff like and your brief saying is into the cake I still haven't paid to under the cake so the more information you get about the wedding yeah I like I've met hope is there with no team gone through the wedding and yet when you're talking to him they don't see donors like exactly you have that there and they know Kevin they stand back later I mean they're relies on we do and that's when you'll get to design the case you have team and then there is like it's very much there are it's very yeah like you have to take in your venue as well like whether it is like your country homes your modern hotel room what happened like you don't want to reload which is style wedding cake in a big modern yeah that says do not a man so you think everything oh yeah cuz you see these cakes you got that's lovely yeah it's not a cake flour sugar frozen cake yeah so your punch the flowers to me yeah this was you're trying to get exactly what they're okay Oh cuz a lot of flowers will do like mood boards

they had you today know the consultations and she'll be straight out she went for a hairdresser and she was at tries her hairdresser going back last year and he's a figure out she wanted this one kinda person she's talking on for a cake er and the hairdresser said oh look by waiting person they're massive like so she did enjoyed that like so and I suppose because there's so much to cake and I think we probably given people but if there was one piece of advice you'd give someone what would the one piece of advice be when it comes to wedding cakes a little ask people this question cuz there's so much I want to tell people yeah do what you want to do don't be don't go on trend if you're mean it's your day yeah do a for your personality okay yes unless a fitting with the dress whatever but if you're going for something quirky make it a booty so I kept into like if your dog's your to start tractor into hiking or like I know I'm doing a hate for a couple I think it's sometime in June what happened and the ball into hiking grace and Hill walking so that's what the cake has been based around that's even the front adore invites have a picture of them to me so it does so much you can do in Volkers you know make don't people and there's always these articles being released these features and blogs about like you know 20 20 collars 2020 themes 22 and it is healthful to people and if you kind of just yeah exactly but I think you you're right don't forget who you are exactly why g20 : it was a car was on the main colors I for the whole year light into two car wedding cakes okay but you've only helped people and inspired them to you know you don't have to do that and you're kind of drawing it other people yeah what do you like you are you I must be brought very kind of like this is who I am this is what I might go fresh Nessa but they don't realize they actually like everyone has a personality and they said something I think people are afraid to kind of this yeah I have the consultations are sitting down and this when you're talking for about the flavors and they know show you  and you can see their Facebook yeah I didn't realize there was this much involved cake done I mean I've had calls come in and they ain't even because they've got such a fright there was so much involvement they can't do anymore like think about this yeah the four guys okay no we did actually just really didn't realize but it is you walk into room ego that's beautiful that tastes great and you think nothing more about it and that's how it should be yeah on the other side it should look effortless at a couple last year and they came in friends moment and as much as case she she actually went back into the very first cake she loved in the first place yeah and I find it as well like Germany would get confused so much stuff out there but I always come back to the first cake you like yeah and actually there's money I want to ask you before we end this seasons do seasons ever kind of have an impact on bigs so I think if you're having a Christmas wedding do you find that people kind of go a christmas team I haven't seen it too often no okay I you know I did a lot of Christmas yeah I think I don't need one Christmas themed wedding cake I think when it comes to death let's say people are so just for Christmas at that stage I mean yes the Cobblers might the bridesmaid scholars might be the raids early you know degrees is stuff like that no they're not going one or two will yes Matt no yeah I think more so if I find for Kristin's wedding is it's more so for couples okay that are away and are coming back to get married I do a lot of that because they know the families are onto Christmas let's shape our teachers are some people that are all for for Christmas okay and that's when they're getting because I think it's like a lot at that time but we was actually putting old okay so there's not really that you don't have to be like great and having Christmas wedding is any of a Christmas cake no okay you can do it like it's nice yeah again I suppose like that this kind of being like yeah sticking with everybody do what you want to do whatever I know what everybody I've seen it before we happens okay I mean five or six friends getting married doing it one year you see the same group of people that staring into the fire for the best friend do you want to do it's your day it's your wedding yeah as I said dealing I would say the world of flavors you've got to think akan flavors that will be even yes if you want to do something that's really nice that the to me love together keep it for the top tier because could be bringing quite a number of their friends and their different generation yeah yeah cuz you've won many awards over the years is all right I don't have to put that because you have in fairness like you can if the amount of times like you know post on social media there is another trophy well it's ombre but it is what it is though because like it stands you because I think we got a good feel of who you are today like I tasted a lot of your cake I can tell you you do of your heart and soul is in this business I think that does is when you're on this side of the fence I can you see the hours cuz even John sometimes do you do it I love sleeping like at night I have to sleep if there you don't mean they say sometimes you'd be there at nighttime you to talk attentive Marlon and your messaging okay cuz going between five or six yeah chocolate cake here so we're all messaging each other at our tonight because we all know we're up to the same times I'm working the way electron I'm try to work ready judo breaking things hopefully a few more this year and you should be honest I think it was no the worse cuz when it comes to cake as you said a lot of couples of come in and they've said oh I didn't realize so much was a cake this is kinda can see but a little bit of a heads up I suppose in a sense people as well we'll get to see from the other point of view and I see people I know and it's an awful thing my pet peeve it's only cake it's only UK but they don't get to see the other side of things then we get to

defending freedom is the world's largest religious freedom legal advocacy organization and our mission is pretty simple we advocate for the rights of all people to be able to peacefully and freely live speak and work according to their faith and conscience adolf has found ourselves a lot of the supreme court in recent years and we're blessed to have won five cases in the last three years alone which was and is the inspiration for this particular event series i know we're anxious to get started and hear from our esteemed supreme court experts on this panel but before i briefly introduce each of them i'd like to give a short overview of masterpiece cake shop which is the primary focus of today's panel and now despite the many inquiries i've received this week we will not be serving wedding cake as part of today's lunch sorry to disappoint you on that front i think most of us would agree that masterpiece cakeshop is one of the most critical cases on free speech and religious liberty we've seen before the supreme court in some time the implications are significant and the facts are fairly simple cake designer jack phillips has owned masterpiece cake shop a shop in lakewood colorado for many years he has always been an artist having developed a love for art and artistic technique from a young age shortly after high school he discovered discovered he could bl he could blend his love for art and culinary art and ultimately open masterpiece he chose that particular name for a shop based off a scripture verse and its logo is an artist palette with paint brushes a devout christian jack keeps his shop closed on sundays and operates his business to the best of his ability in a way consistent with his faith he serves all customers who walk through his shop stores when two gentlemen came to a shop asking him to design a custom cake for their wedding ceremony jack politely declined offering to sell them anything else in his shop the reason for his declining of this opportunity was his christian religious convictions on marriage convictions which have been the consistent basis for his declining of other opportunities throughout the years for custom requests that had nothing to do with marriage but because those custom requests would violate the teachings of his faith the two gentlemen sue jack under colorado's laws and now here we are at the supreme court so there's a lot to discuss about this case in other cases so without further ado here is our panelist lineup for today and if you'd like to learn more about each of them their bios are have been provided in your program you can just flip them over and you can read a little bit more about each of them first we have kristen wagner kristen is senior vice president of u.s legal division at alliance defending freedom she is council of record for cake designer jack phillips and she will be the one arguing masterpiece cake shot at the supreme court she is also council of record for washington floral designer baronel stutzman in the orleans flowers case scott keller office of the attorney general of texas he is the solicitor general scott regularly appears before the supreme court on behalf of texas and he argued the historic daca immigration case the united states v texas just last year louise melling deputy legal director and director of center for liberty at the is i've seen this american civil liberties union otherwise known as aclu the aclu represents david mullins and charlie craig in masterpiece cake shop in addition to louise's extensive legal background you will often see her quoted in various media outlets for all of significant first amendment cases and it is certainly our pleasure to have her join us here today yaakov roth is a partner here at jones day he had quite the trip coming up the elevator to join us for this for this event jakob zappell and supreme court experience ranges from protecting the religious freedom rights of death row inmates pressing a first amendment challenge to an ohio law prohibiting false campaign statements and successfully representing former virginia governor bob mcdonnell against political corruption charges our moderator today is lawrence hurley he is the supreme court correspondent for reuters would you please join me in welcoming our panelists [Applause] just like to thank kerry for giving us such a good introduction and allowing me to not have to go through all the details of the case um and i won't take up too much time before we get straight into it and uh obviously we have lawyers from both sides in mastercase so that's a a great opportunity for us to hear directly from both sides in that case i would just say one thing that you know as a journalist this case um is fascinating in part because it has these dueling narratives and depending on which of those narratives that you're sort of sympathetic to may indicate you know how you view this case um so obviously you know from the adf perspective it's seen mainly as a speech case and a religious conscience case um but from the perspective of the aclu obviously they see this as just being a basic uh example of discrimination and and uh how the court wrestles with that is obviously going to be very interesting so without further ado i'll ask kristen to get us started on masterpiece and then louise can can weigh in afterwards well good afternoon one of america's greatest contributions to the world has been its broad protection of free expression and free exercise and i would say if we want to have that freedom for ourselves then we also need to be able to extend it to other people including those that we disagree with on critical issues that's been the beauty of our our jurisprudence and it is something that our constitution affirms and protects the supreme court as well as president obama have both said that people of goodwill are on both sides of the marriage debate we certainly believe that to be true and the supreme court in obergefell the same-sex marriage decision has said that the those who believe marriage is between a man and a woman have decent and honorable philosophical and religious premises that they're relying on we also know that as we move through the next this issue that this issue transcends marriage in many ways and impacts also our ability to freely exercise our religion and live out our convictions so from ads perspective and i think certainly jack phillips and baranelle stutzman of arlene's flowers what's at stake here is whether expressive professionals will continue to have the right to create artistic expression that's consistent with their convictions and before i finish i want to make sure that it's clear that the supreme court has said that artistic freedom the freedom that the free speech provides extends beyond words and symbols to visual art the supreme court has said even things we might not recognize we might not understand what the message is in the painting or we might not really appreciate new dancing or tattoos but all of those things are protected and that's certainly true in the case of jack who is designing custom cakes for a religious ceremony he sketches he sculpts and he paints and then he often attends that ceremony to deliver the cake and that final product that creation that he has built his canvas and painted on is artistic expression that also has spiritual significance to him and to millions of other americans so the bottom line for us is we're looking for balance here this isn't a zero-sum game it shouldn't be a zero-sum game because marriage is different and we want the right for all people all creative professionals to be able to express themselves consistent with their convictions even if we disagree with those convictions louise so i wholly agree with lawrence that this is in many ways a story of competing narratives so this case isn't about a cake this case is a about fundamental questions about how our nation will what the court will decide about our anti-discrimination laws whether the court will continue to commit to the principles that are embodied in those and that we have held true to for decades now in essence when you when you think about the claims that are being advanced here they really are a claim that the constitution confers a right to be exempt from anti-discrimination laws the constitution confers a right to be exempt a constitutional a constitutional right to be exempt from anti-discrimination laws which is really a claim that the constitution protects discrimination in this case and the other cases that would be covered by the fundamental principles here and now i think the one sentence i'll say that i think everybody will agree with is this is an incredibly significant case in terms of what the court decides going forward and texas has uh filed an amicus brief in this case supporting masterpiece um i noted when i was looking at it the other day that it cites to um a couple of interesting publications one is called the artistry and history of cake decorating um another one is called having your cake and eating it too intellectual property protection for cake design so my first question for scott is how much he's learned about making cakes so much more than i ever knew before uh and you know the uh men and women in the texas solicitor general's office and the research they put into that i'm very proud uh to be able to display that but i think the complexity of this though and the fact that there have been all of these books there's reality tv shows there there are courses in colleges designed or to talk about cake designing that this isn't simply just a white sheet cake or a commodity or a food product this is expression i think it's also a little helpful to you know even simplify the case a little bit i mean i would think i'm about to put words in your mouth so tell me if i'm putting words that should not be there okay i would think that if someone went to a painter and said i want to commission you to paint a painting of my wedding that that would clearly beyond any doubt be expression that the free speech clause would say you cannot compel a painter to paint now maybe you disagree with that premise if you disagree with that premise i would suggest that you have a different view of the free speech clause than i think every justice of the supreme court for the last few decades if you do believe though that the free speech clause does not allow government to compel a painter to paint a painting well now all we're doing is talking about a commissioned cake and is this of the same nature that a painting would be and that's a fundamentally different question though than you know is there an exemption from anti-discrimination laws i mean the constitutional rights of free speech no matter you can pitch it as an anti-discrimination law you can pitch it as a speech law however you however you would pitch that the bottom line is if this is a burden on expression the first amendment doesn't allow it so this isn't what this is is not a case where somebody called and asked for a particular commission that's not what the anti-discrimination law reaches what's at stake here is a business that opened its doors to the public and the business chose to have a product the question is once you have a product once you say i have cupcakes once you say i'll sell wedding cakes once you say i'll sell dresses what the anti-discrimination law says is you can't make you can't pick and choose to whom you sell that we don't say that as a bake shop you have to make a cake we don't say as a bake shop that you have to make cupcakes but if you are going to have that product and you are going to open your doors as a store to the public then you can't pick and choose to whom you're going to sell that you can't choose to sell only your cakes to heterosexuals you can't choose to sell only to white people you can't choose to sell only to muslims once you're selling that cake if we want to think about some of the first amendment angles i know this will be provocative but here goes in the sense that there have been other free speech challenges to anti-discrimination laws and in the supreme court case of rum cell one of the things the court says there is the fact that anti-discrimination laws required you to take down a sign words that said whites only doesn't transform this case into a free speech case this is about who you guys i understand why like adf is focusing on the cake we're focusing on the as the law does the law is regulating conduct the law is regulating the conduct of whether i will sell it to you or whether i will sell it to you and what i do whether i turn you away or whether i treat you fairly and consistently with how i treat other people kristin do you want to weigh in on that oh yes first of all that's not what the law does and i would first say there are plenty of speech cases pacific gas miami herald you can go down the list hurley for example they all say that even laws that generally do regulate conduct once they start touching on speech or other constitutional rights we're in a whole another territory in fact the supreme court has referred to that as being a peculiar way of applying a law and hurley is essentially the aclu is re-litigating the hurley decision which said it is not about the who when the parade organizers declined to have the gay and lesbian group in their parade it wasn't because of who they were it was because of the message they were expressing and so in that case the public accommodation law could not trump their right of free expression and the same is true here neither jack nor baranelle stetson nor any case that's being litigated right now in this nation is about the who it's about the what it's about what is being celebrated and we have to recognize one we need to protect free expression if we want it for ourselves and two marriages weddings are uniquely different the supreme court has recognized that time and time again this is about the speech it's not about incidental conduct of sending logistical emails like the decision of uh the rumsfeld decision that was just mentioned so let's uh bring in yakov our in-house council so to speak um about the how the supreme court's actually going to approach this case and uh just before i ask you that you know i just mentioned you know obviously a lot of focus is going to be on justice kennedy who authored the burgerfeld gay marriage decision in which uh i just read a bit of what he said where he went out of his way to say that people opposed to same-sex marriage reached that conclusion quote quote reach that conclusion based on decent honorable religious or philosophical premises and neither they nor their beliefs are disparaged here which um you know is is this line in the opinion that uh obviously adf will uh like uh but on the other hand uh the dissenters in a burgerfell didn't really think that kennedy meant that with justice alito saying um we will soon see whether this proves to be true i assume that those who cling to old beliefs will be able to whisper their thoughts in the recesses of their homes but if they repeat those views in public they will risk being labeled as bigots and treated as such by governments employers and schools so which way is justice kennedy going to see this yeah i'm not i'm not sure even justice alito realized just how soon we would find out uh whether justice kennedy meant what he said in that quoted language one of the things that's actually interesting about the case is in many cases in the supreme court we see two narratives one appealing to the conservative side of the court one appealing to the liberal side of the court here we actually have two aspects of justice kennedy's jurisprudence that are being pitted against each other because justice kennedy is quite well known for his strong position in favor of same-sex rights i mean going back to romer and also lawrence and then windsor and and obergefell on the other hand he's takes a very expansive view of first amendment protection and expression and the importance of expression to one's identity and human dignity all the things that justice kennedy really cares about so this case pits one against the other for him so i think it's going to be a very interesting case to watch the questions that he asks uh if you're asking for a prediction you know if i could predict justice kennedy i'd be very rich [Laughter] and very sought after right but if i have to put money on it my guess is that justice kennedy will see this as as he often does as a case of government encroachment on individual liberty right the the other gay rights cases that he's written have really pushed back against what he viewed as government interference government denigration of a particular part of society there are all cases where you had the same-sex individual or couple against the government and the government lost here you have the government pitted against uh the baker and i think he's going to see it in those terms this is not a case where the government is doing something to demean a portion of society in the sense of the uh same-sex couple if anything it's the government demeaning the views of another portion of society that hold uh different beliefs about the role of marriage so that's how i would game it out but don't don't hold me to it justice kennedy in a burgerfeldt he has the quote that that you read and he has another quote in a different section where he says he also references the sincerity of people's beliefs and the need to respect people and then it goes on and i i don't have it exactly but he goes on to say but when the government when the government then sanctions those it puts an imprimatur on i forget what his word is but with that that stands more for that indicates that this is going to be hard for justice kennedy in both directions that justice kennedy i think cares deeply about faith you see that in how he reasoned or how he asked questions in little sisters of the poor for example but a burgerfeld sends messages about the dignity that he cares deeply about as you were saying for lgbt people it also points to the dignity of people of faith who oppose same-sex marriage and but then he has a sentence about the state putting its hand on on respecting that to the detriment of lgbt couples so if the state through the court puts its hand on creating a hole in the anti-discrimination law that i think will also create a conflict for him that there's he may see he could see this more as he was as you're talking about but he may also see this if he were to rule in favor of masterpiece as a threat to the lgbt legacy in terms of the dignity of people then turned away and denied and his concern his deep concern about anti-discrimination principles so last term we had the trinity lutheran case another religious uh rights cases as so to speak where a lot of people thought originally that was going to be a 5-4 decision um once the court actually decided it um but it ended up not being so is there any chance at all that this case doesn't turn out to be a 5-4 is there some kind of narrow way that it could be ruled on it that would get uh you know either more than five justices to sign onto it i think there is i think there's opportunity for a much broader consensus on the court and obviously i think on the the free speech side of things the fact that a wedding cake is essentially a temporary monument that is celebrating the wedding the the fact that it is artistic expression there's broad support on the court justice kagan has a number of statements about free speech as does justice kennedy and hopefully justice breyer too i mean they hurley was a nine to zero decision if you if you look at these free speech decisions and i think trinity applies here too trinity was a lot about status based discrimination in the sense of you can't if you are looking at the who then that's wrong and you can't discriminate against someone because they are religious and when we talk about dignity in this case we have to consider both sides of that issue and i think that the balances in this case are very different than what we saw in obergefell we're permanently ruining people taking all they own and i i'm embarrassed to say it because it seems so surreal but some people are even faced with jail if they don't create these this artistic expression and that's mind-boggling that we're in this state so i think the the equities and the dignity harms are very different yeah scotland i don't imagine this being something other than 5'4 and i think i think this is different i think a shop on the street justice kennedy for example what he does i don't i can't predict but he will understand that a shop on the street is not the same as a parade but there has not yet been a case where a speech association or religion claim has prevailed in the context of a chart as as a defense to discrimination in the commercial marketplace so this is a this this question poses very deep questions very deep issues on both sides but one of them is whether we really are going to say that the anti-discrimination laws in america have a hole in them for anybody who makes something that's custom-made or for any time it's an expressive event and they'll i'll just say it again the law is regulating the conduct it's looking at the who scott what i'm hearing is it's okay to compel expression as long as it's in the face of another discrimination and oh look i guess if you're skeptical of the position that the state of texas took in its brief for the position the adf has taken ask yourself this would you be okay with giving the state of texas the power to compel similar types of expression that someone doesn't want to engage in because the limiting principle here it cannot just be that these are there's going to be a different rule for same-sex weddings i mean the principles we're talking about here go far beyond that i mean can you can you compel you know a movie director that if they're gonna take a movie on a position of one they have to make another they can't turn down uh that type of movies they're writing a press release doing a 30 second political spot ad i mean there are all sorts of examples where that leads to and i'm not sure though that this case is just about well if you have a brick and mortar and you're going to sell products that therefore you have to then also com commit to creating custom-made expression i think it'd be a very different case if this were simply a cake was made it was out at a brick and mortar for sale to the public held open to sell to the public and someone came in and said i want to buy that and then the proprietor said i'm not going to sell that to you because of who you are because of sexual orientation but that's not what's what's going on here the cake is not out there in the shop it is a multi-hundred dollar cake that there are sketches to be made there's designs it is is a custom creation that has not been created yet um very briefly as far as a narrow way to decide the case too on the not the free speech claim but the free exercise claim i mean a wrinkle of this case that there could be a very narrow decision on is colorado here fined jack phillips for not creating the cake celebrating a same-sex wedding but that same colorado civil rights commission allowed other cake designers to refuse to make cakes denigrating or opposing same-sex marriage whether you call that a viewpoint discrimination on the speech side or you call that a religious gerrymander on the free exercise i think that's one narrow fact of this particular case that you could see something narrower let's just sort out a few things though i think and so one is this isn't the same as the insert cases this is in the sense that the state isn't saying walking into a store and saying oh jack phillips i direct you to make a cake that says i love jim and sam jack phillips has said i'm making cakes and he what the state is saying here is you can't hang a sign up in your window that says my cakes are for heterosexuals only this is this is about a product and a who and it is not the it is not the state coming in and saying you must make this particular cake that's what's different about the other context where the colorado civil rights commission said this is about your particular message this is this isn't about a category of person protected by the the colorado anti-discrimination law this is about a particular message the vehicle yes the the challengers certainly have i would say work to narrow yeah work to narrow the issue i mean that's not surprising that's typically what litigants will do in the supreme court to try to gain try to gain potential for additional votes right narrow the issue and the brief that was filed by the federal government the solicitor general's brief really takes pains to emphasize how narrow the issue is right it's we're talking about cakes and there's a lot of unique things about cakes and you know certain other expressive aspects of the wedding ceremony and that's what gives them additional first amendment protection and you know but it wouldn't it would be different if it were some other service that were being provided and it would be different if it was a different type of discrimination so there's a lot of narrowing going on but i think it really to some extent it un that undersells the social problem that is beneath the case right the um thinking about uh you know jewish example right the if masterpiece wins this case on a narrow theory then i suppose the rabbi can't be forced to officiate at the same sex marriage that would involve speech you know has to give some invocation but it wouldn't prevent the synagogue from being forced to rent out its banquet hall that's only if the synagogue otherwise rents its banquet hall yeah right well it does say let's say it does and so it's generally open um and that so that would not be covered i mean there's no there isn't really speech there the way the parties have framed the case but there's a i would say equally or close to equally serious conflict and problem uh with that for somebody who believes in religious freedom and religious conscience right so you know i i was on the board of my synagogue it would be a real problem if we were faced with that situation um so there's a lot there is a real bigger social problem that i think uh is to some extent being missed by just focusing on aspects of cake making well i think that the i mean i'm interested in what you think i think that the briefs have a little bit of tension on that theory between there's the focus on speech and the making of the cake and then there's the focus on the importance of the cake at the wedding but there's also i agree with you there's also a sort of endorsement theory that runs that that isn't dependent on it being a cake as i read your briefs and in in which case then a table becomes significant any act that is making the wedding possible or showing up at the wedding is then by how i read your theory one form of endorsement that is troubling and i don't i can't tell whether you're actually arguing that as a sort of clear ground under the speech and religion arguments that you're advancing i do think the religion arguments are separate from the free speech arguments but when you go into the the scenario of the table maker and the level of participation i think we have to look at what is the test to determine whether there's a free exercise violation and that test is is the law neutral or generally applicable that's how you get to the height scrutiny and as scott mentioned in this case the way you get there quickly and easily is to look at what the state of colorado has done essentially the state of colorado has taken the position that if you are a customer a religious customer and you want to purchase a cake a custom cake that opposes same-sex marriage you lose if you are a cake designer and you don't want to create a cake that supports same-sex marriage you lose so the bottom line denominator here is if you're in colorado the viewpoint discrimination and the way they're applying this law is that you lose no matter what if you don't agree with the state's position and you can be compelled to create expression that violates your convictions so i don't think we can get away from that and this idea of well it's a sign and you're denying you know service if you go back and you look at what the state of colorado said with those bakers that it said yes you have the right of free speech not to design this cake they said well look they serve other people they serve other christians and catholics in other cakes well but jack phillips and and all of our clients they serve all people as well it's the message throughout jack's entire career he's declined to celebrate all kinds of events not just same-sex marriage this is just the most recent and so i think we need to remember that in this debate it's not the who it's the event and it's the expression and it's also the the wedding ceremony itself the spiritual significance of that to jack the state has to be even handed in its treatment of conscience and expression and otherwise it violates the free exercise class too if i can just jump in here very quickly i think this is a especially for people reporting on the case or the optics of the case in fact in this case and also in arlene's flowers jack phillips and baronel stutzman would in fact serve and sell products to lgbt customers and in this case jack would have sold brownies or cupcakes or whatever he had already made that were in his store for public sale he would have sold them to the complainants in this case or custom cakes too he would even sold custom cakes provided that it was not expression that was going to be part of the same-sex wedding and so all of those facts show that this is not about sexual orientation discrimination this is this is far from rover versus evans that was the justice uh kennedy opinion also coming out of colorado that was targeted on sexual orientation discrimination what this is about expression for a particular religious ceremony uh two points about that so i'll just use two examples so one is to say that you would deny a cake only to a same-sex couple of courses about the fact that they're same-sex right and that same-sex people as evidenced in the supreme court case have a right to al one of have a right to all of the sort of fundamental aspects of being able to live a life that's part of the purpose both of windsor and of a burgerfeld it's your analogy i would just point you back to language from lawrence and you know when lawrence overruled bowers it said at one point people said this is about a particular kind of sex this isn't about the people and then the course the court came back in lawrence and said oh that's preposterous you can't separate all these things from the status of people of the people that involved here so it's hard for me to understand how a same-sex wedding isn't about same-sex people which is about sexual orientation second it was no excuse in in bob jones university bob jones university had a practice of admitting black students what bob jones university did was object to admitting students who said that who were involved in interracial marriages or advocated and otherwise supported interracial marriages so you could say oh that wasn't a discriminatory policy because the university was willing to admit black students that's not how we understood bob jones university case nonetheless in terms of putting forward a form of discrimination that we understood as racial discrimination so i think the fact that you can you'll serve some things to people occasionally and not other things based on on status doesn't get you out of the status discrimination but he wouldn't he wouldn't serve cakes to you know if you know polygamous marriages were to become legalized i mean that's why i said i mean look go read the briefs and you can make your own determinations about this uh but that just shows that it goes this is about weddings though kristen just one line and then we'll move on to the next subject because we could go on uh probably for the next hour on this uh do two quick lines to put an end in uh obergefell already resolves this the suggestion that those who believe marriages between a man and a woman are compared to those who are engaged in racial bigotry is offensive that is not what the bob jones university case was about for 50 years bob jones university excluded african americans from admission that whole system the interracial marriage was a part of an entire system of laws to subjugate a class of people marriage between a man and a woman has cut across all civilizations and the supreme court in obergefell has already said decent and honorable religious beliefs support this this belief and if you compare that to what it said in loving versus virginia it's night and day difference and that's a distinction that matters life is a long sentence i know sorry that one just gets to me and i just yeah the i think the the race analogy it's always hard to get away from race analogies and constitutional law but the race analogy to me sort of highlights what the case is about are we as a society going to turn every observant christian jew muslim into a member of the kkk i mean is that how we want to handle this tension in our society um so i hope not but you know i also watched the confirmation hearing last week where a senator was haranguing a judicial nominee for having spoken to adf which he called a hate group based on positions not dissimilar from a position that we're debating here so there are parts of our society that are trying to uh divide us that way and so so i think we'll have to move on now as we're a bit uh running a bit behind but speak is on a similar subject of uh allegations of uh religious discrimination uh we're just going to talk quickly about the the travel ban case which is something you may have heard of um so this supreme court is is uh scheduled to hear or oral arguments uh in october on this uh though of course the 90-day ban uh of uh people entering the country from uh six predominantly muslim countries is due to expire on september the 24th is the latest date we've been given so i just want to ask scott since texas has also filed the brief in that case just to um give us a quick kind of summary of the establishment clause issues in that case and uh you know and then um i think yakov maybe we'll talk about whether or not the court will actually get to those questions yeah so the i guess this is the second travel ban uh case that's being litigated there was a temporary pause for 90 and 120 days issued by the president through an executive order on individuals from six certain countries coming into the country and also the refugee program and one of the claims that the plaintiffs have raised against this there are others but the main one we'll talk about here is an establishment clause claim in that this is actually a classification in the statute that is intentional discrimination on the basis of religion that even though it's a neutral classification based on the countries that individuals are coming from and the fact that they would be you know part seeking refugee status that this is actually protectual discrimination on the basis of one's uh membership in the religion of islam so this is where the label muslim ban comes from um there are many problems with the theory that is being raised um but before i get into any of those i think what the supreme court did at the end of last term in allowing the travel ban to go into effect in large part is very indicative of undermining the argument that this is pretextual intentional religious discrimination because if the supreme court really thought that this was pretextual religious discrimination i don't think that nine justices would have allowed most of that ban to go into effect but the argument here is that even though the statute is just neutral in particular president trump then candidate trump's statements uh regarding these topics the plaintiffs are trying to marshal to say that this is actually a pretext that there's intentional discrimination here even though the face of the statute says nothing about islam or the religion at all for centuries for over two centuries the supreme court has said repeatedly that you need a clear and strong showing to have any chance of making out a claim of intentional discrimination and the court has said over and over again if there are legitimate reasons for a law the court is not going to step in and question the motives of the government actors and i think all those principles which have been applied in many different contexts since chief justice marshall described them back in 1810 control this case and i understand that obviously this is a very heated policy disagreement but the courts are not designed and they should not be used to impugn government actors motives itself as a basis to have a different policy outcome that's exactly what the legislative and executive branches are for and if there's a problem here and you don't believe the president should have this much authority to block people from entering the country well that's an issue for congress and congress gave the president all sorts of authority here essentially that he can unilaterally block the entry um of aliens who are not uh residents here and if that's the issue then we should be having a conversation about whether congress should be reasserting its prerogatives rather than talking about intentional discrimination so just before yakov weighs in uh the aclu is the uh is representing some of the plaintiffs in this case although it's not louise's uh case um i'll just ask her to quickly uh give this summary of the aclu's position on this so obviously it is a theory that you the establishment clause says you can't favor one faith over another and in this case nor can you disparage one faith as the government and in this case muslims are being disparaged in terms of the argument about looking to intent this is intent of government actors does come into play in different kinds of court decisions for sure in terms of the courts do sometimes look at purpose the court looks at the intent of government actors in certain kinds of discrimination cases for example so it is not in any way sort of out of the zone to be looking at the statements and and pronouncements of government actors in certain occasions and here i think you it may be that there is even more basis where you're not trying to just look at what congress thought where you have you know several hundred members as opposed to what did the executive think and the other challenge i'm just curious about which is if you say that the statements of the executive have could never have a bearing in this way you you can readily get yourself to some preposterous result where somebody could say on tuesday the president could say on tuesday i personally i have a overwhelming prejudice against name some group and i think our country should be free of ever having any more of that group and then signs a neutral executive order it's hard for me to imagine at least in that in in something that extreme that the president's statement would really have zero bearing on the question at hand so yakov what's the court going to do you had initially asked you initially said you can ask whether the court is going to reach the question and i uh i wouldn't be surprised after hearing from both sides if they tried to dodge it nobody i don't think anyone here wants to hear about mootness so uh i i will say this on the merits of the on the merits of that debate and their good arguments on both sides i i have a feeling that the nail in the coffin for the challengers came very recently with the lawsuits that were filed challenging the rescission of the daca program because one of the theories that the those challenges rely on is very similar to the theory that the that the travel ban is being challenged on which is well president made campaign statements that reflected animus towards hispanics and now he's taking this action and you should infer that the reason he took this action was because of the animus i think what it really shows and what will i suspect what it will illustrate to the court is once you open this door there's no end to the challenges that you could bring and the psychoanalysis that you would be doing of uh some individuals at the top of the executive branch um and is that really the way we want courts analyzing these things as opposed to sure intent matters i mean purpose matters but do you look at purpose by through that type of methodology or do you apply tests and standards that are meant to smoke out illicit motives by looking at how the what the law says how it functions and whether it's over-inclusive and under-inclusive the type of more objective legal analyses that courts uh have historically used for these purposes so i think um some of the recent developments may be helping uh the administration and of course there may be etcetera just add something to that i think as not having a dog in the fight one of the things that i found curious is to take under what you're saying is that there's an establishment clause argument rather than going under the free exercise class just from looking at the difference in the claims i'm a whole lot more comfortable with litigating a free exercise clause with established tests without broad remedies where it's a all or nothing and you can consider the state's interest and that whole idea of a single person being able to say something and completely obliterate the law doesn't seem like the best way to to navigate our jurisprudence whereas under the free exercise clause it provides the the framework to look at those things so i i just as an outsider looking in it's curious to me that you would advocate for an establishment clause claim as opposed to free exercise or maybe not the beckett brief so the odd thing about this case is that everything could change before the argument even takes place it could be a new ban it could be a new presidential tweets could be anything so i think it's one of those unusual cases where we're all going to be keeping a very close eye on things heading into the argument um now we're going to move quickly on to some of the uh petitions that are pending uh at the supreme court uh they've got a big pile of them now uh that have been building up over the summer that they'll be deciding whether to take uh in a couple of weeks and i think kristen um is going to talk a little bit about um one of those cases that's on the summer list which i think adf is involved in about the uh the pregnancy uh crisis centers as they're called in in california and a law in california that requires them um to post signs telling people how they can get uh abortions and contraception and whether that violates free speech so um do you want to talk a little bit about that sure in california passed an act that basically forces pro-life licensed medical facilities to have to advertise for abortions and to tell the women that come into their clinics you can go get a low-cost abortion through the state and and give them the resources to do that in terms of where to go it the law also forces unlicensed facilities that are providing resources and help to pregnant women to post in an advertisement that they a number of different things but essentially that they're not a licensed clinic with medical physicians and so on and you might not think that's real onerous until you read the fine print which is in major areas you may have to post that in 13 different languages an inconspicuous font which essentially means that pro-life clinics can't advertise at all can't let anyone know because it's cost prohibitive and that's that's what was behind the law the findings actually say that it's targeted to go after pro-life facilities um so that they have to refer for abortions and have to provide this information these laws have been struck down in other in austin texas a couple in maryland as well as in the second circuit in new york and so in california the night circuit applied inappropriate standards they did not apply strict scrutiny even though it's a content and a viewpoint based law under the free speech clause they applied a lower standard and in addition i think a critical issue just even bigger than this issue is what kind of speech can the government compel similar to the masterpiece scenario can the government tell medical professionals what they must say when it's not even related to their expertise or knowledge just under some vague state interest of we think it's in the health of our citizens for you to tell them this if this ruling is upheld uh potentially that is that's that's what's at stake uh is this one that the aclu is involved in too or not we have not filed in this case at all as i understand it and and i have not read the decision recently but i know the kinds of questions people ask in these cases right so one i think one is is there any kind of factual record of a need for people to be told provided some information so i think i know that some of the advocacy around crisis pregnancy centers the the non-licensed ones at least talks about people looking like doctors and so if people think they're coming in to see a doctor they should know it's not a doctor and then is there any record of people being misled and then that as to some of the the statements the the statement says as i recall you know there's california provides services for family planning prenatal care and abortions including for low-income people and if you want help here call this number or something like that it's not just abortions it's it's prenatal care contraception and abortion i know that some of the people who defend the law say that then it's really requiring a posting of nothing other than what it would be required as a matter of medical ethics the only problem is they exempt from the whole law the clinics that are actually providing abortions so that's kind of a tell-tale sign that it is a viewpoint content-based uh law and in addition there is no factual record that would support these unlicensed clinics you know being suggested they're somehow deceptive in their practices so yes you can say that not you but i mean they can say that in the law but there's no factual record to support it so uh yakov any thoughts on whether the court might take that issue i don't know if they'll take the case but i do know that the the justices tend to be much more favorably inclined toward uh compelled speech claims and even commercial speech claims uh than the courts of appeals tend to be so i think if they took the case would be a very good sign for the challengers but it's been i mean there are compelled speech cases for example coming in the context of abortion clinics there's a lot of speech required of physicians who provide abortion there's required speech mandated speech for example to provide booklets with brochures and to provide lists of all local places that provide services for women who want to carry the term as and others in the court at least in casey the court was dismissed the compelled speech um claim in like two sentences or something there's a professional speech sort of document yeah sort of a subpart of this but it sounds like the law applies to non-professionals that's what's interesting about this particular petition is because it has both it has licensed and non-licensed and so in the license context there's a a key issue that i think is very intriguing which is can the state compel professionals to give advice and give information that would violate their their ethical obligations that they feel would violate their ethical obligations just because the state says well this is in the interests of our citizens and cato and others have filed briefs in that case to say this is a very very dangerous standard that you're setting to let the state tell the doctor what he or she ought to say does this mean you're going to join the aclu in the compelled speech cases on behalf of the clinics that provide abortions well you send that my way and we'll consider it well that's the question i was going to ask scott because obviously states have lots of different reasons for passing laws um we do and uh one could imagine that texas passing a law that the aclu wouldn't like uh that might compel people to speak or imagine is this a sort of issue that could uh lead to some oddbed fellows if the court was to take it up well i think one of the reasons i think you all have asserted your circuit split you know the primary reason the supreme court takes a case is because there's a conflict of authority in the lower courts and i think some of the cases that you all have cited have dealt with not only the situations with pregnancy centers that are pro-life but also what can a state tell doctors that they must say and so i think all these issues are going to kind of come up in the context of uh the questions in this case right there are other compounds there are other contexts in which compelled speech is being litigated similarly i want to say the whether doctors what's the gun scenario the 11th circuit yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so uh just quickly we've got another couple of minutes before we go to questions any other uh cert petitions pending on the sort of issues that our audience here are interested in that we should be keeping an eye out for i do think the kneeling petition is um interesting i don't know if you did you want to talk about that or happen okay go for it okay take it away um neely actually just yesterday the supreme court asked for a response in that and neely involves a wyoming judge that had two positions a part-time magistrate position as well as another judicial position one she did not do did not have the discretion to perform weddings the magistrate position she did if she wanted to and the wyoming without any complaint without any request even to do a same-sex marriage she was asked by a reporter what her thoughts were on it said she would refer to someone else to do those weddings and the wyoming judicial commission tried to actually remove her from both positions saying that she was biased and unfit to serve on the bench that went up to the wyoming supreme court and there's a petition pending right now at the u.s supreme court the wyoming supreme court said she could keep her position that didn't have any discretion to do weddings but she needed to lose the other one essentially because if you had beliefs on marriage and you dared to speak those beliefs you were biased against an entire class of people and the implications of that not just for the compelled speech claims but also just for those who want to serve on the bench in the future as the amy coney barrett situation came up recently are really troubling so i was glad to see that the supreme court was asking for a response any other cases quickly that to keep an eye for i'll briefly flag the city of bloomfield versus felix the establishment clause 10 commandments case this is also another adf case but we in the state of texas filed an amicus brief on behalf of 23 states so we almost got half the 23 states saying supreme court in 2005 you had a pair of cases dealing with when can a when can a 10 commandment statute properly be displayed on government property and in texas the ruling in our decision was yes the ten commandment statute in texas could remain but in kentucky it had to come down and the court did a very fact-bound contextualized analysis of looking at the particular historical circumstances of both of these but even as the court was issuing these opinions at the same time there was tension between the two of them and the court almost kind of created its own split on that day about ten commandment statues and so this case is asking the court in the context of a case coming out of new mexico can you please you know elucidate what you meant by how we should deal with these two different cases and because of that the fact that also multiple lower courts have said i think judge easter brook famously said that if the legislature had created this body of law it would be found unconstitutionally vague when you have lower courts signaling to the supreme court that they really need to uh fix that i think there's a good chance that the court's going to take a hard look at that and i think there's a sleeper issue in that one too right which is standing right who can challenge these displays and monuments it's a bit hard to come up with a test that isn't going to be fact bound when you're talking about displays and parks or that type of thing but if you adopted a rule that limited standing and took away the ability of people to sue just because they were offended from seeing the display uh that would basically kill off this entire area of litigation um without creating a new test so that's something to really watch out for well one of the ironies in this case is at least one of those litigants has never even read the monument they just drive by it so i think that's what makes the standing issue even more interesting right well thanks a lot for that um we've got about um 15 minutes exactly for questions uh and i think there may be microphones going around um in the front here first well thank you so much to all of you for being on this panel i found it very interesting um my question is for you luis general keller raised an interesting point um with regards to painters and if you know should a painter be forced by the state you know to be commissioned to paint something of a ceremony that goes against her conscience or that she'd prefer not to be a part of so i guess my question is and you mentioned you know if you're open to the public obviously the painter would be offering her paintings to the public as part of her business so should the state be allowed to compel that painter to paint something that she'd prefer not to to paint i think this goes back to the the sort of message versus person in some sense right so you don't have to make the cake that says i love gay couples or i love the nazis and there i'm assuming that nazi isn't a creed um because i know that is in that's in a footnote in somebody's brief so i just want to say that um as distinct from can i refuse to serve somebody so you're the painter and you're offering paintings you can't if you have opened your doors to the public and you're a public accommodation you're doing commerce and serving the public say i would do a commission painting for you except that you are christian or i will do a painting for you except for the fact that you are gay so you're saying so you're saying if a painter's asked to paint a painting say of a same-sex wedding and they don't want to paint that religious ceremony the government could still come in and tell them yes you do in fact have to go in and paint this ceremony so the ceremony on the so some of these situations that get between message and identity become somewhat murkier i will of course i'm not i'm not naive become murkier right so if you're not otherwise you did you realize this was going to be a moot for your argument i'm not arguing and he's going to tell you how it's going to come out if that were i think if you this is i think it would depend a little bit more on the facts in terms of whether that then is that you are turning away people because they're gay as opposed but that was a problematic scenario for sure if you're painting if you're doing wedding portraitures in general and then you so if you're doing wedding portraitures in general and then you say but i won't do it because you're gay then that is discrimination against you because you're gay i guess i'm just sort of thinking more about the content of the message or the event you're being asked to do in this sense i would imagine that you know the painters say let's let's assume that the painter would be happy to paint the couple in other contexts nothing to do with their homosexuality or their you know how they identify it would be simply because of the event or you know another thing that comes to mind you know if i don't maybe i'm pro-life or maybe i don't want to you know paint something that's going to violate my conscience or paint someone going experiencing having an abortion or something like that i'm just sort of trying to understand because to me the line is the line you're proposing does seem a little bit murky and a little bit frightening to empower the state to be able to dictate what i as a painter can be commissioned to do and when i can't become what i can what what requests i can accept and what requests i can decline so so in general anti-discrimination laws were passed in particular so that people who had been subject to discrimination had been second-class citizens didn't couldn't participate freely in civic life whether that's staying in a hotel or whether that's being served or whether that's getting a job had all of a sudden had a shot and to have that shot there were then rules so that you couldn't discriminate against people so as to level the field so part of this is when you think about i think even if you don't when you talk about dignity even if you don't agree with me i think you'll at least understand that if you have been subject to discrimination and you haven't had a right to be married you haven't had a right to be recognized as equal you haven't had a right always to go into stores that if you go in and somebody says to you i i realize this is the happiest day of your life but i i can't do this because of who you are and that who you are is the thing that has held you back for so long at minimum you are going to walk out of that store reminded that you were second-class citizen you're going to be reminded that society the public spaces these particular public places of commerce can still treat you as different when i talk to debbie munn debbie munn is the mother of charlie if charlie and dave are the couple debbie munn says that when they walked out after being denied the cake charlie broke down in the car on the way home because he felt like he was he was made to feel ashamed of who he was and that their day that should have been one of their happiest her words are we left broken that's true whether what it is that somebody's selling in the store is a custom-made cake or what they're selling is a cupcake or what you're selling is a space or it's flowers that feeling of rejection that feeling of not being able to move is different and debbie will say that her son and his husband shop differently they they are more anxious when they go shopping now because they've been because they were rejected okay next question uh lady in the middle there thank you all um i had a question about the compelled speech abortion um well you brought up the abortion clinic cases and then obviously the pregnancy crisis center cases are related and i'm not an expert on the compulsory doctrine at all but i thought that there was something um there was a color to that jurisprudence about the speech that's being compelled being something you don't want to communicate because you oftentimes in the cases of the pregnancy crisis center object out of um religious beliefs or conscience and so i was wondering how much that's coming up in the arguments and maybe a question for louise is i i'm i was very kind of uh curious about the the comparison of equating the compelled speech in both circumstances because in the pregnancy crisis center situation the speech being compelled abortion services is something they object to and that they oppose whereas i'm wondering are your clients for the abortion clinic saying that they're opposed and they object to adoption because that's the speech that's being offered there and does that make a difference in these cases when it comes to the law under compelled speech well i would say when it when we're talking about the law of viewpoint discrimination and content discrimination is critical into the in the analysis and in the nifla case there's both there are problems with the content and that they have to specifically discuss and advertise for abortion and the viewpoint is as you brought up there's nothing about adoption that they're you know talking about and it's clearly just abortion and only applied against pro-life clinics also as you brought up the compelled speech piece of it is yes they have an objection to advertising for abortion clinics and and the state abortion services so um i think the compelled speech just in and of itself on the subject matter is very strong and also the question of should a professional be required to disclose those sorts of things that they don't believe ethically they should be doing um and i i just want to go back to one other piece before we move on which is the day in july of 2012 when charlie and dave came into that store because what jack will tell you is it's one of the worst days of his life and there are very few days that go by where he's not also broken up over it he wants to serve everyone it's in his interest to do so and yes i don't doubt that charlie and dave were hurt by that interaction there's no question in my mind and that's very unfortunate and it's sad that they had to had to have that happen to them but we're asking jack to sin against god to potentially permanently impair his relationship with god and to give up his livelihood and his business charlie and david got their cake pretty much right in the same neighborhood their rainbow layered cake and they've moved on and they can live consistent with their values but we're telling jewish muslim sikh christian protestant catholic designers that they have to violate the core of who they are and if this is about identity identity has to go both ways so we're just asking for balance and tolerance in an inclusive society next question oh i didn't i didn't get to answer this question so the compelled speech so casey involved a question for example of giving booklets that identified that showed pictures of fetal development at every stage and yes we did the clinics we did a basic it was an aclu case objected to mandating that doctors have to provide that in every case and the cases now most often sort of in the compelled speech are often some of them are contested for truth as to whether or not abortion causes breast cancer that you shouldn't require a doctor to say something that a doctor thinks is not true and has evidence documents to establish and and other messages that are um i would say more political than a referral well are your clients morally opposed to giving their patients that information the same way that these pro-life centers are morally opposed to abortion you don't have to be morally opposed though to bring a first amendment speech claim right you just have to not want to do it for whatever reason and and i'm not saying they do or don't but but that that really shouldn't make the difference you wouldn't get the challenge if the person was happy to provide the information so presumably the person who's being forced to say something doesn't want to do it for whatever reason and the test that the court has used for at least for certain commercial disclosures asks whether the um required speech is purely factual and uncontroversial so a lot of the debate ends up turning on well what is controversial mean do you mean that the controversy surrounds its truth or do you mean controversial in a different sense political or social controversy next question um is it up here in the back in the middle um so i had two uh brief questions one for the solicitor you mentioned that it would be really bad precedent if the government began questioning the motives behind a law um and my immediate thought is similar to louise's thought which is that the motive when the does the does the clarity of the motive um matter for example if it could be argued that the motive was very clear that this was meant to discriminate against muslims because previous statements would that how does that affect your argument and my question for louise is not to belabor the point but put into focus a little bit more um the the previous questioner asked about whether or not uh the wedding portrait uh so if you could speak specifically to the point of whether or not the wedding portrait if the if the painter said well i'd be happy to paint you two in any other context than a wedding portrait would that be less about the who and more about the what so those are my two questions sure so on the the issue of how you do this purpose analysis the supreme court said is you only look at purpose or motives in very narrow instances where the court has said you should racial discrimination is a good example yes you can look at motives when you're bringing a claim of that but that doesn't mean that you can bring a purpose-based challenge to any type of claim in the establishment clause the court i believe has said in one of the ten commandments case that you can probably bring one of these types of purpose claims okay so now we've said you can bring that type of claim in this type of case the court has then said though even if you can bring this type of claim and this i think was jakob's point there's a presumption of constitutionality and good faith and regularity and you have to look at the motive through that lens in other words there is a weight on the scale that is saying that what the government is doing is presumptively constitutional and so to answer your question if you had the level of evidence to overcome that strong the court has called it a strong and heavy presumption then you possibly could have a case in which that uh challenge could be sustained but i think it also is going to depend not only just on statements but also how the law actually operates in effect and here clearly i mean the six countries identified were identified by congress and the obama administration long before the trump administration came up as countries of concern regarding terrorism so one thing to remember here is if you think about either the test that you guys are advocating or the test for example of the solicitor general in terms of whether it's expression as in the custom-made product or whether it's expression as in the event and in particular an event that often has very strong religious resonance for people that won't in any way be limited to a wedding so for example a funeral um you can i don't understand why the same theory wouldn't apply for example to the florist who is solicited by jimmy bergefell for flowers for the funeral of his husband in the sense that that is that is about marking their relationship and it is a is it a creative event so i wouldn't be i think i want to caution everybody that i was i understand how folks are trying to for as you said for the way that happens in the supreme court argue a limiting principle because a because you believe it because it's also a better way to win um but even the limiting principles are not it's it's not just flowers and it's not just a wedding it's i think there's involved in this argument a question about endorsement there's a question about all expressive goods and then at least for the solicitor general there's a there's a further narrowing in terms of of events i feel pretty confident to in predicting that both sides will get very tough hypotheticals absolute boundaries but but i think you know what does it mean to say that the most important event for many people's you're taught you your briefs say it themselves in terms of how important a wedding is to people expressive for people involved expressive for the couple getting married to say that for that most important event we as a nation would say that you can turn people away that you can discriminate in public places and treat people differently based on suspect categories i think we have time for one more question a gentleman in the front this is this is for uh christian uh can you talk about briefly daca uh this issue i am uh against it you want me to take it i'll say this i could talk about that but i think you probably do better to hear from solicitor general on that as he's much more involved in those issues than adf is um the state of texas with 25 other states led the challenge to dapa dapa which was the follow-on program to the 2012 daca program both programs what the president was trying to do was unilaterally without congressional authority confer lawful presence and work authorizations um to well one million or over one million and then the next program about over four million otherwise unlawfully present aliens and so we blocked the 2014 program through litigation and then litigation was threatened over the 2012 daca program and recently within the past few weeks the administration then had agreed to wind down the daca program and that was what the states had asked for and so we pulled our lawsuit and because they had satisfied the demands of the settlement letter essentially that we sent now in response to all that though uh 19 other states in the district of columbia have now sued the executive branch saying no you can't wind down daca and one of the great ironies of this is in their pleadings they are affirmatively saying things such as well daca confers substantive rights and this confers eligibility for medicare and social security and it's like all the arguments we were making for years that they were kicking and screaming that we were just no this is just prosecutorial discretion there's nothing to see here and so they're almost pleading their way out of court in the sense that if daca was unlawful to begin with because it conferred substantive rights and didn't go through the proper procedures well of course the government should be able to pull that immediately so this is going to be obviously though ongoing litigation on this and also arizona has a cert petition before the supreme court that's somewhat raising this issue because arizona tried to deny driver's licenses to daca recipients and the ninth circuit said that federal law preempted that but the problem with that theory is even if you disagree with us in our position even if you think this is just prosecutorial discretion it was simply about not deporting if it's just enforcement in action that cannot possibly be a congressional statute that preempts the state's ability to structure any of its programs and so either way you have that i think arizona has very strong arguments there um on that preemption case but as far as where daca is going uh it's gonna depend on these various lawsuits that are still going to be uh standing out there and uh we may not have filed our last brief on this issue and i guess one other little irony is that the states suing the government over daca would be citing your case as to why they have standing every time they cite the standing in nationwide injunction uh we should like start a little tip jar or something in the office but look we were right on that and i get it look they are perfectly within their rights to come to court and say yeah we took other positions but you know what texas is right about that and if they want to say texas is right in that regard we welcome them okay i think that just about wraps things up i think we'll we'll reconvene for round two of the masterpiece battle at the supreme court probably in early december so we'll see you there thank you lawrence that was great thanks to all of our panelists uh feel free to get some more lunch and

using my Swiss meringue buttercream recipe but you can get an i or description box brandon turn your phone off this is television we're live okay let me save mine's off and added some passion fruit powder to it look it's so so good [Music] I'm gonna put this in the fridge you gotta trim it yes crumb coat it I'm not gonna turn the sides of this one because I have plenty of room between the board and the cake so we're just gonna ice it I made final coated yes I'm icing this and a light blue color because we're gonna go back and mirror glaze this with sort of like a marble ocean water color you know what color always reminds me of the ocean the ocean [Music] first trip to the cooler and then we'll do a final coat [Music] hey Josh well you want to hear another user comment yeah and a wolf what's up Anna she said hi Joshua hi I looked up Margaret Braun and oh mama mia right man of hers - she's amazing that's my cake here Oh wonderful cake you did today I'm sure if she sees your cake today she would go to the over the moon I see now why you really love her cakes they have unique touch and so does your artwork well done have a blessed day thanks Anna I will have a blessed day every day is a blessed day for me [Music] we're gonna start on some of our decorations for our sealife cake I have some of these really awesome molds these are like shelves I have some little fishies I have this awesome seahorse he's a two-parter so I can do both sides and stick them together and it's a whole seahorse and then I've got a cool starfish and some other little clam shells I'm gonna do this out of modeling chocolate I have some sculpting chocolate here and you get this stuff it's really really hard out of the bucket we have to to process this a good thing no one was standing right here so we have a blog I kept some of this off I'm gonna make them all in white and then we're gonna paint them with confectionery plays later let's make some fish first I'm pushing the chocolate into the mold and I'm gonna take a knife and cut it away and then what we're gonna do after this because these are very delicate I'm gonna put them in the freezer and then I'm gonna gently pop them out [Music] let's do a seahorse you see this little baby he's so cute all right so I got my two hats and I gotta make one of these starfish because they're suspicious because they're so cool all right one more and then we'll get these guys in the freezer perfect we'll come back pop them out now we're gonna start on our mermaid tail so I have this sloka eye who I called Myrna Anderson Cooper anyways I have him for like color inspiration and just so I get sort of the parts right just in case I'm like oh that's right they're not real but this one is you know what his name is what beefcake that's his name like from height or her chest beefcake I was I was waiting for like the Bank of America flag do you like did you did you or did you order beefcake it's for work resource for work it's for work all right so I'm going to keep them close by and then we've got a piece of modeling chocolate that's already processed and I'm gonna kind of do this like I do everything else start here and then I'll put it up on my form and then once I get it how I want it will transfer it to the cake [Music] all right so we're gonna give it a little bit of life with a shape here cut the end off all right let's get them up onto the form here my hands are super hot so I'm gonna set him to this side cuz he's a little bit one and I'm gonna work on his tail and his fins all right so I'm gonna roll this thin to one side all right so I'm just cutting out the edge of his tail here I used a soft piece of foam because I'm gonna actually make his texture on both sides so I don't want to flip it over and squish what's underneath first I'm gonna pinch everything really really sort of thin on the edges so what I'm doing is I'm just making some long marks all right I got the tail to a pretty good spot and we will make a couple of fins all right this is the same idea except we're just gonna make a little fin 300 some scales I'm gonna use just a tip to do this [Music] I think he's in pretty good shape so now I'm gonna let it set up completely and then we'll glue the tail on and then paint it super super dangerous that's so fun so we're gonna make some coral I have some isomalt here that is boiling boiling hot I'm gonna color and we're gonna pour it over ice I know it sounds crazy but as it gets into the cracks of the ice and solidifies you pull it out and it makes these really cool Coralie shapes so this one we're gonna do pink I'll add a little pink to this whoa that was a lot of pink gonna be very bright and then I'm gonna add a little bit of titanium dioxide this is like white white just to make it opaque just a skosh I dig that color I've got on gloves just like with the croquembouche I get this on my hand throw the glove off ready here we go [Music] let's see what we made stick to the container a little bit - so she closed something she's coming she's coming Oh would you think that you think that it was gonna suck come on your own man about cake so there's gonna be probably pieces of ice that are trapped if you try to pull them out you're gonna break your structure so just let them know how cool is that though we're all gonna be a little different depending on the temperature at which the sugar goes on to the ice and then also you can change up your ice shape so these are like little round nuggets of ice you could do cubes you can do like sonic ice circle a sonic drive-in ice it like sanitized it's the best ice no ice no the other comments will be more relevant but I want them to answer below what which is the best ice sonic ice is the best ice I don't think it has that same ice yeah chick-fil-a actually really and I'm from Atlanta and I support chick-fil-a they changed [Music] great now I'm gonna clean up a huge mess we're gonna paint our mermaid tail now I have my colors here it's just a variety I have firm Anderson Cooper as my model and then I have some confectioners glaze a little bit of gold in two brushes [Music] now that Mattel is completely painted and before it dries I'm gonna just add some little gold flecks [Music] now we're gonna beer glaze our cakes they're both completely cold I got my mirror glaze i thinned it out a little bit and it's worn we're gonna add a touch of blue just to get it blue and then we're gonna add a little bit more blue and kind of swirl it and then see what kind of pattern we can make so this is neon bright blue yo why not let's try okay I'm not gonna mix it all the way and let's add some turquo and maybe a couple drops of white here we go now we're gonna stack our cake with bubble tea straws I'm gonna glue it down with a little bit of chocolate so it doesn't slide around and I'm actually going to cheat it to the back so you put all our fun coral in the front [Music] all right now it's time is that great all right the first thing I'm going to do is add the tail to the top of the cake using bubble tea strong I mixed together some brown sugar and sugar in the raw to emulate sand and I'm gonna put that around the bottoms here now I'm gonna place my colorful coral pieces I made some seaweed pieces just like I did the hair for the crying onion and I'm gonna add those next now I'm going to add my sea creatures and shells using white chocolate [Music] our under-the-sea cake is complete I think she turned out beautiful yeah if you guys want any of the tools or supplies it's all in the description box below and there's also a coupon down there for you let's taste her mmm breaking news man eats best cake ever thanks mom Anderson Cooper I got nothing because he's embarrassed cos he

so you know and you probably do i'm not a big cartridge person i use my own blend i use distill it a lot and syringes and make my own however when i find somebody that can prove to me that their product is prepared the right way has the right materials in it and isn't going to give me any carcinogens associated with cartridges i'll use it this is custer cart custom cart and what i've done i've checked them out and i expect all of you will also that's right what we're looking for is not just flavor anymore this is a delta eight cartridge one is gorilla glue and one is ice cream cake both delta eight ninety four percent thc this is by marin analytics signed by their chief scientist why am i doing this why am i doing this because mrs stoner likes cartridges okay standard cartridge packaging but the difference is it's delta eight okay and there's a big thing going on now in our industry about delta eight and what it can do for you and how it's just a little bit different so what i think we want to do is taste it delta eight distillate analysis okay here we go five clicks on this is a standard c cell battery cheers everybody very tasty i make my own blend but this is tasty stuff very tasty this is the ice cream cake let's move off the ice cream cake onto gorilla glue gorilla glue is going to be a little bit more piney in flavor both one gram cartridges here we go definitely a little bit more piney so that the birthday cake you definitely had a little bit of a sweet taste with the gorilla glue you have more of that tangy piney i'll call it the traditional weed taste but both of these are also utilizing terps now i haven't seen a specific breakdown of the terps that are in here but there are terps in here and i'll say this when you're looking for cartridges today you need to remember no glycerin no vitamin e find out the process by which they extract okay i found out i'm happy this is a good brand so if you're looking for cartridges it's custic custom carts c-u-s-t-i custa carts give them a try very tasty thanks for watching hope you enjoyed this discussion of our gorilla glue and birthday cake custard carts have a great day everybody and you must

the style of the cake and the design work involved three to six months is recommended if somebody wants a very simple white cake you wouldn't have to plan very far ahead but for something unique and creative you'd want to go with three to six months for a design an etiquette stage you should have at least one slice of cake for all of your guests so based on that you can kind of get a rough idea of how many tiers you'll need as you're deciding about your wedding cake it's really important to keep three things in mind one you should definitely know your budget the second thing is you should have an idea of what you want for your wedding cake what type of style how big you want your cake to be how many servings that's going to feed and the last thing is you're really going to want to do your research know how much the average wedding cake costs in your area if some of the more important things are whether the person is professionally trained or has experience that they really understand the food product they're not just looking at it from a decorators perspective but they have sort of a whole vision of what they're trying to achieve they know how to decorate a cake they know how to make it taste good they know how to get it there in one piece they can advise you on whether the buttercream is going to work for you in July in Texas or if you should go with fondant flavor is every bit as important as the way your wedding cake looks and don't be afraid to use different cake flavors or feelings for each tier of your wedding cake some flavors of cake work better than others in different times of the year for instance if you're having a summer wedding obviously you don't want to go with something very heavy you want to keep on the lighter side normally in the fruits like lemons and raspberries whereas a winter wedding you can do anything you know more the chocolate based cakes and they're more rich kind of cakes too but again it's personal taste there are no rules any longer you", "jGSrB5nPHNI": "what's up guys i'm lori and this week we are making a faultline cake with russian piping tip hopefully make a really epic cake hopefully so I have my two 8-inch round cakes and I have a six inch round cake I'm just gonna pop them all over their cake pans I hate this like crusty you know Bert looking bit that's not actually Bert it's just the sugar caramelizing so we're gonna carve out off so that way we have that nice moist cake underneath [Music] I feel like that heights perfect I never carved off a big amount of that hump on top but that's gonna give me nice even layers and I feel like it's got that good height going on so let's carve off that caramelization on the sides so since we're gonna do flowers in the middle I thought that I would do like almost a teal-colored cake so I'm combining my electric green and my sky-blue it always makes it beautiful to color and if I find it's too blue I add a little green and you know you got the idea I like that I feel like it's a pretty teal so I'm just gonna put in a separate bowl for my crumb coats that way I don't get crumbs all in my nice fresh pacing [Music] [Applause] now that they're come coded I'm ready to start layering them up see normally fault line cakes you don't have the three different size of the cakes well I guess two different sizes of cakes are kind of stacked up together Russian piping tips are so big so I want to make sure I have room to kind of pipe them here where is a normal fault line cake is just that flat cake that has the pattern on the front edge and on the icings built out we just need to back up the Russian piping that's a little bit you're gonna have that like half-inch hang it over I don't like fragile edges like I said gravity is not cakes friend so I'm going to tear it except I realized five minutes ago that I only have two straws so we're just gonna make it work and add the next layer on top and because this one's on a cake board it's just gonna sit right on top of if I can only just get it onto the cake in one piece not centered but I can Center it a little bit here a little uglier tuilik is like aerosol is feeling like a really darker teal for the cake and now I want some like soft pretty colors so I'm vibing off like the yellow orange purple and pink [Music] I don't want it to do rose you know sometimes when you do something is like these perfectly straight rows I know I don't want that I think I just got a start maybe I'll do clumps and I'll do like some clumps of flowers you have to make you first made your decision I made a decision Bob Ross would be so proud I'm just gonna start I think oops I won my Oh too far creating all these different kind of flowers and alternating back and forth but I'm feeling it I think it's gonna be good if I can oh that one wasn't good that one wasn't good but you know what I could just pick it off much better that's much more acceptable [Music] it's like it never happened again these tips are so amazing but they also are legit the worst [Music] I really hope I have enough facing but apparently you're just supposed to smooth out the tops and then kind of clump it convict kind of o of it kind of on to those slides that we had like partly covers up the fault line so just going about it super unsure about this okay this look like it's supposed to look like [Music] yes I like the colors I know that much I know that I like the colors in the direction that we're headed in I'm just not sure how much icing I'm supposed to be putting on right now um or like how low into this like little fault line area like I supposed to like dip right down I don't know nobody knows I guess you guys will know coming into this video whether it works or not and make your own choices [Music] I'm mixing with flowers into my into my icing now I'm supposed to smooth it out with a bench scraper but all I have is this and it has a little curved edge on it so it doesn't sit flat I'm gonna try because I feel like the layers are supposed to be perfect perfectly even I feel like that's like pretty good considering I mean not considering the cake I mean considering me I'm feeling so proud yeah I did it is it smooth enough no I mean I feel like it's possible but now I'm gonna like attempt to paint that edge with a little bit of gold and vodka I mean you can use vanilla extract I just prefer vodka me to say that pour went out for my homie [Music] hi I'm filming but I had to answer because you watched my videos and I didn't want you to see me not answering your call during my video ok I gotta go I will send you a picture of the cake and I love you ok fight I'll kill you you disappear I feel like people will understand why if there are any cake decorators out

requests to do sassy Ruiz of YouTube videos on basic cake decorating and basic techniques so today's video is going to start the program and today we're going to work on basic techniques of baking a cake I'm going to be showing you how to bake a cake from scratch and also the best way to use mixes to get the best cake you possibly can out of a prepared mix this is just the first in a series we'll go on in the next video to work on icings and different types of icings I'll teach you how to make those and then we'll go on from there on basic piping techniques so I hope to show you a lot of the basic skills that everyone needs to become a great baker and a great decorator let's get started the most important part of baking any cake always starts with your oven most people don't realize that you can calibrate your oven on the dials on the top of your oven one of them usually comes off and there's a mechanism there that can calibrate your oven so to do that you need to start with an oven thermometer and I always put an oven thermometer in my oven I set my temperature and then I check to make sure it's reached the proper temperature you'd be surprised how many ovens are inaccurate and baked maybe 10 or 15 degrees hot or cool and that makes all the difference in the world on your final cake so buy yourself a good oven thermometer and just hang it from one of the racks and leave it in the oven all the time so you know that your temperature is going to be accurate the other problem with ovens is they're not always level so buy yourself a little level and set it right in the oven when the oven is cold and check to make sure that your oven is perfectly level and put it going across in a couple directions and that way you'll ensure that your cakes rise very evenly the placement of your cakes in the oven is also very important most ovens have about five shelves that you can adjust the racks on for a regular round two inch cake you usually want on the second one up you want it between the middle of the oven and just below the middle of the oven for a sheet cake you always want it just below the middle never ever bake your cakes higher than the middle level on a standard oven because as you know heat rises so as the top of that oven gets hotter the top of the cake will bake too fast it forms a crust and then as the rest of the cake Rises that crust will split and a little bit almost like a little volcano the the batter sort of erupts over the baked crust and it really ends up being a mess so always be sure that you place the cake properly in the oven now many people today use a convection oven where there's actually a fan in the back the elements are behind the oven and the fan pushes the warm air through on most of the convection ovens today there's a setting for baking cakes and what that does is it lowers the fan speed so that it just creates enough circulation in the oven to keep an even heating without blowing the batter out of the pans so be sure if you're using a convection oven that you put it on the setting for baking a cake the temperature of your oven is also critical for a regular cake pan a regular aluminum cake pan that is not anodized you want to set your oven at 350 degrees now that would be for an inch and a half or a two inch pan if you're using an anodized pan and you will know if it's anodized because when you buy the pan this happens to be a fat daddy-o's it'll say right on the pan that it is anodized the anodizing process molecularly changes the metal and it conducts heat much better if you're using an anodized pan make sure that you lower your temperature in the oven by 20 to 25 degrees so today we're going to be baking at 325 because I will be using anodized pans also if you're using a dark metal pan whether it's anodized or not you want to lower your temperature 25 degrees if you're using a glass pan to make a sheet cake or any sort of cake glass always bakes at a lower temperature as well lower the temperature 25 degrees and lastly if you're baking a deep cake if you're doing a 3 or 4 inch cake you always want to lower your temperature down to about 325 so the only ones that really bake at 350 are your classic aluminum pans that are not anodized and that are an inch and a half to two inches high everything else needs to be in a little bit cooler oven that's the basics of baking with a cake now let's get going and we'll make a cake from scratch now that our oven is ready to go and it's preheating I want to show you how to prepare our cake pans for today's class I'm going to be teaching you how to make a scratch yellow cake and I'm also going to be teaching you how to use a cake mix and get the best results out of a cake mix so for the scratch yellow cake that we're making I'm going to be using two 9 inch pans these are 9 inch round by 2 inches deep and these are anodized aluminum these happen to be fat daddy-o's pans now when you're baking a homemade cake and you're using butter that cake will stick in a pan far more than any other cake mix on the market because the cake mixes use oil or a different sort of fat in them butter caramelized with the sugar and the flour inside the the cake and it just sticks like glue on your cake pans so if you're used to using a spray that you can buy in the grocery store to just spray your pans it probably won't work for this you can use the spray but you still have to dust the pan with flour or even better use a piece of parchment and that's what we're going to do so I took a piece of regular kitchen parchment I fold it in half place your pan on there and then just use a pen and go right around if you don't have parchment paper you can use regular wax paper it works very well and just cut the circle out okay now most of the parchment paper that you buy today will have a silicon finish on it and that will help release the cake but not all of them have it so to be sure the cake comes off the paper we're also going to grease this paper so I'm going to use a brush and today I'm just going to use a little bit of Crisco or you can use a pan grease that's available from global sugar art or you can use your spray shortening that you can buy in a grocery store any one of them will work do the sides of the pan whoops and then just put a little bit on the bottom and then lay your paper in there and now we're going to grease the paper as well so just hold down one side and then you can just grease the paper a little bit alright now to make sure that the cake rises properly if you've greased the sides of the pan you have to flour it otherwise as that cake starts to rise the grease from the side of the pan just makes the cake fall down it doesn't get that strength that it needs as it's baking along the sides of the cake to continue rising and hold it up there so if you grease the sides of a pan make sure that you flour them I'm just going to take a little pan of flour and just put a little bit of flour in the pan you can dust right over the paper that you've greased that doesn't matter at all but I do want to make sure that the whole pan especially the sides have some flour on it now I'm ready to make my cake and deposit the batter in here so I'm going to go ahead and prepare the other one we'll come right back and we'll start mixing the cake okay the oven is set and the pans are prepared we're ready to start really making cake now I'm going to go through the ingredients and what they do to a cake is well and how they affect it the recipe that I'm going to give you does allow for substitutions and I'll go through those substitutions as we go through so we're going to begin with two and a half cups of cake flour now I've priests if tadesse into the bowl and now I'm going to measure out two and a half cups into the sifter again so the proper way to do flour is to fill the cup and then use a knife or a straightedge and go right across the top so I want two and a half cups and then a half a cup it's just easier to sift all the flour ahead of time into a bowl and measured from there all right if you don't have cake flour you can use two and a quarter cups of all-purpose flour and 1/4 cup of corn starch and sift those together the cake will not be quite as light but it will still be much better than just using all-purpose flour to this I'm going to add three teaspoons of baking powder and one teaspoon of salt now the baking powder is your leavening agent that's what's going to cause the cake to rise and the salt is just going to give flavor to the cake and then just sift that together in a bowl sifting is an important part of baking it actually separates the flour molecules so that the fat whether using butter or oil or shortening can can envelope those little molecules of flour and coat them better and you get a better a better cake that's more tender and has better crumb today I'm going to be using a KitchenAid mixer if you don't have a KitchenAid mixer or some sort of a commercial mixer like this you can use a small handheld mixer but the speeds will be different when I refer to this being on medium speed you'll you'll want to use a high speed on a hand mixer and what I'm talking about using a medium or low speed here you'll probably use about a medium speed on a a hand mixer now the mixers today come with a regular beater blade and the newer ones come you can buy them that have a rubber edge on them and I believe that KitchenAid makes one called flex edge and this is actually a beater blade that fits this these are really nice because they actually scrape the bowl for you and you don't have to stop and keep scraping down the bowl so this is what I'm going to use today so we'll start with our flour in the bowl this is called a two stage method this is not the creaming method this is a much easier way to make a cake my whole project today my initiative my goal is to teach you how to make a cake the easiest way possible with the most accessible ingredients and to have the best success making the cake so the flour the salt and the baking powder are in the bowl and I'm going to add the sugar and there's one in 3/4 cups of regular granulated sugar if you want to substitute use 1 and 3/4 cups of superfine sugar and that is available in some grocery stores the finer the sugar the more tender the cake will be but don't use confectioner sugar because confectioner sugar or powdered sugar actually has cornstarch in it and the fine fine sugar will actually make a gummy cake so superfine is okay or granulated and we're going to put this on the mixer attach our blade we're just going to put this on low just for a few seconds to incorporate the ingredients and that's all it really takes now to this I'm going to add the butter and the Crisco now you can use all butter if you'd like I'm using 8 ounces or excuse me 4 ounces which is one stick of butter and I'm using 1/3 of a cup of Crisco you can use all butter or you can substitute the Crisco with oil here's the difference if you use all butter the cake is going to be a little bit heavier and it actually will be a little bit drier butter adds a wonderful flavor to your cake but it does dry them out a little bit just the addition a little bit of the of the Crisco with no trans fats in it makes a big big difference in the final cake so we want to make sure that the butter is soft but not room temperature it should still be cold and I should just be able to cut through it easily and that works great if you're taking the butter right out of the refrigerator just place it on a plate and put it in the microwave for about five seconds that's all it takes and it will soften it enough so I'm going to add the butter to the flour as well as the Crisco and I'm going to mix this on low for about maybe a minute maybe a little more what we're looking for is a sandy consistency we don't want it to gum up into a dough we just sort of want a a nice sandy consistency so this is just about ready this has been mixing for about two minutes and I'm just going to turn this back on so you can see the consistency it's just sort of a sandy consistency you don't want to keep mixing that until it gums up into a really stiff dough that would be wait way too far now we're going to take one cup of whole milk now you can substitute skim milk or 2% but you'll get a better cake with whole milk it has a little bit richer fat content content the milk has protein that actually helps the structure of the cake it gives tenderness to the cake and it also gives color to the final cake make sure that all your ingredients except for your butter are at room temperature if you're uncomfortable leaving milk or eggs out until they're room temperature mix them all together and then put them in the microwave for 10 seconds at a time and stir them in between until they come up to at least 70 degrees but being room temperature is very important for a good quality cake bakeries commercial bakeries and and retail bakeries spend a lot of time making sure that all their cakes and their dough's and batters come out at the proper temperature and they actually take the temperature of every ingredient and then they can calculate how warm the water or the milk or the liquid has to be so that their batters and dough's come out the exact temperature and that's how you get real consistent results in making a cake so I have one cup of whole milk I'm going to add three whole eggs and I'm going to add three egg yolks and the egg yolks are going to give it a richness and a color I'm also adding three teaspoons of vanilla and I'm using pure vanilla and I'm just going to blend that a little bit until the eggs are just broken up now I'm going to add half of the liquid to this mix while it's running on low speed okay the ingredients are incorporated now they're certainly not smooth but they're all incorporated if I wasn't using a blade with the with the rubber edge on it to scrape the bowl I would stop at this point and I would scrape down the bowl that's a very very important point always make sure that the bowl is continually scraped so that all your ingredients are mixed properly I'm now going to set my kitchen timer for two minutes and I'm going to put this on on around a medium speed on the KitchenAid and that's about between three and four on a KitchenAid mixer on a hand mixer you can go right to high speed for two minutes okay our first two minutes are over now I'm going to put the mixer back on low speed and I'm going to gradually add the remaining egg and milk mixture with the vanilla in it and I'm adding this slowly so I don't get it back in my face all right that's just blended now once again if I did not use that beater blade I would put this down and I would scrape the bowl really well I'm going to put this back up I'm going to set one minute on my timer and this time I'm going to put this on medium speed which is just between two and three on a handheld mixer you can put it right around your medium speed as well okay my minute is over my cake is completely mixed just to make sure you can use your blade or your spatula and just scrape the bottom of the bowl and if you see that it's not completely blended just blend it by hand for another couple seconds but this is completely blended and you can see the consistency of the batter it's very light it's very uniform it's very creamy so we'll scrape this off batter I'm going to show you an easy way to divide cake batter in into two pans you can eyeball it and you can just sort of guess or you can actually do it like bakeries do and make sure that you have the exact same weight on every cake so I'm using a scale I'm going to put my pan on the scale and I'm going to hit the tare button and that brings my settings down to zero and I know from having made this before that it's going to be about 22 ounces of batter in that pan so I'm just going to dump that right in the middle there's 21 and there's 22 ounces in that one there's 22 ounces in that one and I have just about two little spatulas left and I'm going to put one in each then just spread the batter with your spatula until it reaches the edges and the final thing that you want to do is just tap them on your table that will level the batter and if there's any big air bubbles in there they'll pop right out so those two cakes are now ready to go in the oven again this recipe is for two nine-inch cakes or you can make three 8-inch layers now I want to talk just for a second about a regular cake that you would serve at dinner versus a wedding cake or a professionally decorated cake where you want a full four inch height these cakes will come up almost to the top of the pan and this is going to give you about a three and a half inch cake if I were making a wedding cake and I wanted a full four inches I would put this batter in two eighth inch pans not three and those cakes will rise just above the top of the pan and after they're cooled I'll put them back in the pan and I'll slice even at the top of the pan and that gives me two perfectly symmetrical two inch high layers that are perfect for making a wedding cake but for the average home use two 9-inch pans will give you a really nice cake so I'm going to go pop these in the oven I used anodized pans so I've set my oven at 325 degrees and I'm going to bake these for about thirty minutes when we come back I'll show you how to test to see if the cake is done while our scratch cake is baking in the oven I'm going to quickly show you the best way to make a cake from the mix now I want to talk about mixes in general one of the most popular mixes on the market is probably a Duncan Hines cake mix and 20 years ago this was a very different mix than it is today today this package weighs just a little over 16 ounces it's just about 1 pound of mix you used to be able to bake two 8-inch cakes with a Duncan Hines cake mix and it would come right over the top of the pan that's no longer the case there's less mix the formulation has changed and now you get two rather thin cakes I actually think this is more appropriate four to seven inch pans or if you want a really full cake actually one cake mix per pan for that reason here at global sugar art we came up with our own cake mix and we have purposely made these with more mix in it this actually has 24 ounces in it which is a lot more cake than a regular Duncan Hines cake mix we also sell it in a two and a half pound bag and in a five-pound bag this cake mix comes in yellow white and chocolate and this particular formulation I made specifically so that the cake is a little bit heavier and is perfect for covering with fondant this isn't going to be a light airy cake like a Duncan Hines this is going to be a little bit firmer cake with a delicious flavor and it will cut and serve beautifully so this is great for parties weddings large cakes and sculpted cakes as well in this case we're going to start with a cup and a half of room-temperature water again just like the scratch cake always be sure you use room temperature room temperature ingredients so I'm going to put three-quarters of a cup in there we're going to make the yellow cake and I'm going to put all the mix right in here at one time now this particular mix we have we have a second mix that will be coming out very soon but this particular mix already has the eggs in the mix so it's great to have on the shelf at home because you never have to worry whether you have enough eggs in the refrigerator to make a cake at the last minute so put that on the mixer and I'm just going to start this at low and then I'm going to put this up to medium speed around for for three minutes I always like to use a timer because it's very easy to get distracted when you're baking and start doing something else and you really forget how long a cake has mixed and you can under mixer over mix the cake very easily that way so I've got three minutes on my timer I'm going to start it you go right up to about a number four on here okay for the last 20 seconds or so I'm going to slow the mixer down and I'm going to slowly pour in 1/4 cup of vegetable oil and again I'm just doing this slowly so that it doesn't splash out after you have the oil in add the remaining water that's my timer we're going to let that mix a minute okay just as in the scratch cake if I didn't have a beater blade on there with the rubber edge I would lower the bowl and I would make sure I scrape this down really well then I'm going to set my timer for three more minutes and I'm going to put this at a low a low to medium speed right around a number two on this mixer that's going to beat for three more minutes okay we've come to the end of our three minutes we'll turn that off and just like I did with the round nine-inch cakes I'm going to divide this batter into two eighth inch pans and we're going to put this in the oven again I'm using the anted ice pans so I'm going to bake these at 325 just one last thing on the cake mixes this line of cake mixes that we have also includes a delicious carrot cake mix that actually has real carrots in it unlike a lot of commercial cake mixes that are just more like a spice cake this is a nice firm and very moist and delicious carrot cake with carrots in it the new line of cake mixes that we'll have out very shortly is a different formulation and to that you will add eggs and water and oil and it's also going to be packaged in a little heavier packages so that you can get a nice full cake and it won't be just a one pound cake mix like many of the commercial mixes will come right back we'll be back at the oven and I'll show you how to test if the cake is done okay our 30 minutes is up and actually when I looked in the oven they still looked a little on the pale side so I set it for the additional 5 minutes this cake will take 30 to 35 minutes depending on your oven so we're ready to test the cakes you can reach in or you can just pull the cakes out a little bit the one thing you'll notice about a butter cake when it's done is it'll just gently start pulling away from the side of the pan I have a toothpick and when I insert that in the center it comes out perfectly clean and I'll do that on both of them and also test clean the old standard of touching a cake and see if it bounces back sometimes applies but typically on a real tender butter cake it will leave an indentation but the cake will be cooked it's important that you do check with a toothpick once these are baked I'm going to take them out I'm going to put them on a wire rack and I'm going to let these cool on the rack in the pan for 10 minutes don't take them out of the pan for at least 10 minutes we'll come right back when this time is up and I'll show you how to remove them into our cake is now cooled for 10 minutes and we're ready to invert it onto the wire rack you'll notice that it's just come away from the edge a little bit in a well-balanced recipe and a butter cake that will flatten out and we'll make a nice layer that will require very little or no trimming on the top to get a flat cake take a sharp knife and go around the edge of the cake all the way around so that you cut away from the edge now the easiest way and probably the safest way to invert a cake is to put the rack over the top use your pot holders to hold both of them at the same time and then just invert it and then you can lift the pan right off the top and you can see because we use the parchment paper for the bottom that it popped right out of the pan and then just slowly peel that back and you can see even though I greased the parchment paper you can see how some of the crust actually stuck to the parchment paper that shows you how much a butter cake can actually stick to a pan if I didn't have this on here Ida had a hard time removing it from the pan at this point let this cool completely don't wrap it in cellophane or put it in a plastic bag or refrigerate it don't do anything in this to this cake until it is thoroughly cooled give it at least an hour outside on you on your counter or a little bit more when it's completely cooled then you can either ice it and go forward and decorate it or you can put it like in a ziplock bag or you can wrap it with some sort of a cellophane wrap and leave it on the counter overnight or you can refrigerate it whatever you choose to do well it could be right back to finish this video and we'll take the cake mix cake out of the oven and show you what that looks like and the last thing we're going to do is we're going to actually cut into one of these layers so you can see the texture inside the cake we'll be right back well we're finishing up our lesson and cake baking and I wanted to cut both the cake mix and the scratch cake for you to see the final results you can see the difference in coloring and texture on the outside and that's just because this one is mostly butter and this is all oil in this cake and it really does make a difference the cake mix with the oil in it is going to be a very fine grain it's very soft and it's very moist the scratch cake is going to have a wonderful wonderful butter flavor you just you just can't compare the two flavor-wise although I think this is an excellent mix if you don't want to use a mix this is a fabulous recipe to try you'll find that it's very soft it's very tender and it's also very very moist this whole video that you just watch is sort of a prequel to a series that will be coming up next in my next video I'll teach you how to make a couple different kinds of buttercream and we're going to slice a cake fill it and ice it in two different methods and from there the series will continue on and I'm going to teach how to decorate with buttercream there's been a lot of education on how to decorate with fondant but buttercream has not gone away and I would like to teach you how to use a pastry bag and start IPPs and round tips and specialty tips and flower tips and how to get beautiful results with good old fashioned buttercream stay tuned I hope you've enjoyed this video the products are available at global sugar art and thank you for watching you", "QSzgwrAHQGM": "hey guys welcome back to my channel in the next few tutorials you may notice a slight difference now in this period of uncertainty I don't have access to my goal or recording or baking equipment because I'm also changing location but don't worry I've come up with a feed back to basic recipes which involves no fancy equipment or ingredients so I hope you enjoy these recipes I hope you try them out and most importantly stay safe so because of the current situation many weddings and large events are actually being canceled and postponed however some people are still going ahead with their weddings and even making their own wedding cakes and so I thought I'd do a tutorial of how to make your own wedding cake at home the best part about this tutorial is that you can use any cake or fillings you'd like it's all about the technique how to make it look elegant in a very easy way so I'm gonna be making a lemon cake I think lemon is a very traditional flavor when it comes to weddings so I've pre baked a lemon sponge here which is my normal sponge with extra lemon zest it's as simple as that I've also got some of my Swiss meringue buttercream which I flavored vanilla some of my homemade lemon curd I'm going to be making a lemon sugar syrup to soak the cakes in I've also got a springform tin so you can use a ring but this is all I have at the moment so it's the same tin that I've made the cakes in and here I've got some baking paper so to start as usual I'm going to trim my cakes to begin I'm going to trim off the dome at the top now as you know I like doing this by hand but if you want to use a cake wire then by all means use a cake wire but if you want to try this freehand you can start by marking the very top of the cake and going around whilst rotating the cake when you get back to where you started you can then start cutting in a little bit further and eventually you'll cut all the way through and have a nice flat top of the cake now don't throw the excess away they can be nibbled on later and I'm actually going to use this half of the cake to mark the other half of the cake so they're as even as possible same technique rotating as I go and now I'm going to cut each of these in half again so I've got a total of four layers once again mark around halfway before I start cutting inwards and the same on the other side so I've got full even layers of cake just gonna clear up the crumbs and I'm going to make my lemon sugar syrup which is really easy I've got 50 mils of lemon juice here freshly squeezed and I'm going to add 50 grams of sugar the equal amount of liquid and sugar same as any sugar syrup and usually I make it with hot water but because I'm using lemon juice I'm now going to heat this in the microwave until the sugar dissolves so just about thirty seconds heat it up slightly give it a little mix to dissolve the leftover sugar and I can see that the sugars dissolved and now I can start brushing it over the cakes now I find to really bring out the lemon flavor in a lemon cake it needs a good soaking and it really brings out the zing in the lemon too and now I like to soak the cakes at this stage rather than when I build up the cake so now I know the soaking is done and I don't have to worry about it and just something I also like to do I like to stack the layers of cake in order that I'm going to build it up in so keeping the two bases one is the bottom and one is the top the cake layers are ready to put that to the side and clean up the crumbs so you may have seen me do this technique especially if you've seen my Instagram stories when I'm making a small cake such as a 4 inch cake we're basically going to use the shape of the ring to help build up the cake nice and straight so what I'm going to do is take strips of baking paper and line the inside of the ring now if you have acetate it is better to do it with acetate because it is slightly stronger I don't have any and so I'm going to do a double layer of baking paper instead to make it a little bit more sturdy so before I start adding the cakes I'm just going to pipe a little bit of buttercream and that's gonna act as a glue for the first layer of cake so the cake doesn't slide around the board so I'm going to get the first layer and remember this is one of the bases so it's nice and flat and I'm going to place it in the paper in the tin and press it down so it's secure to that buttercream so now this layer of cake is in I can actually tighten and knead up the baking paper around it so it's more snug so because I'm filling the cake with lemon curd as well rather than just a layer of buttercream I like to pipe a ring of buttercream around the rim of the cake and this will prevent the lemon curd from spilling out and I'm sure many of you can relate when I say there is nothing worse than lemon curd or Jam spilling out of the cake when you're trying to build it up so this helps prevent that and now I'm gonna go in with a couple of spoonfuls of lemon curd and spread it out just with the back of a spoon so if I wasn't building up in baking paper I would use a palette knife for this because it's easier to spread but I can't quite get the angle right because of the baking paper so I'm just gonna do it with a spoon and I'm going to pipe a layer of buttercream on top of the lemon curd to get a nice even layer of buttercream so I'm not gonna smooth this buttercream down with a palette knife like I usually would I'm just gonna go on with my next layer of cake and then press it down and that pressing down action will naturally flatten that buttercream and I'm going to repeat the same process I'm going to pipe a ring of buttercream around the edge of the cake and the paper is actually helping guide me around the cake add the lemon curd and then some more buttercream next layer of cake and repeat this one more time so what look very top of the cake nice and flat so I'm going to flip the last layer upside down remember it was one of the bases that I kept from earlier and place it on the top give it a nice press down and I can actually see now that the buttercream is hitting the size of the paper which means the sides are going to be really nicely packed with buttercream which will help with the shape of the cake too so now I'm going to put this in the freezer for about 15 to 20 minutes to really firm up the buttercream I want it as hard as possible to maintain the shape if you don't have space in your freezer you just need to keep it in the fridge for a bit longer until the buttercream is firm so the cakes been in the freezer for about 20 minutes and when I touch the size I can feel that the buttercream has completely hardened so now I'm going to grab my makeshift turntable which is an upside-down bowl with some damp towel on top so it doesn't slide around and now I'm gonna carefully release the tier now this is a springform tin so it's actually quite easy to open and lift off and remove the paper and you can see that because the buttercream is hardened it's not even sticking to the paper anymore if it's not hardened enough it will come off with the paper or acetate so you want it as far as possible and you can see how beautifully straight the sides are too so it's a really good trick in getting a straight-edged cake so if you wanted to go for the full naked look you can stop there and then start decorating I personally prefer the semi naked look which is basically a crumb coated cake so I've got a little bit more buttercream here and I'm gonna go over with a thin layer all around the cake so I'm using my step pallet knife and spreading it around the sides filling in the holes and making it as even as possible and then onto the top as well it's also a lot easier and you have a real turntable but this is working just fine so I'm going to even off the top almost pushing the buttercream over the edge of the corners because we want to fill those corners in and I'm just gonna use the scraper to make that top layer really thin and now I'm gonna scrape off the excess buttercream around the sides of the cake rotating the cake every time so this is not only scraping off the excess buttercream but it's also moving the buttercream around the cake so filling in any holes and eating up the very bottom corners to so I can see that some buttercream needs to be filled in here so I'm just gonna go over with my palette knife again and then scrape on top of it now usually I don't care so much about a crumb coating because I go over with a second layer of buttercream but because this cake is going to be a naked cake I want the crumb coating to be as even smooth and neat as possible so I'm happy with the sides and now I'm going to clean off the top corners one swipe with the palette knife from the outside in scraping every time so I'm happy with that I'm now gonna put this back in the fridge for about 20 minutes to half an hour for it to fully set before I go on with my decorations so I thought to make some dried lemon slices because the cake is lemon and they're really easy to do as well what I'm gonna do is cut some thin slices of a lemon so I'm not using a mandolin here because I find that if the slices are too thin they'll actually get burnt so I cut them to about half a centimeter thick and I'm leaving the skins on and all I'm going to do is place them on a wire rack and the oven is on at a hundred degrees Celsius so really low and then basically going to leave them in there for about an hour to an hour and a half for them to dry out and it's really as simple as that don't worry if there are any pips in there because once they're dry they'll either dry into the slices or just fall out so once they're fully dried out that looks something like this now some of them have caught a little bit of color I personally like when that happens as long as it's not too dark and they really are the most simple yet effective decorations for a cake so 99% of the time wedding cakes have fresh flowers on them and I actually always get asked about using fresh flowers on a cake you can get edible flowers which are obviously safer to use for cakes because they're obviously not gonna poison you but you can use non edibles you just need to know how to prepare them correctly like this one right here you can see it's totally sealed and it goes into a straw and therefore none of the flour is actually touching the cake so what I've got here is some fresh peonies which are my favorite flowers and definitely wedding like I've also got some eucalyptus branches and I basically want half of the bottom stem completely clear of so I've done that with the peonies and I'm just going to tear off the leaves of the eucalyptus to prepare them for taping together so I'll start with the flowers I want to trim the stems to no more than ten centimeters because you obviously don't want a really long stem in the center of the cake you also don't want it too short I'm now going to use some flower tea and wrap it all around the stem including the very bottom I'm then going to get a straw and measure it to about a centimeter below where the stem stops and then simply insert the flower stem into the straw and that's the flower done and I'm going to repeat this to each flower that I want to put on the cake so wrap around the stem trim the straw and insert the stem into the straw I also really like the variation of the open peonies the half-opened ones and the buds I think it's gonna look really nice on top of the cake now peonies are edible but only if they're grown organically eucalyptus leaves are not so I'm going to be extra careful with the eucalyptus leaves I've also only got small straws so I can only do one of these flowers at a time but if you have those jumbo straws you can fit in two flowers or even the flower with some of the eucalyptus leaves as long as they're taped together I'm gonna do them separate but I am gonna pair up the eucalyptus branches I'm gonna take two here and then take the branches together so obviously it's a lot easier to do this and there are no leaves on the stems which is why I took them off before I wrap them up nice and tight making sure the ends covered so no SAP comes out of the end once again into a straw and actually doing this the wrong order but I'm gonna trim this now and I'm going to make a few more bunches so I've got the flowers and leaves prepared to decorate and my lovely lemon slices so now all that's left to do is to decorate the cake so the cake is nice and chilled which means it's not going to start squashing or moving around when I'm adding the flowers and decorations so I'm going to start with the large flowers I think it's easier to put the larger flowers in first and then the small decorations around it a lot of needs to do is simply insert the straw into the cake and then I'm actually gonna use some scissors to help push the flower down as much as possible and go in with the second flower and you can see that no part of the flower is actually touching the cake which makes the cake still safe to eat go in with a smaller buzz and then I'm going to insert eucalyptus leaves in between the flowers I'm just channeling my inner flower arranging skills I feel like when you're using fresh flowers you don't need to apply too much effort for it to look beautiful so for the lemon slices I'm just going to apply a little bit of buttercream and place them in between the flowers so they're almost like sneaking out of the flowers don't forget the back as well equally as important especially at a wedding and there you go DIY wedding cake complete with fresh flowers eucalyptus leaves and dried lemon slices if you're still getting married in this difficult time then good for you and don't go Kate let's try and make one yourself you're making enough sacrifices already hope you enjoyed it I will see you next time", "qZVFcAvNhtA": "[Music] boys",

need clays you're going to need pastry bag this one is already filled with the sandal with clean plate Chris also makes it whipped cream clay as well but this one spreads a little easier to make it look like frosting like this cake um here's some seeds I found them in a little wedding section at the crash slurp and if you want flowers you can either make them with our molds points oh god this one was already made my mold or you can make them by rolling out some cosmos clay and making it a little flower alright so let's get started so I took some of this great play out and you just shape it I think I have some here comes in a tube like so so we're going to do is take a little bit out and then make sure you fraps you end up real tight like twist it like this then add a rubber band around it to keep it air out okay so you have your place clay this one and then take it into a ball and then we're going to make a shape it just like this solo into a little ball get all the creases out all it doesn't matter if you're going to cover it with the whipped cream clay but if you're not you're just going to make it look like a fondant covered cake I want to make sure that all the creases are out of it a little pressed for time I'm just going to make it into a little cake will take about a day day and a half to dry if you using polymer clay you're going to go ahead and bake it okay so that's the base making a different sizes for the different tiers ok so now so this one is dry I got a this is that I can get this and may a flower nail for cake decorating and I put a little bit of polymer clay on it and I'm going to stick the clay to it after it dried like that's the cake place ok so I'm going to take the tape off of this notice I don't have a icing tip on it you can but it's not necessary so we're just going to now start on the edges out here keep going on like so let's not prophase okay fine out and you take your toothpick and smear it or smear this clay around to make it look like it's been covered I'm cake knife ok at the top Oh get some of the missing spots here okay so now we have that covered you can take your to stick you can kind of flatten some places if you're going to make it to three-tiered cake you're on them make sure its kind of even to get back the other one up ok so after you have smooth out your cake whatever you want it to look like this takes that and about a day to dry and then you can take that off you got your kick bottom there so I already made the top I put a flower on it and some leaves you can take some world bond put it on your cake like this and stick the two tiers on it just like that you gotta tt-take you can cut your pearls like this after it dries take your add glue and put it all around and then add your pros like so okay so you got your little wedding cake okay Mike enjoy you", "F2gDXUW3eWQ": "hello I'm Peggy Porsche and welcome to my cake studio coming I got into cake decorating when I was about 14 years old

right time at the right place and got really good jobs from the start and the ball started rolling and the business I've grown really fast within three years and now we are about five people in the company in summertime when it's busy it will be more and it's going really well I would say my signature style on my signature look is very feminine and pretty very detailed lots of pings and flowers stripes polka dot basically the ultimate girly dream of cake my secret ingredient I would say that to me it's really important as I'm afraid pastry chef that cakes to taste as good as they look and therefore we use mainly organic ingredients so ever possible and everything is really fresh we don't use any aromas or flavoring expensive so we really just stick to fresh ingredients everything is

welcome to Man About Cake. I'm your host Joshua John Russell and this week we're making a brunch cake. I'm gonna build a two-tiered coffee flavored cake with Italian meringue maple buttercream and it's so so good Ready, let's brunch it! I'm gonna break down four square 10-inch coffee cakes. This is a coffee sponge cake. By the way, this is the wrong size I was supposed to bake an 8 inch so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna cut them all and then I'll take my template and trim the sides and the sides we'll use to build a parfait in our little mug we're gonna make for the top so it actually worked out perfect. Offscreen: Okay, so we're just gonna ignore it that you messed up. JJR: You don't have to ignore it. I'm not perfect. Offscreen: So there's... no garbage cake? JJR: There''ll be garbage cake. You can't even have garbage cake right now, you're like ketosis. This is the cake I made the unicorn Reindeer with. Same recipe. It's a coffee sponge cake so it's a little lighter, and we're actually gonna soak it with a coffee syrup All right now, I'm gonna stack them all up and trim them at the same time Offscreen: You guys know how the trim song goes? JJR: There's no trim song. Offscreen: Yeah, it goes \"You see me stack it and trim it trying to get my cake on nice and purdy.\" (more join in: nice and purdy) JJR: You stole that. That's not an original thing. Offscreen: No dude he doesn't know the words. JJR: Alright, now we're gonna save this cake because I'm gonna use it for the mug on top to build a parfait, and I will fill her. Now we're gonna fill the cake with Italian meringue maple buttercream but we're actually gonna soak it with some of this coffee syrup as well So this is just espresso powder that I dissolved into a little bit of simple syrup. Get a little extra coffee flavour in our coffee. This is a sponge cake so the cakes you've seen me do before I don't soak because they're really dense. Sponge cake is a little bit more... spongy. *laughs* No, for real. It's it's more spongy. You can get extra flavor and moisture in by using simple syrup You can use plain simple syrup as well, but I like the extra added coffee kick to it, and then the maple buttercream. Offscreen: Isn't there like a really awesome comprehensive video that we made? JJR: There is. If you guys want this recipe for the Italian meringue maple buttercream There's a link in the description box below where I show you how to make it. A bonus video! Offscreen: And there may or may not be a super sweet song in it. JJR: There's not a... oh god. Offscreen:The JJR mixin song. JJR: Did you just plug your your album? Your latest single. Offscreen: I got a soundcloud mixtape dropping. JJR: The latest song called bler bler bluurrr What's the name of that song? And then I'm gonna add in some granilla. This is uhh Stuff that I've always put in my cakes for like the crunch factor. I usually make it just vanilla so I call it granilla It's kind of like granola, but it's like way, sweeter. This is cinnamon. It's so good It's like cinnamon toast crunch. Mmm. That's perfect. It's so good All right, we're gonna get this in the cooler to firm up and I'm gonna trim the sides do a crumb coat then a final coat. I'm gonna make a mug for the top of the cake. We have to do this around a form, this is a 4-inch dummy cake here that I've lined with a little wax paper And then we'll use this four inch cutter for the bottom because we're actually gonna build a parfait Inside of it so then somebody can eat the cake out--probably me. We got some gum paste here I'm just gonna roll this out with my spacing bands. I feel like that's aggressively long enough Going to measure this. I'm marking it We cut a straight edge Alright. Now we have our strip and just roll this guy up Make sure it's tight, and then we will just cut down the center here Boom. We gotta leave him to dry overnight. Right now, I'll get his bottom here And I'm gonna make the handle. This we're gonna do freeform, but I do want it to be maybe three inches long. Alright, I'm gonna roll out a log Take a fondant smoother so I can get my hand prints out of this. Offscreen: So there's no evidence. The perfect crime! JJR: You don't know how it was made! I just want to make sure it's even All right We're gonna leave this guy to dry overnight and he's gonna be the topper on our cake I'm gonna make some fried eggs out of fondant and candy melts. By the way, my favorite food ever is a fried egg I would sleep with one under my pillow. I love them so much Fried eggs are my favorite thing Offscreen: Do you like them over easy? JJR: I like them over medium. Offscreen: So just a little runny? JJR: Never scrambled. Offscreen: Why? JJR: Because you ruined it. Offscreen: Scrambled's the best! What kind of eggs do you like Brandon? B: *incomprehensible* JJR: No those powdered eggs are so gross All right, so I'm gonna roll these out There's no cutter for this because all fried eggs are a little different So I'm gonna do a bunch of them so what I would do is start with equal sized balls, so they don't roll out Too much, it's gonna be like a motif on one of the tiers And I want them to be around the same size. All right, so I'm gonna roll it a little bit And then I'm just gonna push down the edges Depending on how you roll it will determine the shape See? So they're all gonna be a little bit different All right so for the yolks I'm actually gonna use yellow candy melts Cos they look just like yolks! But the way candy melts are made, they actually have this little dimple on top. This little raised area. We're gonna cut that off and then I'm using my finger Just smooth around and yhen we'll sink them in different places because you never know whether the yolks gonna end up. It's not always in the middle. And the last thing I'll do to make them look really like eggs I'm gonna hit on with a little bit of edible lacquer, so they look greazy. So cool, right? By the way all of the the lacquer sort of beaded up on here, it won't dry that way. It'll dry shiny. All right. Let's make some waffles. So I've got a sort of a waffley colour here. I'm gonna airbrush these waffles, so this is just a base color and in order to make these I made my own tool So this is one of those easy pie crust cutter things that I've taped each of the holes up with and then Put a piece of saran wrap on top of. But it works, so we're gonna roll this out, we're gonna emboss it. Brandon: Yesss. JJR: Your favourite, and then we'll cut out this center part to be our one of our waffles I'm gonna keep this kind of thick too because waffles are a little thick Waffles, don't have bubbles. *little voice*: Waffle it! Yeah. So we're gonna cut out this middle section here. Alright now I'm gonna just make sure that I get all my edges off. Make it look like a real waffle. There we go! And then we'll airbrush them. How cute! Now I'm gonna make a bunch of waffles and a bunch of eggs and put the cake together Brandon: Why are you doing blue fondant? JJR: So we're doing the two colors of our logo. B: Nice. JJR: So the tier above this will be like the teal color and then on the mug we'll put a little man *whispers* about cake. Love it Now we're gonna stack our cakes using bubble tea straws. All right, I'm gonna take a little bit of royal icing to cover up my seam. Alright. Now I'm gonna add my handle with chocolate and a little freeze spray Now we're gonna put our waffles and our eggs on using some royal icing So we have the pieces that we cut off the side earlier and then we have some of our buttercream, the maple buttercream and then we have some mirror glaze. This is gonna go on top I'm gonna dye it brown. That's gonna be like our coffee, and then I also cut out a little man from my logo that's what I did was I printed it and then I laminated it with pieces of tape like I did in the cherry painted cherries episode And then I cut him out and he dried over a form and we'll glue him on as well. But I'm gonna build my parfait first. I put some buttercream in the bottom Maybe I should have done this before I glued the cup up here. I'm not tall enough! All right Let's put in some of our pieces All right, we'll do some more buttercream Okay, so we'll do final buttercream All right, I've got some mirror glaze here that I thinned with a little bit of water I'm just gonna add some brown food coloring to it We're just gonna make it black I could add a little bit of white to this to make it coffee with cream I surveyed the boys and they all agreed. Offscreen: Black coffee! JJR: Black coffee like like their hearts. Aw, that was mean. Alright last thing I gotta do is put our logo up there. I'm gonna do this with a little bit of royal icing Our brunch cake is complete, and I think he looks super delicious Don't forget guys if you want to learn how to make the Italian meringue maple buttercream, there's a link down there with a bonus video.

learn to make a silver platter out of chocolate you'll learn to ice cakes quickly and easily you'll learn to make really fast gum paste flowers and do a lot of different piping techniques but today I want to talk to you about something I get a lot of questions about how to price cakes it's a very tricky one most people right off the bat forget to account for their time and the time that it takes to decorate a cake cake takes so much time and you have to remember the time that it takes talking to the clients about the cake you've got to remember all the time that it takes you to go buy your ingredients and hunt down that special tool you need or find that silicone mold all that time needs to be accounted for and your client needs to pay for that you don't that is the time that you're giving them and allotting to them so labor is your biggest expense and you have to account for it you are worth a whole lot your time is worth just as much as my time as anybody's time so do not forget to charge for your time if you had to make a guess as to percentage-wise I would say that food should your food cost should be about 15% or so 15% so if you think about what you're charging now for your cakes if your food cost is more than 15% you might want to think about that if you're thinking oh well this has about 8 pounds of butter and that costs $50 so I need a charge you know 75 for this then you got to think again because you got to get that food cost lower your labor is worth a whole lot more the butter is just think of your time with the cakes as time away from your family and from friends so you need to account for that time and your clients should be paying for that your family shouldn't be a lot of bakery sell their cakes per serving and that's how we do it because it's an easy thing for clients to understand oh how much per serving so one thing that you should get in line is what how big is your serving you know kind of get a standardized serving chart and really stick to it so that you can charge accordingly another thing to consider is geography if you're a New York City or Los Angeles and the amount per serving is some standard price your price should probably fall in line with that your shouldn't be you know a third of it because then you're just making a third of the money everyone else's that seems kind of silly a lot of people say to me that clients in their area won't pay this certain amount of money for these cakes well they certainly won't pay for that if you give them that same cake for half the price if you charge half the price today you'll never get three times the price in the future you need to commit to a price and wait for the clients to catch up they'll get there I promise if they want good quality cake from a good quality cake decorator they will they will pay the price and just remember when you're buying a piece of art like a painting it's not the paint in the canvas that you're paying for it's the artist time and his schooling and his techniques and his skill and that's what they're paying for to when they're buying a cake from you so those are things you need to consider when setting prices for your cakes to learn how to make a cake like this with everything you see here at cake icing modeling chocolate and piping please check out my online course contemporary wedding cake with classic piping techniques I really hope to see you there [Music]", "DdleYEyNG78": "hey guys welcome to rosie's dessert spot in this tutorial we'll be making this fun three-tier cake decorated with fondant drapes you'll need a four a six and an eight inch cake that has been crumb coated that's just thin layer frosting all around the cake here i'm creating a final layer of frosting that is still ganache and i've mixed through a little bit of buttercream smooth it out with your bench scraper i sell these at my website rosiespot.com and then pop it into the fridge with the lip raised for the four inch and six inch notice they're both sitting on cake boards the same size as the cake create that crumb coat and then again that final layer of frosting nice and smooth with the lip raised after about 20 minutes so it's set hard in the fridge grab a super sharp knife that's been dipped in boiling hot water and cut off the excess this is what's going to make your top edge super super sharp if you have any bits where a little bit too much came off just go in refilling with some of that dark chocolate ganache dark chocolate ganache is a really really good medium for fondant it's my go-to whenever decorating with fondant you could also use a crusting buttercream like american buttercream that has all unsalted butter and no vegetable shortening recipes for all of these will be listed in the description box below and in the eye icon up top let your cakes rest in the fridge till they're nice and firm usually about 20 minutes and then roll out some fondant here i'm using because brand of fondant and cornstarch to make sure it doesn't stick to my countertop roll it out to three millimeters in thickness drape it over your cake secure that top edge and then undo the pleats and massage it onto your cake i didn't skip any sections i just sped up this video so you can see the whole process of just turning the cake pulling those pleats apart and then gently massaging the fondant onto the cake and it will stretch by the way and it can also smell fear so honestly just do your best with practice it'll come to you if you're just starting off with fondant i recommend using shorter cakes just to wrap your head around the process and then work your way up to taller cakes i've cut off the excess now i'm using two fondant smoothers to smooth out the sides and the top pinching them together and then sliding them back and forth to create that nice sharp top edge you want to repeat this step for all of your cakes if you're enjoying this tutorial feel free to subscribe we do upload a new cake decorating video every week on to the very last cake and again just clapping the scrapers at the top and creating a nice sharp edge into the eight inch i'm placing three bubble tea straws you could even place five just to be sure and these have been cut flush with the top of the cake stick your tears together with a little bit of that ganache again make sure it's centered and then add the dowels into your six inch as well these are placed in the cake to support the weight of the top tiers stick on with some ganache again and then at the base of each cake i'm going to fill in with a ribbon just to hide the seam you could use double-sided my kitten in the background you can use double-sided tape to stick that together or you could also insert a pin with a round head that just sort of says hey i'm here don't forget to remove me before serving and then your cake is ready for decorating so i have some white fondant and i'm going to roll it out to about two to three millimeters in thickness i'm going to cut it down to a rectangle shape and then i'm using some straws to help create that pleat pattern what you want to do is first of all make sure that your excess fondant is stored in an airtight container wrapped in glad wrap so you can use it for later and then grab some straws drape your fondant over the top feed through the next one and then pinch those together you'll want to pinch after each addition of the straw just to make sure you get that really nice indented um drag slash curtain sort of effect happening [Music] once you have that pattern remove your straws and then give this curtain a pinch on either side i'm going to call the curtain let me know if you guys call it something different i'm sure there's an actual technical name for this once they're pinched at the sides apply it to your cake with a little bit of water pull the drapes apart ever so slightly just kind of fan them out it makes it look a little bit more delicate and realistic i find where each of these meet i'm gonna be adding in some flowers you could add flowers just between the four and the six inch and between the eight and the six inch so there's only two section four flowers just like this you could leave it at that or you could add some at the top and the bottom as well like i have totally up to you i think just the two looked really delicate and i personally i don't know i feel like i over did it by adding it at the top of the bottom let me know in the comments below which you prefer and that's it your cake is complete i hope you guys enjoyed this video tutorial and give it a go if you do hashtag rosie's dessert spot so i can see your awesome creations as well this was a really really easy cake to make i can't stress it enough how easy these drapes are to make and they look pretty awesome on a one tier as well thank you again for tuning in and i hope to see you again in the next one you", "_3QiNcnDtGE": "crows creative cakes adding beauty to your special occasion [Music] simply beautiful", "4TBLawlROrs": "well with just two days to go until you journeys a wedding the couple have announced that they have chosen a red of velvet and chocolate cake for the big day well Juliet SIA is here to show you how to make yourself one and so it was a recent tradition and it was broken because it used to always be a fruitcake but now the the Royals for their weddings are doing things a little bit more interesting bit different and what's your take on this cake what do you think yeah I think it's really interesting red velvet I think it's a bit of a Marmite it's quite a love it or hate it I think it's a really lovely texture cake very old terminal yeah we've had the press release so they've said red velvet in chocolate we're not sure whether that means to tear of red velvet and chocolate or have they because regularly you have a cream cheese frosting with a red velvet perhaps they've gone for a chocolate ganache so we've tried a couple of combos but the most important thing it's about the sponge because it's quite a yeah so what is this funds made of them so the sponge is it's basically a vanilla cake with a light chocolate flavor and it's got lots of buttermilk in there and white vinegar and it's very very light and fluffy okay so I'm going to show you how to make the white vinegar because I watched bake-off last night and they were because it was a vegan week cause them all a nightmare of a time they had and they put in the vinegar into to get the bubbles yeah to make it a release of carbon dioxide and get it all raising yeah make it nice and like okay yeah so do you make it as same as the normal cake it's a bit different and it's a little bit more delicate I'd say so we'll go through all the steps so nemours but we've got we've got butter and sugar in here yeah and so we're gonna add a nice generous slug of vanilla extract yeah first of all and then we're going to use some strong red food coloring so you know you get the very strong pace and that will gives it the color red colour yeah nila smells a minute so we're gonna put quite a generous amount of red into here just turn this up for a second oh yeah then you can fear that lovely dark red kind of reddish brown yeah and then we're gonna add eggs so just eggs one at a time hmm get that mixed in and then once these are in we're gonna add some buttermilk and that's gonna make it really nice and moist it's a bit tangy as well okay and also some flour cocoa powder and salt so Jim I just I'm combining the cocoa powder and salt into the flour mixture and just come all that in here yeah just to kind of distribute so that's that sort of who likes chocolatey flavour yeah yeah just give it a scrape down and we can fold the rest of it through see that's that's all you need to do with the electric blender yeah so that's got the eggs in there all the details of this are on our app by the way and you've already downloaded it a hundred thousand times Wow this is very popular I'm like John that's amazing so what I'm gonna do just kind of bring it together a little bit more so got the eggs in there that's cutting you can see how nice and ready yes so the next stage in the recipe is just to add the buttermilk and the flour mixture about a third time alternately so she'll top a third of that into there first of all and then a bit of the buttermilk oh it's like yogurt yeah isn't it and then you stir it so just do that a new house has to be buttermilk you can't get away with anything else I always just use buttermilk I'd rather I think this recipe is one of the more kind of delicate one so you can make your own it's quite sour yeah it is a bit morning mhm again well you're not gonna finish this are you gonna go into something else now we're making this but you're gonna say so much to do the last thing to mention just have a look at this so if you just but if you just pop the bicarbonate soda into the wife is gonna use it I'm just gonna show you cuz I watch it all bubble up its really magical say Wow see and then you put that into the mixture mix it through right at the end yeah once we've got all the buttermilk and then it goes into the oven and bake it 480 degrees for about 20 minutes open the oven until about that time so it's nice and risen and then just check its cook through twenty to twenty five Nikki don't open the oven I don't open the oven on this one and also I like to do it in three layers it's quite lights so just kind of nice thin layers so yeah so bad at baking can't do you know I really am couple of a recipe I just can't do it really no I get bored I get like all doubt do that haven't got the right size ten I'll use that so what you end up is with your three layers of sponge so we kind of generally use a cream cheese frosting and we've also tried it with a chocolate ganache and then we're going to decorate and we've gone for all terminal colors so we've made just he's just like the rolling sugar paste that's very pretty isn't it really cool thing and it's a really simple to do so what we've done we've got some IV cutters here and they cutting out the shape of the sugar but they've also got this plunging sort of mechanism in impress the detail so you don't have to be that skill to do it usually give it a go yeah just about harder at first I should be fine see Jamie just never get powder and then just just sort of plums just now like this and you can as you can see you'll get the detail of the veins on the leaves when you push the plunger onto the sugar paste didn't take mine out that's very clever isn't in that time and so you can just do them in loads of different autumnal shades and then just to make them look a little bit more realistic we've got this food coloring dust so you ones have a ghost you just basically get a get a dry brush and you can get these dust colors in all sorts of different shades I just kind of rub it on this bit like eyeshadow isn't it yeah how doing it mainly is amazing what you can get now if the dry leaves all you can do it onto a fresh should I do it on that one yeah you can do it on that one when they I sometimes that hard and offer picks they're easier to handle and you can just brush over with any and then you just stick them onto the thing with something I think the one with butter icings we've got a cream cheese frosting here and you can just do that we've kind of again we've looked at the Kate magazine Instagram we've taken inspiration for one of her designs and just put them on in a kind of cascade up and down the tiers okay stick one on it's week one on yeah we can well I was gonna say we should definitely cut into it because we've got both versions we've got the cream Chennai lining cuz she would like wedding trying to help me that's going on here that's fees sticking on your leaves Oh should I go for it go for it I'm just gonna step on your cutting there holly is the red velvet and chocolate ganache filling hang on is there like a is the boarding all right no one's answering the okay I want you to try both actually I will I'm gonna get the chocolates hold it let me hold it down sorry well held I'm Noel semi so that's your chop my fingers I am out of control hold this still I can't get in I know we've had time on this item cut the cake now we've made it there's no chance we're gonna stop before we've eaten it there we go okay okay now you can see the difference you've got there so what's this one oh this is your red velvet eye cream cheese it looks very Christmas it does the red anyway yeah all the awesome thing that's the classic combo this is with chocolate ganache and I'm adding a chocolate I like a ganache she will I kick a - I like a cream cheese I prefer the cream cheese and oh me too no I won't go with the chocolate inside perhaps soldiers have separated Scobie and the sponge is really lovely really really moist and yummy you", "dZSMreyrNk4": "oh hi I'm Carrie with Kara's cakes and my tip for the day is a black and white wedding is really striking however if you use too much black icing on your cake it will turn everyone smells gray teeth their

thought okay I can wait at the camera Daniel you want to lick the bowl so what do you think you would like them to put I would recommend white somewhere in the wedding cake because it's going to please more of it yes sometimes in a flavor where I would probably do those bodies here because if we do all for each there's different flavors Jackie will have to take the cake down so you can cut

the wedding cake becomes the site to see the wedding cake to me is a showpiece next to the bride and I think it should be honored that way the two things that everybody looks like when they go to a wedding is they want to see the bride and they want to see the cake but you may not realize just how much time attention to detail and innovation actually goes into making your wedding cakes such a jaw-dropping mouth-watering edible work of art putting together we're thinking is very exciting because you have an inner structure when you see the canvas of the wedding cake five or six tiers all perfect all why ready to be decorated it's so exciting it's like stretching a canvas it's what the artist does and designers are blanketing the white canvas with increasingly intricate and elaborate designs one of the most awe-inspiring design elements cake artists are creating are sugar flowers so realistic in their appearance they need to be touched to discover they're truly a sweet and the process to make these sugar flowers bloom requires true creativity and dedication to detail this is the process of making a classical sugar rose the sugar roses are not exposed to nature we have to mimic what actually happens to them when they get wind and Sun and we have driving over the spoon trays to get the natural curve and I also injured the edges to get this natural feel when it comes to established and creative cake artists if you can dream it up they can concoct it out of sugar love shoes make it you're completely edible cake topper and regardless of how you decorate the cake on the outside today's cake artists can customize the flavor of the cake to reflect your tastes on the inside it's good blood orange and key lime and coconut and strawberry raspberry mocha anything you name it if we don't have it we'll make it for you but it's not only the cake that makes an incredible sight to see with some of their latest innovations very different cakes are literally taking their wedding cakes to new heights with these sky's the limit cake stands the cake stands and the platters allow for tremendous airspace between the tiers instead of a cake that's heavy and weighted down the tiers are stacked into a tight pyramid and it looks sort of burdened our cakes are light and airy and the colors flow and sometimes cake designers not only go to great heights with their cakes the wedding can require that they also go to great links we have shipped Cakes all over the world we have gone to Sardinia Mexico Japan England we've gone all over regardless of how far the cake designer has to go or how much time an effort must go into each important element of your cake for the true cake artists creating that perfect cake for their brides is simply what they do you", "0zSjwidX3RM": "Hi, I'm Tracie. Welcome to, or welcome back to Auntie's Cakery. Can I just tell ya, I love the color pink! I've done pink birthday cakes, pink gender\nreveal cakes, I've done pink cookies and pink cupcakes! So, I made a pink Wedding cake, and I'm going\nto show you how I did it. But, before I do, I want you to take a look\nat this product I have right up here. They are unique wedding toppers from a company\ncalled Marri Tree Lane. They come in Male and Female, each three different\nskin tones. I'll tell you a little bit more about them\nat the end of the video. Now it's time to start the cake! I'm going to get my wheel going, and make\nsure this cake board is centered. Then, I'll stack and fill. Her, I'm putting on a buttercream border,\nand then filling it up with cream cheese icing. The cream cheese is a little bit softer than\nthe buttercream and if I didn't put a border, it would probably squeeze out. After I've got that all stacked and filled,\nI'll put a thin crumb coat of buttercream icing on it. Smooth it out with my bench scraper,\nand clean up that top edge. That was a 10 inch cake, I'll also do an 8\ninch cake, and a 6 inch cake. This is just the final coat. Clean up that corner with my plastic mylar\nfolder. This is something I've never done before,\nusing a mold to create that sequin texture. I'm really happy with the way it turned out. Smashing the fondant in there... Smashing it really well so it picks up all\nthose details. Using my fondant smoother, I'll just smooth\nit out especially along that cut edge. Then I'll stick it in the freezer for a few\nminutes, and it will pop right out of the mold. To stick it onto the buttercream, I'm using\na little bit of piping gel, It's a little more sticky than water, but\nwater will work. These are still chilled, so I'm just molding\nthem around the cake. Gently sticking them on. Right along that edge, the mold is perfect,\nand it matches up beautifully! Pinch that seam together and it's as if it's\none large piece. Here I have a little extra, so, I took two\nof the edges to match up, so we have only one definite seam line. Kind of cutting it crooked so it matches up\na little bit. Take out the back piece. Squeeze it in there. And push it together. That will be the back of the cake. I'm also piecing the opt together and squeezing\ntogether that corner edge. I'm not too worried about this top piece because\nit's going to be covered by the other cake, but I want it there just so it's level with\nthe rest of it. Now, I'm going to airbrush some shine on it! I made a little test spot up there, and I\ndon't like how it covered up the pink, So, with the pearl sheen, I added a little\nbit of color dust to make it pink. And, I like that much better, so I sprayed\nthe entire cake. Now for the top tier, I'm going to make a\nmarble effect for the fondant. I've got White fondant, light pink fondant,\nand dark pink fondant. I'll just mix those together, just lightly. When I roll it out, it will have this beautiful\nmarble effect. I'll just drape that over the cake, smooth\nit down, and cut off the excess. With my fondant smoothers, I will smooth out\nthe edges, and crisp up those corners. Now, back to the 10 inch cake. I'm using this quilting mat just to mark the\ncake as a guide where I want to stick the ruffles. For the ruffles, I'm using my pasta machine\nto thin those out. I thin them out to a number five. I'll just cut them a little shorter. I'm cutting a two inch strip. On a piece of foam, I will make the ruffles. Using my fondant roller, pushing down and\nwiggling it. Makes a beautiful wide ruffle. With the water I'm only wetting about a half\ninch. I don't want the ruffle edge sticking to the\nfondant. After I've got that nice and lined up,I'll\nstick a little roll of paper towel under it to flare that ruffle edge. I will continue to do that all around the\ncake. Once I've got about 5 or 6 ruffles on, I can\nremove those paper towels, and lay down that edge just a little bit. do you see how those ruffles still flare out? That is the exact effect I was looking for. Before these edges get too stiff, I'll gently\nfold them under. It's a little easier to use my brush. Now, for these last two strips, I've cut them\na little bit wider. Two and a half inches instead of two inches. I'm going to try and line those up, even those\nspaces out for the back of the cake. All those ends left big clumpy lump and the\ntop, so, I'm taking a 6 inch cake board and cutting all those lumps off. After I've got the scraps removed, I will\npaste those ends down with a little bit of water. I'll put the cake board back, so it still\ncreates and even surface for the 8 inch cake to sit on. Stack all the tiers together. Then, I'll work on painting the ruffles. I have a little white food coloring, mixed\nwith a little pink. I'm going to roughly paint the edges. I'm not trying to make it look perfect. For the tops here, I've just got a smaller brush,\nand I'm brushing the edges right there. With the end of my paint brush, I'm pinching\nthose sequins down a little bit to close the gap between the two tiers. Thanks so much for watching me decorate this\nbeautiful cake. I just love how the pink marble turned out! Well, the pink sequins too,\nBut most of all, I love these ruffles! I love the diagonal, I love the little pink\nedge, So pretty! I'm so grateful to Marri Tree Lane for sponsoring\nthis video. Without sponsors, I wouldn't be able to produce\nthe content I produce for you, so I'm grateful for them, and I'm grateful for your support\nto my sponsors, and to myself! You are wonderful. I am so excited to keep continuing creating\nvideos for you. So, let me tell you a little about these and\nwhy I chose to feature them in my video. When I saw these for the first time, I thought,\n\"Oh, those are so elegant!\" They come in a beautiful decorated box, with\na magnetic opening, They are cushioned really well, so they arrive\nsafe and sound. And it looks like it's made of wood, but it's\nmore like a heavy resin. Really durable. It also comes with a little plexi glass plate,\nyou'll set the plate on top of the cake, and then the toppers on top of the plate. Say that ten times fast! They are simple, and I love the emotion they\nshare, especially the hands cupped together. There are different skin tones, so you can\nmix and match, You can also mix any gender combination. And they work on so many different styles\nof cake. From really elaborate, to medium ones, and\nthe ever-so-popular rustic buttercream cake. Again, if you want to take a look,\nI do have a link in the description box. Thank you again for all of your support! And for watching me decorate this beautiful\nPINK wedding cake. I will see you next time!

inquiry to delivering the cake to the venue and everything in between loads of you ask me for this tutorial I'm not actually gonna be making anything I'm just gonna be talking a lot but I hope you find it informative I'm still learning I've been doing wedding cakes for about 4 4 5 years now and I would consider myself still new in the industry every time I do a cake I learned something new so I'm gonna share with you my knowledge and what works for me there's no one way of doing things so you may have heard different things from other people but again I've learned with experience so thought I would share what I know I'm going to start with you getting your inquiry so a customer emails you hi I'm getting married they say a date and then they ask what your processes of a wedding cake or how they go about it firstly remember that they are a customer and you want to show that you're nice keen and like perfect for the job basically you're trying to win them over little do you know they they may be talking to loads of other cake makers so you want to make a good impression I always congratulate my clients so if someone emails me saying hi we're getting married next year I go congratulations on your engagement already it sets the tone now secondly it depends what the inquiry says some people ask hi I'm getting married do do tastings or some people may do a really detailed description so you obviously have to read what they're after so a lot of clients ask me about tastings I did actually do a YouTube tutorial recently of how I make my wedding tasters I think this is the best way to give them to your client for them to try now I don't have a shop and I make every cake pacifically for the client so I used to do free tastings I was quickly persuaded not to because a few people tasted and then I never heard anything so they got free cake and you may have heard this phrase before but time is money so I've started to charge for tastings I do fifty pounds for the clients to just collect the samples or a hundred pounds for a sit-down consultation actually hold mine at the wedding gallery where I have a stand myself and it's a beautiful space and I offer them drinks tea coffee etc it's a hundred pounds to sit them in for about an hour and talk through the cake as well as tasting the cakes now again some people price this differently mine may seem a little more expensive however the tasting comes off the price of the cake so essentially the tasting is free if the client goes ahead with the wedding cake I think it's the fairest way because if for some reason the client doesn't go ahead you don't lose out so it's during the tasting I usually explain how I work and how the prices work as well now again that depends on their client's original email if they want everything in an email first the main key is not to hide any details you don't want them to get really enthusiastic about the cake and then pretty much secure the order and go oh by the way there's another hundred pounds delivery on top so you want to be honest and upfront about everything there and then whether that's by email or at the tasting itself I offer up to four different flavors of my tasting if people want extra then I charge accordingly but usually four is a good number because my average size cake is usually three or four tiers similar to this one right here so if they're trying full flavors and they have three tiers they usually choose between two or three let's use this cake for example because I have it right here this feet 70 people I'll get on to portion sizes and top tier only feeds ten so it doesn't make much sense to flavor the top tier with one flavor because only ten portions will have that flavor so it's good to balance out the flavors so for a cake this size I would usually recommend either one or two flavors so during the consultation and tasting I actually bring a four now this is for my own purpose and it's got the clients name the date the style of the cake they want the sizes the decoration delivery everything on this piece of paper because you don't want to miss any details I've learnt from mistake saying oh I'll remember that by the time the cake comes around trust me you don't so I find if you write everything down there and then in the meeting and when it comes to making the cake I have this in front of me again to make sure I don't miss anything so pricing and portions for me the two come hand-in-hand because I priced my cakes depending on the portion size just as an example like I said this feeds 70 and so I price it based on 70 portions the same design feeding 120 will be the same price per portion but obviously four more portions so it's gonna be more expensive pricing is one of the most difficult things that I had to learn during my cake journey let's say there's no rule you can go to a lower bracket or a higher bracket depending on what you're offering the kind of cakes you do and what your competitors are charging really I quickly figured out the portion guide pricing the most effective and also just let the client know immediately roughly how much they're going to be spending on the cake so for example if you say six pounds of portion 120 people they know that it's roughly 720 God my math so I will tell you what my prices are this is by no means telling you how you should price your cakes like I said each to their own every cake maker is independent and they're offering something different I based mine on the brand I built up my experience the time it's taken and of course ingredients so my wedding cakes start from 500 pounds so basically if you want a wedding cake from me it's going to be minimum 500 that was something new that I introduced recently mainly because if I was going for a lower price per portion people were basically getting two hundred three hundred pound wedding cakes to make a wedding cake is a lot of effort and a lot of time especially spent with the client which I absolutely love but and that's the beauty of the wedding industry that you get to know the client so well but to only do the same amount of effort for a 200 pound cake wasn't worth it so I put that minimum spend again up to you if you want to do that so I have three price points for my portion guide and I always say starting from because my cakes are always completely bespoke so for example someone wants a naked cake and the next person wants the same cake but with gold drips which is obviously more work and so you charge a little more but my price points are six pounds a portion seven pounds of portion and eight pounds a portion and I differentiate it depending on the decoration so the six pounds of portion is probably something like this where it's firstly the naked effect only with a few flowers or some fresh fruit very simple and time wise obviously doesn't take as long as my crazier cakes the eight pounds a portion so the top end is my fill crazy all handmade decorations drips and everything and then the seven pounds a portion is somewhere in between now they could be naked cakes or just little clusters of decorations again everything is on my website so if going back to your first inquiry you can always just go right into a website if everything's on there but it is always good to just speak to them in person so let's talk about portions now if you google cake portion guides you do get really different results I think this is mainly because cakes nowadays are taller so my cakes have four layers of cake in which means that each tier is roughly four to five inches tall I think that's a newer trend especially in the cake and wedding cake industry so I've actually figured out my perfect portions and I have drawn diagrams to show you ranging from ten to four inches so just to put it into perspective this cake is four inches six inches and eight inches and then this is a 10 inch so imagine that's underneath so firstly I like to show how the cake is cut which is usually a grid you're most likely not gonna cut the cake if you're supplying wedding cake it's usually the caterers job or someone at the venue and this is how they usually cut it so each finger slice is kind of like a long cube or rectangle rather than a cake wedge they can be cake wedges but this is also the most simple way how to explain the portion guide so for the 4 inch it feeds 10 portions with my grid that I've drawn it actually shows a little more than 10 but some of them are small corners so average 10 portions a 4 inch is also 10 centimeters so I'll try to remember to convert them each time 6 inch which is 15 centimeters I say feeds 20 portions so for example a two-tier cake of 6 and 4 inches just the top tube is 30 people at a wedding which I actually have done in the past for smaller wedding ceremonies the next slide is the 8 inch which is 20 centimeters and this feeds 40 portions so the 8 6 and 4 inches which is the same size as this cake here feeds 70 funnily enough this is my most popular size now it sounds small but I think it's a really nice size for the 70 people or if there's a tea at a wedding and people tend to just slightly downsize but this is a really nice small cake but it still has kind of substance and stands out yes this is my most popular size uni and then I have the ten inches which is 25 centimeters and that feeds 60 people so this size with the tenant underneath is a hundred and thirty portions three tiers of tenant 8 inch and six inch without this top tier is a hundred and twenty portions another popular size where the next size up which I haven't drawn out and my tin is somewhere in storage is the 12 inches and that feeds 80 people so you can get a lot of cake out of these tiers so imagine a five-tier cake with this and then a large one that's 210 people that is portion sizes covered I will leave all the details in the comments below and I'll also upload these drawings to my Instagram at George's cake so you can go and check that out and use that as reference again I have told here so this is my portion guide for a tall tiered cake back to the consultation and the tasting so you've given the tasting the clients are happy they want to go ahead how do they secure the order I personally take 50% of the final total of the cake as a deposit some people take less some people take more it's been unfair to ask for the full amount it can be a lot of money so 50% just shows that they are eager to go ahead and you're guaranteed the money and then you can figure out your own cancellation policy I think the wedding cakes I have about a month's notice because that's when I've already ordered flowers and made sure that I've got all the ingredients prepped for those coming weeks and also remember you may have said no to other orders so if someone cancels with really short notice you may have missed out on an order that you could have been getting paid for so that's a really important note so finalizing the price of the cake you've got the portions so you've got the actual price of the cake and then extra things like delivery remember delivery takes up your time so you have to charge accordingly it takes me about half an hour to get into central London and so I charge a flat rate of fifty to seventy-five pounds depending on where in London and you have to be aware that they are obviously their client is obviously spending a lot on your cake so you can't charge the same for delivery and unless it's a couple of hours away if you drive and you're driving the cake and it's a two hour drive you can't just say oh it's fifty pounds you know 25 pounds an hour for driving is great but actually that's two hours there you need about an hour setting up and then it's two hours back and then by the time you've loaded the car and unloaded the car you've taken about six hours out of your day so when people fall off the chair we need to tell you the price of delivery you can explain why because it's mainly about the time taken plus the petrol costs and then the last bit on the pricing once you've obviously included the tasting within that so that's deducted is a cake stand I always ask if the venue that the wedding is being held in has a cake stand because it's just a lot easier if it's the venue's cake stand and you've delivered the cake and it's there and you don't need to worry about getting it back if they don't have a cake stand and you want to give the client one to borrow I would recommend taking a deposit I charge fifty pounds which I then refund the client once they get the cake stand back I learned through mistakes I didn't take a deposit and the cake stand was sent back to me and it was one of those really nice expenses Massa glass ones and it broke so not only did I not get deposit I had to well I didn't actually buy another one coz I like my lesson but is about a hundred pounds just gone again you learn so yeah so get a deposit for your cake stand and then it's usually their responsibility to get it back to you so the cake logs or like a nice white China Wan just be sure and explain to the client that they're very delicate and they should be returned to you in one piece quickly about transporting the cake I don't usually travel with more than four tiers stacked if it's more than four tiers I separate the tiers as much as possible and otherwise it's just really difficult and also really heavy cakes are heavy so you don't want to be carrying a five-tier cake around I would ask your clients if there's a point of contact at the venue you're not gonna get hold of the bride and groom on the day I can insure you now so it's always good to have a contact number of someone who's at the venue maybe the events planner or if it's a hotel someone working there and you also want to know exactly where you're going because when you turn up with the cake you don't be holding a cake and running around the hotel like a headless chicken make sure you bring spare equipment spare buttercream and spare decorations with you if you make Swiss meringue like I do and it doesn't crust and it's very soft and delicious but a bit of a pain there are chances that things will get smudged and ruined so I always bring a palette knife I also have a cake lifter to lift the cake off the traveling board onto the cake stands and little bits of butter cream and scrapers now I usually decorates my cakes before I transport them apart from the flowers if you are using fresh edible flowers they need to be put on as last-minute as possible which reminds me I didn't mention about delivering and timing going back to your tasting and when you're talking to your clients off when they're cutting the cake and what room it's going to be in and when is the latest you can set up I say laters because you never know what the weather's doing especially in England we can have a heatwave in November for all I know so I would always set up the cake up as late as possible so it's not standing out so long so for example if they're having dinner in one room and then they're coming through to the dancing room where the cake is going to be at 8 o'clock try and set up at least an hour before so I would usually get there 6:00 6:30 and give yourself an hour to set up it usually takes less time but you just want to be safe there only decorations that need to be added on is the edible flowers like I was saying and that is usually the only decoration I do at the venue and maybe touches of gold leaf and edible glitter and you just want to make it look amazing because how you leave it is how the bride and groom is gonna see it and you just want them to look at your cake and go wow if you are starting out it's very tempting to leave business cards buy the cake I wouldn't recommend doing this I think it looks a bit tacky and a bit desperate but what you can do is speak to the event organizer and give her some business cards and just kind of say hi I'm just starting out it was lovely to meet you can I leave some cards with you you may even think I didn't even have business cards isn't everything on Instagram unfortunately at weddings and everyone's had a bit too much to drink and the cake comes up they will take photos but they don't then thinking can everyone can anyone tell me who made this cake they need to tag them it's a very in the moment thing and you may miss the tag etc look at the end of the day if someone wants to know who made that cake they'll ask the bride and groom and they will tell them so I think if someone really does want your cake you'll get the job don't worry so you leave keeping your fingers crossed hoping that no one's looking into the cake you explain to the event organizer and ask who's cutting it and just double check that they know that there's straws and dowels in there just so that no one gets a fright and then you leave and then you wait for that email and that email may not come which is usually a good sign they say no news is good news or you get pleasantly delighted when the email comes through a few days later of your clients praising you saying how amazingly pickles and that oh my god everyone loved it all went it cetera again fingers across they say that and then you can relax and you can breathe again and you can make your next cake and start all over again so I know I've been talking a lot and this hasn't been the most visually exciting video but I hope you found this helpful and answered a lot of your questions once again this is how I do my wedding cakes you may disagree with some of the points I've made but this is literally everything I do and being really honest with you and I hope that it helped you and gained you confidence because the wedding industry can be quite daunting and I think it's got like this label on especially when they say like luxury brands luxury this luxury that it's not scary if you do it properly and if you get the odd bridezilla work with them you're making their cake the cakes the fun bit if you're the event organizer about something else but the cake always bring smiles then that's why I love making them so again I hope you found this really helpful if you have any other suggestions or videos and please write in the comments below and then till next time I will see you very soon [Music]", "WUqEqvOFITQ": "what's up guys hope it's a man about cake I'm your host Joshua John Russell and this week this man is all about modern mirror glaze cake we're going to build a three-tiered mirror glaze cake finish it with pop rock bark and some colorful meringue let's do it [Music] we start running making my pop-rock bark so I'm going to make this two different ways one is going to be the one that we crumble up to go inside the cake and then we're going to make one nation of decorative so I'm going to use some white candy melts here we're just going to spread this out onto a piece of parchment and then we're going to sprinkle on our pop rocks the reason why we're encapsulating the pop rocks in chocolate is because when they hit the moisture of the cake they're going to pop so as you're eating this and the chocolate starts to dissolve it actually will fizzle in your mouth so they're popping they're going to pop a little bit but they'll still be popping when you eat on the compromise you're so weird alright so for this set I'm going to move them around a little bit to make sure they're all coated and the chocolate it's both of them can you hear it me pop drive it back of my throat so if you just put pop rocks in all the cake right moisture from the cake the water would pop the top rock it can capsulate them in fact keep some they pop a little bit as you heard but the bigger ones will still stay intact you'll see I'll eat a piece after it's set and I look like physics and your guess will be well what's happening in the mouth alright for the decorative ones I'm going to put them over these fine what do you call these texts your Mac's these are like floral print but I'm going to marble a few different colors of chocolate and we'll put the pop rocks on the back those just can be shoved in the cake they're not actually going to hit moisture these are the same colors won't make our meringues with two so it's christeson right like bubblegum carrot delicious am I the only not like that combination I think okay we'll spread this guy out there's no real rhyme or reason to this these are just going to be busted up and stuck in the cake like our man cake the last one I'm going to make just with pink and orange so we'll have more of a dramatic color colonial gotta give them all Mabus Plymouth cake to eat ever everyone can be like oh alright we get to you guys in the cooler and then we'll bust them up sticking the cake alright we're going to break down our 8-inch vanilla cake round by the way if you guys want any of the recipes or supplies click the I at the top or give us on the description box below did you imagine that v8 sticking you didn't know what everything I'm allergic to this but it's amazing all right now we're going to fill our cake with blackberry buttercream so what I did was I took some freeze-dried blackberries and a pulverizing them and then I mix them with some melted down buttercream to hydrate it and then we'll add it into our vanilla buttercream and make like everybody face that is correctly right there actually it looks kind of like eggplant eggplant blueberries delicious together alright we'll mix this up alright now we'll fill our cake start with the bottom layer here alright I'm going to add a little bit of my blackberry buttercream spread that out I should taste it first right what if it's not delicious alright now we're going to put our top dog barking alright wait for it that's over if you hear it it's like popping like crazy let's fix my brain by the way the pop rock flavor is very make sense right very very willing to put like peanut butter pop rocks in here that would be really good like kind of iron Joe Guidice cake flavor and pop rocks can be weird yeah alright I'm gonna get this guy in the cooler to farm up then we'll cutter coder and pink buttercream final coder in P buttercream that's not pink that's panic ta NK well I colored it and it obviously a darkened because it wasn't this pink but actually I like it because once we glaze it a like pink patent-leather yeah sexy we're going to make our meringue decoration pieces now I'm actually going to do this with a meringue powder so if you read the instructions you have to make a synthesis and let it cools have already done that we're going to add that to the bowl and then I'm going to add 1/2 a cup of meringue powder you can do this with just a Swiss meringue or Italian meringue but I find if you if you use the meringue powder they get a little bit stiffer and they hold their shape in the oven as I dump this all over myself I mean I should scoop it out this is how much this we're not baking drink alright then we'll whip this guide the full piece and you a little bit more and pull with that I think she's ready yes that it's fully that's what you want just don't see a little hair thing awesome now we're going to pipe them out now it's time to pipe our meringue so I'm going to take a piping bag and actually strike it with key color we got put a tip in first and we cut this commences this is your job to cut cake well I didn't cut the head head big enough hold on and the tip so what's happening here the expression is similar not the fiddle it is always of the fiddle okay the scissors just fine I got it I'm going to take a skewer out a little bit of pink gel color and a little bit of orange gel color so we can match our pop rock bark I'm going to go in all the way down I'm just going to wipe the color all the way up do a little a little more and then we'll do one on the opposite side and then we'll do our orange in between I'm going to be super Cullison all right we got that bag ready and we'll do one for the other tip here and then this time I'll just do two lines of color so we'll have some that are a little bit different so we'll do the orange whoops see that looks like a mistake it'll actually will be cool I'm gonna do a little bit of pink it's just kind of splatter this one if I mess it up there we go now we'll add our white meringue to the bag and the color will pop out on the side we use it down it's going to grab some of the color will do our star tip now comes the fun part I'm actually going to squeeze this until I see the color because I don't really want white one here come okay I can see you now boom there's no rhyme reason to either you can do them in different shapes you can wiggle them you can swirl along we're just going to do with varying shapes so we don't have all the same meringue woo no no one nothing crooked Wow you guys are so lame no none of those none of those work I'm going to wiggle this one let's do it slowly one let's do a double one look like a Christmas tree super little do a tall one [Music] alright so they do the same thing with our round tip here [Music] when we believe beautiful now we have to let's be secure so you're going to bake them on a very low temperature 250 degrees for about an hour go kids all right now it's time you glaze our cakes all of our cakes are cold and our glaze is warm and poured over the top and these people shiny you guys ready yes nice and even bit up the excess glaze off the top all right all my excess glaze is all you get these guys back in the cooler all the cakes are chill and let's unmold our pop rocks bark can be a weird sound already oh it's not that weird it's kind of can you hear it mmm I need to see if it work it's pop rocky all right let's do this one looking at curbed a little bit oh that one's nice now we'll just break these guys up wait time to rotate together all right now it's time to stack our glazed cakes with velvety stroller I'm going to do them a little bit off-kilter so I can add my meringue pieces I did mess up a little glaze here but that's okay glaze is very very touchy don't touch it but if you do we have lots of decorations we can paulus are not what you do it's how you correct your fall that's probably a really bad thing to teach people all right now what time is that group a little bit of gold powder just going to sprinkle over these Blackberry thank you guys for joining me on this episode of man about cake remember if

Welcome to, or welcome back to, my\nyoutube channel. I'm Tracie a.k.a Aunt T I recently made this beautiful white and\nsilver wedding cake and I think it's really perfect for a winter wedding. In\nthis video, I'm going to show you how I did it. First, using some white chocolate\nganache (I like using ganache because it sets up a little more firm than\nbuttercream) I created a damn. Then, inside, I put the filling. This is a\nraspberry filling. Sooo delicious! My favorite filling. Take my spatula and smooth that out. and I'll continue stacking. again, with ganache I'm going to crumb\ncoat the cake. I do one layer at a time because ganache\nsets up quickly. clean up the edges.\nThat was an 8-inch cake I'm also going to do a six inch cake. This is lemon cake\nwith lemon curd. and a 10 inch cake chocolate cake with\nchocolate hazelnut Filling. this cake has been chilling in the fridge and now\nI'm going to apply a final coat, again, using white chocolate ganache. smooth out the top. and then I'll work on the sides. with my bench scraper, I will scrape the\nedges nice and smooth. looks like I need a little more ganache\nright there at the bottom now I'll go and sharpen up those edges add a little more to the corner there Doowwwn we go. Looking good. here I have a little water and I'm\nmixing some corn syrup into it, it just makes it a little more sticky now I'm going to cover a board with\nfondant roll out my homemade marshmallow fondant I'll flip it upside down so I can\ncut off the excess and give it one more  smooth over. I'll mark the fondant with a quilting template and then to deepen those lines I use a\nstraight ruler and I just go over those lines pressing quite firmly I use one of my fondant shaper tools\nthe star tool then I make little quilting marks where the lines meet and now it's time to cover the cake in\nfondant I learned a really neat technique from\nanother YouTube video I can't remember which one it was\nbut I'm taking two fondant smoothers and squeezing them together until the\nfondant actually cuts itself off. that really makes a nice corner so you're not worried about all that excess fondant piling up. squishing squishing I wiggle a little\nbit too I don't worry about the rough edges I'm going to smooth em in a bit cutting off the excess as I go by squeezing those Fonda smoothers\ntogether I'm sharpening up that edge smoothing out the sides as best I can.\nI'll take my finger and kind of smash down the... what are those called?\nFrillies? Frays?  and then I'll take my fondantsmoothers and pinch the edges together to make it as straight as possible.  and I have to admit I'm not as\npracticed as I'd like to be doing square cakes but I think it turned out pretty\nwell now I'm setting the 10 inch cake onto the\ncake board and as you can see, I did not do a\nperfect job on the fondant I just needed a layer of fondant to stick the ruffles\nonto. All this base fondant is going to be completely covered so you won't see\nany of the imperfections. this is amazing! I love using my pasta\nroller to roll out my fondant. in this case, I'm rolling it to a number five on the pasta attachment and then I'm going to cut it into\nstrips and with these strips, I'm going to make\nthe ruffles using another sugar shaper I'm going to press and roll so it\ncreates this little teeny ruffle effect it's quite pretty as you saw, I marked the cake where I\nwanted the round ruffle roses to go... ...round ruffle roses! Lol! I like those 3 R's I will glue it on again with my corn\nsyrup water mixture you can also use some tylose in water this is not going on as easily as I\nwould have liked and so as not to bore you I'm not going\nto show you every little ruffle I put on but I do continue in this pattern until\nit is all finished now I'll just let you sit and listen to some music and watch\nme work once I've got the main shape of those\nruffle roses I can't get over that ruffle roses\nto make the inside I'm actually going to roll the ruffle on the side and then\nglue it on so here I've got my ruffle adding a little water to it now I'll just roll it up I'm also kind\nof pinching the bottom as I roll so the tops flare out a little bit and I'll tuck the end down in there. there's a close-up I'll have to use one of my fondant\nshapers just stick it down in there I'll also do that with the remaining\ncenters with the rest of my ruffles I'll fill in\nall the extra spaces. It took me about an hour and a half maybe two hours to do all these ruffles and this little piece finishes off that\nside and yes it took me about five or six hours. so, if you plan on doing this,\nPlan for extra time! and if anyone knows of a faster way, let me know in the\ncomments. I am open to suggestion! moving on to the 8-inch chair I'm going to do aquilting design on this tier as well similar to the design I did on the cake\nboard then I'll stack that 8-inch tier on top\nof the ten inch and add a few more ruffles to fill in the gap between the\ntiers after that's done I'm going to use a\nlittle piping gel to stick on these beads. I've coated them in silver luster\ndust so they're really messy. piping gel seems to stick them onto the cake fasterso I don't drop them as easily Here, you can see the piping gel on the\nbrush a little better and now, my favorite type of decorating!\nhand-piped designs!! i'm going to do a beautiful scroll design on this six-inch\ntier going from the bottom corner to the top corner large to small. For this\ndesign, I'm using some dark gray royal icing. you can find my favorite royal\nicing recipe in the description box now with a damp paintbrush I clean up\njust a little and I will continue to do that until the\ndesign is finished I worked on this first side when the\ncake was off then I decided I was going to decorate the rest after the cake was all\nstacked. so here I'm using some bubble tea straws as a support. Cut them\noff. and some fondant paste as glue. smooth  that out and the cake is really cold so I'm able to handle it. plop it right on there and I'm using fondant paste to seal that gap between\nthe tiers. and the paste is just fondant mixed with some alcohol here at the bottom I'm adding just a few\nmore details now that I've got it stacked on the 8 inch tier and then I'll work on the design for the\nother sides. they'll all be slightly different but just as elegant now I've got that finished up I'm going\nto let it crust over. and while I crusts, I'm going to highlight the ruffles.\nhere I've got some very metallic silver luster dust mix with a little bit of\nalcohol and this is just a little round sponge that I cut in half dip it right\ninto that silver and then a very lightly dab the edges of these ruffles see how\nit kind of sticks to the edges just perfect! oh that looks so good. you can see right here at the bottom of\nthe board I'm made a little bit of a mess but that's okay I just take some\nwater or alcohol dab it a little bit wipe the brush dab it again and it soaks\nup that color now I'll use a little paper towel just to make sure I got it\noff with that same silver mix I'm also going to paint the royal icing and as a final touch I'm taking my hand\nsteamer and I'm going to steam the fondant just to get rid of any excess\ncornstarch that might be remaining. There we have it lovely winter-esk wedding cake! thank you for continuing to watch my videos,  I am so happy to share my\nknowledge with you! I invite you to subscribe so you can see the next videos as soon as they arrive. I hope to hear from you in the comments bye", "790iHK19SlY": "it's a fantastic day it's a good day to be alive kind of think of it every day is a good day to be like alright guys thank you for another video your boy Shaka if you don't know who I am my name is Shaka Zulu if you see my videos you haven't subscribed yet please subscribe subscribe and if you're new to the channel subscribe cos right I'm always coming with a good vibe doesn't love my videos mat now you might not love it you might love it I don't know keep watching and you'll find out but today as you can see from the title I bought I basically bought a live turkey and cart and I bought a live resin cart and I thought the live terpene cart was a live resin cart because when I went into the dispensary I went to a dispensary out and I think my desk I can't remember what the dismiss of his name was but when I went out to the dispensary I asked can I get one of your life resin what kind of life resins you got and she showed me the live it was a live terpenes actually it wasn't my present so I decided to do research on it and find out what's the difference between a live resin car in the live terpene cart so that's what you guys are going to get today but before I get into that this [ __ ] truck is made how [ __ ] I hope you guys can [ __ ] hear me but you already know your plea kind of start this off without bond rip you guys [Applause] [Music] buddy you gotta start to vlog off right with a bomb grip diet but yeah I'm probably gonna get out the car actually cuz I want to show you guys you're not wearing that to park that I'm app so cuz if you guys are on quarantine and you're scared to come outside or you just don't want to come outside you want to be extra safe I want y'all to get to see you know where I'm at so you feel like you're outside you feel me so you feel like you outside get your join get your bongs and go on a little walk with me out here and we're gonna talk about this live resin and live Terps guys but before that let me I got one more thing to tell you guys I'm coming off on 400 subscribers when I hit 500 subs I'm gonna do a Q&A video so if you have any Q&A questions put them down below I'm gonna try not to answer your questions I'm used to just answering people's questions so make it a serious question maybe even say it's a Q&A question if you can but if not I'll like it I'll like it but I won't reply and the reason why I'm not replying is because I want it to be a Q&A question for I want to save up some Q&A questions basically for my video but um let me get out here let me get my wax pan get that live resin I'm smoking on the the nut rot live resin it's berries and cream I forgot to say it in my video last time what the strain name actually was but it's berries and cream [ __ ] way go hi guys all right guys [Music] it's actually a good amount of people out here but I'm still working under a willow tree hopefully you can see I give you a quick overview all right guys the first difference is each stretch it's different than like you know your typical shatter crumble turps because it's two different extractions it's the process it's called a freeze frozen process where they extract and extract the wax before they actually care all right so when you chop down the plan you skip the whole curing process it helps preserve the terms and it also gives it that you know that flavor profile that comes straight from the flower that I roam that days you know I mean preserves all that although they do here the plant when they make terpenes on the other hand I'm gonna talk about terpenes now they the turps cards the live turf cards are usually way more fresh and are cleaner and less harsh on your throat because they take out the fats and the lip nodes the lip node another difference also up to is you can see the layer of terpenes in the jar when they make a so like you can actually take a dab of that term because the THC content is way different in fibrous and I think it's a less THC content so it but it gives you more but if I'm wrong people tell me I'm not I'm just going off of what I've been reading about the live resin and in the Terps the live resin turps because I do have a car a live resin Terp cart I got this car is called freak n abisco I think it's called I'll show you guys later but I haven't tried to get live resin nut cart you fit me snot Benz obviously prefer libraries and more than flavors and herbs but imma try both for both II for you guys but that's all I really know know about my present look at the difference between libraries and in terms I'm not I don't know that much more if you guys have any more information for sure put that [ __ ] down in the comments you guys already know I check out cuz I want to learn more about the libraries in interns honestly and the different methods of extracting because I've been one to make my own some [ __ ] to get like a press and make my own I'll be like next level but we'll see what's up but I'm going to show you guys that cart before I go cart it actually looks alright it looks like fish Jilla to me obviously because dish hill is more lighter and darker but it's the terms I honestly need to look up with this still it is someone comment the difference between dis jillion terms in the comments please I need to know all right guys see I'm gonna show you guys in a man let's help Wendy can't get a good like hit I hope you guys can see me it's kind of dark like cuz it feels like it's gonna rain but might not rain just gorgeous [Music] freak a nabisco freak a nabisco [Music] see the live resin is way way more darker than the live resin turps but it's still cool I mean we won't find out if it's good I'm gonna be honest with you guys if it's not good I'm not will tell you guys [Music] don't forget to Like comment subscribe more videos to come if you guys want me to try I guess I am gonna try it but man shout out to whoever told me I forgot who it was and my comments but you told me to try these now that's the reason why I got it I'm gonna try it out for you also I forgot to tell you guys if you made it to enter this video I'm just asking guys you know

your host Josh McCown Russell and this week I'm so excited because I'm paying homage to my cake hero to Margaret Braun I'm gonna build a five tier chocolate cake filled with chocolate ganache and finish it with all the Margaret details let's do it wait wait wait what is what is playing Amish mean paying up shut up Brandon [Music] to start I'm gonna break down a tenant chocolate cake you guys know where the recipes are in the eye or the square box below so Joshua why we doing chocolate on chocolate well when I first found marks book I used only her recipes she's this chocolate blackout cake that is so good and so when I was prepping I have a baking assistant in demanda who bakes everything for me and I was supposed to tell her to bake Morgan's cake and I forgot whoops so she baked my cake but Mike my cake is similar but Morgan's cake is not vegan like mine so we just have my cake which is delicious argot also does lots of layers small layers the ratio of frosting slash ganache to cake is like really good so I'm cutting all these in half so we have like lots of layers of cake with ganache in between it's gonna be really really rich better than those poor cakes Bree that's not what that's not what rich means in this case no it is this cake is super wealthy she's a princess [Music] alright I'm gonna clean my crumbs up and we're gonna fill this with chocolate ganache so this is chocolate ganache recipe it ended up being a little bit tight so what I did was I put it in a mixer and use the torch to sort of thin it out a little bit and added a couple sticks of butter so it's a little bit lighter but it's still chocolate ganache in is still gonna be rich and delicious I used really good chocolate too from Belgium oh we make up it a good job here - yeah oh gosh that's real bad let me try again is that a leprechaun or what we make a good chocolatier in Belgium would you like to try some of our other treats not waffles we make very very good spaghetti toast spaghetti toast yeah have you not had sounds Italian to me spaghetti toast yeah tastes like spaghetti looks like toast wait are you being for real nope I wasn't sure because listen I've been to Amsterdam a couple times and they eat this thing in the morning it's like toast and they put butter on it and they put chocolate sprinkles I think it's the coolest thing ever but I don't do that I put peanut butter and they all laughed at me oh why because they're like you're so American I asked for peanut butter they're sure they brought it and then I put the peanut butter on their leg no no no it's butter I'm like but Taoists butter and like sprinkles I need slyke's ml flavor plus peanut butter I was like protein [Music] this feels aggressively taught even a stop right here I'm gonna get this in the cooler then we're gonna carve it out Margaret Braun known for giant cakes will carve it down all right so Margaret is known for her sculpted cakes she does like these cool tapered things I'm gonna taper this one in and it's a little bit too tall somebody cut some off the top as well mmm we're in for so much garbage cake lots of garbage cake all right I made this way too tall so I'm gonna take a bunch of this off because it is aggressive do we want to do a cake this is a world record biggest cake for his bake jeez so anyways Margaret behind my cake hero had a cake book called cakewalk that came out in 2001 and I bought it I was a teenager and it changed my life I had always sketched these like crazy cakes and at the time American cake decorating was very much sort of still old school and she just had these incredible looking cakes she's actually not my friend hey I found this thing is this yours Doki well this is cakewalk this is not what it actually looks like did you sleep with that under your pillow no I listen I've had a look no I lived with the dog once that got got to it and I wanted to strangle that dog but I love animals too much but look she signed it oh I say to Joshua I wish you many adventures and sugar good luck Margaret and then she drew a little cake but look at her Kate look at these cakes they're insane hold on you should get one of my favorite ones real fast so the first part of the book is all like technique how to do her different styles she even reinvented the polkadot literally I'll show you later that's her she's so pretty this was the cake that I was like whoa crazy all hand-painted lots of piping which is why I love piping so much we're gonna make these two their marzipan fruits and the best thing about it is it's called a cakewalk so she actually talks to you about her cake walks how she got gets her inspiration this cake right here though you know and that's a cake that looks like goodbye isn't that crazy I think I've made every cake in this book like the pages are stuck together anyways I have another copy that she signed that's fresh and then I have a third copy that's here this is what it's supposed to look like hold on so this is what the book actually look like so I have this copy the original one which is the one I work out of because it's gross and then I have the one that she's signed and in this one I'm never unwrapping because I want to keep it forever so nice it's beautiful wait we gotta get these out of here because I don't want any to see dirty alright that looks pretty good okay I'm gonna clean up my crumb so then we'll give it a first coat and a final coat [Music] now we're gonna cover the cake in fondant I'm gonna roll this to an eighth of an inch thickness with a little bit of we could change the name of snow you know so what D'Andrea don't make it gross snow is pretty [Music] [Music] okay now it's time to paint the cake so Margaret has a really unique style I'm gonna use two different colors I'm gonna use a pink and I'm gonna use sort of like this teal color what I'm going for is sort of this bottom tier here where we have these cool swags in one color and then the bottom is in a different color so tops gonna be in pink I'm gonna do that first and then we'll go back and paint the bottom teal she although normally pipes first and then paints above and below it that doesn't work for me as well I tried it so I had to paint it first so I got a little bit of titanium with a little white white titanium dioxide got a little bit of pink we'll start with that and then we're gonna dilute it with something like vodka I have a little dilution solution here that I'll use that reminds me of the dilution solution song oh gosh it was made by the same people that did Schoolhouse Rock there's a dilution solution and it causes pollution and you want me to know it tomorrow because if you do not know it then it will flow and everyone will die dholu ssin solution okay so I can mark this out like a normally dealing cakes butts market is very painterly about what she does and so I wanted to feel a little bit more organic so I'm just going to wing it so I'm gonna start with our swags now that I've got everything planned out I'm actually to go in with a little bit of a darker color and then we'll sort of fade it up so it has a little bit of texture to it now I'm gonna switch to a bigger brush and going with some lighter colors [Music] okay now on my pink is painted I'm gonna add some golden beef with my finger adding it to here and you just kind of spread it around very delicate so it breaks apart it makes it look kind of aged [Music] okay now that all my gold is on we're gonna do the teal on the bottom I'm gonna paint this the same way a little bit of teal a little bit of whites something to dilute it with I'm grabbing a larger paintbrush and I'm going to do a little bit lighter color below so Margaret pipes her royal icing using a paper cone I'm gonna use a bag with no tip and this is for that the parts that are above the swags and then when I go to pipe the swags I'm gonna switch to a tip because it gives you more control I'm gonna start with the forces right above where the pink is [Music] [Music] it's another cake is painted we have our swags and all our piping done we're gonna do some polka dots and I love the way marker does the polka dots because she doesn't use a cutter she makes them my hand she literally reinvented the polka dot so basically what you do is just take a ball of fondant I'm gonna use a little bit of corn store oh sorry no because it's a little sticky and this is this is you can use gum paste this is just fondant and then she just makes her own little polka dots so they kind of raise up and have nice texture and drama to them drama take the drama for yo la no you didn't she basically just kind of copy on everything this woman does oh the point of this whole episode is that I'm taking techniques from her book and making a cake that's an ode to her so it's a brand new cake it's not not replicating with her cakes because this isn't the exact design she did but it's parts of her techniques what I've learned from her James do you have to attach one with her you know you just stick them on the cake is still is still pretty sticky because I just painted it but if you let the cake dried and yeah you would want to attach them with like some piping gel even water you must really like this lady she's my cake hero you know who my cake hero is Joshua who mr. birthday mr. birthday yeah he makes birthday cakes it's not me I mean you're good too and you're fired okay I've had a bunch of these made Simon stick them all on and then we're gonna move on to marzipan fruits I'll do the music baby a paper pipe you printing it sequins in change it so now we're gonna make some marzipan roots I'm going to make lemons limes and oranges to fill our chalice and go all around the cake this is Margaret's recipe it's very very good marzipan is basically just almond paste send a lot of sugar and a little corn syrup we're gonna start with a lemon there's no technique to this just make it look like a lemon what I'm gonna do is actually because my hands are really hot I let them sit for a little while and kind of firm up and then I'll take a little bit of green and sort of dust it in so it looks a lifelike [Music] so I'm going to take a clove here right I'm gonna take this little seed out so I have this little cloth looking thing I'm gonna put this in so it looks more like a light a realistic orange look at that but it tastes like all the tastes so many buddies once I get all these done and dusted I'm gonna coat them a couple times with confectioners glaze so they're a little shiny I think that's more like a kumquat or cherry tomato shut up it's a baby orange now I'm gonna make a bunch of these and Brandon's gonna shut up [Music] okay now my cake is all stacked I'm gonna pipe a pearl border with royal icing around each tier you Josh but what percent of cakes do you do pearl borders on like 99% I have no idea why just curious look if I had to describe a classic jiggy our move it's the Pearl border you think and gold and I say gold yeah and other things are fleur-de-lys I do love a good little e I don't know if you guys have my my trade Margaret I don't know what is my trademark you guys tell me what is my trademark style down there this is this really what Amish cakes look like don't make me laugh what are you talking about an Amish what do you mean Amish so if we were playing Amish it's paying homage it's like making a cake you've your fire leave the camera [Music] so to finish the cake I'm gonna use airbrush and Pearl Sheen for my polka dots I'm going to take my swags and paint them gold and then I'll finish it with all of my little fruits [Music] [Music] my Margaret Braun inspired cake is complete I think she turned out super majestic I want to give a huge thank you to Margot Ron for letting me share some of her beautiful techniques with you guys if you're feeling inspired to make cakes I have a class called baking butter creams and Beyond where you can learn the basics I'll put everything in the description box below next week we're doing from sketch to cakes you can see my entire process mmm I think Margaret would be very proud oh she's the Amish one you [Music]", "9ZEFrXKysps": "round is still the most popular its traditional basically that's were close friends are going for topsy-turvy is growing in popularity I feel like a cookie cake or the shapes being twisted and turned even the square cakes people just want it to be different so we're off setting a lot of them and we're giving it different turns and twists the most popular flavors are the lighter flavor so the mousse is French cream and raspberry the chocolate mousse in the ride Barry were still selling the custards and the strawberry filling but the French creams the Chantilly creams or more or taking more of a demand I'm also a very very popular flavor is salsa de leche mousse which is a caramel flavored a move Senate excellent as well as decorations I'm said I'm seeing a lot more bling and I feel that that's right now is the trend still have your swirls and your PIN dots I mean that's more classic but we're also using a lot of plans and cutouts cake jewelry that's huge people that love to bling out there cake they want to match it with the dress that maybe 23 years ago we're seeing a lot of flowers lots of gum paste flowers sugar flowers I'm not seeing that mean I think the trend is more going towards a cleaner sleeker look I see little white cakes but your color is definitely people don't want boring and seeing a lot of vibrant colors well I haven't seen what's gold and lots of silver we're so via colors definitely", "czle4NDjvBw": "hi sugar geeks lives here today I'm going to show you a very special tutorial I'm doing a remake of my first wedding cake ever and showing you guys everything that I wish I would have known when I made my first wedding cake so when I first started cake decorating there was no Facebook there was no social media there was only books and there was a lot of stuff that books did not tell me I didn't understand how to chill my cakes I didn't understand how to stack them to get those super sharp edges but did that stop me no my first wedding cake was just a hot mess just sagging corners it actually like vibrated itself to crumbs on the way to delivery luckily was just for a friend so she forgave me but it was literally a nightmare I my first tear cracked so I had to rebake it and then I tried to stack it warm so it cracked again I was using box mix I mean I was using Wilton fondant I just didn't know what I was doing so recently I posted a picture this cake to my social media and said hey guys if you're feeling bad about yourself this is where I started to show you that everybody starts from somewhere and it usually isn't very pretty especially my stuff and then some people kind of like we're joking about maybe remaking it and I thought that's a great idea so that's what I did i remade my very first wedding cake and I'm going to show you exactly how I did all of those steps so for this square wedding cake I'm going to make a 10 inch 8 inch and 6 inch layer so I have two sizes of every cake pan but if you only have one size you can totally make that work as well in total I had to bake up three batches of my white cake recipe to have enough batter for all of my layers four square layers I always put parchment paper in the bottom of my pans to help them release easier you don't have to do this with round pans and I'm using my homemade pan release because it's cheap it's easy and it works really good I fill the pans about 3/4 of the way full since my largest cake is only 10 inches I'm not even using a baking core because it's not gonna make a difference but if you're making any cakes that are 12 inches or larger you might want to use a baking core to help them bake evenly I like to weigh each pan once the batter is in there to make sure that each layer has the same amount of batter as the last one so they bake evenly and are all the same height my large 10-inch cakes took about 40 45 minutes to cook all the way through at 335 degrees and then of course the smaller cakes took anywhere from 30 to 35 minutes once your cakes are baked go ahead and let them cool in the pan for about 10 minutes and then you can flip them out to cool fully I like to put mine in the freezer to get them cooling down faster so I can crumb coat the same day when I'm baking wedding cakes I will typically start baking on Wednesday and then I will crumb coat and get everything frosted on Thursday and that will leave me all fry dates he decorates I always trim the brown off of my white cakes because it makes the slices just look really beautiful a little secret to those perfect slices it's not mandatory but especially for wedding cakes you might consider doing it and it only takes a little bit of time I like my layers to be 2 inches tall and then I will typically torque them in half lengthwise so that I get more buttercream per cake tier because who doesn't want more buttercream for more information on how to trim and tort your cakes you can watch my tutorial in the link above or on the blog alright so I have all of my cakes trimmed and ready to go I have all of my cake boards cut and my buttercream so now I'm going to frost all of my cakes I don't use simple syrup with my cakes because they're already pretty moist but you can if you want to if I'm not doing a filling though I do about a quarter an inch of buttercream in between each layer of my cake sometimes I do three layers of cake sometimes I do four just depends on how much cake I have to bake in how much room I have in my freezer I'm gonna go ahead and do my first layer buttercream on my six inch cake this is called the crumb coat the seals and all of the crumbs that can get a nice clean layer of frosting on the outside especially if you're not gonna cover it with fondant square cakes and round cakes are very different to frost so while the round cake you would just have to do a crumb coat and a final coat square cakes they take a little bit more effort so that's why I'm using acrylics so they can get super sharp edges and corners but you could use the upside down method you could use ganache whatever your client wants you have that option open I just definitely do not recommend you use anything like cream cheese frosting or whipped cream especially the cakes gonna be outside and cream cheese frosting under fondant will end up making your fondant melt so just keep that in mind I know you guys probably wondering about how much buttercream I used for this and this was roughly about 4 batches of my easy buttercream on square cakes you have to focus on the corners of the most so good tip is to start at the edge of the corner and work your way to the center of the cake and then stop if you pull all the way across the side of the cake you're going to ruin your sharp corners for more information on how to cover a square buttercream cake using acrylics check out tutorial I've decided to panel my cakes with fondant because I want the edges to be super sharp you don't have to use the panelling method you could do a traditional covering you can check out my other tutorials on how to cover a square cake and fondant so paneling does take a little bit longer than a traditional way to cover your cake and fondant but it does result in super sharp clean edges the trick to paneling is to start with a very cold cake and to roll out your fondant and panels then we're going to trim them down to the size that's just a little bit bigger than each side so my top is 8x8 I'm gonna cut out a square off on it that's you know nine by nine then I'm gonna put that on a cake board put it in the freezer for about ten minutes and this is actually going to freeze the fondant so when we put it on to the cake and trim away the edges with a very sharp a brand new exacto blade or razor blade the fondant holds its shape it doesn't sack the downside of paneling aside from it taking a little bit longer is that you end up with seams now I know it seems really obvious to you but when you decorate the cake you're not gonna even notice these seams but I do like to make them as invisible as possible by taking my fondant smoother 's and just pushing the seam together and kind of making it as invisible as possible I really like to use my lmf recipe or Renshaw on it for pretty much all of my high-end wedding cakes because it tastes really good and it's easy to work with if you're having problems with your fondant and it's cracking or breaking you just might consider using a different brand or you can check out my lmf recipe it's really great for beginners you would only need two batches of fondant really like a batch and a half a lot of clients will complain that they don't like fondant or they you know they don't like the texture of it and it's just like chocolate explain to them that there's different types of fondant there's gourmet fondant and then there's cheap fondant so you know gourmet chocolate tastes a lot better and you know cheap chocolate so a good way to convince your client to have fondant on their cake is to put a little piece of fondant during the wedding cake tasting so they can taste what it actually tastes like I've sold many a wedding cake using this technique so go ahead and cover the rest of your cakes in fondant and then just put them into the fridge to chill until it's time to stack them a lot of people think that you can't put your cakes in the refrigerator if they have fondant on them because when you take them out they start to sweat this is normal this is like completely normal it's not going to hurt the fondant it might make it a little bit sticky especially if you're in a really humid area but eventually the cake will come to room temperature and this is a good thing because cakes taste better at room temperature you don't want to be eating cold butter inside of your cake that doesn't taste good and when it comes to room temperature it will stop sweating you can reduce the amount of sweating by doing a couple things if you live in a humid area you can put the cake inside of a cardboard box and then put that into the fridge so that when you take it out the condensation kind of like rests on top of the cardboard and not on top of your cake the other thing you can do is just have a fan blowing across the surface of your cake and it just helps the water that's on the surface of your cake evaporate faster just don't touch the fondant don't you know mess with it or anything and it will be okay delivering a chilled cake is much much safer and much easier to stack than an unshielded it will look cleaner and nicer most professionals either work with ganache so that their cakes are nice and stable or they work with chilled all right so I'm going to go ahead and stack my first cake on to my cake board this is a 12 inch cake board from kickboards aver or you can use a cake drum just don't put your cake on like a really thin cardboard or something because it's just not going to be sturdy enough to support the weight of all of these cakes I really like cake boards of air because they're pre coded and this food-safe material they have feet so that you can get your fingers under there to lift the cake very important things you don't think of so I'm gonna stack this cake here but sometimes I will wait to stack my cakes when I get to the venue and I'll bring them to the just the edge of the table like this take my offset spatula to just lift up so I can get my my hand over there and because they've been chilled they're easy handled so I'm just gonna put a little bit buttercream or ganache just to kind of hold it in place try and get it centered as well as possible when you lower it you want to use an offset just under the edge get your fingers out of the way and then you can lower it down carefully and then slide your spatula out so then if you have a gap around the edges you just want to take your buttercream and just fill that gap in always have extra butter cream or ganache or fondant or whatever you used on your cake when you deliver just to touch up any mistakes then you just take your finger so you get that flawless edge if you ever need to caulk a sink that's exactly how you do it so I have my three cakes that have just come out of the fridge they have already been chilled covered they're ready to go you might be wondering al is why do we have cake pans sitting here we're gonna use these as templates so that we know where how big the next cake is so that's literally what all these are for I'm stacking my cakes with straws these are not just regular drinking straws or something called milkshake straws so a little bit wider and a little bit stronger than your typical drinking straw some people use boba tea straws or you can use wooden dowels like there's so many different options for stacking but these are the least expensive they're super easy to put in and to take out and they're very strong I've used straws to stack cakes up to five tiers I have my straw guide for knowing how many straws to put into each layer you can get that on the blog post and download it so this is an 8-inch cake and it's going to talk with a 10-inch cake right so I need eight straws to support this cake so one straw per inch do not use three straws to support a 10 inch cake that's how problems happen so how many straws do you need for a six-inch cake that's right six alright first thing I'm going to do is take my 8-inch cake pan and if you're bad at centering use a ruler there should be one inch of space on every side I'm just gonna score a line a guide if you will so now we know where our cake is supposed to be at and make sure that we're centered first thing I do is I poke a hole into the middle of the cake go ahead and mark where the top of the cake is with your thumb thumbnail or you could use a pen if you feel more comfortable I kind of go you know just a little bit tiny down into the fondant hold on tight because there's a vacuum and that's how tall all of my straws need to be I know I said we only need eight but I'd rather be careful so I have all of these straws around the outside edges but I don't have anything in the middle and I don't want to put it right in this hole cuz that's our dent so I'm just gonna put it right next to it what I should have done was actually taking these and put them slightly in a little bit further that I was trying to teach I'm not thinking now we're gonna go do the next tear and because my cakes are chilled I can actually move them around just a little bit if I have to then I'm just going to seal the gap that's around the bottom another thing I didn't know with my first wedding cake is how to hide that gap so all of my cakes had like ribbons around the bottoms like if you're curious about the tools and stuff that I take when I deliver a wedding cake you can check out that tutorial on my website it's all about the supplies that I bring I call it my oh shoot kit it's an emergency kit all of the tools you know my recommendations for things to bring with you to fix any sort of emergencies and put final touches on a wedding cake when you're delivering [Music] okay time to decorate so I'm redoing the design that I had on my original cake that had some scrollwork scrollwork on the center tier so I used I think buttercream the first time I'm going to use buttercream this time as well just because I feel it's easier than using royal icing and at the time all I knew how to do was like s's so you just be like this kind of thing oops that's called a pop that's not super cute it's it's very kind of old-fashioned looking so I'm going to show you the kind of Scrolls that I do now so what I do is I try to create flow coming from whatever the focal point is so we're gonna have flowers coming all the way down the front so I'm going to create scrollwork that's flowing off of that and kind of accenting it to create movement so I'm going to take my my um Heidi bag and I'm gonna create like a swirl like wind like a pageant wind right and this is a number four piping tip I kind of feel like I should have like a slightly bigger one but I don't have one so and then I'm gonna take another swirl but go in the opposite direction and if you need to practice a few times on parchment paper which I probably should have you can and then I'm gonna come in with a few little lines going like this and we're basically gonna recreate that same swirl over and over again I think one of the hardest things about learning how to pipe swirls is understanding how hard to press so if you're pushing and it's coming out really squiggly you're just pressing too hard so and if it's breaking then you're you might be pressing hard enough but you're moving too quickly so it might take you a couple minutes to figure out a good flow basically anywhere there's kind of like a hole I'm going to put little dots three little dots and that kind of fills up any empty space all right so now we get to add some flowers to our cake we have our buttercream flowers that have been frozen solid so we can easily take them off the paper my hands are warm though so you're gonna have to work quickly and if they start getting too soft you might have to put them back in the freezer I didn't want to make this video too long for you guys so if you're interested in how to make these easy buttercream flowers go ahead and check out my tutorial on sugar and show calm I just have a little bit of my white buttercream then I'm just gonna start adding some flowers in I thought about doing these in fondant again but because this is like an updated version I wanted to use something which is a little bit trendy R and right now buttercream flowers are like so hot but not too hot because it's like buttercream sorry GV I'm just starting with my dark purple ones first when I first did this design with the fondant I had like never used a fondant flower cutter before and I was absolutely amazed but there was like this thing that existed that could just cut flower shapes into fondant so they're like super chunky and they were like not smooth down or refined at all they were just super chunky not very delicate looking flowers I have a leaf tip at the leaf tip that has the little v cut out of the center and you just have to have that the little V is to the side so you don't see the whole from the top and when you pipe you squeeze and pull just make these cute little leaves with a vein in the middle and you can add them to Saul your scrolls just like texture so I'm gonna take some of my purple buttercream and just add some more purple to it and I'm gonna make kind of a really dark purple to use for the Centers of my flowers very quickly apply my next color well they're still cold I'm kind of trying to cluster them though you know around the center down this line and then they getting spread out I've only been using three colors you know well actually one color really I started with my dark purple and then lightened it and lightened it some more so that way you can get variations in color and depth and it looks elegant but it all goes together it all matches it all has the same undertone lastly we have our white buttercream flowers and you know you won't be able to really see the white like it's white on white texture but it just adds more depth to the overall design it's going to put these kind of around the outside edges so now I am going to just come in with some more little dots to fill the centers where I feel like it needs it just feels like empty and maybe a few more like pipe leaves and I think I'm actually gonna even though my original design only had swirls here I think it makes sense to kind of have a few coming off some of these like flowers down here that is our finished wedding cake redo of my very first wedding cake a little bit better that's it guys that is how I remade my very first wedding cake hopefully this has motivated you and giving you some confidence if you feel like you're struggling and you're ever gonna get better trust me you will get better don't give up I'll see you guys next time you", "nUuKjBjuEho": "[Music] [Music] good morning and welcome to you another vlog we are currently on route to the Cotswolds we're having a little road trip through central

Bernard Oakes here in a bit of a rush to leave and yeah coming through central London we haven't found anything rude so it's getting a bit hungry it only has like a fry-up every day breakfast pit stop

put her links below she has a very nice website and she's a food stylist just a lot of work for like waitress magazine stuff so that was super excited to see and and the cake was so delicious our favorite was definitely the toffee apple with salted caramel buttercream as she said actually it tastes quite a lot like carrot cakes it's quite cinnamony is that your favorite no oh what was your favorite I thought you liked that one I did I mean I do but my favorite Victoria sponge yes we're definitely gonna go through tourist buns but I definitely gonna go with the toffee apple too because it's quite autumnal wintery for the time of year and then we realized the lemon cake but we often feel like there should be chocolate involved too so difficult decisions though things with the cake are pretty much sorted and we'll just be like finalizing stuff around the time we should also have a fixed oven which is so exciting that ovens been broken for like a week or two two weeks three weeks two weeks two weeks but they should someone should have been today taking out the old one installed a new one and we're praying because I want salmon with crispy skin they usually have that once or twice a week and I miss it so much so yeah hopefully have a nice dinner tonight if we ever get home I think I should drive no Sam you're welcome to I'm pretty bored of it so we've got a new oven look out clean this is I'm so happy that I don't have to clean the old one now yes look at that bad boy can we kick some salmon not so you probably all think I'm stupid because it was same bit brie and it's by bring apparently according to this one we adjust tucking in to this the cinnamon roll a halo top I have never tried Hera tops so I'm going to tuck in now and it sounds delicious we are super

really looking forward to putting my coat on but the let's go [Music] [Laughter] [Music] good evening guys it is now at the following Friday and I am just off out to eat pasta with my friends we are going to patella a London Bridge and I know you can't book and it's really gonna be super busy but I'm hoping we get a table because the food looks incredible but I thought I would quickly fill you in on my week which is just being work and a way box photoshoot which I got a tiny bit of footage for and it was a really really good day and I've also done some workouts which I'll just insert a little clips of footage [Music] and now I'm gonna go eat all the pasta hot twist I can't film anything because we decide to sit outside hence why I live like this because it is so windy and it meant that the heat was on and there like UV light UV light infrared red light was on and it made everything red but my god that food is incredible I am frozen to the bone and slightly wet and windy looking because we did sit outside to save an hour and a half it's one of those London places where you can't book you have to just queue I queued while we queued for 45 minutes me my friend which was good catch up and then when you get to the front of the queue they then give you a time so she said it would be an hour and a half to sit down inside or we could sit outside and they give you like blankets and he to see whether that option I have pasta there is amazing it's completely fresh pasta I would highly recommend I will link them in the description below well that was a fail is now like the next week after and I've just been a useless vlogger and I'm just cheating here with my new candle which I absolutely love it is the Yankee spies Dwight who could handle and it was half-price in Clinton so if you like sweet festive candles then I would highly recommend and go out and buy this while it is still on offer I think I will probably do some sort of festive haul at some point just like a little bit so we're buying for the fact but yes I am here to end the video because I'm editing it and realized that I didn't film anything else and we had a real nice weekend in Birmingham last weekend with some sister and did like loads of countryside things she doesn't like a little village near Stafford actually and we just like had a row sinner and it was amazing and I've also just had my nails done by urban massage they are now doing nails and facials and they like come to your home and do them since Rihanna's lady came to my home and did my nails and it was super fun and I didn't even have to

is when you freeze your cakes and you throw it out I mean it's as moist as when it came out of the oven it is like the best for superior product you got to use a little cake shorting so it depends on how much you care about your cake the search for America's best cake decorator Jean I am going to make a wedding cake for my two-tier cake it's going to have a variety of sugar flowers on it roses and peonies and calla lilies and I'm going to make it come down in a cascade very classic and traditional for weddings I selected doing a wedding cake for this particular competition because it's something that way specialize in our clients always come to us looking for wedding cakes I'd say about 60% of our cake business is making wedding cakes we love when people are coming together and we love weddings so it's a natural fit I think speed is really important and this kind of like challenge especially in the beginning so I'm trying to be as fast as I can right now the tier cake that I'm planning to make is basically an abstract a vision of what will be the ocean with the Sun like in a sunset so is not a specific idea going into details but it's more in abstract vision of what I see what's your cake I'm making today is a white on white which is really popular I think it's very classic that's actually one of the first cake designs that I did when I first started out was a two-tier cake with sugar pearls and a giant white peony which is my favorite flower I just been doing that design for a long time and I think it can really fit any event wedding baby shower birthday it's really feminine delicate and I think that it can kind of go for any event the tier cake I'm doing today is basically I got inspired by fabrics different textures of fabrics so I wanted to make it's kind of like a Chanel coke old-style Chanel cake black and white with like satin and pearls and jewels so that's basically what I'm trying to accomplish today I think that finishing it on time is going to be difficult it's a very time consuming technique and I hope I can finish it on time some of the techniques that I'm going to be using are going to be basically marbleizing foam then I'm going to use the teal color which is basically the same color that I'm going to use through the entire piece but in different constant duration looking for the marble effect by startling out the piece of fondant thinking that I'm going to use this side but if you flip it over this size is always the best I don't know why but is always for me and my particular case always ended working better so you should always double check we specialize in buttercream here at sugar flour cake shop and don't use fondant I don't like the taste of it and so I won't use it at all so but getting the buttercream to look as smooth as the fondant is definitely a challenge that we face all the time normally when we make wedding cakes in order to bake and to ice and finish a cake it takes us a full day to be able to do that and we've got to condense that down into one hour the most difficult aspect of today's cake would probably be to keep it straight and smooth looking because again there's it's such a simple design but everything has to be balanced or else it'll just look sloppy it'll look extremely obvious because there's only so many things that are actually on the cake it's pretty simple so it has to look sharp and clean I'm definitely a perfectionist I think a lot of cake decorators are perfectionists because with the high quality of cake decoration now you kind of have to be a perfectionist or else it just might look sloppy to me the most important thing is having the right tool it really makes all the difference in the world you could do it the hard way and a simple tool will just make it go so much easier so my tip is definitely it's worth it to invest in the right tools anything that gets you there quicker is better I don't think anyone has more tools than I do if I don't have tools who does you know time is money and the quicker you make a cake the more money you'll make in this particular design they marbleize concept I'm trying to use is basically to create a little bit of the water movement of the water so basically I don't want to just color a piece of fondant flat blue because it doesn't say anything however if I use a marble lines technique it can give you a little bit more flow of the movement of the water for me colors are really important in my designs because this is what makes you design stand up from others I have a very colorful eye so I like to work with brilliant colors with bright colors so color is really important in all my designs because it's so cold in here I just pop this fondant into the microwave just for like 10 seconds just to soften it up a little bit basically it just makes it a little bit easier to put it around the cake I'm dealing with a little bit more air bubble just because of the time constraint I didn't get it as smooth as I would have liked it before I covered it but I think we'll be okay I just heated up a little bit of my buttercream because I have so many holes just gonna make it a little bit warmer and that will help to make it a little bit smoother since we've been in the fridge for a little bit the sides of the cake are hard and so I just I'm throwing basically just a skim coat of buttercream all around the edge and with just a little bit of pressure now I'm able to take out all the holes so you can kind of see the difference between where the holes are and where I filled them in now with the warmer buttercream this looks a little dry right now I might just take a new one cuz I'm crazy because if I take a chance and I don't like it know what I'm scrapping it I'm really taking a chance it looks dry and I don't like it so I'm going to need up a new piece so it's better off I took the couple of minutes I needed it I put a little Crisco in it softened it and now I have a nice smooth cake the thing I'm worried the moss basically is since I'm working in such a short period of time if the actual Scrolls are going to be able to stick on the on the cake they're not going to be falling apart baby it seems to me that I'm having a little extra time so I'm going to use that extra time to kind of like go around the cake and look for the final details just to make sure that everything is set perfect in the right position and the cake looks way in order to make our sugar flowers look really really natural we usually dust them with petal dust and so it gets brushed on and we tend to love to mix colors in order to get a nice almost an uneven finish which you would think oh I know it has to be perfectly smooth and one color but when you look at things in nature it's never just one tone so seeing a variety of different colors on the same flower is a very cool thing so we won't completely blend all of our colors as we're working in you know we just kind of keep layering on different colors to make it look the way it's supposed to look in nature because I'm rushing I just basically pushed my finger into the cake so it kind of like made a hole in the cake you know I pulled down too hard so I have to basically find a way to fix it so I'm basically going to try to make some extra swags and incorporate that into the design in my case even though that wasn't planned there's always a back of a cake and this is the back of my cake and I add one more swag this way I covered that thing I even covered the same where the back of the cake is that could almost be the front of the cake now turn the mess into something nice that's what you got to do the cake I'm going for today is a little bit more simplistic but I think less is more in general when you're making cakes some people put like 8,000 different kinds of patterns and colors and you don't really know what to look at so with my cakes I think you can you can kind of see what you're supposed to look at a minimal design I think is a lot cooler to me more modern than to just decorate everything twenty-seven different colors and 800 flowers five minutes left that was the quickest 55 minutes of my life then what's really sterile about my work is basically the details of it and how clean and unique it is I think that is one of the things that set me apart from the other cake decorators I work fast but my work my final products exclaimed need and you need Wow tough stuff I think my cakes are very now something that people would want to buy I think if they were on the shelf and say okay I wouldn't buy that I think this is very now I think in terms of our aesthetic anyway less is more in terms of keep decorating I just think that some people tend to over decorate with either a pattern or color or texture or something it can just look too noisy you always want to add something else and tweak something else but sometimes you have to walk away from it I think the thing that stands out about my style is and using buttercream not resorting to fun it yet still being able to achieve something that is pretty and not as smooth and above all that tastes really great I prefer new texts to other look cake shortenings years ago I tried them all I kind of like put them all up toe to toe and in all my research new Texas Bar None beat everyone out", "6IybONNp1oQ": "[Music] foreign [Music] [Music] red food

help cake designers over there bookings charge HT $12 first life for their cakes and owed a profitable and successful cake business bad bass love and in today's episode we're going to be called talking about the follow up process with the brides that you have conducted a cake consultation with and if they did not book with you so I do in a lot of my programs I to talk about how to actually book crying at the point of sale at your cake chasing so you have really closed that circle in terms of knowing that you work with them you know it's going to be a go and you have booked the cake and everything in there on your calendar but there are times to where you don't actually booked that cake consultation and book that order with that client perhaps they giving you the objection of I have to check in with another cake designer I have more cake tastings I have to think about it I have to tell my fiance I have to really talk with my parents about this you know will let you know or check things out you know there's just a whole slew of objections that you're going to get for why they're actually not going to pay you the deposit which I know can be extremely frustrating and a lot of things you can really profess that Oh from your cake business we want to talk about that inside of this episode but we're going to be talking about the follow up process because you can still book the sale with that client it's not going to be a done deal so we're not going to focus them you can certainly a book that client this is what's really gonna I'm going to share with you what has helped for me with my taste business so one thing that you really need to do and be very clear on with that client if they're not going to what being let's back up one thing that you need to do is you need to ask for the sale at your cake TC um sometimes if you're not asking for the sale and saying do you want to actually go ahead and book with me I'm Asian just a nut houses and you're just thinking or what happened you know I didn't actually look at sometimes I'm you need to just ask Amy to ask very clear questions so you're getting a yes or no response that's going to one way to really understand am I going to book this client or not I love clarity in terms of making business decision and move with my cases and so make sure that you're asking do you want to actually book with me today and if they're going to give you an objection which completely happened what mean that you need to do is say that they're going to actually do some other cake-tasting you can say okay great when is going to be another we're just going to be the day you plan on making the decision to book your case and then allow them to give them the response so they can then ask perfect I'm going to follow up with you within a week so then we can go ahead and get you on the calendar so then we can move forward so one thing that I like to do is I like to ask very clear questions so then I know what my follow-up process is going to be and when I should actually follow up with them is it going to be a week two weeks three weeks a month I'm very clear on what that's actually going to look like in terms of when they're going to make that decision and a lot of times when people don't really know when but when you ask them they're going to know when they're actually going to make that decision and you would like to know that as well just have the confidence to ask the questions that you need to ask so then it's not going to be something to where you really don't know what those questions and answers are going to be for your cake business and one thing that I want to point out from my last step is going to be to assume the sale a lot of times up we can be picked designers can just be not confident we're not sure it's actually going to book with us and one thing that has really work is going to be assuming the sale and knowing that you're actually going to book the arm but the client not now but it's going to be later that confidence is really going to seal the deal in terms of really manifesting that cake water on your calendar you know it's going to happen you know you're going to actually slot that off and so then you're going to know that you're going to have another cake order for your business but I ask the bride clear is structural questions in terms of when you plan on making a decision can I reach out to you and within a week so we can move over and then also let them know if it's if it's is true if you do only have one more spot left on that weekend let them know that the bid they're able to really understand you're filling up with your business and they you do need to know so then you're able to add them onto your calendar I found that you do need to be honest with this if you're going to use it as a closing tactic that is an authentic and a lot of times when people really do be through that and then it really feels that you're desperate for that cake order which is something that I know you do not want for your cakes instead and so a lot of times i'ma lastly is you need to you need to really just remove yourself from the end result and not obsess over it anymore and just continue on with your cake business continue on with your day and accept that order but just let it go don't be obsessed or worry about it if you're really meant to work with that client really accept that and if you're not then be okay with that as well just really be easy about the clients that you're booking and don't be too obsessed over it as well so I hope this videos really helped you just to really understand like what the follow up process is going to be and a lot of it is going to be understanding and knowing asking during that cake tasting so that you know what your follow up process is going to be so that you know when to actually reach on send the email out send the invoice so they actually pay that under progress assume the sale and then let go from

stuff but that's why i don't know if i've ever told you all this but i did pageants i was like in pageants when i was younger and then when i got older i did the stages i decorated the stages for

hush i swear to god callie look we're not gonna do that y'all she is so spoiled i'm trying not to give in to her because i spoiled her i mean that's i'm why she's like that but it is on my last nerve but um what does she want she wants i don't know what she wants clay the wind is down to where she can get up look at it she probably wants out to run around anyway was i saying oh i just love that i love the hustle and bustle of an event coming that dan and i both work really well under pressure it's stressful but we do good under pressure like that but um i don't know i just love weddings and pageants and what is that what what what do i love but um yeah i i would give anything to be young again and be able to do that especially with what's available to us these days because back when you know i was doing pageants and stuff we didn't have all this stuff available to us and yeah i y'all you couldn't tell me nothing if did you fart callie do you need a doo-doo y'all maybe she's a dookie oh dear god i got to go all right guys this is supper tonight this is fried chicken breast i just cut it up in pieces peas this is my favorite and then potatoes and gravy and this is the other half you know i made this bread last one day this past week this is the other half of that loaf i knew it needed to get cooked so i made it with this meal but that is separate tonight guys and i haven't been showing you all these but this is cali's plate like she literally gets cooked food just like we do so she's having chicken tonight because we're having chicken so yeah she gets cooked like whatever we're eating whatever like meat she won't eat any of this or i would give that to her but like she'll eat rice and stuff like that so yeah she gets cooked food with us this is the bad thing about ordering on amazon i don't know i have been making these uh dog harness things and this is the d-ring i've been using to do it with well this these are obviously one inch so i held up my little d-ring and i said okay i need a one inch d ring so i ordered one inch d rings off of amazon and this big giant thing showed up this is what i've been using and that's what showed up when i ordered one inch and i thought well okay well maybe i need half inch so i ordered half inch this is the one inch that i ordered and that's what came for a half inch y'all what the hell what is this i need this size right here not this big giant one and not this teeny weeny baby one what the hell is this now i have like a hundred and something of these i don't remember how many of these and when i couldn't find anything i had bought this little package of things at walmart and i was using the little these little it's like a keychain thing but that's ugly that don't look cute so what in the hell do i need i got all this mess here i'm gonna use these little tiny ones because the dog i'm doing one for right now is tiny so i can get away with this little teeny tiny one i mean i could get away with this teeny tiny one on probably all of them but to me this is the perfect size and of course i don't have the package that they came in to see and i got these at walmart but you know with the pandemic happening they just don't have stuff like this anymore but um what size is this y'all it's the perfect size d ring for a little dog harness anyway yeah okay y'all this is our supper for tonight uh we're having smothered potatoes eggs bacon i'm having a croissant dan and clay are having toast with theirs and callie is having a piece of warmed up grilled chicken she don't like bacon believe it or

girlfriend all right guys this is supper tonight we're having barbecue chicken and y'all look at this big giant like thick piece of chicken breast callie eats with she's gonna eat with me tonight so that's mine and for me and cali and i'm not trying to make excuses but my plate this is a little plate i eat off of the salad plate and not a regular dinner plate so while it looks like a plate full of food it's a tiny plate but anyway green beans potato salad and a roll that's what's for supper tonight we got sonic last night i didn't cook last night so anyway that's what's for supper tonight

those over the age of 18 and medical marijuana patients all right like say hi to everybody out there if you haven't subscribed hit that subscribe button down there leave me a thumbs up thumbs down let me know how you're feeling tonight what you're smoking on token on what you're moved in um so today we got the token tim's mad scientist lab we are going to be making some rosin vape carts on our own save a lot of money um i will like give a shout out real quick um i got some of that girl scout cookie now this stuff was only coming in at 15 it was minnie's i couldn't see that online um and i'm not a fan of girl scouts but this stuff totally changed my mind this stuff's real good um nice flavor to it nice high to it not quite a sativity ah as sativa leaning as the last stuff i've had that was the girl scout cookie so like i said not bad at all all right so we're gonna make our own rosin vape carts now you guys know i've tried true leaves i just went and got another one we got the skunk ape blue river rosin we tried both of them for cure leaf i left the other box in there from the select um some people was asking if this was live resin or not to me it didn't really taste like that tastes more like the terpene like the cannabis infused terpene vape pens exactly like them so if you could find those vape pens cheaper i'd go with them but we're going to show you a way to do it real cheap and i tell you what they taste amazing all right so we squirted a little distillate in there i got i was trying some of them i got a little tore up had to take a break my water cooled off so it didn't work so this is take two on the video honestly um that's that papaya cake rosin from move or from true leave sorry um in there and then the distillate we're using because it's an indica uh the indica uh bubba kush coming at 78 percent so all i did was microwave some water and a shot glass put it in there you don't want to get it up past the stopper there you don't want to get back in there i want to get this part done before it cools off again so there was probably about three left in here on this syringe it's got a little bubble but it was about at three i put a little bit in there already so when it's warmed up it's just gonna go real easy in there yeah i guess we're gonna use all of it all right that's all of it are all that we're gonna mess with getting out at the moment now if you notice the pad i'm using is that five dollar baking sheet which is silicone so it's the same thing as a dab mat that i got on amazon it was like five bucks or two for five i can't remember videos if you go back as while back i just cut a piece off to fit the table so i didn't have to clean the whole table off so now all we're going to do is we're going to take this and we're going to mix it up now i have made a few of these before i did warm the rosin up on the one and then by time i got out here it was just kind of like a hardened back up more like a caramel just letting it sit out at room temperature seems to work better let me pull it off the view for a second and make sure i got it mixed evenly sometimes the distillate wants to stay on the side but as you know the rosin carts are about 60 bucks apiece and they're only half grams so this distillate i believe was 60 bucks from grow healthy which truly has them for 60 most everybody's around the 60 mark for a full gram so this right here will fill two vape carts um and then the rosin's uh 75 gram so you basically for 135 you're getting two grams um which you would only get one gram buying it by the vape cards like i said these are half gram vape carbs these aren't full grams only half grams if you also notice on true leaves the thc is always really low i'm using 80 distillate and 80 um rosin so these are still up in the 80 percent so we're gonna use our um we had some la confidential co2 cart which i got another one of these so we will be reviewing it later then all we're going to do is unscrew the top here now i will say that it helps to have a decent dab tool the dab tool i'm using is the one i got for five dollars uh from banger supply and if you use code token tim you'll save 10 at banger supply they got these for like 5.99 so try to keep it up here in the camera see what we can do so mainly what we're going to do is we're going to take the flatter end um or either end the flatter end kind of works better towards the end and we're just going to get a glob out there like that this stuff's stringy and looking in the camera is a pain in the butt all right we'll hold that there and then what i do is just press it around the stem and then put it down in there so let me go over here and do this where you guys can still see it but yeah you guys can see it there now i'm gonna go ahead and use the flat end just kind of scoop out a big scoop like that and then smooth on that thing and it's easier just to push it right down in there you guys can see that just kind of pushing it down now it doesn't go real good um so there is a trick we'll use here in a second once we get it pretty blobbed up all right trying to it's hard for me to focus i need new glasses so i keep pulling it off the frame to me to be able to see it now i'm just scraping all the gunk out of the jar real good i'm gonna do the same thing i'm gonna go over to a clear spot each time and just wipe it off on that and then take the tool focus there we go and slide it down that thing it's not wanting to focus if it does go on the outside just scoop it back up all right we've got about all of it now the first one i tried to wait for it to go down and it just didn't seem to go down quick enough so i'm gonna take a little torch and i'm gonna heat the glass down in here i'm not gonna heat the concentrate i'm just gonna do it like that without burning my fingers off hopefully so i'm just going to slightly warm the glass going around you can see it's starting to drip there where we warmed it up so just real quick that one bubbled on me and then it starts to it'll just start to run down in there then go ahead and take the tool and access there's a little bubble there we're going to pop that scrape all that off on there try not to get it inside there for sure we've already got it about half full it doesn't take a lot um a lot of concentrate that is you can see i only had about three in that syringe and i only put a couple dabs in there it really wasn't a lot so again we're going to take a little bit sometimes with this i can just scrape it right across the glass or like i said just roll it around that and whatever's left there the mouthpiece fits real tight over that silicone ring and it just pushes everything else down let's get a real good scrape on this jar real quick and then i'll show you the other ones i made and talk about them a little bit now i will say the flavor on this stuff is just amazing it tastes just like just like doing the dab let's scrape this off of there real quick all right now i could play around and get some more out there but i want with you guys i'll just dab that out with my dab straw later so we're going to stick that on see how it just squishes that on through there and we're going to screw that on now i found with some of them you'll have to go back again with your torch and this one's a little thicker you can see it's still thick so i'm just barely going to heat it if it starts to bubble you want to quit so i have to look at this real good and it'll take a second for the heat to transfer through to the glass still a little creamy there's still some up there at the top there we go this one must be a little thicker glass than the other one i had we're just going to hit it a few times now if you notice when we did that it kind of cleared up a little bit not a lot but so you can see the little holes down in there now where the wick is you'll see how that cleared it up some and i didn't bring the battery out i told you i got pretty medicated all right but we have made a few other ones um so i made one yeah this is it i used the move vape pen and this it worked great for about two days and the battery died and if you can see right here at the bottom it's got little um holes i thought i could take it off with a battery i grabbed it with some pliers and apparently i couldn't so i shattered it what i'm going to do is unscrew the lid i'm not going to do it now because i want the glass to fall off and then i'm going to heat the banger up and i'm going to put it in there upside down like that and just let all that wax come out now this was the um i used the skunk ape and the bubba kush um the skunk ache ape was from move or true leave again sorry i don't know i got move on the head now i did put some of the thca powder in that one also and it was really really really tasty tasted just like the skunk ape tastes a lot better than the skunk ape rosin car which we'll get we'll have a video on that later but like i said really really really tasty um and the thc is going to be up there and it's a cheaper cheaper thing so i'll show you the other one i did but first we got to do it sorry it's alive all right so i did make a live resin vape cart um this is with moves rainbow train wreck and you can see how it's cleared up a little bit more i hit it with a little bit more of the torch um but it tastes amazing there's a little clog there that's why heated this one up it was clogging a little bit but man it tastes amazing and the high on there i'm telling you the high is better than any of these vape pens i've had yet and i gotta write what i put on this one so i don't forget that's the rainbow train wreck which we know it's live rosin because that's all there is um but the skunk ape one i'm telling you you know vape card even these i hit these um you know 10 good hits off of them to catch a little buzz um i was only hitting that skunk ape three three little hits and i was blasted i the dying i made that i rolled up a joint um and after my three hits i had like this much left of the joint and i looked at that i'm like hey no way i'm lighting that thing back up so it tore me up pretty good so if you guys want to give it a try like it's not really messy you do have a little bit of residue left in these so you could either take a bud and roll it around in there and then roll in some keep and make your own moon rock or you could just take your dab straw and hit it you could also take a hair dryer and melt it down so it would get it in a corner better to get a little better dab out of it but if i mess around with it with like this one that has that little scoop on the end i can pretty much get everything out of that jar there won't be anything left and especially it's starting to cool off now because it's getting ready to rain here but especially when i'm working in a hot garage and it pretty much stays warm here anyways it makes it easier to work with it's not coming back up so it's easier like i said just to push push it all the way around to the corners i just take this one the longer straighter one and get the sides like that and what i'll do with this is dab it that's what i do with the other stuff that's why i mark the charge but i think it rub keeps rubbing off with my fingers so that one's uh we just made the papaya cake so that was this one we're just gonna put a pea on the jar so i remember but yeah that's what i'll just use when i come out tonight i'll scrape that again you can see like i said i just got that little bit i wiped off on the edge there just by taking it around a little bit and just keep scraping it back on the side and then when you get enough to take a dab you just take it all off of there and dab away and like i said with the other with the rounded one it works a little better getting everything out there real good this one's not bad but the other one's better so like i said it doesn't take long to get you a dab and then just drop the dab tool in the dab rig and you're good so that's my take on making my own vape cards um the live resin i did use the co2 true clear the sherbert so i figured it'd have a nice cleaner flavor but this stuff here wasn't bad um i haven't tried this one i just made yet of course i didn't bring the battery out um but i used it with a skunk 8 but that skunk cape's got such a strong skunky um smell to it it's hard to for anything else to come through so we'll see if anything comes through on this one but like i said the thca powder worked great in there too it didn't clog that one up that one worked you know it was almost all the way full and you can tell see there's not much left in there i smoked over half of it in a couple days it was so tasty and like i said the battery just quit on me so i don't recommend refilling those the reason i refilled this one and like i said we got it filled with just that little bit i didn't use a lot i'll show you how much i used on that um but this one's got the charging port on the bottom so hopefully we can recharge it when it does die now i only use this was a full gram i did lick a little bit and but pretty much i just used two i pushed it from where it was at the one to maybe just past the eight so maybe three milliliters of this stuff but closer to probably the two because it did fill that pin up and it's only 300 milligrams so like i said it didn't take much of this to fill that vape in and i did dab a little bit in my mouth dabbed a little bit in the banger just to try it the flavor wasn't bad the banger wasn't real clean so i couldn't get a good flavor on it so we'll save that for a review hopefully too well that's going to be it guys if you have any questions just leave them down there in the comments like i said this is an easy way you could also just put the distillate straight into the vape pen without the rosin and just make a bait pin that's what pretty much they're using is distillate but like i said with just a little bit of that rosin it makes it a real good flavor so you don't need a lot of that even you could probably just put maybe two little dabs in there mix it around put one in there see how you like it next time add more if you need to but like i said they tore me up good so i definitely recommend those of you who are feeling your own give this a shot let me know what you think of it that's going to be it guys we do got some more videos coming tomorrow we got a delivery coming and then we'll also do what's new in the florida mmj we got some new things

name is Jennifer Maker. Today I am showing you how to make custom cake toppers on The Great Maker Show and Tell. (light guitar music) So my family loves cake and it's not surprising that I used to bake and decorate cakes. But those days are long\nbehind me at this point. So when I am responsible with a cake in a family celebration, that usually means that I'm picking up a store bought cake. (chuckles) What can I say? And sadly, store bought cakes are kind of boring. Especially, oh, when you get the ones from the deli case an hour before the party starts. (laughs) Sure, you can buy some decorations but those are generic and kind of boring too, aren't they? But you know what does make\nany cake look magnificent? A custom cake topper, which are totally on trend these days. And you can make one yourself\nquite easily, really. In fact, it takes less time to make one than it takes to get in the car and go to Kroger to buy a cake. I'm not even kidding you. Now you probably have everything that you already need to make a\ncake topper right now. Just a few sheets of cardstock, some bamboo skewers, and some glue, and that's it. It's so easy. You'll want a way to cut\nyour cake topper, of course. And you can totally use scissors, or a craft knife to do it, but I am using my Cricut cutting machine because it's way faster and I love using technology to make my life easier. I've even made some cake\ntopper designs for you to use, like these here, as well as a template so you can make a topper with whatever name\nor saying you want on it. So let's head out over to my blog at http://www.jennifermaker.com so I can show you where you can find the free cake topper designs and template and then I will show you how to customize and assemble your cake topper. Your first step is to get my free DIY cake topper\ndesign and template. I keep all of these\nthings over on my blog at http://www.jennifermaker.com. You go to the red bar at the top and you click on that and then choose Enter the Library. If you don't have a password, you can request one free. Once you're in the library, the fastest way to find this project is to search the page. Press Commands+F or Ctrl+F and then type in cake topper. You'll find it right here\nand you click on this file. It says SVG/DXF/PDF to download it. It'll download to your computer and you just open it up to unzip it. For step 2, you need to prepare your\ncake topper for cutting. I'm going to use my Cricut\nfor cutting this project, so let's go to Cricut Design Space. Here we have a new canvas all ready to go for our design. To upload the file that\nyou just downloaded, click on Upload Upload image Browse and find the cake topper. And you'll want the SVG file. Then click Open. Then click Save. And once it's uploaded to your account, select it and then click Insert Images. I'll make the screen a little smaller. So there's four different designs in here. Make a Wish, Best Day Ever, Celebrate, and then a blank one\nthat's a template for you to put any name or phrase\nthat you want in it. So let me show you how you do that. Let's first ungroup everything so that each element is by itself. Regardless of which one you use, you'll want to decide if it's the right size for you. Right now, all of these designs are sized for an eight inch cake. So if you want something\nsmaller or bigger, you'll just need to resize it. Let me show you how to do that briefly. Let's go ahead and remove everything except this one in the corner, which of course is our template. And if we wanted to, say, make this a little bit bigger, all we really need to do is click on the resize handle at the bottom. When everything is selected then you click and drag the resize handle until you have it the size you want. Keep in mind, it should not go any bigger than the size of your cutting mat. So the maximum is going to be 11.5 inches, which would be a very big cake topper. But, hey, if you got a big\ncake go for it. (chuckles) But we're going to do ours\nfor the eight inch size. I'm going to click here and undo that. And that size is eight inches. Now, let me show you how you can put a custom name or phrase\ninto this template, and have it cut out and look amazing. First, I want you to note that there are three different elements\nto this cake topper. There is this one and then there's this second one\nhere which is identical, and then there's this ring. The ring is used, and it's optional, but it's used for putting\nthe bamboo skewers in so that you don't have to\nglue it to the underside. One, that means you don't have to glue it, but also it means that you can slide the bamboo skewers out when you're done and save your cake topper as a keepsake. Let's set this aside for now, we don't have to modify that at all. We really just have to\nworry about these two. And in fact, these two are going to end up being exactly the same. So it's okay to get rid of one of them right now. Okay, so we're just going\nto work with this one. I'll make the screen a little bigger so you can see. Now, let's say I want to put my daughter's name, Alexa, into the inside of this pretty wreath. The way that we do that, or any name, any phrase, click on Text over on the left side and type in the word or\nthe phrase that you want. So I'm going to type in Alexa. And we get the standard font. I'm going to click and drag it up into approximate position. And then I'm going to resize it so that it's touching on both sides. Now this is not a good font to use for this project because what we want is a font that's completely connected from side-to-side letter-to-letter. And while the A on this side is connected and the A on this side is connected, in other words, it's overlapping the sides. The L, the E, and the X are not. So we're looking for a script font in order to do this properly. And the way that you change the font is you go up to the font menu right here, and there's lots of fonts to choose from. You can literally just\ntype in the word script and you'll get all sorts of choices here. But you want ones that\nhave connected letters. So this one called Cartoon Script is not appropriate for this project because the letters don't touch. Neither is Underscript. However, something like Signature Script would be fine, as would Yulsa Script, right? Some of these are maybe in my system. I'm not sure if they're all Cricut fonts. I would like to use a\nreally pretty cursive font, and that is called Magnolia Sky. I think that's it. Let's type that in. Magnolia Sky. Yes. So this is a font that I got from http://wwww.dafont.com and it's a free font. If you're not familiar with how to download fonts and upload\nthem to your computer so that you can use them\nin Cricut Design Space, I have a whole tutorial on how to do that, which I will link in the video description so that you can look it up. All right, so we're going\nto do it Magnolia Sky and I'm selected it to this. All right, so that's very pretty, but Jennifer I thought you said that the font had to touch, all the letters had to touch. Well, they do. Right now, they don't. But we can make them touch. So we need to get these\nletters much closer together so that the little line\nhere on the L meets the E and the line on E meets the X and the X meets the A and so on. The way we do this is to go up to our letter space menu and change the letter space. We want to make it smaller. So I'm going to start\nby just putting in zero. See how close we get. That's better. And then there's also these little arrows then we can go ahead and click the arrows to bring them in a little\nbit smaller increments. I'm just trying to get them to just touch, which is pretty close right there. Still not quite right, of course, but really close. I'm going to resize this\nso it's closer in this. Well, this A is kind of... There we go. So you can see the\nproblem with it, I hope. Which is that the A is not connected and the L and the E right here, the connection's not very good. We can fix this. You go up to Advanced and you do Ungroup to Letters. Now each of these letters can\nbe individually moved around, which is perfect. Let's undo both of those moves. So first, let's connect the A to the L and we can literally just\nmove it up like this. Or we can make it a\nlittle bigger like this. Or we could also use a lowercase A. I'm going to click on this\nand type in a lowercase A because that might actually\nconnect a lot better. It's completely your choice, you may want to play around with it but I think that that looks really nice. Okay, and the L is not\nquite in the right position so let's move that over. All right, so now we\nhave the A touching the L touching the E touching\nthe X touching the A, which is touching the side here. But this side's not touching. We need to fix that. So I'm going to select everything here and move it down. And then I'm going to\nselect just my letters. So I have all five of my\nletters selected right now. And then I'm going to\ngo down and click Weld. Weld is very important. It's crucial that you do this whenever you've ungrouped letters, or especially when you're\nworking with Script fonts. Because otherwise all the edges will cut and you don't want them to do that. You want them all to flow\ntogether beautifully. So we're going to click on Weld and it's going to turn\nit into a single object, which you can see over in the Layers panel here on the right. So let's move our wreath\nback up here into position. All right, so now we're\nlooking much better, but we need Alexa to be touching\nboth sides of the wreath so that when it cuts, it's all connected, nothing is floating in\nthe middle of the air because that's not going to happen. (laughs) So to do this we're just\ngoing to click on the word. We're going to click and\ndrag it over to the side so that the A just overlaps\nthe side of the wreath there. And then we're going to\nuse our resize handle to click and drag it so that the line on the A overlaps the\nother side of the wreath. And we can move it around until we feel like that's a good spot, and I like this spot right here. All right, so we have our design but before you do anything else, I want you to make a copy of the name or the phrase that you made. So we're going to right-click\nit and choose Duplicate so that we have this because we need the extra copy to put on top in case you want to use a glitter\npaper or a fancier paper. Now this is optional, you\ndon't have to do this. But I'm going to do it in\nthis example so you can see. And I think it's a good idea. I mean, this word or this\nname is the focal point of our design and it's\nnice if you put it in a little different color for contrast or a fancier paper to really highlight it. All right, so we'll\njust move this down here next to the ring. All right, so now what we have is our name and our wreath design and I want you to select both of those and we need to weld them together so they become one piece. So we're going to click on Weld again. Now, I want you to duplicate this because I want you to cut it twice. Having two of these wreaths glued together will make your cake topper\nmore structurally sound. It won't be so floppy or,\nyou know, want to fall over in the breeze if you've\ngot at least two layers. You're welcome to do more but two is totally sufficient. All right and we just need to make sure that we have everything the same color before we go to cut it\nout unless, of course, we're doing things in a different color. Make this a little smaller. So right now, we have two\nwreaths with Alexa in them. We have one Alexa name\nin a different color and one ring that's the\nsame color as our wreaths. Right now this is pretty good. I think that I'm going to\ndo it in pink, however. So I'm going to change\nmy wreaths and my ring to a pink color. And by the way, if ever you don't like the\ncolor choices they give you, you can click on Advanced\nand choose a pink here. Like this. Okay. And then I'm going to cut Alexa in a pretty pink glitter\ncardstock that I have. So I'm going to give it a different color so that I'm reminded to\nuse a different paper when I go to actually cut it. And I'll just make it\na little darker pink. There we go. If you want to double\ncheck that it looks good, you can put everything on\ntop of everything else. Right into position. And bring that to the top. Send to front. And there we go. This is what it will look\nlike when it's all done. Which will be very pretty. Now we can go ahead and click Make It because it's all ready to go. It separates out into our mats starting with our glitter color, or whatever contrasting\ncolor we're going to use. And then we have our\nthree mats for our wreaths and our ring. And that's really all you need to know. We can go ahead and click Continue. Now I want to make a note that if you're using both cardstock\nand something like glitter cardstock or craft board, you can change your material\nin the process of cutting and I'll want to show you how to do that. So let's start out. Let's say we're going to do these first and we're going to choose Medium Cardstock because it's just regular cardstock. So we can go ahead and\ncut these out right now, these three we can cut\nout with medium cardstock. And then when it's time\nto do the fourth one that we're wanting to do in glitter, we can come in here, right, we don't have to go all\nthe way back and change it. We can literally just\nclick here to change it to glitter before we press the button on our Cricut to cut it out. Just in case you didn't know that. So you can change your\nmaterial at any time before you press that Start button. All right, let's go cut this out. Step 3 is to cut out your cardstock. Now you just cut out your\nvarious cardstock layers. Now every layer can be the same color, as I mentioned, or you can choose a\ndifferent contrasting color for your phrase or name\nto help it stand out, which is what I'm doing here. As a reminder, I recommend you cut two\nof the wreath layers and one of the sentiment layer in the desired cardstock or glitter paper or whatever other fancy\npaper you want to use. If you're cutting the sentiment\nonly to use as a topper, definitely cut two\nlayers of the sentiment. The double layers adds\nstability to the cake topper. Really, at the minimum\nyou want two layers. And two layers is fine. Once your cardstock is\ncut, unload your mat, flip your mat over onto your work surface, and every gently remove it by peeling your mat away from your project. This will help minimize curling\nand bending and tearing. Go slow though because the\nwreaths are a little fragile and you don't want to\naccidentally rip a leaf off. Step 4 is to attach\nyour cake topper layers. So using spray adhesive or glue, you just attach the layers together. I recommend you start with the two wreaths and then add your name or your sentiment on top of the two wreath layers. Step 5: Add bamboo skewers. Now you have two options\nfor attaching the skewers which are necessary for your cake topper to stand atop your cake because the skewers will\nactually go right into the cake so that your topper can suspend above it. Now you can either glue the skewers to the back of your cake topper or you can glue the optional ring, the cardstock ring, to the back and slide your skewers through the holes in the rings. Gluing the skewers is probably\na little bit stronger, so if it's going to be moved around a lot or a little windy you\nprobably will want to glue it. But using the ring with our holes means that you can remove the skewers when the party is over and keep\nit flat as a keepsake. It's totally your choice. I prefer to use the little\nrings and the skewers and it actually is really pretty stable, it doesn't slide up and down them or anything like that. And who doesn't like to\nsave these when you're done? Because they're so cute, no one wants to throw them away. So try the rings and if\nyou really don't like that, you can glue them, but I think you'll like the rings. And here is our finished cake topper. Isn't it super cute? By the way, this cake was made by Alexa. She made this cake so that we could take photos of the cake topper. She doesn't know that I made\nthis cake topper for her. I get to surprise her with that tomorrow when we actually eat the cake. But this is the cake that she made and I believe it's a pink cake. (laughs) Although I don't know\nwhat flavor pink cake is. (laughs) Maybe it's strawberry. I guess we will find out tomorrow. I also bought a chocolate cake because I love chocolate and I needed another\ncake so I could show you another cake topper. Like, uh huh, that's right. That's totally my excuse. (laughs) So now we have a chocolate\ncake and a strawberry cake. Two cakes in the house, it's a little dangerous, guys. But they look so pretty\nwith the cake toppers. If I could I would invite you all over to help me eat all of this cake. See? Cake toppers are totally amazing and so much easier to make than you might have thought\nwhen you first saw them. And you could whip up one of these really awesome and lovely\ntoppers in just a few minutes and everyone will think that you custom ordered your cake. And hey, maybe you did. Maybe you baked it yourself with love. More power to you if you did, and a custom cake topper\nwill make it even better.

(light guitar music)", "2tQYFzKLETo": "I am welcome to another edition of wedding show TV today I'm here with Niels from the Papillon patisserie to discuss choosing your style of wedding cake Neil thanks so much for having us today page of happy so Neil and right often choose a specific theme or style for their wedding and how would you recommend fitting the tape within nothing it's actually very simple - to fit a wedding cake within certain theme of a wedding the beauty of of choosing a wedding cake is you have so many styles that you can choose and it's very very it's very bespoke pop wedding you can change so many things colors and ribbons and different icings and things like that which can be manipulated towards a certain style so if you're having a very country rustic style wedding in a barn you know you can go towards more naked cake when it's no icing looks very rustic with fresh berries if you're having a more City style venue where there's a top-notch hotel you can have lots of lovely ivory icing with piping details and a little bit more elaborate so it's very very easy to fit a cake into a certain style of wedding whereas other parts running it may be more difficult there are some exceptions where you almost make it obvious the cake is not meant to mash weddings so things like a chocolate wedding cake then unless you are having a Brown themed wedding it's not meant to be part of the style it's meant to be an edible that became very decadent and it's something that you want to eat particular styles popular at the moment me and we are seeing at the moment a real surge in simplicity in wedding things people I guess are choosing a more simple wedding they want to go towards more natural look with natural words and wildflowers and so we're seeing that to come through into the wedding cakes so people are coming to us and saying we would love the beautiful wedding cakes but nothing but too much detail not too much thrills and hike worth funding just simple ice cake fresh flowers on top again the naked style cakes are really in fashion the other way is also going it is ultra elaborate if you're having that kind of venue so if you're in a five-star hotel you can't get away with a rustic cake you have to have something with cascades of flowers coming down or maybe some pipe works and some diamond brooches and satin ribbons and things like that so although we are still seeing that the simpler wedding cake is certainly in fashion there's obviously lots to think about do you have one specific piece of advice that you into a write to me yeah I would say try and choose your wedding cake around the rest of the style of the wedding so if you're having a certain style certain colors try and make it look as if the cake to being thought about rather than just a cake that you light and say you you can put it in the wedding so try not to have something glossy and shiny and elaborate if you're having a rustic wedding trying and go down that the gluten rule of having something a bit simpler but have fun with it as well it's one of the areas that you can have fun with you don't have to to stick to tradition wedding cakes 20 years ago very different to what they are now you have so many different options so really try and be different but fit within the knot of the style above everything else as well that makes sense lots to think about thanks so much me oh you're welcome you can meet Neal and all of our other experts by visiting the national wedding shows for further information please visit national wedding show d'arco UK and

gonna feature one of the most requested topics that our subscribers have asked us and that is the case stacking that's correct and not just a cake stacking but we will show you and how to stop the five layer wedding cake yeah so the five year wedding cake so actually yes thank you as well for this monica seniara for trusting us and the venue was a big front hotel that left those last uh november the last week of november so thank you so much miss monica senera for choosing the seven to one kids and pastries and last month also by the way we had our november promo yes we received a lot of joiners of that promo so if you have won some prizes from the 721 cakes and pastries yes congratulations congratulations yes and to expect some more troubles in the upcoming months that we have for the seven two one cakes and pastries okay so yes what are we waiting for yes so let's start the ball rolling in three two one this five deer wedding cake is made up of four real cakes and one dummy cake the first tier is an 18.5 by 6 inch dummy cake and as you can see we also covered it with a whipped cream the same thickness with the other cakes we didn't have much struggle in putting in the second tier onto the base as it has a cake board where we can just carry and directly layer it on the top of the base cake compared to the last three tiers where we used a styro as a base of each of the cake prior to do the stacking we made some holes for each tier to ensure that we easily get the center and for us to easily put in the main dowel so if you can see we adjusted uh the tears using a wooden dowel to make it sure that the cake board isn't visible so we piped some dots using a circular piping tape and of course with the help of some whipped cream so here are the tiers of cakes that we prepared for our five deer wedding cake so again the base is a dummy cake the second is a classic chocolate moist cake the third deer is a vanilla cake the fourth is the mocha and lastly the fifth deer is our mango supremo cake so we have arrived safely at the venue at b front hotel so huge shout out to b front as well for helping us carry these deers of cake from the ground floor onto the fifth floor of their building so here we are we these are the boxes of cakes so we had around uh four boxes of cakes since we uh stacked first the first two tiers of the cake so we are now unboxing the cakes so we used a chipboard because there isn't a cake box that is available here in cebu that can uh cater the size of our cake so we customized it using our chipboard so we also ensure that we bring our staplers our sea sauce at the venue so that we won't be having any struggles when we unbox our cakes so we don't just throw it away that the chipboards after using it once because we can still use it in our other events because it isn't really easy to cut out these chipboards and customize it and make it into a cake box so here's a closer look of our tiers of wedding cake and how we do the unboxing [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so we are now ready to do the cake stacking so these are the five tiers of cake so again if you can see there are holes in each tier of the cake this is to ensure that it would be easier for us to get the center of each cake and for us to easily apply or put in the main dowel of the five deer wedding cake before showing to you the cake stacking procedure we would like to share to you the equipment that we used when doing the cake stacking so we used a metal knife a bread knife and an angled spatula and since this is a whipped cream or soft icing cake so we need to make sure that we don't touch any part of the cake so here's our bare five deer wedding cakes if you can see we were able to hit the center and we were able to stack it perfectly so on the next part of the video we will be showing to you the step-by-step procedure on how we did the step we are now on the most interesting part of the video the cake stacking so in this part here we are removing the cake from the cake board so as mentioned previously we used a styro so it's like layers of cakes onto the styro and glued on the cake board so we used here a bread knife in removing the cake from the styro so it needs to be slowly removed you really don't have to hurry to ensure that we won't be touching any part of the cake and as mentioned we use here a metal knife a bread knife and an angled spatula okay so in this part here we are slowly and carefully putting in the third tier on top of the second tier you really don't have to hurry again because we need to ensure that we hit the center of the cake before removing the equipment that we used so you need to take a look at the sides of the cake ensuring that you hit the center and okay so here we go we were able to successfully stack in the third tier on top of the second tier okay and we are now on our fourth tier so this is a mocha cake so this is a much lighter cake compared to the vanilla cake which is on the third tier so again slowly transfer the cake on top of the third deer all right so we used again metal knife bread knife and an angled spatula and of course you can ask some people to take a look at the sides of the cake ensuring that it's perfectly stacked on the center all right before removing the equipment adjust okay so voila we were able to stack in the fourth tier perfectly and we are now adjusting using a pvc tube i mean i'm not so sure though if it's a shoe but it's a pvc that you can buy in the hardware so we washed it a lot of times pour in some boiling water and to ensure that it's sanitized we covered it using a cling wrap and we are now on the fifth tier so this is the best seller of the seven to one cakes and pastries our mango supremo cake all right so we are now transferring the fifth tier on top of the fourth tier all right so slowly ensuring that you hit the center of the cake because again you will be putting in the dowel later okay and it has holes in it so you need to ensure that it's on the center so that you won't be having any problem when you put in the dowel okay so here we are so we are now adjusting okay so we are now adjusting ensuring that we are hitting the centers of each tier of the k so we used here a pvc so when putting in the pvc ensure that it's uh from the top up to the bottom so we are now done stacking the five deer wedding cake so the next part here is beautifying the cake so to ensure that we only put the seven to one creation on our seven to one wedding cake so the flowers are handmade by us only here at the seven to one and pastries okay so so we will now be putting in our seven to one creation so we are now putting in our seven to one creation our beautiful peonies until the five year wedding cake [Applause] so [Applause] [Applause] [Music] foreign oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] so [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] huh [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] so friends here it is the seven to one cakes and pastries five deer wedding cake at bayfront hotel cebu [Music] so all right so stacking a five-year wedding cake was a no joke at all because you need strength patience and determination strength because you need to ensure that you carry the weight of the tears of cake patience because it was not easy at all and lastly determination because you need to make it sure well with the height of the cake you need to make sure that everything is perfectly beautiful that's right so someone haven't subscribed please click the subscribe button below and hit the
