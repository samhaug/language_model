{"bo9qKWBA0hs": "yahwah's good you two happy Sunday what's the date Saturday for me but well I I mean but it's a it's gonna be uploaded on Sunday so you're good you're good happy Sunday everyone or Saturday no it's it's Sunday for you now cuz you're seeing this on Sunday but or I mean maybe Monday or whatever day of the week it is today I'm gonna take a bunch of weed pills and see what happens I've taken thirteen before one time but it wasn't it wasn't these ones the ones that I made before when I took thirteen weren't nearly as potent as these these ones I used more reclaim than those other ones if you guys want to see how I make my reclaim pills I have a youtube video up just go to my profile and you can find it so I make reclaim or THC caps with reclaim these ones are pretty strong probably around 60 milligrams each maybe a tiny bit more I'm gonna take six of them right now I normally take two and when I take two I get pretty blazed and a lot of the times often take two and then I'll take two more so on I'm taking four in a day but you know spaced out and then that'll Holly not need to smoke as much because I'll be pre placed throughout the day enough I'm trying to be or whatever so today we'll see what happens if I take six so let's say that let's start taking these I'm really really bad at taking weed pills um just cuz they're fat I mean these pills are you it's [ __ ] hard you miss okay though we'll get to it look into it one we're drinking a mango smoothie by the way right here mangoes help you get more lick if you eat mangoes 30 to 45 minutes before getting late these pills probably gonna take longer than that to kick in but still mangoes I love them what you guys might witness me choke right here in this YouTube video cuz really better taking pills you know we to Ithaca okay number three going in okay gone down easy so far number I think it's the smoothie honestly a thicker consistency drink makes it really easy to swallow fat pills for me number four down the hatch up to number five I did not drink quite enough somebody knew that but it's doing down it's just fine the last but not least not least goodness gracious number six Cheers I almost got that one stuck in my throat but we're good six pills down the hatch a YouTube video though I feel like from me wouldn't be complete without at least a DAB so I'm swiping the wheel off of my fingers they just these ones have a little bit of oil on the outside just cuz I found sitting here for so long sometimes they leak a tiny bit instead did YouTube video for me wouldn't be complete without an ice dam but I'm not yours Emma do you want to die right now all right we're gonna do a dab right now then I was gonna say I'm not sure if I'm gonna do it now or wait like a little bit but then it took a weed pill while ago so I feel like once that starts kicking in she probably won't want to dab so it's perfect timing to take it down right now I'll heat it up and let's get it got that well you know what I feel like I hit the creation in the last YouTube video didn't bring my last video on Instagram last video on Instagram was at that pen in nature let's go for it the konk studios burning tube here nicely clean ready friend Aloha I don't know why I have a feeling that while recording this video the storage on my phone is gonna run out I just have a feeling we'll see so if it randomly cuts out yours like wait a minute this video doesn't seem quite right it's probably because my phone died not my phone dialing my phone ran out of storage recording in 4k 60 frames per second takes up an incredible amount of storage no [ __ ] big files so yeah what I do normally is all I record a video and then I have to edit it right in Adobe Premiere is what I use it's on the phone it's really great for editing for videos like that elissa we're at 5 minutes in 20 seconds so we've got like 6 minutes and 30 seconds will be about damn time so then I'll go and edit it and once I edit and get the full video then it saves again in my phone so it's like I have the footage twice so it's just an insane amount of sort so I've been going back and kind of deleting the extra videos and stuff so we're good on that I actually forgot to grab dams hey babe do you think you could grab some dabs um we have 30 seconds and some papaya and lime warp would be lit gonna go six minutes in oh no I think I said six minutes and thirty seconds tonight in the recording yeah okay as usually I'm not ready at all whew sorry about that babe knows like I just feel everyone else okay going in on the dab cheers everyone might be a tiny bit let's have I mean I need to be here I'm not sure Wow definitely didn't sorry I'll get you're good you did it was my apology long and okay here hit that up really interesting on the temp there but still nice now holy [ __ ] I'm gonna be so glazed when these weed pills kick in oh and we interesting to see what we end up doing today probably some streaming on Twitch yeah some art maybe will be will try to make some music [ __ ] yeah well I'll check back in um and like an hour maybe I'll check in every hour on these weed pills and let you guys know how it's going I think every 30 minutes okay okay every 30 minutes we'll do a quick clip until I start feeling them and they'll tell you guys a little bit more about what's going on so yeah I'll start a timer catch you guys in a sec when I check back in in 30 minutes yeah all right Chiefs it's been thirty minutes actually 35 minutes we just finished some yoga um I mean we took that dab right before so I can't say that I'm baked from the six pills yet but I was laughing while doing that yoga because I was farting a lot yoga always makes me fart I don't know what it is [Laughter] yeah it's all the stretching and stuff so I had the giggles I was like what's this because of the weed pills like you know what I don't think so but my stomach started hurting maybe like 15 minutes after I took the weed pills but it's because I hadn't really eaten much except that mango smoothie right and so I ate a Nature Valley bar and now I feel phenomenal but I mean it's like 2:30 now so I should probably eat some lunch you know actual fat meal you know what I'm saying before these weed pills really start kicking in is what I'm thinking so yeah I think that's next up on the plate is making some food maybe some potatoes oh yeah it's settled making potatoes I'll show you guys what I make alright it has now been 1 hour as you can tell via my eyeballs I'm starting to feel it it took 6 weed pills I haven't dabbed in just about an hour so I could be mine early lit still from that last time for sure for sure but I am NOT just mine early let you see realized pretty nicely blazed right now we'll check back in on another 30 and see if they're fully kicked in and whatnot what's going on I got my eyeballs and they're pretty red right now so see if they get redder if I get more lit we're not thinking about it I feel like thinking about how that I am makes me realize that I am indeed quite blazed already see where it goes see you in 30 peace alright checking in haven't made the potatoes yet it's been at least another 30 or so minutes I need to make the potatoes now and then it's like what type of potatoes are you gonna make I was you're good I'm blazed the pills are working and yeah I got a little cardio in so that was nice you know warm up the metabolism to get the pills going even more so yeah ok let's check back in in 30 minutes or actually I'll check back in when these potatoes are ready which will be 30 minutes we're checking that's like a blanket to see it's like it looks like a blanket but it's a jacket it's like psych Oh underwear with it two things all right so it's been another 30 minutes the potatoes are cut up I haven't seasoned them yet because I was checking my canvas which is freshly rezoned what are you judging how much you think I'm lid off of based off of that's what I thought this is literally reflective now I can reflect a traffic light like oh it's green no I'm just kidding I don't think that's the thing look good at that this one's available on our website links down below alright we're now four hours in since I took the pills and I am blazed I forgot to take I'm so blazed I forgot to take a video of the food I literally just ate a ton of potatoes some turkey sausages and some guacamole I like to dip turkey sausages in the guacamole and then yeah and then potatoes and I just ate all that and now I'm just like yeah [ __ ] yeah so I think that uh Senna and I are gonna finish watching this episode of this dank show we're watching and then we'll see where the day takes us after that you know what's good YouTube its cosmos and as you may have noticed it's not the same day as I was just recording and that's because I kind of fell asleep last night I mean I definitely stayed up pretty late but I forgot to keep recording about how late I was I was pretty damn blazed overall I would say but I figured since I forgot to record it again we'd wake up and do it all over again cheers [ __ ] let's get it we'll take when I take six pulse we'll take five bills right now I got pretty blazed yesterday we'll get pretty blazed once again today we're getting kinda low on the pizza Oh kind of low on the pills and I have to make some more soon let's down these five pills take a DAB to start the morning off and we'll call it on the YouTube video with that cheers everyone first pill going down I almost choked on that bill it got stuck in my throat for a second geez to three all right good start good start before going down I get some extra water first ah and number five ah perfect nice okay let's take it down whoo swim talk

attractive and interesting folks make sense of your crazy wonderful mixed up scary anxiety inducing what the hell quite is this place known as your local dispensary so today we are taking a look at a product that has been uh or a category of products rather that has been kind of up and down in my estimation i find some i really like and find a lot of duds and that is the capsule category uh we are taking a look at buddies today oh boy that uh has quite the reflection buddies soft gels one thousand one thousand one thousand one thousand one thousand one thousand milligrams of thc of course we're not doing on 1 000 like all of our wheats reviews we aim to do 100 milligrams of the thc and review that much of it but a thousand milligrams is quite the uh achievement uh especially for as few as there are there are actually only 20 soft gels in here uh leading to 50 milligrams a capsule if you know you are very simple multiplication um really really excited about this one uh if i can find oh my dog is growling at another dog here she's being kind of a [ __ ] underneath so um so these are as i said very very very strong for a single capsule i'm kind of interested to see what they look like 50 milligrams in a single capsule to me seems very [Music] uh at the limits of what can be done but i don't know you know maybe they figured out some kind of magic um so uh on this buddies package here we've got all our incredible information we want we've even got nutrition facts so one of these soft gels has 6.61 calories in case you want to get that specific 6.61 calories 0.73 grams of fat um so this is a gelatin uh oh it's a glycerin base grapeseed oil uh so it has both some kind of like gelatin glycerin which is some kind of um often glycerin is often used vegetable glycerin is often used uh when making like tinctures uh and then grape seed oil is apparently what they are using uh as their um uh base instead of the more common sort of mct oil you see i don't see grape seed oil very often so 50 milligrams we are gonna do two of these capsules uh and just to ensure that i'm gonna get the best effect i am after i take these capsules going to uh eat some food with a lot of fat content in it just to be sure it gets in the bloodstream in the most uh effective way possible uh and then the other big thing to know about these capsules is their surprising affordability uh buddies i've seen they have quite a few products i've seen um carts from them uh they are sort of partnered with packs i've seen pax pods uh and now of course these um soft gels uh and they're always quite affordable uh these soft gels are no exception soft gels are usually quite expensive um for example like the gold cap which was it used to be a big brand a thousand milligrams of this would have cost you uh well over a hundred bucks uh these were a scant forty eight dollars for a hundred or excuse me a thousand milligram uh capsules a hell of a good deal especially if they are as strong as advertised and then last thing i'll bring up is the lab test results they're on the side um so they do you know show that these have 50.7 milligrams of thc as uh denoted by their lab testings and then of course they give you all the other great manufacturing information on it uh and well let's go ahead and open it up take a look at our very shockingly small soft gels for something that's going to have 50.7 milligrams of thc supposedly there it is um nice looking oil actually a super consistent handsome little tablet capsule soft gel let's get that nomenclature correct so here is apparently 100 milligrams of thc uh i cannot wait to be impressed forgot to bring a beverage with me so you know what just gonna have to dry swallow down the hatch well there we go that's 100 excuse me 101.4 milligrams of thc according to their lab testing results so i'm really interested to see how these are going to fare uh that's going to take me and our custom review wheats review process two hours to find out i'm gonna uh chill out here hope to get quite high as i said eat some nice high fat meal and then two hours from now i'm gonna come right back to you guys here and say hopefully i'm super high well for that we'll all have to find out together see you guys right back here in just a bit [Music] my buddies my buddies my buddies and me i'm pretty sure that was the name of a child's toy from the 80s my buddy it's probably the inspiration for chucky what's not the inspiration for chucky is buddies 1 000 milligram soft gels or in our case one tenth of that 100 milligrams of buddies soft gels um and uh that's where the beginning and end of the similarities to chucky are um in every other way it's distinctively non-chucky-like um it never gets married it doesn't have children it doesn't break the fourth wall um buddies why were we talking about chutty chutties chuckies buddies they're pretty good 100 milligrams um of these uh i wouldn't say it's quite as strong as a um good solid baked edible but i'm not gonna complain that much either um that is the smallest footprint of a thousand mil or excuse me 100 milligrams i think i've ever taken uh and i am uh pleasantly quite high again for something that was so miniscule um and i have nine whole doses left in here uh equivalent size to doses all for uh that very affordable 48 bucks like you're not gonna you know um you're not gonna find ten edibles for that price so that's uh that's a pretty good uh gonna be a pretty good endorsement from me it's not the strongest hundred milligrams i've ever had uh but i am always always looking for things that are going to um pack uh sort of out i'll punch their weight class uh and these tiny again these things are so small uh that is 50 milligrams of thc right there dropped one better not let the dog get that um and uh so yeah very very happy with buddies looking forward to doing uh another nine rounds with them in fact um so i'm gonna give it you know what i'll just go ahead and give it two thumbs up of buddies their thc thousand milligram thought soft gels not the best hundred milligrams i've ever done but again a hell of a value and a tiny little footprint uh so before i go with you guys i mean anytime we do the big old siskel and ebert two thumbs upper uh we want to go and mix our metaphors even further so we want to go ahead and add a little cherry on top some you can sort of mole over think about enjoy watch process during your busy boring days um that is the coronavirus uh you know that you can do with or without weed and this week i want to leave you uh with one of the things that i love hearing the most and um uh and and it can be a bomb for our uh anxious times and that is the phrase uh this x can be a salve for these scary times um just pay attention and anytime there's something that isn't uh people are talking about that isn't scary or is vaguely pleasant you'll hear somebody in inevitably describe it as a bomb or a salve for these anxious scary trying boring uh you know pick your adjective times uh and uh then you get really irritated with it quite quickly so my cherry on top is uh my observation that you're gonna notice people saying an x for y a lot uh that x being a bomb or a south things people never use any other time um so why that seems so uh pertinent now i don't know what also isn't pertinent is this review of buddies thousand milligrams which we did a hundred of thumbs up also thumbs up this phrase which is um a a tincture for our a highly uh friction something something world um i failed to come up with another one wow this went on for a while buddies really great boy this one off the rails in the best way possible thank you so much for watching it's been great stay high stay healthy really do stay healthy and we'll see you guys on a later review also stay high goodbye", "EeCyvVgqSjc": "you welcome back YouTube so today I want to give you a little demonstration on how to basically make your own personal use capsules my biggest issue when I make a big batch of oil is like sometimes I really don't want edibles I don't want cookies I don't want any of it sometimes I just want to you know consume I will hey is it that hard it's really not so what I usually do is I get this little capsule machine you go to GNC or Vitamin World or any any health food store they sell these capsules and they also sell this press right here so the capsules cost like a dollar you got like 200 oh and this cost about $10 money well spent let me tell you so all you're gonna do is you take your capsules okay your tops you put your bottoms in this really can't get any easier and the best part about this is these friggin things work you you can make your oil as strong as you want and then you can really really hone in on how strong is my caps and you you can really master this so you get it all filled out and it'll come back in a set but say if you don't have one of these fancy presses which isn't that fancy or expensive but you just you know you're not gonna spend the money it's just you don't you don't see the point so you could what you could do is get a bowl of sugar and say you take your tops put your tops to the side and then you just stick the bottoms into the sugar or the salt and it works pretty perfectly you'll lose say if you do about a hundred you're probably gonna lose a good 15 in falling and just not just whatever but that's not that bad and on the other half you're gonna put your tops so what's gonna happen is we're gonna put or oil and then we're gonna spread it around it's gonna fill up the caps perfectly and then we're gonna put this top on and then squeeze and then when you squeeze they all perfectly become capsules it's amazing and the best part is you give it to one of your friends or or a different medical patient they're gonna look at you like you're just how did you do that so before you go any further you really want to make sure that each one has a capsule in it because if you miss I'm just gonna have oil everywhere and you get a waste of money and you're gonna be pissed so next you take your card so I'm gonna take it I'm gonna pour it in a center round a little square and it'll disperse around and the best part about this thing is if you do too much oil you just pour it right back into your glass so you just spread it around so a little excess oil that I got all right so now I'm gonna take my tops and I'm gonna sit it on top and this is where you really got to be focused when I say really got you focused I mean not really but just squeezed evenly is really what I'm trying to tell you so you're gonna take it and give it a nice squeeze make sure it's all in then boom got canvas castles oh now you can go to work boom boom boom you know no big deal and now ain't no big deal but they work they look great and this is exactly what we're going we're not going for half-assed you know edibles that kind of work like we want stuff that's gonna work so give me a little close-up well thanks guys for watching like how easy was that get yourself out there instead of making cookies or being boring with your oil do something different make some capsules and and you're gonna find that you love these things because I know I did but if you liked what you saw today don't forget to check me out on Instagram at the NJ chef and as always smoke [Music]", "ka1V0ztvt24": "[Music] hello goof-offs and jack-offs and welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary although this time we are not going to be reviewing an edible we are instead going to be reviewing capsules delta-9 capsules to be exact 300 milligrams of THC 10 capsules in there with 30 milligrams each this will be the second time I have reviewed a capsule I reviewed I think it was gold caps the first time hated them a huge waste of money they were very expensive and they did nothing for me these are both cheaper and more potent I believe the other ones were 250 milligrams for 40 these were 300 milligrams for 30 so not a good sign necessarily but this is from Delta 9 this is why I decided to give capsules another chance Delta 9 is a company that I know from their chocolate I've reviewed three of their chocolate bars and have found them to be all amazing so I thought I would give their capsules a fair shake because I've never tried anything from gold capsule than there's one capsules and those were terrible so because this is from the trusty brand delta 9 or at least their chocolate is the trusty brand I thought let's give the capsules another chance who knows you might find some some gold here if not liquid gold so but I think I'm gonna do with these actually is I'm not going to eat them or take them all right off the bat I think I'm gonna do them in two batches 250 milligrams batches about 90 minutes apart so do all three of these over the course of the three hour span and come back to you guys two hours after the last time so this will take five hours in in totality to let you know how we're doing so I'm gonna take or four and a half hours I guess I don't know something like that so I'm going to do ten of these then come back to you guys in 90 minutes let you know how I'm feeling and then take the other ten and then come back to you guys two hours after that and lets you know how we're feeling with the whole batch so let's get started with this first half here let's open it up and just like you would expect this little bottle here oh and we've got our dastardly packaging which I opened nice and easy alright so here we go open open open here are what our capsules look like they're pretty handsome capsules white and green just like the packaging so let's grab five of these for now let's put the other five back in the model and let's take the five that we've got here and just uh I pressured that male life like I could choke okay [ __ ] it'd be funny did it choke thank you Ron Palmer love you alright well those pills tasted like plastic and amazing oh my god such rich complex flavors and those pills ooh still you know decoding all of the complex and just interesting tongue feel that I had with those pills of course I'm just [ __ ] with you who cares what they tasted like they tasted like pills I will see you guys in 90 minutes however to let you know how these first half of these pills are filling so I will see you guys in just a bit thanks for watching wheats and I will see you soon all right guys on back it has been about an hour and a half since I had the first five of the Delta nine capsules which is 150 milligrams of THC and I would say I'm already way higher than I was before when taking the gold caps 250 milligrams of THC definitely way higher than that but not outrageously high I'd say I'm at a four maybe a five somewhere in there so definitely feeling it which is a huge improvement but not you know this isn't like akarova 150 milligrams cookie um these excuse me these five pills um but we still have half the bottle to go so we'll see how much more these final five pills are how much farther they get us in the process all right so here we are we've got our final five these handsome little devils here we'll just do the same thing as before risk choking to death and take them all down in one go still alive that's got to be a sign of something so we've seen how it the first half go after about 90 minutes now let's see how the second half of the bottle goes and for that guys I will check back with you in about another 90 minutes and we will see if I am maybe at Delta nine instead of a delta for that kind of works all right guys I'll see you in about 90 minutes peace welcome back guys another 90 minutes has passed since I had the Delta nine capsules the remaining 150 milligrams and that seemed to do the trick put me from about a four to a straight linear about eight or so I'm quite high as you can tell from the eyes well no no no let's not say eight let's let's let's let's pump the brakes a little bit and go with a seven it's not let's not jump too far I think I'm maybe at about a seven but I'm pleasant with them I'm happy with where I'm at capsules I don't think are ultimately going to be for me these are a hell of a lot better I think than the gold caps the Delta nine capsules that's just on a sample size of one from both companies so you know take with that what you may but but my experience on these are a hell of a lot better than what I have with the gold caps and these were cheaper so that's a total win for Delta nine I don't think I'm gonna be purchasing them they're a little too expensive for me for what you get I do like the concept of them I do like the idea of capsules and just being able to like have something super super discreet that you don't even have to eat I just haven't found one yet that's as potent as I'd like them to be these are close these are close and if they were a little bit cheaper I would buy them on the regular for different occasions but as is I think I'm going to probably not be picking these up in the future but you know who knows maybe if they come out with different dosages or change the price or if I'm looking for something just to mix into a medicine bag or something maybe I'll maybe I'll still give these a chance and also let's give the wheats producer here round of applause for this back here oh my god isn't this amazing the wheats producer just which the they came in here the other day and they're like this place is a piece of [ __ ] we're whipping it into shape and I was terrified because if you ever met the wheats producer you would be you know mortified if something like that were to happen to you and look what happened you know a few days later we have this professional-looking thing in quotations thank you so much for watching wheat skies we will check you out on the next review Papa Papa peace great", "eqSJoOmCi8s": "alright let's get started first things first you're going to need some THC distill it I'm gonna need some coconut oil you're gonna need a shot glass you're gonna need a dropper finally you're gonna need a pot with some water in it so the first step in this process of making cannabis capsules is going to be to weigh out your THC distill it so we're gonna weigh up one gram here just put your shot glass on top of your scale tear it out so it's at zero get all that distill it in there we're now gonna follow it up with three milliliters or three grams of coconut oil this is gonna give you a nice dye Lucien you're gonna have about 23 milligrams per dropper on this dropper here which is 0.25 ml dropper so you might have 10 ml per notch on your syringe so next we're gonna tear the scale again we're gonna get our coconut oil I'm gonna add 3 grams or 3 mm now the next step is to take your coconut oil and THC distill a mixture place it in top of the pot of water on top of the stove allow it to blend evenly when it's completely mixed it will be ready to fill into your cannabis capsules so it's been about five minutes with both the oils over medium heat on the stove and as you can see they're completely blended into a beautiful clear liquid the stirring definitely helps now this is what's going to fill your cannabis capsules alright now we're off to the final step which is filling up your capsules you're gonna need some capsules here we've already took in the time to split them up we got the big end small end these are very easy to find you can find them at your local health store they're just empty gelatin capsules size zero zero super easy to find great for making cannabis capsules of any kind so what you're gonna do here is take your cannabinoid rich oil suck it up into your syringe or your dropper we're using an eye dropper here it's easier for filling up the as I find and you're gonna take out your dough sighs so what you're gonna do is you're gonna figure out how much concentrates you used how much oil you use and do the math ml mark and since we're making 40 ml capsules we're gonna suck it just up to here the 50 mark on our eye dropper take the top of one of the capsules pop it on and you've got yourself a cannabis capsule if you're making these for personal it doesn't matter if you don't use gloves if you're making these for somebody else please use gloves cuz it does get messy and your fingers gonna be all over these things unless you have a capsule machine there you go there's your first cannabis capsule this is a 40 milligram pure THC distill it cup so again hook it up to the 15 portion get it in the capsule get a top one there pop it on it's another cannabis cap so we got two there", "jl31o-0zWKs": "hi geo gee can you get the medicine thank you honey you are so very good you get a treat for that good boy a little piece of kibble thanks honey what did you bring mommy oh what's that hi mcconnell ranch family this is our very first product review and today we'll be talking about a little red pill well not what you think but usually people turn to cannabis to get off pills but how would you like to take your cannabis in a pill i did that for the very first time yesterday with true leaves indica capsules these come in a bunch of different strengths and types there's hybrids there's indicas there's different dosage strengths uh i get the the crazy one and now i tell you it is absolutely crazy i did this last night as soon as i picked them up i took one and i love how discreet they are because it really is like no different than taking a pill i mean i'm i still uh take gabapentin so i am no stranger to taking pills if you've been on pills for years like i have i was on tram at all for on and off 11 years since i was 18 and when i started medicinal marijuana i was able to quit cold turkey so it was kind of like hmm this is like uh kind of like what people get away from but it's not the same thing at all chio is here as always and he's good at getting the museum you want to be in the video with mommy you say hi hello just messing okay so let's talk about these um take them out do a little unboxing this is what the box looks like there's my details on the front these are the 1 500 milligrams 30 count there's 30 milligrams in each of these so it's kind of like doing an edible it works the same way so you take an edible and your liver processes it obviously it goes through the digestive system so let's open it up if you're used to edibles that are like 5 grams 10 grams these are gonna whack you these 30 gram ones so here's what the bottle looks like get my camera to focus it's got a little qr code on it too that's pretty cool and it'll tell you the ingredients on it which is actually a really big deal to me if you're like me and you have allergies i can't have mint which stops me from taking a lot of sublingual oils believe it or not there's a lot of mint flavoring used in the to flavor the oils i guess and i just think what a weird choice but i cannot have mint so when i'll show you the ingredients on this it's coconut oil and cannabis oil that's it no funny stuff it doesn't even say there's any food coloring um they are red and i would imagine i'm not sure if you can i haven't done this but the capsules themselves i'll take them out and we can have a look-see their little plastic capsules are like wax gelatin kind of capsules so i think you can actually even break them apart and you can put it into a drink maybe i haven't tried it i mean let me know if you do i just took it like a regular pill it's easy to swallow if you don't have any water they're very soft it's not like taking my gabapentin which is like a horse pill and it's like chalky and tastes bad and like it gets stuck in your these ones went down nice and smooth if you're caught without water and you or anything to drink um don't have to take it with anything i if you're like i said um a veteran pill taker uh you can just dry swallow them let's keep them out for now but yeah don't do more than one if uh i thought i had a tolerance guys i do not i'm someone that uses cannabis daily or almost daily i've been trying to cut back a little just because i want to not always have to titrate up and up and up so it's a good time it's like good to like give your body a break sometimes but if you're somebody that can't do that you got to take it every day i mean maybe this is what you're looking for because it's super strong you don't have to take it with food or anything either i didn't you can take it on an empty stomach and it says on the box give it up to two hours to kick in like like a regular edible and it does it start it's clear it creeps up on you i remember i'm sitting there and i'm like all right you know sometimes it can take me a little longer for for something to hit me because i'm like crappy guts i have really bad intestines they don't absorb so well so your mileage may vary depends on how your system usually how you react to an edible if you do edibles that's how you can gauge how quick this onset and how it's going to hit you just it's like taking a really really strong edible uh it creeped up on me it was like nice to meet you i i loved it though and it took me in gradually but let me tell you since this is strong it got to the point where it was like oh this is almost too much you know those times where you're like i think i got too high but then i just i laid down i was super giggly but i laid down and it made me really relaxed and sleep if you have pain like if you take this for pain like i do chronic pain you're not gonna feel a thing um and i know those days where your usual dose doesn't cut it like even if you take like your pills your marijuana your other stuff your yoga your physical therapy and like it doesn't work like no matter like what you do like try these these are these lids will come in handy and i think these are like an icing on a cake they're all by themselves though not even icing on a cake they're just like wow they pack a punch so it lasted me from i think like 1pm all the way to like i just passed out around like i think seven six pm somewhere around there and then i slept for six hours and i have really bad insomnia so saying that i slept six hours at a time without waking up not even to pee like i didn't feel a thing i was out like a like a zombie like the best you know the dead sleep you know uh was really nice so uh yeah it's an indica it does the job um the other one was a hybrid that was on the website so you'll get a different effect i mean usually these things sativas indicate hybrids they always affect me the same they always make me sleepy they always knock me out and i know how people are always like so tables will give you energy and i'm like no that's not me uh give give me some comments below if that is you too like make me feel like i'm not a weirdo i feel like everything just affects me the same way but if you need to sleep if you want to relax and if you want to get hungry oh my god you guys i was eating my house down i ate five eggs okay like i was like oh i can't stop and like i was i felt like i was starving it felt like i hadn't like i was just a starving child and i just wanted everything and food tasted like magic you know how like when you you have that those those you know every not every strain is going to make you want to eat the house down sometimes it just makes you like not want to eat depending these made me want to eat everything and everything tasted like a miracle and it felt like bottomless pit style i could have just kept going and going but it didn't affect me negatively i had no negative side effects i want to report other than it just might have been too much because the dosage was super high so but you can like i said you can go on there's different websites there's different strengths you can see on the website or even if you go in person they'll show you the different milligram dosages if you're new to edibles or swallowing you know oral ingestion i would start out the lowest possible and then you know like they say start low go slow um there's five milligrams like an average edible 10 is really strong these babies will have you on saturn i'm just gonna say i'm very happy with these i'm gonna wait till my tolerance creeps back up and i'm like you know that my normal edibles aren't doing the job until i take another one of these again but if you have like a rainy day a weekend maybe a weekday who knows you do you i mean i have weekdays my sister drinks champagne on mondays if you have a day where you can just hang out and do nothing you're gonna have a great time do it alright so i hope you enjoy our very first canner review i know i did chio kind of passed out over there he's waiting for breakfast it's early in the morning when i'm filming but thank you guys for watching and uh if you like these i'll be doing more leave me a like share with your friends don't forget to subscribe to mcconnell ranch and i love you", "kC0PG3GqVMo": "thank you too so today I'm going to show you guys how I do my any type of gummies any type of any type of salt cane the way I do this is no fail and it's really easy all you got to do is boil some water mix it really hard and you're good the main idea of my gummies and probably everybody else's but I use a little bit more just to be a little safer is a lot of gelatin so usually for a recipe for gummy bears and anything anything like that it usually calls for one box for tax which is fun you know that really will work if you made some gummies with one box of jell-o and four packs of it will work it's it's I'm not saying it's not gonna work but but now during a hot day or even just a little bit of moisture in the air your gummies are going to stick together and they're going to melt and you're gonna be pretty pissed off so take my advice and follow my recipe and I'm sure that your gummies are gonna hold up in your pocket you're gonna be able to go to work and go on with your day without any worry that something's gonna happen to basically the money you spent making these guns so let's get started so this is really simple like I said all you're gonna do is boil some water and that's it so we're gonna add 1 cup of water now that we had our water will crank go on so this isn't gonna take too long to get hot it's one cup of water so it's literally about two minutes it will probably be there so we got to think fast to move this so what we're gonna do is usually now you can do two full boxes of gelatin and that's only gonna make your gummies last longer they're gonna be a little harder a little more firm but they will last and that's the main idea but I usually like to do seven packs just because it's a perfect amount of like thickness in there so so now we're about to start boiling so I'm gonna add my gelatin sooo some cold water so it does AHS a little bit so when we actually do mix it doesn't get love you not sure if you guys know it's the Spanish shirt I'm wearing I believe design and he's out of Philadelphia PA and you guys like these shirt so I'm gonna be wearing check out his website I'll have a link down at the top lots of hats lots of shirts who's got lots of stuff ok so now that our gelatin is dissolved I'm gonna add our gelatin to the water after I have my gelatin I'm gonna have my gelatin pack then I'll add our additive and we're done so what's that era now it's at our gelatin give this a good a good old stir because you want to break up anything that's happened to not dissolve John says it's fish so this mix that we're making now I have three volts here this one box recipe should almost perfectly cover all three moles so now that our gelatin is combined and there's no more lumps now get out our gelatin so I'll do let's still line add your whole pack you really don't gotta rush this that's the best part about gummies and jello you don't it's not hard candy it's not like the minutes it's done you got the rush and it's gonna solidify on you if it does solidify you can just reheat it it's good again all right so now our jello has a gelatin and it's ready but does it have any good stuff so so it's outer additive and then we'll take the next step all right so now do you added your additive to this thing's ready to go you're ready to have a really fun day so the hard parts done we have it ready now the biggest problem is filling your molds I see people using turkey basters don't use surrogate of turkey basters think about when you suck it in just the two go over here you're gonna lose by the time you're done here you probably lost about seven to eight gummy bears worth of drop so don't use the turkey baster it's a mess and you're gonna lose stuff what I like to use is a squeeze bottle a squeeze bottle you can pour it in perfectly and boom boom boom boom no mess and no loss so let's do this so if you have a big squeeze bottle you can burp the bottle like that so when you tilt it it doesn't shoot out at somebody sitting across the room and you kind of control it a little bit better so you just go over each one how easy was that using a squeeze bottle way better than using a turkey bass boom all I got to do is wait for these is wait for these things are cool and I can be poppin these things all night long feelin really good so we'll check back in a couple of minutes when they're ready we'll see what they look like so we are all solidified see what we got the fact we used a lot of gelatin these things are gonna come out nice and hold your shape and it's gonna be nice so yeah boom just like you went to the store got some gummy bears this time they're gonna get you baked it'll look way cooler they won't melt in your pocket none of it okay go on your daily business don't worry about these but I just got these little molds I got from Michaels and they see more there's so many cool molds that you can do I really want to try the Lego molds you can build Legos with those things just so so cool but that was easy boil some water add your jello add your gelatin add your additive mix it up mold done I hope you guys can tell but I'm freaking freezing it's cold so what I like most about these is you know hard candies they're great when they take too long and you know sometimes you just want to eat some candy really fast and these are really good for it so you could be boom-boom-boom and be on your way instead of sitting there having to suck on some hard candy for a while these are these are great and you guys like what you solo today don't forget to check me out on instagram at the NJ chef don't forget to check me out on medical edibles calm every

Joe Namath I'm a periodontist in Southfield Michigan and I want to talk a little bit today about CBD or CBD oil cannabidiol CBD CBD oil can be derived from the marijuana plant or it can be derived from the hemp plant it does not have THC in it THC is the ingredient that causes one to get high so this does not have that in it so it doesn't cause you to get high but it is used for pain control and many people it can be used as a as a rub to help control pain in children it may help control seizures it may help reduce anxiety but today I want to talk about the possible role of CBD in the mouth in oral health and specifically on your gum tissue so there was a study using rats what they did was they induce gum disease or periodontal disease in these rats by using certain kinds of wires that irritate the gum tissue and these rats were given CBD actually there were two groups of rats a control group that did not receive the CBD and the experimental group that did receive the CBD now the CBD was given in the form of injection and of course when you brush your teeth you're not going to be injecting CBD they found that at the end of the trial period the rats that had been given the CBD had much less bone destruction they healed much faster and their gums were much healthier relative to the rats in the control group that did not receive the CBD so CBD by the way CBD is now a buzzword you could hear it everywhere and you're gonna hear even more about it because a lot of people think it's the holy grail well it's not the Holy Grail but it may be helpful in certain situations and maybe it's even helpful in the mouth it does tend to reduce inflammation it doesn't kill bacteria so there are some toothpaste some very strong toothpastes that have ant bacterial agents in them and those antibacterial agents kill most or all of the bacteria in the mouth even the good ones on the other hand there are now toothpastes that have CBD incorporated in the toothpaste and these do not destroy the good bacteria but they enable the good bacteria to to proliferate and continue to grow and minimize the harm of the bad bacteria also a great role for CBD is it does reduce anxiety and so it might be very helpful for patients to take some CBD CBD oil something with CBD before a dental appointment to reduce their anxiety of course in our dental office there's no anxiety because we never cause any patients any pain but basically if one has anxiety it does tend to help reduce anxiety and it's very effective for that in a future video I want to talk more about CBD and specifically I want to talk about marijuana and actually smoking marijuana because as opposed to CBD or CBD oil which could have a therapeutic role I think the jury is still out a bit on it marijuana and the smoke actually is probably and is harmful to the gum tissue because the smoke tends to dry out the gum tissue and may reduce the blood supply to the gum tissue so there's a big difference between smoking marijuana which has THC typically and CBD which doesn't so I'm going to talk more about these subjects marijuana CBD in the future but I just wanted to give you a glimpse of potentially what may be going on now and I want to remind you to keep your mouth healthy because if your mouth is healthy I guarantee your body will be healthier subscribe to our YouTube channel we'd love to hear from you and have a great day restore your smile and your health visit dr. Nemeth calm to schedule your appointment today", "pUhJnKKQDTE": "as marijuana becomes legalized throughout North America [Many] are trying edibles for the first time as a healthier option but with Edible marijuana Providing such a different experience than smoking how does it work and is eating pot Actually better for you? When you heat cannabis you effectively change the chemical makeup of compounds within it called Cannabinoids Smoking heats it to around 800 degrees Celsius and converts thc a to Delta 9 thC which binds to receptors in your brain making them continually fire and causing your imagination, thoughts and perceptions to magnify this is why every thought can feel like a significant one and Because it travels straight from your lungs into the bloodstream and to your brain the drug works within minutes and lasts about two to [three] Hours, but when making edibles the weed is heated to around 150 degrees Celsius burning less of the actual plant and minimizing Carcinogens ThC is Lipophilic not water-soluble so the activated Thc must be dissolved into something fatty like oil or butter and once the substance is consumed the onset of the high is delayed as the drug is absorbed more slowly through your gut but this high typically lasts four to eight hours and most report feeling more high than Compared to smoking marijuana [this] is because when you eat edible weed the ThC is first metabolized by the liver before entering the bloodstream and here Delta 9 thC also becomes 11 o h thC which Passes the brain barrier more rapidly and is a more potent chemical so using the same amount of marijuana You actually get more high with Edibles because it ends up creating both Delta 9 ThC And 11-OH-THC which is a stronger compound and because there are more? psychotropic types of Cannabinoids acting on your neurons you'll be high for longer of course you also get to skip out on the toxic chemicals that smoking provides like Carbon monoxide Bronchial Irritants and tumor Initiators smoking anything means you're inhaling cancer-causing molecules so if you can get high without smoking it will be healthier for your lungs and body the downside it's much harder to control the High you'll get because it can take up to one to two hours to feel the full effects and the dosage can vary significantly modulating the effects or Titrating as it's called is much more difficult [and] as a result you can end up a lot higher than you intend - but unlike those who consume too much alcohol Opioids or other drugs you won't be suffering any serious long-term harm Toxicity [or] Lethal overdose if you do consume more than you intended [if] you've ever wondered why marijuana gives you the munchies? check out our AsAP stop video that breaks down the science behind that by clicking the screen or using the link in the description and subscribe for more weekly science videos every Thursday", "Ig-mNLIdGYE": "on today's video I'm going to show you how to make cannabis capsules or canna caps in two different ways well we're gonna talk about why choose canna caps whether you infuse or not all the materials that you'll need and then I'll do a demonstration for you and then we'll come back and talk a little bit about dosing hi my name is Andrea Hogg I'm a cannabis coach and educator we do a whole bunch of stuff besides weekly YouTube videos online classes workshops one-to-one consultations you can find out all about that and get some really cool three stuff by heading to reveal cannabis calm so why go through the investment of time and equipment and resources to make canna caps what are the benefits of them well for lots of people taking a capsule is a really familiar way to take medication so especially for people who are new to cannabis and might hold lots of stigma against it sometimes taking it in a capsule can feel really reassuring to them they're very easy to take just like regular capsules you just swallow them and they're easy to increase or decrease the dose so you can start out with one capsule and then see how you feel and then increase from there they're super easy to store you just keep them in a cool dry place maybe in the fridge if you'd like they're very discreet you can keep them in your purse or your pocket and medicate as you need and making them yourself saves you so much money over store-bought traditionally canna caps have been filled with cannabis infused oil so that's oil that's been infused with cannabis and then they strain the cannabis out they take the oil and they fill up the capsules with it but you don't have to go through that step if you don't want to so if you prefer you can simply D carve your cannabis in the oven grind it up slightly and then use the capsule filling machine like I'm going to show you in a couple of seconds and the scraper that comes with it to just scrape the cannabis flour into your capsules you want to bang the tray deee on every once in a while to make sure that you're getting about the same amount in each capsule but it really saves you a lot of work of doing the infusion if you do decide to do that just use ground D carb Canada make sure you take a little bit of fat with your kiddos capsules when you take them cannabis binds really well too fat so having some avocado or some cream or some butter on your toast is a good way to ensure that you're getting some of the fat that you need to help the cannabinoids bind well so for this project you're going to need cannabis infused oil and I have links to recipes and videos to make that down below or ground D carb cannabis so either one of those to start and then you do not need a capsule maker but it really does make the job a lot easier and a lot faster than hand filling capsules you need the empty capsules try to find it capsules that come with the tops and bottoms apart so you don't have to go through that step but it's really hard to find those so good luck you'll need tweezers for flipping the capsules when you're using the capsule machine a syringe or two or three because sometimes they get clogged up and a dish of hot water or a double boiler if you're using the coconut oil infusion method I get a lot of my capsule making supplies from Amazon but you can also get these at some pharmacies and you can get the capsules themselves at lots of health food stores so check that out as well I just want to give you a picture of what to look for this is the basic capsule filling machine yours might look slightly different but so long as it has these basic parts then you'll be good most of these capsule fillers only take zero and zero zero size capsules and I actually have a whole recipe quote unquote down below for you so that you have links to all of this as well here's a look at what your capsules will likely look like again if you can find them atop some bottom separated that's the best or even different colors is really helpful but this is what I can usually get my hands on make sure that you do check the capsule size there are different sizes and again you can read about that on the recipe down below these are the types of syringes that I buy you can buy literally a whole bunch of different kinds on Amazon I try to get them so that they are at least five milliliters so that you're not refilling your syringe often and some of them do come with the long metal tip I don't find it necessary but some people prefer it so here we go I'm going to show you how to do this the first thing that you need to do is separate your so bottoms from your capsule tops some of the packages come already separated and that's fantastic if not it's a little bit of an arduous job to do next you put this device I do not know what all the names for this stuff is it looks like it should be weight easier than it is and it takes some practice to learn how to use it and sometimes I wonder if it would just be faster for me to fill them by hand and then I go try and sell them by hand and I realize no not sure just taking out all the extras so I've got some here that are actually like upside down and some of the holes aren't filled so I'm going to go through and fix that way that I do it is by pushing down on the springs and just flipping these legs around that need flipped around sometimes I have to go and grab tweezers because just the way that it's set up but you do really want to make sure that you don't leave any of these unfilled especially with these clear caps it's hard to tell so make sure you do a super good like luff scan through because otherwise if you get cannabis oil all over this machine I know it's on machine but all over this capsule filler and it's hard to clean so yeah do your best to make sure that you learn from my many mistakes of capsule filling next we take this piece and put the filler on it again and we do the same thing that we did with the top after you're finished with the tops you can just set this aside for a couple of minutes because you're going to be filling up your cannabis capsules what I have here is cannabis infused into coconut oil and I'll link to a video on how to do that so that you can have that all ready to go and I have it sitting in a dish of really hot boiling water I do that on purpose because I want the coconut oil to be really warm otherwise it starts to solidify too quickly when I'm filling up the capsules and it clogs up your syringe and it makes it a real mess so try to keep this as warm as you can you'll get into a rhythm and you'll spill a whole bunch over the edge a whole bunch of times as well but you'll be able to fill these up relatively quickly and then we'll put the caps on them altogether that took me about seven minutes to fill those capsules up so it wasn't as bad as I thought so my capsules are filled with oil I'm going to put this orange thing on top of the capsule lid and then you flip it upside down smashing clothes they kind of clip closed then you have a bunch of Hana capsules now what I like to do with these right here is put them in the freezer for about ten or fifteen minutes and then you can store these in the fridge or the freezer for quite a long time it's just coconut oil and cannabis and then you have a really convenient way to dose full disclosure time before we get into dosing those kin of caps that I put in the freezer they're still in the freezer it's been about two weeks and you still haven't pulled them out because it's been busy but when you're done with your Kanak apps you can just pull them out of the freezer pop them out of the mold and store them in glass mason jar in the cupboard or in the fridge let's talk about how to dose them so I have on my website and I'll link to it down below a dosing calculator that makes this easy to figure out Emily how many milligrams of THC or CBD might be in each of your capsules again I really want to stress that this is an approximate range unless you're using lab tested cannabis and all of your procedures are really on point however even if you have lab tested cannabis and everything is perfect with your dosing with each new batch that you make you should always start low and go slow and see if everything is the same on the new batch do you have questions about this I love to answer your questions so please leave them down below and again head over to reveal cannabis calm to get your free stuff and to check out all my other offerings", "pmJ5binaa28": "This case involves a cancer patient, police and pot. Check it out. This is what when you have stage four pancreatic cancer all my tribe mates. Here they are. A Missouri man fighting cancer says his rights were violated when police searched his hospital room after they suspected he might have marijuana. And his Facebook Live video went viral. Hi guys. We got a call saying there was marijuana in the room. [Police Officer 2] I smelled marijuana whenever I walked in the room. OK. [Patient} And there is no way they could smell it, doc, 'cause I don't smoke it, I don't have, I don't ever use a ground-up plant. It's an oil that I use in a capsule. OK. So there's no smoking it. I take it like a pill. Well no, we have not found anything, but he's got another bag that he's Do you guys, just from a legal standpoint, do you have probable cause to search his stuff? Do you have the right to search his stuff, or do you need a warrant for that? No, we have the right, he's on private property. Frustrated that officers were looking through his final days' belongings, which reportedly included THC and CBD capsules, the man defended himself by mentioning the state had recently legalized medical marijuana. Medically, in Missouri, it's really legal now. They just haven't finished the paperwork. [Police Officer} OK, well, then, it's still not legal. But I don't have time to read through that. Shhhhh. Man, what would you do? Tell me what you'd do. If that was your only, I'm not in that situation, so I'm not gonna play the what-if games. You've never said you'd do anything to save your life? You'd do anything to save your life. Marijuana is saving your life? If you had five kids, it's the only choice I got to live. Ultimately, cops found nothing and no citations were issued. But did they do the right thing? Oh my gosh. Oh my God. How many police officers were, I know! I'll ask you, because in your world, obviously, you deal with a lot of criminal offenses. And, I mean I, it's hard to watch because We have this thing called the United States Constitution, and every state has a constitution. Two separate constitutions, we have the federal and the state. The Fourth Amendment protects against illegal searches and seizures, OK? You have a reasonable right to expect that you're gonna be, to your privacy. That nobody's gonna come in and look at your stuff. And first of all, they've got nothing better to do than to pick on a poor cancer patient? (audience applauds) You know? In a hospital, yet. First of all, they had no search warrant. It could be an argument made, you know, there is no expectation of privacy because he's in a room where people are coming and going, they're going through his bags, they're going through his suit coat. They're opening things. They have no right to do that without a search warrant. However, I did read that he consented. You consent, then everything's off the table. You know, yes, you can search his bag, yes, you can, then it's, they can. Well, let's just even theoretically say this is a Stage four pancreatic cancer patient, and people know the very grim statistics. This is such a deadly disease. Less than three percent survival after five years. Let's just say he had a joint in the backpack, it's hard for me to see this happen and take place because there are plenty of other things out there that deserve the attention of police officers, and I don't know (applause) what situation the police were put in here, but also, to me, how does the hospital deal with this? Because, it seemed like a physician came in there and said, wait a minute, what are you all doing here? I think she asked if they had probable cause. Yes, she did. And they needed a warrant. To get a warrant, you need probable cause. All they had was a phone call from somebody saying, I smelt it. Well, I walk through my hotel lobby and I smell it all day long! (audience laughs) I walk down the streets of LA, Hollywood Boulevard, I smell it all day long, you know? Yeah. But to walk in and invade this man's privacy, Again, what would they do here? That's actually a really good point because I do feel like he raised this amendment two that was passed the preceding November in Missouri, that was for allowing medical marijuana. So in this changing landscape, where so many states are now passing marijuana regulations that have outstripped the ability of the state to even regulate them, and who gets what, how is there even a case there? Like, how do you even adjudicate something like that? They shouldn't even have responded, you know. And obviously they didn't find anything. They were looking for marijuana, and they didn't find it. So there is no case, you know. The question is now, you know, sue them for invading your privacy. I mean, you just, can you imagine being in a hospital room and having, like the SWAT team come in looking for your marijuana, my marijuana? Really? You know, I could see if it was something bigger and better, like, you know, maybe he had heroin. I mean, that would be outrageous if he was having, you know, that in a hospital room. It's marijuana, and it is now legal in that state, is my understanding. Really?", "wsIAkMsB3r0": "hey guys dr. Shawn here and it's time for another cannabis product review today just a quick review on tweets Penelope strand in the gel cap form so Penelope is available in all different forms from tweed you could buy it as an oil as dry bud or as the gel cap and it's known for its low concentration of both THC and CBD as well as having sort of an equal ratio between the two cannabinoids now things I like about Penelope is that that's the name of my daughter cut to a picture of my daughter and also it has a sort of a micro dose so you can easily titrate up to the dose that works for you it's also from a hybrid strain so not totally indica not totally sativa I personally find the Penelope to be more on the sativa side of things less sedating than a pure indica so that's about it in terms of just general information about Penelope oh it's retails for about 20 dollars for 15 capsules there's a larger size of belief when you order the 60 capsule size the price comes down a little bit but it's roughly about a buck a capsule so that brings me to some of the things I don't love about this is that for me personally it's a little too weak to just take one capsule on its own so if I'm using this you know I'm either using this for sleep or I'm using it for maybe like pain relief during the daytime if I'm a pain patient but if I don't want to be high during the day and I'm using is using it medicinally it's also not pure CBD it has THC in it so you have to watch out so it's kind of a weird gray area in terms of dosing and potency for me because one capsule is not enough for me for sleep but it might be enough for some people and also if I'm using it like let's say I don't know recreationally just you know during the daytime with friends or whatever it's still kind of weak so you end up taking more than just one capsule and then the more and more capsules you take the price adds up so I rather be taking something a bit of a higher dose and I only need to take one capsule or one syringe of oil and that's all I need now for individuals who are sort of new to cannabis and don't know what dose works for them right off the pant this might be a good option so you can slowly kind of titrate up your dose and find out what dose works for you the other thing that I didn't love about this one is that it doesn't seem to offer me that nice sedating quality that I like from for sleep for instance I did a review of cannabis cannabis of tweets argyll cannabis oil and that one has for me at least much more sedating quality to it I prefer it over the Penelope for sleep so that's all about Penelope so out of ten I'm gonna give this one about a 5 out of 10 it's not my favorite I probably won't be ordering it again but if you're into micro dosing and you're new to cannabis and you want to kind of work your dose up slowly and you want a little bit of THC and CBD in the mix this might be a really good option for you so that's it for Penelope next I really plan I've been planning this for a while but I really want to review the cove CBD oil a lot of my patients take it and I hear good things about it so stay tuned for that one that's probably going to be my next review and please subscribe to my channel if you like these reviews comment below tell me what you want to see and in a future review and and that's all for now see you next time", "iDjF5HSkAY0": "[Music] how's it going everybody welcome back to another scam to strain review with me Stephen stairs how's it going everybody I know you probably like Steve what the heck is that on your eye your brother like like what am I like a see-through pirate I'll check it out it's like a plastic lens to keep dirt from out of my eye I had cataract surgery yesterday super painful not really into it but yeah so this is different my eye so that's what that's what you're looking at everybody so don't don't get confused anyway so product to review today is I'm doing these castles so these are these are lbs Oh Leafs by Snoop these are 2 point 5 milligram THC capsules I'll show you here right like they're pretty cool-looking they're nice and clear you know they look very medical they come in a little diffuser in there and make sure that moisture gets in there um however like this is probably the first review we'll all ever do that's it all negative I don't see the point in these two point five milligrams of THC is an extremely low dose it's something that I would call a micro dose so I I have done my research by taking these plain you know regular run-of-the-mill no cannabis in me for the first day and I didn't feel I've given them to someone who doesn't smoke cannabis and they didn't feel them so I'm not sure if these are for like a micro droves to take the edge off that maybe I'm not experiencing but for the $30.00 or so that this capsule was I'm honestly not a big fan they seem like it's good quality product however for people who want these effects of THC this is 2 micro of the dose and that's nothing to do with with tweed or or or you know Leafs by Snoop or anything like that this is just a market share this is too small for the recreational market I'm as far as I'm concerned I might be wrong you tell me what you think you go and purchase this and tell me what the two and a half milligrams of THC does to you and there's only 15 capsules I believe in this thing or 30 so it's it's not something that will get you quote-unquote the cannabis high they won't do that but they might be great for microdose they may be for analgesic anti-inflammatory stuff I'm not sure I really have questions as to why lbs Snoop would put something on such a low dose product where all of us know Snoop Dogg we think big fat joints and you know chronic and you know bubonic and you know sticky icky we right but yet you got please I don't know I think this might be one of the misses in the legalization industry so that's my review of these go check them out for yourself tell me what you think and you know maybe send them 10 tweet or LSPs a letter saying maybe make your doses a little bit stronger because so far the feedback that I'm getting when I tell people for these is yeah cannabis users aren't looking for two and a half mile gravity maybe 25 milligrams or something like that but 2.5 in one pill it's not worth it so that's my review on that if you're interested in more strain review cannabis products I've got more coming up this week we're going to be doing a CBD only flower which is really nice and I've got some other products coming up this week as well those of you who wanted to win the Giza papers I'll be sending you a private message regarding your win of the papers for a year and you can get your a fax sent out to you so other than that next product CBD weed okay so thanks everybody for tuning in I hope you like and share definitely try this out for yourself don't take my only word but as far as I'm concerned these aren't sighs for me so tell that to the feedback all right take care everybody Steven stairs once again sending off cannabis stream reviews like share comment don't forget to hit the bell and subscribe take care [Music]", "2VCDFUeC3Ow": "hey everyone and welcome to hemp in a pan today we'll be showing you how to make CBD pills [Music] so if you're looking for a great discreet and portable way to consume CBD then you've come to the right place because today we'll be showing you how to make CBD pills we'll start first with making CBD infused coconut oil to fill the capsules coconut oil works well for this because it solidifies at room temperature so that the pills are more stable when transporting around and because of their high saturated fat content they'll infuse well with the CBD I used a quarter of an ounce of medicinal hemp per cup of oil you can add more or less to this recipe depending on how potent you want the pills to be but I found that a fourth of an ounce is a good starting point for most people we'll start first with grinding of the hemp and then decarboxylated in the oven at 250 degrees for about 30 minutes now that the hemp is nice and toasty you'll want to place it in a bowl with the coconut oil place it on top of a pot of boiling water and then use this double boiler technique to infuse the hemp with the coconut oil you'll want to let this boil for at a minimum an hour and preferably two to three hours to make sure that as much of the CBD is infused in the oil as possible now you want to take it out the heat and let it sit for about half an hour to let it cool down not so cool that it solidifies to room temperature but not so hot that I'll burn to the touch strain everything through a cheesecloth [Music] [Music] squeeze as much of the oil out as possible and now we're ready to place them in the capsules you'll probably need to wait another 15 minutes or longer for the oil to cool down just a bit more the melting point for the gelatin capsules are around 90 to 95 degrees because it has to dissolve at below the human body temperature of 98 degrees so you'll have a range of around 75 to 90 degrees to work with since once you're below 75 degrees then the infused CBD coconut oil will start to solidify we now need a few supplies for this part starting with the capsules I found that the zero zero sized capsules are a good compromise between size and ease of use if you want a smaller capsules you can go down to the size zero which is easier to swallow but harder to fill I don't recommend anything smaller than a size zero as they're just really hard to work with you'll also need a way to fill the capsules most food-grade syringes work well and the ones with the needle tips or a tapered deep reach will make it easier to fill the capsules accurately now there's a ton of capsule pill holders on the market to help hold the capsules in place to fill it quicker and to automatically cap each pill afterwards but if you're not making that many pills you can always make a simple one with a small cardboard box and a drill which is what I'm doing now now that I finished drilling in the holes for the capsules I placed each inside as you can see well the hole i accidentally drilled too large so i'll just skip that one now I just used a syringe to fill each capsule cap the maus and that's it [Music] for long-term storage I definitely recommend keeping them in the fridge as warmer climates will keep the coconut oil from solidifying and here's what they look like once solid", "zGGdXtYeRc8": "well we start with your finest herb your favorite grinder grind it up a bit but not too much thank you crow spread it out 225 for 40 might work as well for you don't use your mom's croc body you know what it is low and slow you can use oil of any kind but coconut is supposed to be one of the better ones i let it warm up a bit so i can get it a little bit more accurate top it up pour it in put in your toasted cannabis i love it mix it up a bit let her sit a little bit more a little less this stuff is so tasty just by itself i've always thought of making a nice pesto with it you can double filter this if you want period might be hot so careful when you squeeze it out and that stuff tastes delicious and it's good for your skin give it another squeeze to get out a little bit more put it aside i'll show you what to do with that later i think you can get vegan ones of these but these are better dude you have to have kids if you know what those are this is the fun part slaps my bottom part yeah and then you just wiggle around and they mostly pop in you have to work a few of them back in and i'm looking for a pipette that i can soak up a bunch and then just hit a button and it doses out 0.75 of a mil each time i haven't found one yet a little bit more a little bit less if you go too much it just makes a spilly mess everywhere so less is more literally these the tops same sort of process and this is the chopsticks they just pop over perfectly and you can flip them over get them upright if you miss one it takes a while to notice it it's a bit of a mess it's all good keeps the caps in place then you flip it over just kind of give it a little wiggle and push down and then boom then you just kind of pop them out onto a paper towel because there's some messes i'm going to put the tops and the bottoms back into the bag for next time there's usually about another 10 pills left over 20 pills depending how much coconut you put in yeah just pop them in there put them in the freezer so they last they usually don't last long anyways if you know what i mean and they'll fade up a bit i hope you enjoyed it take care", "OlRnKmufRZc": "what's that mom I was saying where's the car the cars outside I'd like to be outside and home we have been outside

legs up it's just a good idea when you're pacing about like this you know your back is hurting you that's why you're grabbing it yeah and that's that's that's from the pacing around because you're the arch in your back can you um mama we are home no we are not you'll feel better in a few minutes mom I'll feel worse these fine this time ah cross heavy heavy weight yes mama watch what you just please have a seat no mama oh maybe we should go to three pills a day so we don't have to go through this hour to everyday lawyer where you pace around so bad because when when the pill is working it you're you're fine this but boy when it wears off you just go right back to how you were before you did the pill well I mean I I'm the calm saga ticket I'm desperate to get oh I've got it back well right mama and you have to you have to sit down that's why your back hurts so bad because you're wandering around and you've got osteo peeny yes you have terrible curvature of your back well I know that all right that's why you should sit you're better you're best off in my car and take me home mom we are home we don't own this house yes we do this is our home really yes we've lived here for 13 years so now it's about five after seven yeah there's a bunch of birds on the feeder you've been sitting down now for about five minutes yeah you realize that you were just pacing around for about an hour and a half two hours maybe for the past two hours for the best two hours I was facing mm-hmm walking around in the house yep back and forth between the doors and back and forth in and out of the kitchen you know just just pacing I just don't think saying that you had to get out of here yeah just a few minutes ago you were like that you had to get out of here because this wasn't your house no joke yeah that's emoji but now you've been sitting down for like as to saying about five minutes I was just trying to delete stuff off my camera because I was recording you before when you were facing her own and and you yeah now you've settled down for about five minutes and I deleted some stuff on the camera and I got another 40 minutes free on here but yeah you're much better here you realize this is home now yes yeah yes yes yes I would recognize that it is residence that we use and like but you have a red place that is more pushy do you do more loving no I love this place that I'm bonfires that this place is great beautiful place nice Birds got the river oh it's a great place it sure is but 20 minutes ago I sure couldn't convince you of that why hmm yeah yeah just 20 minutes ago you were you were pacing back and forth and you had to get out of here you kept saying this wasn't your house so you had to get out we weren't supposed to be here this room yes right here your living room mm-hmm I got in between Lola's furniture oh sure yeah you were pacing around all over back and forth yeah just a few minutes ago not building what I couldn't tell you I don't know you're just you're just not content the opposite of content is what you get like you know you don't believe it's your house you don't want to be here and that's why you need to start things you like to be around oh yeah it's not very much fun trying to yeah I convinced your mother that she's in her house no no that's no fun it's uh it's a much much nicer life one when you like your house and you're happy here and yeah you're able to sit down because it really it wreaks havoc on your back you know when you go home attacks and constantly right right and but when you pay so much because of you're leaning forward in because of the osteo peeny it just puts that much more stress on it so when you pace around you really get it sore and you know and and trying to sit you down just doesn't work you won't sit down just get right back up again it's it's uh it's wild but uh yeah it sure is nicer when you when you're content because we are already out shopping today we had plenty of exercise it's uh I get worried about you when you just you know you're blindly pacing back and forth back and forth you were doing it for a good hour before I even came up you know you yeah you start doing it later in the afternoon when there when the pill wears off there's the bad kitty foot boy it's it's just such a difference now from a half hour ago oh oh what was fo you were pacing back and forth not believing this was your house and you had to get out of here yes ma'am yeah yes yeah no no it's no good and it's yeah you used to do it this most of the day you know and you were falling down all the time and that's why we got John this pill the dronabinol to begin with because you just you couldn't sit down you were going crazy and that's back before I had to lock the doors and everything you were wandering outside you'd fall right on your face and you were falling upstairs all the time because you would just do nothing but wander back and forth and but since you've started this pill now you know at least 80% of the day you're you're completely reasonable when the pill wears off uh yes yeah you you you you go right back to it slowly but surely yeah just unbelievable for sure that is better well I'm just so thankful at least we've got the pill to bring you back down you know I mean have to be really good well here we are I mean at least you're here now it's better than you were a half-hour ago right right I mean there you are you're my mom again you're sitting down you're content you're at home and you're safe because you're sitting you're not hurting your back anymore it's oh yeah right yeah you were just pacing around for an hour and a half right right oh yeah it's it's been hurting you for 10 plus years the back yeah and there are long straight scoffs scoffs yep Joseph Peter great-grandpa my grandpa who am i mom Who am I no you don't know who I am you don't know what my name is when you were freaking out you knew my name was Joel just before which was odd you you usually can't pick it up but just before when you were a little bit out of sorts you knew my name and then that was odd and now you're you're back to more like yourself and you can't think of my name let's do it wow that was that was magnificent the whole damn thing Joel Stuart Taylor yeah when just a few seconds before you couldn't even think of the droll part that that is fantastic mother that is that's uh that's the first time you spit that out in a long time and yet you you spit a word out the other day that you hadn't used in years when I came up I brought you breakfast I was a little down and I said and you said so morose and I what talk about this you look sad you said you know Wow yeah you hadn't used morose in a long time yeah I yet then it's these damn pills like the work but I also yep so yeah and I don't want to use it for some reason but it's a nice word it's a good word I'm just amazed at your your ability to grasp right now and and and the fact that you did grasp morose yesterday or day before whenever it was it it it shows improvement in your cognition it really does I weird little things and it's all related to the pill it completely related to the pill really oh oh yeah I mean you're you're you're completely out of it when you don't have the pill that's when you do the pacing and go into the snit about you know not being home and having to get out of here and it's not our house and oh yeah you go into into Weirdsville but with the pill it it brings you right back it calms you down and it improves your cognition no doubt about it it's I I just miracle is the only word I keep coming up with this stupid miracle word but I'll tell you what it it's it does so you pick up my medicine or what what what happens with us well you've been taking a pill during a banal twice a day no free boy I have 19 months I'm guessing you know you get it with your breakfast and then you get it a bit before dinner - dinner time when I really don't know why I'm getting anything oh no you always know you're getting it and that's that's another you know weird thing is you always ask me what it is even though you've taken two a day for how many hundreds of days now you know every time you take it you don't know what it is your record button is definitely broken that that the pill does not help it does not help the record button but it's as far as your cognition and dealing with what still is in your memory it certainly does help it certainly does help it's a it's a night and day difference I mean you can't think when you're when the pill wears off you're not you're you just you can't even sit down right let alone that you know you can't even sit down let alone think you know it's it's very odd but now there you are fine you know and it you can even see it in your eyes the difference it's it's wild really as well I'm sure thankful for them that's for sure because if a person can't be content in here where can a person be content right all right yeah with the birds and and the beautiful trees it is it's just a wonderful place and it sure makes it easier when you like it I'll tell you that but I keep you know I've been recording all this stuff and I keep thinking you know I don't really want to make it public and whatever else because it's it's a private thing in whatever but everyday just like now again today I see this just miraculous unbelievable difference it makes life livable is what this pill does for us and there's so many people out there that could be getting helped from it like we are and they don't even know you know here it is it's a substance that comes out of the ground it's it's from marijuana and it and nobody knows about it and what it can do for Alzheimer's and the sundowning symptoms it's just incredible and people should know so I think I'm going to go back to making it public", "xodXswlIW5c": "banning then wrong smoking weed for me I apologize to eyewear stickers up with some leather truck and if I came it's have to work not

we are taking a look at a new to us capsule brand from the folks at get zen we are looking at their cannabis infused capsules today this is the high thc line where each capsule has 25 milligrams of thc uh for 750 milligrams in the total bottle uh like all of our wheats reviews we're not going to be doing all 750 milligrams at once we're going to be taking four capsules for a hundred milligrams uh and that is what we will base our review off of so i picked this up at a dispensary in long beach california uh for i believe uh with taxes included uh around about ninety dollars uh so pretty expensive for these 750 milligram capsules uh certainly on the upper end for what i've seen in the area uh so we've got some decent expectations for them uh and on their website they've got such wonderful boilerplate uh text as this let's let's give you a read here gitzen is on a mission to improve the quality of life for patients by manufacturing the highest quality of cannabis capsule and other cannabis products our goal is to bring honesty integrity and accountability to the cannabis market and change the way cannabis is perceived by the medical community in the general public how noble i'm sure they are uh fulfilling that mission uh with the absolute utmost zeal every day of their existence so uh let's get into the product review here uh here's our little bottle uh it's got some lab testing results on the bottom that doesn't really give us more than just the number there uh which actually comes out according to these lab testing results to about 821 milligrams 10 more than advertised there's one of these like little funky stickers that you can pull away to get more information than you occasionally see on these pill bottles oh and uh back here we just have uh the ingredients which uh is more elaborate than i would have thought and now i am seeing that this is actually um rso in here or at least as advertised this is uh not just any um thc distillate it is rso rick simpson oil doesn't really change things that much it's just a different extraction method uh let's get that sticker off and get to the promised effects of these pills which are high euphoria we shall see i'm realizing now i have no liquid in here with me so good old-fashioned dry swallow it is and here are capsules ah okay these are quite a bit different than what i have seen these are just little gelatin capsules but instead of like liquid filled there's a very dry amount of i guess rso there at the bottom uh just kind of splattered in there i'm not sure how well it's showing up on camera uh but it just looks like somebody just took a little dropper of some really sticky goo and put it in this capsule um not very appealing looking but you know uh you gotta do it one way so here we are here is again our 25 milligram capsule uh let's give it a try down the hatch it goes one and two no taste believe it or not other than the elegant capsule two all right that's half of what we're gonna be doing for this review we're gonna do all 100 i'm gonna take about i don't know uh 30 minutes to an hour or so before i try these next two but once i do about uh 90 minutes to two hours after i have my second half of this dose i will come right back here guys to give you those most important part about all of the reviews the wrap up thoughts are these get zen high thc capsules gonna get you high for that guys you'll just have to stick around and i'll be right back in just a bit thanks for watching welcome back to weeds guys it has been about two and a half hours since i had my first get zen capsule i was about to show you the logo again but i ripped the sticker off i can't do that uh and about what did i say two and a half hours inside my first probably about 90 minutes since i had the second two the other half of my dose and these capsules work pretty well they're good uh the rso oil in there will get you quite high i'm still pleasantly high two and a half hours later um i'm not sure however that they are worth the premium over some of the other capsules uh of a similar strength at a lower price or higher milligramage um uh so if they are cheaper at your dispensary or if they're the only ones capsules they have available and you like capsules these will certainly do the trick but i don't think that they are necessarily worth a premium over anything else if um if they got some buddies or some papa and barclays or whatever in there and there's you know cheaper than these you're fine using those uh but these get zen will certainly get the job done so i'm gonna give them a thumbs up but again it's kind of a qualified thumbs up uh these are good but you don't need to spend the extra expense if these are more expensive than any other at your dispensary anytime we give a thumbs up we like to give a little cherry on top a little something extra that is not weed related we can give a little recommendation of very simple quick easy one this week just finished or re-watching the 2012 uh movie killing them softly uh which is i think available on netflix the stream right now stars brad pitt uh was a legendary bomb the year it came out but it is a great great film pretty quick like 90 minutes to get through too uh super cynical super dark uh about um oh uh what is the movie about uh it's it's about [ __ ] you pay me that's what it's about i guess uh so check out killing them softly on netflix and if they're not too expensive check out get zen capsules the high thc especially if you like the capsules they'll get the job done and that guy's then is gonna do it for this cherry on top it's gonna do it for the review until we see you for our next one stay high more importantly stay healthy we'll see you then goodbye", "ZLpZxkFB2-8": "[Music] what is up my friends and welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary uh and on today's review I've got the spatula the wheat sworn spatula and the trusty jar of Nutella that means that we are reviewing something that does not have fat in it because THC and fat go hand-in-hand so we're reviewing today we are taking our third look I've reviewed two of these this type excuse-me of edible and past Oh or I guess you would call it an ingestible cuz it's not necessarily edible per se so we are taking a look at th C capsules medicinal softgels today this is our look at the pro canna THC plus hundred milligrams 250 milligrams soft gels as i said i've reviewed two caps in the past both of those were 300 milligrams one was pretty good the the if it was delta-9 yes the delta nine capsules were good I enjoyed them they were a little expensive I believe they cost thirty bucks for the 300 milligrams and then there was also I think it was the gold caps which were also 300 milligrams which were 50 bucks I believe and they were completely terrible they didn't do anything at all to me so I've got a hundred milligrams this time so less than the others but this was a more affordable price I guess linearly it's the same price as the delta nine as it was ten bucks for the two of the hundred milligram pack so you know it's the technically the same price but certainly a lot better price wise than the gold caps pretty simple little packaging here just a cardboard box with some you know directions there on the back advising that we consult a doctor before taking pro kanna don't know why doctor is capitalized there let's go and open up see what these look like uh-oh they are weirdly shaped so here we go here is one of the capsules right here in this little package they're ugly little capsule first let's do a little bit of the good old and Nutella my favorite part of all fat-free reviews is getting a nice scoopful a Nutella yum yum yum yum yum yum who doesn't love Nutella heartless folks that's him okay so that should hopefully be enough back for now and let's go ahead and plunk this in forgot to bring my handy trusty Arnold Palmer tea with me so I'm just gonna have to dry chuckle I swallow that's the word for it so let's do it three two one down the hatch got one more here three two one down the hatch okay well so I've had both the pillows now that's 100 milligrams of THC or so they say now in my body with the requisite amount of fat to help activate it now all we're gonna do is our for me I'm gonna wait two hours for you guys through the magic of editing it'll be just a couple of seconds and I'll let you know how these pro can uh THC caps are hitting in just about two hours so thanks for watching guys and I'll see you in just a bit peace [Music] alright guys I am back it has been two hours for me since I had the pro canna THC soft gels and let's do a little ocular test Whitis [ __ ] snow I don't know I want to let me say this right off the bat I want to love THC capsules I love the idea of them I love something that's discreet easy to take doesn't have any calories with it way of ingesting THC but these suck these didn't do anything for me I I mean it's I don't feel high at all nothing so in terms of what I have tried these are down there with gold caps they're not as good as the delta-9 obviously those got me at least you know somewhat high this is just a real [ __ ] product I don't know if it's on me oh and this time I also try it with fats I had had people in the bat before asked me like well maybe you need to try it with fat which I should have done anyways tried it with fat and still no result um I feel like I could you know if I was if I was a gymnast I feel like I could perform gymnastics if I was a mathematician I feel like I could perform some differential equations but I'm just a stupid idiot and I still feel like I can function as a stupid idiot even after two hours on the THC plus from poke pro canna man again guys I cannot articulate enough I would love for these to be the magic bullet you know an easy discreet portable way of getting THC with into your body that isn't either smoking vaping or having to consume something with a lot of sugar and calories I keep hoping for it I I don't think I'll be going back to pro kanna next time I have to review but I think I'm gonna keep trying to find that magic capsule out there to see if any of them work I'll do a couple more maybe maybe they're just not for me maybe there's something about mean that they just I just doesn't work as an ingestion method I would love to hear from you guys if you know any good capsule brands or if they work well for you please let me know leave a comment below or send me an email at wheats at wheats reviews.com and let me know what you think about these capsules because I'm trying to find a great one I'm hoping to find something that you know I can take with me to the airport something I can you know take with me into a concert you know that's not going to draw any attention to itself but so far of the three I've taken this I don't know if it's necessary worse than gold caps but it's not definitely not any better so far if you definitely want capsules stick with the Delta nine they're still not great they're still not my favorite way to ingest THC but definitely skip out on the procane a total dud of a product look at the [ __ ] back there that is the category that it's in and I am now just rambling so with that guys I am going to sign off from this review and that is going to do it for pro canna here on wheats thank you so much for watching guys and we will see you on our next review peace", "1sf4R6q1Ano": "[Music] the marijuana reviews show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking a look at a brand new product one that I'm not even a hundred percent sure what it is just yet uh and that is a new edible I think maybe a lozenge I'm not sure what is in here but what I'm talking today about is a level blends pro tab hybrid so I think the company's name is level or level blends all these things have really obscure names there's something that says level there and then it says level blends on the back calm and then it also says Pro tab hybrid I believe it is level blends and I think the product is there Pro tab hybrid something very curious about this is I picked this up at a legal now recreational dispensary here in Long Beach where I live uh but this is not a hundred milligram edible this is actually a 250 milligram a table it is 10 pro tabs whatever those are we're gonna find out together at 25 milligrams each I'm not sure exactly how they are getting away with this I I don't know it if this product is considered compliant with the regulations uh traditionally you can only have at most or at minimum ten servings and a hundred milligrams maximum so this again has 25 milligram servings and 250 milligrams total so I'm not sure how they're getting away with it I know there is a caveat for tinctures tinctures can go up to a thousand milligrams but this is not a tincture so I'm not really sure what they're doing to to bypass the law but I was excited to see it because I like high potency edibles and uh I like things that are small and discreet as well and this appears to be that in spades whatever it is so let's find out it's got a weird way to open it it's got kind of like an old-school like a CD sticker ething on it I'm gonna peel that oh cool it kind of peels in a interesting little pattern so that I'm gonna pull this down and did I do something yes ah okay batch numbers made numbers expires packed on a bunch of cool stuff there on the back okay it says a swallow Pro tab with liquid effects should be felt within 30 to 60 minutes so you know what that means guys it means I'm gonna pause I'll be right back I'm gonna go get some liquid I didn't know that requires I'm gonna go grab a cup of water see in a second I'm back I've got myself some water I am ready to find out what Pro tabs are if I can figure out how to open them I see two arrows pointing in opposite directions it's not really a good indication of how to open it okay wait there we go that's something whoa here we go they are little tabs they look like pills but they're not let's let's take one out uh yeah here they are they're like little aspirin II looking things don't really have an odor to speak of but they're little tablets not what I was expecting I was expecting maybe like one of those Lawson jizz or things that dissolve in your tongue not little pill things interesting so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna eat every one of these or swallow or whatever it is that you end up doing what Beast all 250 milligrams and then I'm gonna come back to you guys in about two hours to let you know how I'm feeling I'm really excited about this one I am very hopeful that this is gonna be a slam-dunk product because I would love love love for to finally have a pill form of THC that that works because all the capsules I've tried so far have been dog [ __ ] so we shall try the pro tabs from level blends here we go I just swallowed it I'm not sure if that's what I'm supposed to do um we're not swallow Pro tab with liquid effect should be felt within 30 to 60 minutes fair enough okay well I will swallow a couple more of these and then I'll wait a half an hour and swallow the rest of them there we go you have three more no case look there's kind of a wee taste when they go your tongue it is all very quickly I found out as soon as it that one hit my tongue it started to disintegrate and get kind of powdery and weedy tasting okay well pro tabs guys I am very very very hopeful that these are going to be a new product that I would love because I've been looking for something like this for a very long time so again this is the pro tab hybrid bi-level blends fingers crossed that this one is gonna be the pill that we've all been waiting for alright guys I will check back with you in two hours and rest assured I will finish these off between now and then and I'll let you know exactly how I'm feeling thanks for watching weeks see you soon I [Music] am indigestion let's start over that's bad let's do that more Jeff [Music] welcome to the Future guys the future of actually about three hours later just got out of a movie wild ass movie that knew Paul Feig comedy thriller thing I can't even remember the title the title of movies terrible a simple favor I think there might be a terrible title man what a weird movie that is I can't believe that's a major block a major motion picture almost that that somebody let that those movie stars in that movie happen no judgement what I am here to pass judgment on however is Pro tab hybrid a classic high amplifies your body and mind right there there 250 milligram Pro tabs and again the pro tabs and we're just little capsules just tiny little pill size excuse me not capsules just um the flattened pills I have no idea what that term is I know there's specific terms for each of the shapes and sizes but forgive me for not knowing this is not a oilfield thing and the verdict is gavel bang bang bang bang bang the verdict is this is without a doubt the best pill form of THC I have found yet that is not to say it is perfect I don't think it's a it doesn't feel as equivalent as some other 250 milligram anibal's maybe like it's you know but that's it's it's still good it's it's on the good and for a 215 milligram edible or I on the end of acceptable too good but in the form of having something that you can take in a pill form especially if you're taking lower doses than I am in being able to just pop one or two before a concert and before a lecture for all you kids in college you know whatever the case may be I quite like the pro tab I am I'm pretty pleased with it to be honest it's the first one that I will buy again I would buy this again for certain occasions again when I'm looking to take something maybe in a smaller dosage and something very discrete you could certainly just stick this at any kind of like pill bottle take it on an airplane don't take that advice for me never heard that but yeah it is just a little bit pricier than other edibles but that is in line with capsules although it's not as expensive nearly as expensive as some of the other capsules on this was 30 bucks at my dispensary there about plus or minus taxes which can be substantial in Long Beach but I did not feel at all ripped off by this not in the slightest again this is a pretty positive one for me I'm pretty happy with I [ __ ] I think I got the name wrong the whole time again I think it's level blends pro tab I'll look that up and the title will be right so that is gonna do it for this review here on weeds I don't think I'm gonna share with you guys a cherry on top I you know what I'm just gonna say that little rant I had about whatever the shitty title of that weird Paul Feig movie is a simple plan oh wait no no this is what I do that yeah this is the second part of the video well I'm higher than I thought yeah I don't have a cherry on top for you I I didn't I feel like you guys didn't deserve it this time um step it up you know you need to step up your game I'll step up mine I love you though peace from wheats booty love", "tDo8CUDA7Vo": "[Laughter] [Laughter] [Laughter] where others day are you [Laughter] [Laughter] their use for people that are trying to get like I Colin I call them death caps if you want a couple for your friend z8", "l7dP70VFo90": "site is going I can't even read my Twitter feed I [ __ ] these people I don't live if I don't put my glasses I don't know what the [ __ ] they're saying oh my people don't get depressing it actually I'm saying psychosis is a different thing okay okay I think we are discussing overall mental health yes I mean look I'm saying this because I really think that this is something that I've made a big turn over the last few years with myself that I don't quit bathroom break yes please go I don't think marijuana is as safe as I used to think it is I used to think it was benign I really used to think there was no big deal but I have a friend that I discussed the other day who was a really confident [ __ ] muscular a handsome man that never did anything and he took a marijuana edible to go to sleep and for two weeks this guy was like this is a different guy not that I was taught it's not Rafi no a different guy he took it and he experienced suicidal thoughts and and all these he had like severe consequences I think that the human beings we vary so much biologically that to just make this overall blanket statement of what's good for you is good for me is irresponsible and I've been irresponsible as saying that well one reason it's interesting what out reason I think that alcohol is so widely accepted despite all the problems it causes and again alcohol can certainly cause problems yeah is that alcohol affects most people pretty much the same way you know if and you sort of know if what somebody looks like when they have one drink when they have five drinks got some dress I've got some friends that get those gerbil eyes you ever see when they start talking crazy but you sort of know that and you sort of know how long it's gonna take to clear your body and you yes cannabis is so different it's a really complicated drug and it does affect different people in different yes and also the tolerance has changed yes so you know people say well two and a half milligrams of THC you vape it that's like one drink for somebody who you know who doesn't use but then if you if you're a tolerant user you can use 200 milligrams in a day that's 80 drinks it's a weird drug and then there's the issue of eating it yes when you eat it your body produces something called eleven hydrogen's on a tab alight it's a far more psycho action you were all along for the ride when that happens yes you are yes and it can take days for it to get out of your system I know many people have eaten marijuana edibles and then they call me up the next day like dude I'm still hot yeah yeah so so so I think I think the legalization community has sort of said for years like oh there's basically no downsides to this there's only upsides the cops will bus smokers they'll be tax revenue all these people have a way to get high that's clearly safer than alcohol and unfortunately that's just not true I think you're right and I think the the issue that people from what I've read are having with your book or people that are marijuana advocates that think that your position is unbalanced and that you've ignored the positive aspects of THC in terms of like what he was talking about cognitive benefits for people with psychotic episodes and that you were only focusing on the negative plead guilty today yeah because I think that for 20 years people have only heard the positive right eye I think that's I think that's also I'll plead guilty that myself because I think that I've only been discussing the positives and one of the things that I've tried very hard to do and one of the things I've learned how to do from doing this podcast and experiencing criticism and communicating with a bunch of different people with a lot of different viewpoints is examine my own positions and try to figure out am i coming at this from a truly balanced position or am i trying to support a conclusion that I started out with and I'm trying to you know somehow or another back up my own work or back up my own just my own statements and and and sort of prop them up instead of being really honest and objective right it's very difficult to do listen I wrote a book called tell your children that yeah about marijuana mental illness and violence you're I don't think you can you can think that that book is gonna be a compendium of the pros and cons above if you want to tell your children the truth though you really do want to tell them the pros and cons right and you did indicate Alex you said you know we should tell people the truth yeah in the book right so you know I think that when you're telling and you're saying that that you're telling the truth and Alex I'm agreeing with you that you're telling part of the truth right but part of the truth is you know a little bit deceiving and deceptive it in some ways right you want to tell the whole truth when you tell the whole truth then you give the whole story and then people can actually make you know a good informed decision based upon that like if people are going to just read one part of the story then of course they're going to make a decision just based upon that one part they're not going to make you know an informed decision based upon all of the price and because of that people are going to make you know some very poor choices I completely agree with that but to me the last 20 years have been an exercise in the other side in the legalization side doing a very very good job talking up its arguments and essentially there's there's almost nobody on the other side there's this one I bet what's got Jeff Sessions you had the [ __ ] goddamn attorney general that's telling people that good people don't smoke marijuana that's literally a quote yeah God that little morons not an office anymore but that's that's a terrible thing to say people don't smoke marijuana there's a lot of wonderful people who smoke - is not true and and and by the way I think this is a personal choice okay especially for adults yeah okay and and you can make bad personal choices you go look I play cards I'd love to play poker I'm said that on this trip to LA I didn't get to go to a poker room but you can go a new casino and you can see people of Los Angeles but you can go to a casino and see people who've lost their houses it doesn't mean that gambling should be illegal it also means that there's less and more dangerous forms that device in your hand where you can bet on what the next pitch is gonna be gonna be a ball or a strike yeah that's more dangerous than my having to drive to the commerce and play there and one hundred percent or 98 percent THC that an 18 year old vapes is a lot more dangerous than a 5 percent you know CBD 15 percent THC product the doctor heart might suggest his patient uses once a night to go to sleep but that that's the message that you know we should be putting out there right we shouldn't just be you know focusing on one side of the story like that part you know should also be you know and in the book and like you know your book you know in some ways has made me rethink the way that I write you know because my first book was co-authored with Jeremy cost and called friendly fire you know my second book that I'm writing now is called cannabis for PT G so it's how to transform post-traumatic stress into post-traumatic growth right because I feel that and you know we all know examples of people that have you encountered really difficult obstacles in their life and some people have you know succumb to that stress and they've gone down you know the wrong path kind of thing and then other people have used that stress to their advantage and they've actually become you know better because of it and you know CBD and THC can both help facilitate that process you know when you're looking at someone like like a veteran for example you know the hallmark of someone with PTSD is someone who doesn't leave their home and they can't sleep at night so like when I see a debt in my office a lot of the times they'll be leaving their home like five to ten days a month right so when you give them CBD and this is really important for people understand CBD has been shown to decrease learned fear that's incredible right so if you can get people outside of their home because I'm not talking about again you know someone who's you know too nervous to like go to a you know at the bar with like the friends or some like that I'm talking to people who like you know it's difficult for them to go to the grocery store just like pick up a few things so you know those are the type of people that I see in my practice with CBD is really excellent for that then when you look at you know the the nighttime component you know THC again is excellent for reducing nightmares that's been shown in studies and it was even shown with one pharmaceutical drug now blown again I don't really use now blown very much because it's only one cannabinoid and I do believe in the entourage effect and using all of the cannabinoids so I don't use that that much but that shows that she she can reduce nightmares and you know if you have you have you have PTSD I mean if you talk to someone who has PTSD and again this is this comes from a clinician support of you they will tell you I will try anything and that's the same way when you get with like you know the parents of kids who have see shoes all day nobody wants to see that yeah and like Alex you know if your kids you know ever started getting getting seizures which you know I hope I hope they don't because it's it's terrible you know what it can do to people but your when if that ever happened you know I would hope that you would consider you know CBD as a potential treatment I think she's not against that I think we have to be really clear as tension like CBD you know again CBD at all I don't know I don't think anybody is I think no one really is arguing except maybe the federal government in certain levels is arguing against CBD that's probably some pushback from the pharmaceutical industry the reality is CBD has proven to be at least as far as I've read very safe and very effective for a bunch of different disorders especially those that are about reducing and have it something do with inflammation or seizures yeah one of my good friends his son has developed seizures and CBD knocked it out just killed it this is very recently you know you're somebody who's you know who's a cannabis user you obviously know a lot of users why do you think it is that people you know in legal states where they can really express a preference they can go into a dispensary know exactly what they're buying why is it that they want such high potency THC product because they get used to it your tolerance develops it builds up you know every year we do this thing called sober October well we don't do any no drinking no no pot and then we do some sort of crazy challenge me and three of my buddies and when we do it what it's it's very interesting how your tolerance is radically reduced like I'll smoke pot at the end of that month and I'm like holy [ __ ] like I don't even know what I'm talking about in the mid-sentence and I'm just bullets creaked whereas you know now like I smoked a little weed last night did some stand-up had a great old time there's no issues with it at all but I'm used to it and if the weed that I smoked last I assume you don't smoke right I do not okay if you and me were together last night and I gave you a hit of my joint you'd be still there in the corner in the fetal position gone what and the [ __ ] is going on because the marijuana is ridiculously powerful but once you're accustomed to it once your body acclimates it's really not that big of a deal the problem is you you're dealing with a lot of habitual daily users and for those people like my friend Joey Diaz there's a video of him giving this other comedian how many milligrams of those stars of death Oh Tilly like when we give Owen what did he give oh I think just one he ruined his life and about 200 to 250 oh I made a video but the day changed Owens life like literally [ __ ] the guy's head up like he went outside he vanished he's gone yeah well I think I think there's a real argument to be made it's particularly with him well I was gonna make two points on that so you definitely can develop a tolerance yeah and I tell people all the time trying to take at least one three-week break but the evidence does show that if you stop for four weeks generally all your receptors return and it'll be like you've never used cannabis before yeah and that's even with people who are really really heavy users I can go back and get the study but I mean these people are you using I'm pretty sure it was like close like seven joints a day well really heavy users and noop dogs a good example of that you know my friend Tony Hinchcliffe his good buddies with Snoop Dogg and he said Snoop Dogg just smokes all day and he just like is always high and you know you're like well what do you do when you're not high he's like what I'm never not high so everything he does he is high as [ __ ] everything he does look for that guy it's not that big of a deal and for the way he lives his life like he's just a relaxed easygoing guy it's no problem you could be high all day and live his life and he's obviously wildly successful with this strategy yeah loudly second point I was gonna I was gonna make on that too though was there does not appear to be any tolerance at the cb2 receptor so she she attaches to the cb1 receptor and that's and that's where we know we can get tolerance you know some people you know they they have some pain they use some THC and sometimes they need a little bit more same sometimes asleep you know they use THC it'll work and then we'll stop working with CBD - we haven't seen that meaning like the people who you know get get seizure control generally they don't need to increase of dose like the girl I was talking about earlier you know I first subscriber I think when she was 20 and she was by him 20 she's 25 now she's never increased her dose and she's just used the same amount to CBD for the last think we should really stop talking about CBD I just wanted to make a note on the on the Italian someone I just want to make a note that CB to the doesn't appear to be tolerance it's all yeah it's just there's just such a significant impact when when it comes to especially edible THC it's a there's a significant impact on people's state of mind and it's not always good no that's just a fact we", "w6xIA7za9_w": "Hey what's going on everybody so right now we're we were making a video on how to make cannabis pills it's for people who don't want to smoke or vape it's a healthier way to take cannabis so we're here with the CEO of Spartan wellness riad bine and we're gonna go in and listen in as he explains about cannabis so if you guys want you can listen in watch and get any questions I'll do my best to get them answer for you and that's a great product along among all the other LPS are out there I'm on my cell phone as well sorry for shaking this here oh so that's that but before I make the all bill and we've talked about this there's another med relief product and it's actually extracted oil within the LP itself okay and so you can get your but you can get your medical marijuana either by dry but you still come in this and it comes in different sized containers ten gram 30 gram and so forth yes or you can get it here and it's what it is same thing you'll have a label on it and it tells who the prescribing doctor is who's the patient their grams per day and everything and what this is is this pre-made oil that we're going to give a quick demo on and it's got the the ratio is everything so TC in milligrams it's got CD in milligrams and those numbers represent what the actual compounds in the marijuana are and there's two main compounds that we always refer to and you and I have talked about it there's CBD right and CBD is a non psychoactive compound within medical cannabis so by taking it you're not gonna have that before or stoned feeling people refer to and then there's a THC which is the psychoactive one of the psychoactive compounds in medical cannabis and that's what gets you that stone feeling so you and I've talked about it quite a bit bill and you don't want to have that stone feeling Oh does that doesn't mean that perfectly yeah more or less pain relief like CBD as a source of so a CBD which is one of its greatest attributes and its qualities is it's an ant II ant in a natural anti-inflammatory so any kind of injuries you have is an inflammation of something so CBD is great at doing that it reduces inflammation it'll help you sleep better and you'll have an overall feeling of energy and just feeling better all around right so that comes in that and then we have the it's a video which is a CVD oil from Italy so Billy quick demo we're gonna do it so where I started off with is just to get ahead of the game I took the dried blood from this container and I put it through a process called D carving or decarburization and all decarburization is is that the compounds THC and CBD are not active when it comes in drive but once it's been drive drive and rock right okay so what we do is we put it to work we put it to some heat right in the oven what I do is I use mason jars there's many ways you can de car tour D carbolic see I use mason jars I keep the lid on and I keep the temperature around 200 to 10 depending on the stove okay and I leave it in there for a good two hours myself people they can put it you can put it a little higher I don't recommend using mason jars if you're going to use higher e 2 to 15 because the mason jars can become so what you're saying instead of getting baked you bake the wheat ya bake the we know what you're doing is you're prepping the wheat so that the actual compounds are active so the medicine in the actual medical cannabis is active okay so once you do that I do it for a couple hours in a mason jar so all I do is I take you know I have it open and I open it up and what I'll do is it gets a little sticky here once it's been in the heat a bit no suction just like mutters jam but you'll notice that when you look at Mother's Jane I've never smelt like this yeah no I can tell this Mother's Jam didn't smell like that no I don't think so make apple jam right or Partridge berry on that works yeah yeah so what we've done is if you look at the but it's a little browner it looks a little bit more it's not as green and flush as it was before what we've done is we've just put heat to it and it's what it's done is to remove the carbolic acid the Kubelik acid from the marijuana from the actual medical cannabis and what it's done is it's now rendered the THC and the CBD as active extractable medicine okay okay so I do that for a couple hours and you can see between the two jars I have 40 grams of Luminarium right and it's a very easy process after that but before I go into adding all the ingredients I'm gonna go over the ingredients and what I'll use okay so you're gonna hear a lot of people you can use any oil as a base for the extraction so you can actually extract the medicine from the actual medical cannabis and it's going to come into this oil through this machine the magic butter maker - I prefer to use brain octane MCT oil because it's around the sea which is the actual fats and the number represents how many are in the chain block rate and eight is what the brain octane is using see eat so with that kind of say hi to Shama oh hi Shawn so the the difference between that with using with using this kind of MCT oil it actually doesn't travel through the liver as much and it also gets absorbed quicker into your body okay and it actually creates you and it gives you a ketone state where you actually have more energy and it's not like in the sugar or not where you get the sugar high and down and it's it's not very effective for you whereas this kind of oil here it'll help you brain become a lot clearer you're gonna notice that you can be more cognitive you'll have a stronger cognitive ability and you'll just have more energy all around right and it's it's purely healthy for you very healthy for doing that and then the next one we use is sunflower soon right okay there's a lot of talk between the electrics in theirs so elections so a lot of people don't want to touch it because the soy its processed it's GMO or whatever but sunflower is actually a very pure form and the beauty about this is that it actually helps your body soften up your arteries and allows for better flow so over the time especially for soldiers and like Oscar black clock and all that stuff all our arteries and stuff get hurt and and everything especially people like us who have taken a lot of pharmaceutical messing medicines our body becomes a lot more rigid and tougher inside right yeah and I'm just talking more layman terms everybody but this the sufferer are less than what it does is it actually allows the medicine to get sorry question I'm sorry just there's a question yeah someone's asking how about coconut oil well coconut oil okay so I'll go back to this actually this brain octane is coconut oil okay it's MCT coconut oil coconut oil has gone through a huge health bust and basically everyone's been saying it's great for you and all that stuff but when it comes down to the processing within the body they call it long chain triglycerides versus medium chain triglycerides okay and you being a cook I don't understand that right so the less comp the less blocks within the chain and that number represents the easier it is to give in your system that's not right and this year has been very formulated it's a it's a higher price obviously it's for one liter sixty two dollars but it's worth the extra money because you are getting the best quality MCT coconut oil out there okay and then going back to sunflower the reason why it's so important within the within the process is because one it helps actually helps the medicine lasts longer within the capsule okay but it has great it has great health benefits artery control for blockages and stuff as well as blood pressure and all that kind of thing good things that come along with it so basically we add this with this while the machine is doing its thing right the process overall is pretty easy the d carbon itself like I said I do in two to three hours you can actually experts of things online Google and that where they'll tell you how to you know different ways of D carbon and deeper deeper relaxation removing the cover alack acid however I found that this is the cleanest way one of the biggest reasons to is cuz smell knows yes right it's capped you don't get that smell and the beauty of it is what's your D carb you have a sealed container your terpenes have been released terpenes are another medical profile of the medical cannabis which you which you and I have talked about quite a bit well the beauty about this is when it heats it'll rise just like as if you're pickling right right and then you just take it out of the oven and then you hear the pop and you'd okay everything's suck it right so now you can just open it up and you're not losing you know you're not releasing all the gases and everything yeah exactly it keeps all the medical profile so now we've got an open any hurt disruption because these are pretty fresh right so the way the Buttermaker works em - magic butter maker and - okay it's very simple comes with the bottom part and the top part this top parts where all the brains are okay so when you're actually handling the magic butter maker you want to make sure that you keep water and stuff and everything from this part here this is the thermostat and all that and then any electronics on the top right so use a damp cloth to wipe it down but you don't want to get it too too wet don't immerse immersed in water exactly just watch it yep and the same with the bottom as well cuz you know you got the plug in on the back right and that's that's where it's just the like general cleaning should be funded yes exactly and it actually has a clean feature where you drop a little bit of soap and some more more than warm water you run it and it'll do a clean process inside so it's actually pretty good so to to use the butter maker and I'm gonna move all this stuff down here because obviously we're carries not the best but all it is did you plug it in and there you go that's it and then to get it going and running you'll put the top off right and then you'll hear a beep okay just so everybody goes and then you can see the numbers flashing on top okay I'm gonna move it over to the camera there right on okay but I'm gonna get you just open up this form here absolutely and then I'll just do this one quickly brand-new one thing I will say about new fool and I never would have thought being home in Ottawa I struggle finding all the materials I need and it was real funny this morning Jamie and I walked into this is actually where he went or yeah we went into the natural health shop and she had everything and as soon as I had compiled everything she knew exactly what I was doing and she she wanted to learn more about Spartan Wallis and we told her and she actually used a bunch of our specialist cards and contact information so if you get a chance check out the natural health shop very very cool place Newfoundland humour and Newfoundland hospitality and they have everything you will need okay good so Billy all we're gonna do is move that camera there is you have filled lines in here okay this scene right yeah they got Max and min graduated fill lines yes there you go so with 40 grams of marijuana medical cannabis jamie has told me that he likes it to be a little more potent than normal he needs to vacation during the day to keep active and to get his mind clear and work out so what I'm gonna do is I'm actually only going to use five hundred mils half a liter of oil for this extraction okay so all it is you just pour it in great little line for the lines that it's five hundred mils right there okay and there you go and that's all that is and then you can store this again Jamie you don't need to keep this in the refrigerator that's the beauty about the MCT oil you can just put it in a cooler a cool darker place and it's good to go for the next time now with the with the sunflower that soup basically what they recommend is for every cup of oil right yeah use a tablespoon of a teaspoon of of the sunflower so you get 2 X so 2 cups is 2 cups and 5 uu 2 the other chef well what do I got to put in you're gonna put basically two tablespoons two tablespoons okay so what we do is we just fill up and you can see it comes out pretty uh you know there's one all right that's good water again installer well I'm not I'm not a chef like you right but then I just give it a little stir make sure everything's in there you can see it gets a little dark you know I've tried to put a little more in there just to see if there's a taste fact or anything and notice anything but I usually prefer I stick pretty close to a tablespoon or a teaspoon sorry every other every cup right so we can just put that in the sink over here and then that's it right and this is how simple this is why the magic Buttermaker and I'll show you just so you know exactly what it is this is why the magic Buttermaker is such a great appliance and it's not just medical cannibis right you can use this to extract anything you want it's got the temperatures here and everything and we'll go through that a second but it's a very multi-purpose appliance so it's not just for cannabis it can be used for many other types of extractions as well now a lot of people will say you know you don't need to be curved or they don't deeper they just put in the magic butter maker I prefer tea carving obviously quit prior to using the magic murdering magic butter maker there is a D carved it up because we will set a temperature okay right now there's several different options you have okay one is you can it says here oil one our option two - ours is butter and then tin ensure which is a form of using grain alcohol and then they've just got an eight-hour cycle right myself I prefer my medicine to be very well extracted as much as possible right so what we'll do for this one for this setting here is I always prefer to use eight hours okay right and I'll set this up and I'll run it through for eight hours total however a lot of people they'll just do one hour extraction or a two-hour extraction or even extraction right so the longer you go the more potent is going to be it's not so much the more poet the more the more the more available medicine you're going to be you're going to extract from the yeah but the machine is built to do like you know the maximum they can within the time lots at setting so really pushing it longer you know you've got the most extracted during the process that it's recommending right so what we do now is we have it like that and then all I do is I just pour the marijuana in now people probably look and they're saying he's never he didn't grind it up he left it whole I don't like grind it up simple fact is is when I grind up my marijuana my marason wonders hold that bill force absolute yeah when I grind up my medicine I'm actually you know you're taking out some of the trichomes and stuff right so I like just to keep it at all that's why I'll do the the the D curve a little longer because I want to make sure that I get all of it okay yeah the directions on the magic butter machine recommends that you don't bust it up yeah you should have bust it up I'll remove any kind of stems or anything from there because you obviously you don't need it but there's medical volume stems everybody like the plant as a whole has complete medical value right so here what we're going to do bill is we're gonna set the temperature so the recommended temperature for doing oil extractions okay yeah right it is 160 degrees Fahrenheit wait so I press it and then it gets to that middle line okay so you know you're on a temperature 116 I know I'm on the temperature of 160 degrees Fahrenheit I hate or 71 Celsius what they say now we can do a 1 hour 2 hour for hour 8 hour okay for the sake of the demo I'm gonna this is Jamie's medicine so I'm gonna actually run it for the full eight hours yes okay and all you do is you press now everybody get ready because this gets pretty exciting it's a lot of noise a lot of likes you're at the nightclub you ready and that's fitting for medical marijuana boom alright now we'll watch it it'll light up it'll do some things but that's it alright it'll do its thing so what's happening internally is it's creating the heat right surveying this go exactly yeah it's creating the heat and once it's going to do is it's going to spin it may squeaks you saw the little blades inside and it will go through an eight-hour extraction process so it's all programmed pre-programmed it's really you push and leave it does make a little bit of noise hopefully we'll hear it when it starts but the smell actually there's very minimal smell so this is something you can get up in the morning do your D carb have it ready by noon go out for the afternoon come back for supper within eight hours you have fresh oil okay so we're gonna let that sit on the side right now and we're gonna let it do its thing what I do have here though is the pills okay now we've prefilled a bunch of pills with some oil that we already had pre-made and this is very simple so you can get these type of pill copy machines they come in different varieties different ways this is the one we picked up today here in Newfoundland it's actually a very it's a very manual but very easy installation so basically what you're gonna do is you would take the pill and I'll show you open the pocket obviously and like I said this is a real quick and dirty demo it's not a full bore we will be producing one soon but if you look at the cap it comes with the bottom part and the top part okay Mon apart is the long part and the top part of a short it is and it's a little bigger right so essentially what you would do with this this cap here is you would take this cap and it would go in there okay right you see how it sits flat right then what you gonna do is what you do is you take a dropper right and we'll use this dropper here because that's what Jamie will use but we can use this oil just to show how it caps we take this and we just drop it in there like that and we fill it up okay and we make sure it gets filled to the top because each cap is roughly 700 million milligrams of liquid okay and it can get a little messy and whatnot then what you do is you just move these away it slides down and you can see the cap is fully exposed and I did have my top here I just put it yeah yeah I did that's the problem they're clear right so well that's no problem open it up no no okay so what you're gonna do is with this kind of capping machine with the manual you just put it on top as such all right and you just push down you have a seal cap with CBD pill okay and that's really it in a nutshell it's not a very hard process this is gonna cook now for eight hours okay and once it's done Jamie's gonna actually what what you'll do is once it's done he lets it cool down for an hour so and then from there he's gonna take it he's actually gonna extract the oil and basically what he'll do is he'll hold this over a ball right you'll pour the oil into this into a bull squeeze it and whatever you to extract it a little bit of oil in there you'll get some rigid residual plant from actually drying them in the container here my night medicine when I make it I actually leave a little bit of the residual plant I go through it fast enough so I have to worry about any kind of things happening but I just like getting the full body medicine the day time I go for as clear as possible so for example you don't mind it was a little bit of plant material into camp no because yeah it's plant material you don't want to keep capsules lying around for like two or three months with the plant material and all that exact and yet well you know from cooking and whatnot right but it's but for the if you're using it fast enough it doesn't really matter and and and all parts of the medical cannabis plant is right I didn't many different levels so we're gonna let this go I know it was short and dirty okay there's going to be a much better video coming out soon probably middle July end of July and it'll be from the spy Ramona's side but you know I thank everybody for joining us and if you have any questions Jimmy does anybody have any questions or none you venture them so far have I okay good and there's a lot more scientific data a lot of more scientific terminology we could use I just tried to keep it simple for today but the big two things take away from it is is that there's two types of marijuana plants strains that are mainstream which is indica and sativa which we've talked about yes yeah and sativa gives you more of a year for a euphoric energy type high on the THC side and the CBD side as well it'll give you a little more energy upbeat whereas the indica is more to help you rest and go to sleep and and so forth okay Melissa would like to know where can I get capsules to make myself perhaps us to make yourself okay so if you are a new flan right and you are in st. John's we picked them up today at the natural health shop okay you can't order them online if you go them online they are a little cheaper right well dot CAS at one location where you can go and get you can order online Billy and it's a lot cheaper it takes about a week or so to get shipped so make sure you in between you have enough supply exactly right and I will go over the size of cap we're using is double zero you can get them in well there's two main ones zero and double zero double zero is a little bigger and like I said it holds roughly 700 milligrams of liquid liquid medicine right as far as dosing and stuff like that we're using 40 grams for this one it all depends on what you want to do and what you want to get from your medicine right so you can use less medicine more medicine with half a liter Jamie's gonna get about about 300 to 400 pills so yes good he's good for a month right for what for his uptake and stuff that's good for the month right Billy same thing you're gonna be mostly using CBD oil but now when do you do it but like I said you'll either get it from you can get it direct in the bottle from the LP which is a great a great easy way for you to do it however I will say this med relief they use the sunflower type base oil tip so for some people there might be some stomach issues they might not like it they might not feel react well there's many other LPS out there they might use medium chain triglyceride oil just like like that one they're bulletproof coconut oil so it's just a matter of when you come to Spartan and you ask and we're helping you with your your laces producer selection like you and I did today yeah you know we'll give you the guidance you need on that side a lot as well as the medicine that you want to take and use I found a really helpful they you guys we're not just trying to push one particular company on somebody which is which is kind of what the world is about like in the sales pitch you're trying to show you one one brand one specific brand about seven suppliers they're eight yeah well we're dealing with all the LPS you know we don't believe that the patient has to you know our motto is is we you know we're doing what we do to help the patient help the Canadians help veterans help first responders and the last thing they need to do is now have to go and do extra research on where they have to go to get the message you know listen it's a good thing to do it though personally you know research find out what's out there come try to prepare yourself educate yourself but you know the thing is is keeping the autonomy we have is has been very beneficial for the patient more so than anybody else Dave said Dave Wilson says he gets capsules on Amazon they're shipped from China takes longer to arrive but he get some good price against Mark Sheppard says he gets a natural health shop st. John's calm yeah that's that's that's the one right there there so you know that the thing is is you can find that there is that this is one brand of many many many they're all over the place you can order them on Amazon you can order Armand well ca personally I use wild CA they've been good for me they are considerably cheaper I believe you can get for around 22 bucks maybe $25 you can get 750 double zero caps these are the actual vegetable vet veggie caps okay there's the gel caps and the veggie caps veggie caps are more expensive apparently they're healthier because it made from vegetable oil extract exactly some of the other ones might have collagen or collagen is derived from an animal so yeah right so you know so these capsules I guess I could say I'm getting my vegetables injury right yes they're not broccoli Jamie but you know these are clothes a little capsule soup yeah there you go there you go Billy do you have any questions you want to ask oh I actually and I'm actually happy to come here today the way you guys talk to to process Jamie and yourself and is amazing you make it so simple and somebody like me I've never never ever used marijuana before it's not was never my thing well now I'm interested in it for the CBD pain aspect but you guys been more than helpful you've been amazing no problem so just if everybody knows about Kennedy's watching okay just so everybody knows oh there we go so go [Music] your buddy yeah it's white noise really and it'll do that throughout as well in our cycle and once it's done there is a few of us that will actually run it twice we'll run it again through another cycle and really it becomes a personal preference and that's the beauty about medical cannabis is is that with the right education the right guidance you can actually optimize your actual medication intake and that makes a big difference other than using pharmaceuticals and whatnot right we're Spartan Wellness I'm here with Billy mcCormick Jimmy a coroner

cousin to try people say", "AC9An_sZcWI": "hi guys my name is Demi and I'm from in Dhaka and today we're gonna talk about CBD capsules so what are some of the benefits and what are some of the negatives of using CBD capsules let's talk about the positives first so obviously CBD capsules are very very easy and travel friendly in the sense that you can bring them pretty much everywhere and they're not gonna spill they're not gonna take up too much space in your luggage they're really really really really easy to incorporate into a daily routine which brings me on to my second point which is CBD capsules is the best way to normalize CBD extracts and cannabis extracts what do I mean by this in the sense of in the mornings when people wake up and they take their multivitamin tablet they might take their iron tablet the idea of being able to take a CBD tablet or a CBD capsule as well is the closest thing we have to normalizing cannabis use the captures themselves are made mainly from vegetable cellulose meaning that there are a hundred percent natural inside is the whole plant CBD extract now why is this important because not only do you get the whole plant extract benefits you also get it taste free now taste is probably the biggest hurdle people come across when they start using CBD extracts and it's something that's kind of unavoidable if you do want that fantastic whole plant compound with all the beautiful flavonoids and terpenoids and all the other cannabinoids inside like we said flavor is a big thing for people when it comes to CBD extracts which is why capsules are so game-changing because they allow you to take whole plant CBD extract in a totally tasteless form really really simple great for kids it's just a really simple and easy way to take CBD extracts what's another benefit another benefit is roughly speaking is localized CB CBD absorption what does that mean so different products get absorbed in different parts of the body depending on how the form is structured in the sense that CBD crystals most the time you will vaporize or obviously you can eat them in edibles CBD extracts such as always in paste you put under the tongue let them absorb for 60 seconds most of the time and then you swallow them CBD capsules are a bit different as the absorption doesn't begin under the tongue therefore our gel caps have made it so that they bypass the stomach acids which is very corrosive and can destroy a lot of the CBD and actually starts to get absorbed into the lower intestine or the intestines in general so why is that important the people that are dealing with symptoms that may be a local as the lower part of the body or below the navel CBD capsules can actually they make sure that the CBD is first absorbed into that part of the body meaning that if you have intestinal issues or there are symptoms that you want to deal with within your intestines with your stomach CBD capsules can actually provide a really low-class way of getting CBD to the area that you want it to be so he's spoken about some of the positives of CBD capsules or what about some of the negatives now there's not many but the few that there are are quite important to understand number one is the absorption now the absorption of CBD capsules is by far the lowest set of all seaweed extract products why is that because as you probably would have noticed most of the oral consumption forms of CBD is left under the tongue for at least 60 seconds the reason for that being is that under the tongue is the most bioavailable part of our body meaning that the CBD has a direct line from inside our bodies to our bloodstream with the capsules it's not that simple with the capsules we rely on our intestines absorbing the CBD now even though the gel caps are made to bypass the stomach and the stomach acids and therefore minimizing - ippity lost at the end of the day it is still absorbed into the digestive system that means that there will be CBD that is lost when you're using it in capsule form going on from that CBD capsules and the least effective way to absorb CBD it also means that the money are spending on the products and CBD capsules they're probably better off being spent on a product that can be absorbed under the tongue or haled or used as a suppository because at the end of the day with the way things are currently CBD extracts will be very expensive therefore you want to make sure that you're absorbing the maximum amount of CBD possible when you do take your extracts so another negative which is actually also a positive depending on how you want to look at it is precise dosing so for some people they just want to know okay I'm taking you 10 milligrams of CBD every day with my capsules I'm taking 50 milligrams of CBD every day with my capsules fantastic it's simple and straight forward every single capture will have the same mana CBD inside that can be a positive you can also be a negative if you want to up to trait and see what a man of CBD works best for you if you start taking a 50 milligram capsule of CBD and you feel great amazing but perhaps you would actually just feel just as good taking 50 milligrams of CBD therefore you could actually make the CBD you have last longer and if we spend less money on the product so the CBD capsules do have a lot of positives but there are some negatives to consider as well I hope I've shed some light on CBD capsules some of the positives some of the negatives if you have any other questions please don't hesitate to reach out to us on social media or contact our dedicated customer service team info adding Dokic com see you for the next video bye", "ngkfa-zRL1s": "hello my name is Gary and I'm going to be sharing information about how I make my medicine how I make specifically the cannabinoid acid molecule medicine that is built around thca and CBD a1 so you take any raw marijuana cannabis bud and within it it contains ta CA and CB da the acid molecules before the marijuana plant is heated or carboxyl iced the acid molecule is intact and then when it's heated or dried it breaks off and it becomes THC and CBD and of course the TAC is psychoactive and so consuming the raw bud doesn't produce any kind of side effects associated with altering your your awareness or impairing you in any way but I am taking a specific regimen of THC a and CBD a as well as CBD and THC to maintain my own health as well as to actualize the benefits that the acid cannabinoids have that are totally different than the the other properties that are commonly known with respect to CBD and THC so first of all you have to have you have to get the product and so I'm going to be showing you how to make capsules which is the best way to ingest it or you can just take the the raw cannabis and mix in the yogurt or put it on your cereal there's other different ways and so I'm just going to demonstrate how I make 100 capsules double up capsules with a capsule machine that you can that anybody can find online from Amazon and I'll be demonstrating how the Machine and capsule works as well as how to prepare the raw plant material so just justify Stu say that there is a specific formulation that is helpful to aim for you wanted to have equal parts if possible of CB da and THCA don't worry about the acid molecule or the designation the difference between THC and THC a or CBD and CBD a in the raw form it is all an acid molecule so so just look for what is the percentages of each now typically what's available especially over here in Washington state where recreational marijuana is is the most popular product and where most of the industry is focused on the medical end if you can find a CBD bud that's high in CBD and with a percentage of ten percent or higher than that's get you in the ballpark it's really easy to find THC that's ten percent of higher it's harder to find the CBD but I've been able to find the CBD in an eighteen 0.74% and a specific product and this is a roll joint a 1 gram roll joint that is made from the actual bud itself this is raw pot typically a person would smoke this but we're not doing any smoking we're going to be ingesting this so I'll be I'll be showing you how I take these and crumpled them up and retrieve the the marijuana in this and then also looking at how we kind of bring together the formulation so while this product only has 18% CBD a in it or CBD it only has a minut amount of THC and so I've focused to primarily get my quantity of CBD bud through getting these 1 gram joints and so the the the beginning of this formulation is going to be looking at creating the substance to put in the capsule so we have to grind it up we can't use any machine or processor for doing this because that creates heat and that unleashes sets free the acid molecule and then it can become intoxicating so we want to do this all by hand for the most part I'll demonstrate all that in this video ok so here we are again I just want to say a couple things to get make clear we're going to be making capsules we're going to be blending two different kinds of raw cannabis primary source of the CBD acid molecule will be CBD joints these are one gram joints and then the source of the the THC THC acid molecule will be the standard smoking hi bud stuff you can buy at any any store this has a twenty one point six percent THC and this has eighteen point seven four percent CBD which is close enough as a one to one ratio so I'm going to be mixing up the two of them to make the compound that's balanced and then I'm going to be installing them into capsules and I'll demonstrate how that happens but first let me just say that if you're going to be making 100 double zero capsules you're going to be using about an ounce of material and so 23 twenties me 28 grams is an ounce and so you can buy 13 CBD joints and a half of an ounce to make one ounce however you want to arrange it I'm just going to mix this all up and so I'm going to begin demonstrating now how to crush the but in a way that doesn't activate the THC and also extract the material from the joints so that we can mix it all together and get ready to demonstrate how material is then put into the capsules so more about that as we go so I'm demonstrating now how to take the to extract the plant material from the joint you just break it basically and just shake all the little stuff out now these joints are just rolled up in cigarette paper and you can just simply unravel the the end that you light begin just to kind of deal all the stuff out now the material the plant material that's in these joints are pretty well ground up already we're going to put it with them through another cycle of how we're going to refine the products so that it goes into the capsules well we don't want any big hunks or seeds or stems or anything like that because we won't get a consistent product where we're after about we're after six capsules equal equaling a gram material so we want to make sure that we get it so there we have it now we have to do this to that so if you are using a half an ounce of the CBD joints then you'll be doing fourteen joints I'm going to do all 28 and then I'm going to do the whole ounce of the THC and then we'll blend it all together and you'll see how how that then works out to be installed into the capsule machine okay I'm going to show you a quicker way so once you learn to understand the principle behind getting all the material out of the joint you can just use pair of scissors and just cut it right down the center of it trying to not mess up the paper too much so you're not trying to you don't put any paper in your capsules so there we go it's easy doesn't take my son as much quicker than trying to empty them out each individual at a time so okay I got my last one here and I'll be done and so just keep in mind your aerial get kind of messy here with all the plant stuffs just flying around a little bit so you'll have to clean up after yourself and you get some some of the stuff on your table just scoot it into your bowl and so I just want you to be able to see I don't know if you can see there's some that but there is quite a few let's see if I can get this out here I don't know that you can see this anyway it's quite clumpy still and so we're going to we're gonna put that through the process of get in nice and fine so I'll demonstrate how that works so basically what we're going to do is we're going to put all the product that we create through a strainer like this and we're just going to pour the material into the grid and then I see a piece of paper already so this stuff this swirl around and just lightly press against the against the wire great and some of the clumps will start loosening up that's really key to getting the best quality of a capsule because you want to be able to evenly pack each capsule and if there's a lot of clumps then things won't don't happen very easily so as you can see right now I've gotten quite a bit of of the powder through but we still have quite a bit of solid material it has to be ground up this too clumpy for the actual capsules themselves so now I've got this ground up this is all the material from the joints so as you can see it's pretty clumpy here and so we're really grinding now so you want to you want to twist it with your fingers and your thumb just kind of get as much grinding out of it clumps of it as possible and finding some more of the joint paper that I have to pull out okay so after you get it down to as bad as far as you feel like you can get it just by using pressure like this what we'll do is well we'll find that the actual buds will even have more of this that we'll want to be working with as you as you can see here this is very very fine very very fine so this is exactly the consistency that we want and the next job will be to take the the more coarser bud that we have here and it's it's going to also have to go through this strainer okay and then I start the process for going ahead and I've got the bud now pull that in the strainer and you and I get the whole ounce there all right there we go as you can see it's quite coarse so this is what I'm gonna do first I'm gonna be just run it between my forefinger just like that and my thumb and just be careful not to let any of the big stuff pop in your bowl so we're just we're just doing it like the best we can in a general way just to crush the bud and as you can see there's lots of stems and so those will have to be taken out as we go because there we're not going to crush those into by and powder because the stems really don't have any of the cannabinoids that concentration is sufficient to really make it really enhancing the final product but as you go you can pull those obvious stems out there in the way so this is going to take me a while to do but once I get it going we'll come back and you'll see how we do the final preparation for the plant material that will move into the capsule machine just a bit okay so now I've gotten all 2 ounces all ground down to just this much I've got it down to mostly just the stems now I don't see a lot of material there that could Lily I'm afraid if I grind this up I'm just gonna be grinding up four stems and that's not really gonna be adding to the quality of the product so I'm gonna call it quits about now and as you can see I reduced I might have a grammar to I'll probably a little bit more than a grammar to of waste but that's what happens when you buy bud that there you get some of the stems in there when you buy the joints it's already gone through this process just not as fine and that's why we have to run it through the strainer before we go through it okay I think I'm done now all right so now what I want to do is go over the basics of the capsule machine so your capsule machine kit will consist of a variety of different parts and so the instructions with your capital capsule machine will give you how to do everything and you may or may not want to do everything that they want you to do so the first thing that they ask you to do is to load what would be the bottom cap and so what I do is I label so I know the bottom cap that's just this is going to take your capsule and let me just show you the with distinction so once again this is a double zero double lot a capsule maker and you'll have to buy the double lock capsules now buy the capsules online there may be made out of beef gelatin if you're vegan then you want to get capsules from the health food store so you don't have any animal products in it but here's the capsule there's two parts there's the bottom part and then the top part fits on top so the bottom part all of the capsules you can put them in one at a time if you want or you have this attachment place this on here and you just pour your capsules on there and they'll find their way now so I'm going upside-down obviously but it's pretty easy to retrieve them you just if it's upside-down you just take take one of these things and put them down it'll pull up the wrong side in and you just fix it but or you can just do them one at a time either way so I've already loaded the bottom capsules into this part of the machine the other parts of the machine now this is this is also used for loading the top capsules and so you have two other parts that are for the top capsule you have the the bottom half which receives the bottom half capsule so or then where to go there's so this little capsule will go into the bottom part and it's going to stick up a little bit and so you're going to want to put all the capsules spot or the tops in there and and in order to do this we're going to have a little help with once again this is part of the machine it's gonna fit over this and then you're just gonna take your capsule ba it's hops like I have here and just pour it into the Machine like that already some of them jumped in there some of them a up be upside down or not it doesn't matter just kind of get them going see what you see where they fall it's just a quick way now the ones are upside down up this way to get it out is to take a cap and just put it on top of it and it'll pull it out okay so we've poured the plant material onto the capsule machine and now we're just going to spread it out and just make sure it all those and evenly distributed over all the holes and they'll fill in and you just make sure it goes everywhere and there's you know this is a manual labor here but I mean I used to pack these capsules one at a time manually this just taking the bud and just trying to pack it into each individual capsule so once you once you feel like you have pretty much covered everything and you packed down as much as you like so so then we're gonna tamp it down so you can just leave that turtle there so here I'm going to tamp this down this just packs to each capsule so you just line it up in the center of majority of them and just press as you can see where you now have more room and so you continue to spread the material around and you'll do this portion several times okay I've gone ahead and finished packing as much of the plant material that I can in the in the bottom capsules so I'll take the fence off now here's the top capsules and this is the top cat cover and notice it's a little wider opening there so the top of the capsules are pointed down so we have to put this on top in order to apply the tops to fit over the bottom so there's there's a pilot screws that make that alignment possible and then once you have it aligned it's a matter of applying pressure like this they're that simple you heard it happen and it's completely together now take this off voila there you have it 100 capsules of CBD a and THC a so I take two capsules three times a day and it's best to take it with something that's fatty instead of just water take it with food as best you can sprinkle it over you yogurt or over your cereal I just have little fat in your diet because these are fat soluble and not water-soluble also in addition to this for me I take three times a day attend sure this is a twenty to one CBD to THC Tincher it it has such a low amount of THC there's no possible way a person would have any effects this has point three milligrams of THC typically it takes ten milligrams of THC for a person to be psycho activated five mega grams to ten milligrams depending upon a person's experience but 0.3 of T C is insufficient so I take to these dropper foals in order to get 10 milligrams of CBD this is not the acid molecule this is the CBD that's specially formulated and it has a little bit of THC so that it gives it's what's called an entourage effect I also of course take some THC in the form of fika which is full extract cannabis oil something that I also have to make and it's high THC as for my prevention of my cancer returning and most people who do this routine also would be benefited by a small amount of THC so I'm not recommending this to anybody this is just a protocol that I'm using because of the health benefits and as I've mentioned I've I've I've acknowledged that my memory is so much better they don't have a inflammation in my body it really has benefit for helping balance and even out all the all the processes within the body so it'd be something that you might want to check it check check in - in addition to taking this every day I noticed that when I've stopped taking the raw cannabis the benefits begin to wane and so you need to keep it up in order to maintain the benefits that you are feeling from from having ingesting the acid molecule of the Indo can of the cannabinoids the acid molecule of the cannabinoids so I hope this helps you understand the process for making the capsules and and not to worry you can take these anytime and not have any experience of being altered so enjoy CBD a is the CBD co pounds precursor just like THC a turns to THC when heated or aged CBD a D carboxylates to CBD found in raw cannabis CBD a can provide abundant health benefits thanks to its natural anti proliferative antioxidant antibacterial anti-inflammatory properties ta cas effects and benefits are there it's anti-inflammatory properties for the treatment of arthritis and lupus neuropathy a neuro protective properties for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and anti anemic properties for the treatment of nausea and appetite loss anti proliferative properties noted in studies of prostate cancer breast cancer THC a decreases inflammation physical pain and neuropathy pain CBD a is also been studied and they impact on cancer and other illnesses such as Crohn's disease and so with all of these benefits that are possible with the introduction of raw cannabis it seems that it's a no brainer just to continue to safeguard our a whole system's health by adding these supplements to our regimen of other vitamins and minerals and things that we take such as probiotics alright", "2MAQJidqxFA": "what's up everybody welcome to the channel today we're gonna be making cannabis pills using Keef so let's get into it [Music] so the first tell you what to do is measure out so gravity now as I'll put the kief in a mason jar a little put this in other words for a minimum of 30 minutes [Music] [Music] take a paper cut [Music] something to do stew - just transferred a 1000 [Music] [Music]", "Wy8J5LSQhvY": "hey guys in this video I'm gonna be talking about the probe account CVD capsules and reviewing them because well let's face it I've never seen them before coming up hey guys welcome back to the US we world so in this video I am gonna be discussing the oral CVD capsules from Provo Kahne I've done a bunch of CVD videos before I've done some unlike CBD oil CBD gummies like CBD CBD soda drinks and stuff like that so I've never before seen capsule CVD capsules now the idea for this obviously is I if you don't like to taste the oil then you can always put a capsule in your mouth and just have some water and just really have your CBD that way now one of the things we used to do is we had CBD gummies that we take for a lot of the time and we take a CBD every single day but sometimes the gummies you know we don't always get exactly the same time every time and there's some always may be confusion with the gummies so the awesome people are Provo can reached out to me I sit down would you want to review some of these capsules because I just show an interest in wanting to talk and talk about and learn a bit more about CBD capsules because I've mainly only done oil and gummies before so I really wanted to do so many oil now I did a review of the Provo can the CBD lozenges for like when you've got like a cold sore throat or if you're feeling a bit under the weather and the wasn't is really cool they look really really good and they tasted amazing we actually use those now in the house as like emergencies like I said it's got a sore throat off you're feeling under the weather but like let's get the probe can like you know lozenges out so yeah so we basically have those on standby every time anybody gets a little bit sick in the house so yeah but one of the things that we found is that and we've with the gummies as well they leave like a residue Lee taste in your mouth and with the oil is residue taste in your mouth and most of the CVD products leave like a CVD taste in your mouth and I said well why don't we mix it into like juices and green juices and stuff like that and so we tried doing that but again I'll use just almost like a very earthy taste in your mouth because CVD is quite an interesting taste so I was thinking well what if we had it like a capsule form and then from a comma like we do them so they like to set me always up and I love this little box that got a cool thing it's like a tiny little square box I think it's cute as heck this thing could stack really easily in your cupboard and I love the packaging of it this thing is so just like a neutral there's nothing crazy on it so this is the fact the CBD capsules 200 and so the 720 milligrams of CBD in here 30 capsules and there's 24 milligrams per capsule there with a net weight of 17 grams so I mean says 24 milligrams of CBD per capsule as 30 capsules anew so you just have one a day you've got a full month's supply in here all the links of these will be in the description below because if you want to get your hands on your very own CBD capsules then you can do so like I said pretty simple packaging I like the fact that this is cardboard this is recyclable I like it guys and this is also plastic super recyclable I love it okay so these are the capsules they come in this like awesome capsule box that says dosage daily dosage says take one to two capsules on an empty stomach for 30 minutes before eating do not exceed 200 milligrams a day so you could take two a day if you really wanted to I mean mostly the time I take CBD so I don't feel as anxious during the day I know a lot of people take CVD for doing things if they want to relax so they feel more anxious or they may have swelling anyone to use anti-inflammatory because CBD does all those things actually does anti-inflammatory and it actually helps with anxiety it does a bunch of different things and it's an all-around well-being supplement just for the human body so this one for me how I would take it I would take one in the morning just up with the day's anxiety which is what I take the other CBD for so let's open this and have a look so oh okay so exist but the tablets are very interesting indeed they're like brownie green apples are gonna take a close-up shot of this for you guys but as you can see these ones are like a brownie cream as you can see inside there and then very very dark and I find that quite interesting actually but it's not surprising considering they are made out of CBD and they're quite big actually let's take another look okay so here is one of the tablets that quite big I guess I don't even see how big that is compared to my hand and I'm just gonna show you on my close-up come here how big this thing is and it's quite big I'm not gonna lie that's quite an intimidating size but for the amount of CBD isn't it then I'm guessing that's obvious and these are actually boiled filled caps I think they're the I think you can see that there's oil inside these I'm not so sure I can't tell in what form the CVD is inside these but it's very clever because this is just sitting there just being awesome I I just I love it so to me I would take these in the morning with my normal supplements and then it's done because one of the things is if you don't like taking something like me I don't like taking someone some pills all the time because I feel like you know when you add them all up and then you take them on this time and that's only if take medication with it you like oh my god I've got all these pills but it's actually not too bad I mean take them all together so yeah I just click them all in together so I play would take this with all my other ones but it's not too big it's not scare really big it's not it's not like oh my god there's a too big is I'm gonna fit down my throat well that's never gonna happen I'm actually taking this is like its standard standard like pill size so if you got a doctor and I give you pills as a standard pill size you know it's like a cigar shape that just slides down throu really easy and you know what I think it's awesome okay they smelled just like CBD just as like good old CBD smell very earthy as well but I mean to me this is a cute little thing you know look at that little tiny box very discreet why probably can't see what he captures cool pop is in your bag poppies ends like yeah your toiletry bag for them in your handbag for your backpack if you're going on holiday if you just travel in for the day you take these with you super easy and they can cool noise you can make like a cool maraca out of them button off all honesty guys I think this is very cool I think this is like a way forward for CVD intake as well I think you not wanted to you know this is one of the things I have an issue with is when you have the oil you trying to dip the oil into you know your mouth and then you're you're trying to drip it in and get the right amount in and it's very ambiguous to find out how much is going on to the pipette and how much is going up seen your mouth and are you getting it right and yeah yeah there and you know you can miss and if you cannot see you know in a mirror there's loads of things that could go wrong but if you have a small pill and you go looking clunk I'll just take the pill in the morning with you know fitments for my breakfast and I'm done for the day and I feel like worried about trying to put oil into my my authority all done is taken all the ease of actually taking CVD into a whole new level I find that capsules are always best I remember I was taking vitamin C supplements a to take them and see sometimes when you mix it in water and you click it down okay about women see but that was women C supplements where you just take this tablet it's quite a big phallus actually bigger than this one and I think that every morning because it's so much easier so to me it's like this what are you gonna trade off are you gonna trade off convenience over like anything else yeah because the convenience of this is very simple just an average size tablet that you just take with you you plunk it in your back pocket whenever you want take it very much with ease in the morning and it's done it's got a good storage instructions well obviously you keep the lid on and keep it in a dry place don't actually keep this thing of water I guess they'll dissolve if they get kind of sweaty it's typical of like what you expect from kind of like a CVD brand make there's also an address and a and an email address on the back so you can definitely get in touch with a company if you have any kind of concerns about the products or anything like that one thing I will say is that if you do consider taking CBD or any kind of supplement any food supplement always consult with your doctor first because you may have an allergic reaction to something or or meat or not even if you just want medical advice from your doctor on that specific product I was always reach out to a doctor because they're gonna be the people who know you best and then of the people who can say oh yeah you know it's safe to take oh no it's not safe to say but that being said guys if you enjoyed this video please give it a thumbs up leave me any comments you have below and I'll answer them because I read and respond to every single comment and I will see you in the next video guys peace", "J0-esluQXAo": "Activated charcoal can help you to detox from\nweed and pass a drug test. Let's get to the basics of how this method\nworks. Activated charcoal works by absorbing most\nof the toxins in the gastrointestinal tract before they are absorbed into the blood system. When THC has been entirely absorbed into the\nsystem, it enters a cycle where it moves from the blood system to the intestines and back\nto the blood system through the Enterohepatic Recirculation. Marijuana metabolites leave the enterohepatic\ncycle if they are excreted through urine before the liver has cleared them. Or if they are passed out through feces before\nbeing reabsorbed into the blood system while in the intestines. So, how activated charcoal can help? Activated charcoal binds to the THC-COOH in\nthe gastrointestinal tract and is excreted by feces. Consequently, this reduces the number of metabolites\ncirculating in the system, thereby reducing the detoxification period. You can read the detailed study with the scientific\njustification by following the link below the video. How To Use Activated Charcoal To Pass A Urine\nTest for Marijuana You will need\nActivated Charcoal Pills Water\nTime. At least one week. The more time you have, the higher the chances\nof getting rid of more metabolites Urine test strips\nIngest 10g of activated charcoal 1-2 hours before each meal of the day with a glass of water. Remember to keep testing the concentration\nof drug metabolites in the urine to track your progress. Please remember that despite the fact that\nactivated charcoal helps to remove THC metabolites from your system, there's no guarantee that\nit will remove enough metabolites to pass the test in 1 week. So this method is not much reliable.", "eWhmYtnHA5M": "this CTE has become a big topic yep you know I saw this thing down having made junkie about opioids and UFC already oh yeah oh so bad it's everywhere and I started thinking about the NFL Wow you know four years you're a player you got to do what you got to do you get six million a year and every year there's a new college all-american that's coming out that's challenging your job yep and you play hurt and you shoot pain pills and you shoot pain [ __ ] solvents and yep you know then you see these guys use lame they can't walk no Campbell yeah you crumbled your liver you crumble everything is the worst stuff you know we noticed you know I hadn't uh after my last fight all my injuries that I retired for in the very first place I didn't fight for seven years I thought I was completely in the clear everything went perfect I felt like a maniac I mean literally in a month I will everybody was telling me that I was training a dude you got a new career this is insane I mean you're flying through everything I say hit this world right and then boom your first injury came back and that came back and that came back and that came back and you know and so I'm and then some you know so I fought I couldn't kick higher than low kicks because people said because I stopped the guy with low kicks they said why didn't kick him in a dress I could kick higher than logic because I've taught at all my groin you know I had to rip out my knees they were completely shot I mean everything that went wrong at 10:00 a night is in both arms I could only shadowbox I couldn't even hit the bag anymore with my arms I was in so much pain so what starts it started there with the simple Norco I remember taking one and a half Norco on the day of the fight at 10:00 a.m. in the morning because it said you know at least ten eight hours you don't have to take anything because it can affect you mentally and I figured you know my fights gonna be around nine o'clock you know I'm the main event not the Komen actually I thought was and then then it's out of my system you know but you know I remember the next day taking again and after the fight you know you were in pain and slowly and then I remember a time that I rolled a 9 and number 9 with a bit of pencil you know the my wife uses of makeup I put it on the on the mirror I remember putting on a left corner the number nine because I took nine pills a day and I was not going to pass nine pills a day well those nine pills they became twelve bills at this time at one time four times a day five times a day so now I'm paying in 48 pills today now the doctor says dude this is so bad for you it's it's it's all the time while you're taking because okay there's less tylenol and in the Norco Dannan and vicodin but it's still really bad you're gonna have to switch to oxycontin okay dork you know idiot that I am and then oxycontin oxycontin it's just that's pharmaceutical heroin you know and then you realize and I have this problem that I went to I believe it was Ohio or something and I measured every older pill out and I had a five hour delay I ran out of pills and let me tell you that's when I realized I'm addicted you know I was on the plane shaking I couldn't eat sweating cold sweats goosebumps all over the place and I gotta kick this stuff and then I start kicking it then I did it the wrong way because of the wrong way I did I did it with the suboxone and suboxone is kinda the the the rich man's methadone right that you get from the doctor but what you should do officially you should build that up what you can use a two weeks and after two weeks you should stop that my doctor said no no it's good who still works for the pain and you only can take less so if you start with a whole pill you can literally go to two quarters you can go to a half you can actually build off instead of going up all the time with the pain pill so I figured you know I believe the doctor and I do that but then I was on for that for three years and you should Google what happens to people who are on that for three years because once I start hearing I heard dr. oz dr. Drew was talking about it on the radio and I go what and then I start googling it finally after three years that's not googling what I'm taking it the idiot you know and it's so bad it got in my bones it took me 11 days to kick that see my supposed to take it for two weeks for two weeks because if you wind it over two weeks you don't have any side effects instead over three years I did it for three years so it gets into your bones and it gets the double vision sweating heart rate is like 95 in bed you can't be you can't go to the restroom again I mean I wrote a whole list of side effects than it had and I got to stop this crap so then I finally I stopped it I tried cold turkey didn't work you know because my daughter I was five days in I was like freaking out it's really hard like people say that it's it's way harder to kick that actually oxycontin by itself it's very hard to kick the suboxone so then I my daughter had a party that weekend I say okay I'm gonna take it again I mean otherwise there's no way it can help you to my wife yet 70 kids coming so I took it again felt good right away again and then I said okay now I'm gonna smart I'm gonna build it down literally go to a quarter to a nephron a third from that quarter and hey you know it's slowly but surely down then once every day a little tiny crumb under your tongue and then slowly okay then I stopped and then 11 days those eleven days dude hell you know what my testosterone level was they've never seen anything it was five so not five hundred it's one two three four five the doctor showed it to another doctor and they're both freaking out they said what how can you come out of a how would you get out of bed I said I'm really I don't want to go out of it but I have to I just force myself drinking coffee and once I'm going I'm going he says women have 60 you have five here people you know people go don't go to work anymore did they stay in bed it's amazing that you still come out of it how's your sex drive I said that's gone you know and that's the moment that I stopped doing all that crap and once that comes back oh man you're like freaking Superman no like the the III explained it like the the bad guy you know Michael Shannon who played the bad guy from Krypton right he came here and he took his helmet off and then hear everything all the people all the sounds you heard because he was not used to that that's exactly when he came over that stuff like shades had to wear everything this will be way too bright life for me I mean I was crazy that your your senses are so out of control because they're not stomped away anymore dreaming that's the box suboxone so how does it compare to like methadone it's the same stuff you know it's just bad yeah so it's a it's just what they call the rigid that's that's how I heard on doctor Dewey says the rich man's methadone and I go what did he say and then I came home started googling that's when I realized I should have stopped it with two weeks so yeah I have so many people who email me and I have a whole piece now written out that I literally can copy and paste because you do that five times you go like I should save this because more people are going to ask me the same question so now I have it all written out that I only have to copy and paste and right away if somebody has a problem and now now fortunately we have a CBD right if you use good CBD with a little tiny bit like 0.3 percent or 0.5 percent THC it really helps you to calm down like a pain pill if you take three pain pills a day let's say if you take CBD you only have to take one because it will enhance it so it's an easier way to build up a lot of these facilities where you get detox are actually using CBD right now to bring it down marijuana as well found by the way it's funny cuz CBD does count me down yeah somebody told me if you take an edible and taking the fella control I have emergency CBD in my jaw like in case you take an edible or something to CBD calms you down oh really I know at night for a fact that the nights and I put seed bead under my tongue ace about an hour yeah but I'll fall asleep really good it's nice and relaxed it takes about now yeah you don't get I get the 1% you know what I do I I eat something I take the CBD I wait ten minutes and just eat one or two slices of bread and then it will go into your system right away it's a better way of doing it because sometimes inedible can show up two hours later right but if you eat with it's like 10 minutes later it'll pretty much within 10-15 minutes it's on yeah I don't need that opposed no more but I like the CBD without it they say you have to have a little bit of THC renovated to activate you up for it to take it to where the pain is and stuff so I get a small percentage now cuz I don't know it was starting to get me sick the edibles oh I believe it I can do edibles if I do edibles you know it affects me the next day you know I'd literally use but people don't believe iti buy a creme with a vape and I can literally do two and a half or three months with that people got there's no way I literally go about four seconds I put it not even till it starts blinking and I'm gone and I'd only do it once a day so but if I would do during the day if I'm at a party or something and I don't want to drink and I take a little zip just not to drink and then at night I want to go to sleep I need more but if I don't do that only one I only need one time a day like three or second four seconds right that's it and I sleep perfect I'm feeling great no headache no nothing it's the best all the pain is gone it's it's really an amazing brother smoke weed no no III do I do in a night also like I take the flower I do that but also I very little amounts I do for me I only want to calm down and I tell myself don't you don't need to go go out of control just calm yourself down and feel my legs my legs I have this great feeling and some of my friends have it too but most have not like it starts glowing it's literally when I and it's such a good feeling like it might my legs hurt a lot but at night and I only do it once I'm in bed so you won't see me walking around the house and no I lay in bed that's when I take my little zip I lay down and literally I think 25 minutes I'm out feeling great I don't forget years ago this had to be 10 11 years ago when people were talking about the benefits in marijuana I got a toothache over the holidays I needed a root canal over the holidays and nobody was open and I didn't have vicodin you know I was taking pain pills whatever the [ __ ] Advil and one night the pain woke me up but I go let me see if there's marijuana [ __ ] works look I smoked a bunch of pot I smoked a joint like hey the more the assault and it was so weird that I got so high I started writing that I forgot about the pain yep and I said this this really works and not my wife is on the fence after 18 years of being with her she went to a kids party Saturday night at the martial arts school yeah she took mercy to watch a movie over there and the owner and the wife and a bunch of the moms were went outside and what this small and that that the crazy told me she was you know the guy smokes like oh come on that guy's [ __ ] straight as an ass she goes no he Bruce Lee smoke man he comes having pain and he got off the pain pills and started smoking once and this pain went away so he's been smoking blunts at night a night so my wife is considering should be after mercy falls asleep listen it's a we know this you know and your listeners probably noticed as well it's just labeled a drug because of alcohol came out at the time before the government labeled it as a drug it has always been medicine I have a priest that I know I'm a Catholic and and and and he said no absolutely you can use it if he uses for your pain yeah if you're all day long start smoking lay on bed you don't do anything non-productive yeah do you not just don't live a productive life they wouldn't be okay with that but it did God invented that plan for a reason and it is to help people for just the government they realized wait a minute we got alcohol now we can text that it's very hard to text the weed though because people can grow themselves oh let's make it a drug and they labeled it a drug and boom it's funny on the website now on the government all the things like gateway drug and all that stuff that they wrote they all have it's all off now because now the truth came out now they have to literally take that off because it's not true you want to hear a gauge where drug alcohol now it goes the gateway drug I know then all the crap all the real bad stuff I did you know and and it's not never to other people but to myself right it starts with alcohol because that lowers your level you go oh yeah that's actually a smarter thing to do I can do right now which you would sit so with it was survey what you drink what you do first smoker join a drink a bottle of Boone's Farm and I guarantee it's 70/30 yeah 70/30 because that's what I did I drank Boone's Farm first but I knew at the age of three four or five I didn't like drinking I drank a bottle of red wine whenever a three-foot my mom was my mom on the bar so to put me to sleep she dipped my [ __ ] pacifier in blackberry brandy call it a sugar cube my mother was a savagely yeah kid yeah in Holland they put a little like that on a sugar coupe and I gave it to the cat so I just so I [ __ ] I saw her drinking this red wine Italian and she put on top of the refrigerator I don't remember this no wait for her to go to sleep and I drank the bottle of wine like Vito Corleone she woke up three hours later I was missing she called the cops the cops found me in the closet [ __ ] diarrhea you oh yay and I never drank again so drinking was not on my agenda well I was like seven I saw these kids smoking when that I borrowed them now cigarette do you remember years ago the cigarettes called now now they came red green and whatever mmm I took two hits of it and in the bathroom in my house there was like an ironing board and the kid in the bathroom and one of those things that you scrub with yeah yeah I remember I took I was making believe I was [ __ ] my mother was in the kitchen he was smoking the cigarette the bathroom like at 7:00 do it this a great I started getting dizzy as [ __ ] oh yeah and I put the cigarette on top of a piece of wood and I left it there oh yeah she's like what the [ __ ] was smoking like I have no idea I'm puking [ __ ] so I was away from all that yeah but the first thing I did even though I was exposed to marijuana was drink yeah I drank for one I totally agree with me yeah no I have the drinking is you know always I'm a happy guy if I drink so at least I have that and I want to have fun with everybody but it's just you know being drunk morning Ron the house it's just not a good thing and that that thankfully I got out of my system really fair well really fat no people know all the stories right there's been a lot of crazy stories but you know that was drinking fighting keeps you in line that's the great thing about fighting you know you do after a fight you know you go to three days crazy and then you have to train again for the next fight I mean I fought in Japan from 93 let's say to 97 for four years I fought at 30 fights that's a lot of fights you know you fight its first year for a year oh yeah no I fought that first year nine fights I think you know I had a really high schedule that was MMA that was a mermaid but at least it was in pain crusher we had to choose with the shin protection in the open hand to the face a closed fist to the body you know but you know that it would just a great way for me to keep myself in the in check it's very hard also from the fighters when they stop fighting because you don't have that high anymore like if you knock somebody out you know it's it's like a hole-in-one you know the forgo of I assume you know you're there people go nuts it's a feeling that you start really enjoying and if they suddenly be taken away you start trying to replace that with something and most of the time with fighters there's drugs or booze you know like a Pat Miletich is very smart about it he just picked another crazy thing up he's chasing tornadoes he says because I know if I don't do not do not do that it's probably going to be drinking or something like that you know so he uses that to still to get that same high back you know with me at the time I was drinking that's why actually I took the last fight in 2006 because I was I was drinking pretty heavy and then I looked at my wife I say you know what I was going am Telling take the fight because if I take the fights I can't drink anymore I quit drinking so that's what I did and from that moment on it was all good now I don't you know I got a little out of hand like a couple of weeks ago and it was the first time I think I was drunk in over a year it's too early afternoon you ain't high go [ __ ] yourself my face I want you around me like I want cancer my ballsack and I'm saying you're gonna come around here looking at me with your [ __ ] white eyes thinking that you know I'm gonna be I'm gonna reform go [ __ ] yourself my morning starts at 5:30 a.m.", "G-gGTkeRmoI": "okay the question is what do you think about marijuana for the treatment of pain put me on the spot here the answer is I don't know first of all I've never been in a state that medical marijuana was legal and when I was actively practicing we could use THC for certain things but which is the active ingredient marijuana but we weren't allowed to use marijuana I've never been in a state that merit merit medical marijuana dispensaries or available why was an active practice and I'm very dependent on other people that have more experience on this and we do have open discussion groups and about herbal products and often marijuana comes up and we have people that give us their opinions it i can say that mayor medical marijuana is now legal i think at 18 stakes in the District of Columbia I may be wrong but THC is the active agree that the most people are interested in and THC is legal FDA approves I think 85 to treat nausea loss of appetite failure to thrive in patients that have things like cancer and AIDS and I've utilized it there it's been very effective in regaining appetite and helping individuals not have a significant nausea the people that I you know I know a lot about neurology and the cannaboids system has been found to be the most ubiquitous system the most the biggest system in the nervous system receptor wise and there's a lot we don't know about it and we're learning I can tell you that it makes sense that marijuana has properties that may help certain pain syndromes especially nerve pain syndromes now setting aside the controversy that marijuana is not legal everywhere and that the federal government has a controlled substance there is strong evidence that medical Merlin has this effect on nerve pain particularly caused by multiple sclerosis and HIV and certain peripheral neuropathies it also may really be good for be a complex regional pain syndrome which is a sympathetic mediated paint it makes sense that may help with that it also may help with people that have certain syndromes like arachnoid it\u00eds and severe syndromes that by increased anxiety increased emotionality you can have increased pain nerve pain but I don't know of a lot of research except for some that's been done at John Hopkins and most of that shows it relieving nausea and help people suffering and side effects like chemotherapy and in cancer I'm open to hear more from everyone now marijuana does have risks the THC tablets are dosed specifically when you deal with marijuana you're getting it from different places and in the past you didn't always know if you're getting the same dose you had to control your dose not heard that's beneficial from experienced users they know how to dose themselves they know which product does what but I also heard that more novices and more intermediate users do not know how to dose themselves and then get into trouble with certain you know kinds of marijuana and they need guidance and I'm I'm not aware of the marijuana dispensaries I've never never even known anyone for someone's I don't know how much guidance that get and welcome I welcome any comments on any of our discussion groups about this we have an herbal discussion group coming up in October that's going to be a teleseminar and then we have we usually have about an herbal in almost every month so if anyone wants to get in on that and help us out and give us some practical advice and speaking of practicality you know there are serious problems with with marijuana some people can become addicted to it and also their psychosis and serious neurological and psychiatric consequences to some marijuana in certain people every drug every herb can cause problems for certain individuals so I see a lot of as with a stronger marijuana's I've heard there's a lot more potential for for side effects now the other thing is there's a whole lot other than th seat that needs to be studied about marijuana there's a lot of new therapies and cannaboids there is anti-seizure being looked at there's all kinds of an T Pain just not just not just nausea and the typical pain because all kinds of things are being looked at now it really affects a neurological system a GI system etc so now lastly on a practical level you need to be aware of the laws regarding the use of medical marijuana your state you could be arrested for smoking marijuana just by going over state line so take talk to your doctor they're prescription drugs available that have th see that are fda-approved and been around quite some time and I think they're very valuable in very valid I don't know if that's the best answer for you there needs to be a lot more research in this area especially now that we know how ubiquitous the cannabinoid system is and how important maybe to the neurological system and I am I welcome anybody else's input does anyone else have anything to say everybody else is terrified right so nobody wants to be on the recording all right well

it's basically when THC breaks down all you have to do is heat it and it creates CBN and CBN is great for it's a it's a it's a very strong sedative and it's mildly psychoactive but it's great for pain

about getting too high then the practice of micro dosing may be the best place to start what is micro dosing and how does it work find out on this episode of we neezy by the growth of dipping your toes into the cannabis waters can seem daunting especially if you've had a bad experience in the past with overindulgence having too much cannabis or greening out can be overwhelming cause anxiety and generally just scare people off trying cannabis again that's where micro dosing can help this practice has been used by medical cannabis patients for years and is a great way to consume cannabis for anyone partaking but what is micro dosing micro dosing is used to help you determine what strain works best for you and at what quantity or dose since there is currently no standardized dosing guide for medical users this method has been used to help them find the best treatment plan for their cannabis medication but it works just as well for those who are enjoying cannabis for recreational reasons the standard mantra for micro dosing is start low and go slow starting low when consuming cannabis it's recommended that you start at a low dose first depending on the format you are using to consume dosing may be different with dried flower you may want to start with just a few draws on a joint vape or bomb if you're using oil capsules you may want to start with a 2.5 milligram dose versus a 10 milligram dose this also helps when trying different strains or CBD to THC ratios as every strain is different and your body will react to it differently by starting with a low dose you can monitor how each strain makes you feel and the way your body reacts to it going low on the dose will ensure you don't over indulge and give you insight into the strains and methods that work best for you going slow the second half of the mantra is all about taking your time don't rush the process as it may cause you to overindulge and have a bad experience part of micro dosing is about understanding how much you need to achieve the high you want that means testing testing and testing it's also important to understand how different consumption methods metabolize in the body for instance smoking cannabis typically metabolizes quickly and you can start to feel results in as little as 10 to 15 minutes while edibles can take anywhere from 45 minutes to several hours before you feel air effects edibles are a great example of the importance of the go-slow methodology often when people are first trying edibles they rush the process they become disappointed when they don't feel anything right away and either have more of the edible or consume cannabis another way because they don't think the edible worked this often leads to a very bad experience due to overindulgence as they aren't waiting long enough to be edible to take effect micro dosing is a tried-and-true format for finding your personal mix of the right consumption method strain and dose to maximize your

they can last up to 12 hours which is a real game-changer for people who have medical issues co-founder Nancy Whiteman says the capsules are easy for patients to carry and much less noticeable people who have real medical needs are having to find a way to medicate every four to five hours so they're always looking where is it okay to smoke where can I can I get another edible Nancy says these pills represent the next generation of medical marijuana and alleviate the ups and downs often associated with inconsistent dosing it's a much more consistent and steady experience for the patient now

have a red card and you can go to a dispensary you can get it is medical marijuana at this point these capsules are even in the child safety cap kind of bottles so they said that that's another thing

reiterate i am an internal medicine specialist and i am very interested in the medical cannabis space um one of the reasons um that i got involved with this with this area was because i had my

with is a multi-disciplinary clinic and we are data-driven so our goals are to look at the data to collect the data and to better understand what cannabis can be used for and that's what i'm hoping to share with you today because parkinso disease is one of those diseases that there isn't just one thing that parkinson's patients suffer from there's a host of things and the current standard of treatment isn't if i could be honest and frank isn't great um and so um a lot of patients are seeking um other alternatives and that's what i'm hoping to be able to share and shed some light into uh today because i think cannabis does have a role okay so um as uh a summary of what we're going to talk about um we'll talk about a general overview of some parkinson's theory uh we'll look at the cannabis uh overview and then we'll go to some frequently asked questions okay so uh parkinson's disease right and so um when you look at the causes of parkinson's disease this is just a summary for what i think many of the attendees here probably already know there is things like um you know there's a genetic component to it um like michael j fox there's environmental causes you know listed here

our mind and how we think and it can lead to some um to some changes that cause parkinsonian like uh symptoms then there are you know risk factors like age and a family history males are more likely to get parkinson's than females environmental exposures and then essentially what happens in parkinson's is that you get this breakdown of the nerve cells um and it's mostly the dopamine releasing nerve cells which is why things like the the standard of treatment is like cinnamon or carbidopa which tries to replace the the dopamine and the idea is that some of the symptoms of parkinson's and you'll see as we go through the theory that not all of them can be explained with just dopamine-releasing cells which is why that cinnamon only addresses some of the symptoms of parkinson's so this was a theory that was proposed that i really really liked and it talks about parkinson in stages um and so most people don't re most people when they think about parkinson's disease they think of you know things like the cardinal symptoms which is the bretokinesia which is a slowing of the movements you know or the pill rolling tremor um or they look a bit flat in terms of how they look right or they start tripping um but that you'll see here actually is kind of a later uh a later stage usually in the stage three right so but parkinson's disease may start as early as stage one and this is why i like this because there are subtle features of parkinson's that may um that may be um present before what people think like ah you must have parkinson's or they they start noticing the pill rolling tremor and that's when people start screening for it so when you look at it you know the in the first steps of parkinson's um or the first stage you lose things that are more non-specific so you get less spell you get things like you get constipated and that's as you go up from the brain stem up to the higher levels of the brain okay so just to give everyone here an idea or a review this this is our brain here and you'll see that um the lower parts of the brain are what's called the the more rudimentary parts this is like for you know your breathing center um and what differentiates us as humans is more the upper brain which is our complex thinking and our critical thinking so this stuff down here in the brain stem you know the the green and the whatever stage one it's sort of a yellow green um that's sort of the the primitive centers in our brain okay and so that's where you get things like constipation and smell and then as you move up you start to affect some of the substantia [ __ ] which is um which is where you usually um cause problems um and that's when you start getting symptoms like okay you get these odd pains that really you know you really can't necessarily pinpoint you get some mood just mood issues um fluctuating mood this is where people start noticing sleep right and so sleep is is um one of the things that's really affected in in patients with parkinson's right and you'll see here that you can imagine that when patients present in stage one or stage two it's rather difficult to say that yeah this person has uh parkinson's because these could be from lots of different things right sinus issues poor sleep could be from stress you know mood can also be from stress so it's not until you get to stage three that people start noticing things like okay you're moving slowly you're getting more rigid you're getting some freezing and then that's when you get the pill rolling tremor and then when you look back you start seeing that oh yeah i had all these other symptoms too but what's interesting also is that parkinson's doesn't stop at stage three right and so as you move up into stage four stage five stage six you start affecting other things that actually become more significant right so as you move up you get more emotional problems that's when you start getting more long-term problems and as you can follow this arrow up the brain as it goes up higher and higher you start getting more and more of the um of the areas in the brain uh that makes us unique as humans okay so the critical thinking the memory um the planning the executive planning and so this is parkinson's and i think it's really nice um overview um so just as a very general review all that i really wanted to show here was these are the cardinal symptoms of parkinson's these are like what people think of as classic but this is not all that parkinson patients deal with right because there's a lot of mood issues in parkinson's patients that may go under appreciated there's psychotic uh things that people can start to hallucinate and then there's cognitive like the dysfunction of thinking fatigue is a big thing you know we don't treat very well sleep disturbance is also probably related to fatigue and all of this is just trying to say that if we look at parkinson's we have to look beyond the pill rolling tremor or just the tremor we have to look beyond that we have to look beyond just the rigidity because there's so much more in terms of what affects our park a patient who deals with parkinson's um their quality of life what affects their quality of life pain is also a big one and so here more features you know you can look at them i'm sure that uh for the guests here or the attendees here who suffer from parkinson's they don't necessarily need to read this list because it's something that they already experience in their lives or in the lives of their loved ones so now let's go to uh cannabis so very briefly let's just talk about what like cannabis overview okay so cannabis is a plant this is a plant um there's two different types there's actually three different types of cannabis there's sativa indica and rudoralis root oralis doesn't really have any medicinal properties so i've left it out for the most part in the can sativa are more historical the way that canada has been growing because most of our products are hybrids and it just you know for the most part with the only thing i want to tell you about sativa and indica because you will experience this or you will come across this if you are looking at cannabis treatment is that the cbd or the thc okay which are your cannabinoids that you find in sativa and indica are exactly the same so that was one thing that i never quite realized when i first got into this into this field which is you know cbd if you get it from sativa sativa or cbd if you get it from indica is exactly the same same with the thc they're chemically the same what differs in the sativa and in the indica plants are mostly the terpenes okay which i'll talk about and the minor cannabinoids okay so um cannabinoids are these unique molecules um they're actually not necessarily only found in cannabis they can be found in other plants but for the most part they're found in cannabis um that that um affect the the the host usually through the endocannabinoid system cbd thc are the most predominant of the cannabinoids okay terpenes um are these other uh molecules that are found within the cannabis plant that essentially gives it the fragrance so you know when you smell the cannabis you can smell that's the terpenes but they also have medicinal properties um and in actual fact um terpenes are usually from other plants okay so like spices have terpenes like parsley has terpene and then they've just bred into the cannabis um out in the wild okay but again the only thing i want to mention here is terpenes by themselves have a have medicinal properties and when you combine terpenes with the cannabinoids there's some thought that they may act more synergistically together all right so how can you these are the these are the ways that you can take cannabis i'm going to talk about how cannabis can be used in parkinson's but just generally how can you take what are the methods of consumption or modes of consumption so you know the most common that most people think of is smoking okay this in our clinic is the least favored why is it the least favorite a it's hard to control what you actually get because you're smoking the entire joint for instance um and you may be trading a benefit for uh a long-term um side effect or not a long-term side effect but a long-term problem okay so like why would you get pain control and then get lung problems like why why do that when there's another way to take it if you are you know there's some good things about it because if you do smoke or vaporize it's it has a faster onset but it also comes off less it also wears off quicker if you're going to smoke though try to use a water a bong because it has a water filter on it vaporize is the other way that i think most people may see out in you know in the public and this one you can use usually is you have a dried flower and you put it into a vaporizer it heats it up and you know under different uh temperatures or or boiling points you can you can vaporize the cannabinoids and you inhale it this one you know there's probably some benefit to it uh because it's again very fast onset so if you're in pain you can you can get a you can you can take a puff of the vaporized uh product and you can get effect within usually about five or ten minutes but it also doesn't last that long it usually lasts for about an hour or two the most common in our clinic is usually in the oral route so either a sublingual buccal or a or a capsule okay and so usually you can use you know you hold it for 45 to 60 seconds underneath your tongue the big things to note here is that when you're taking an oral route whether it's underneath the tongue or an edible like like a capsule it can take up to two hours uh to onset okay edibles include capsules and and um with fixed doses and also edibles can include um uh baked foods or like cookies we usually for medical uh don't use uh edibles like gummies because again you you oftentimes trade one problem for another like these high sugary cookies or high sugary gummy bears um and so it has only a little bit of of cbd or thc in it uh mostly cbd and then you take all that sugar in and then there's topical that's coming out on the market um soon or it's there's some products already out on the market i think this has a lot of this has a lot of potential for localized pain um so how can cannabis help in parkinson's this is not just how can cannabis help in general but this is remember this my talk is specific for parkinson's patients how can it help so there are four really four main areas that we in our clinic have seen it having benefits okay so in sleep in pain in the tremor and in anxiety or mood disorders so what does the data show this is the truth about cannabis so is cannabis a miracle drug that cures everything okay so obviously the answer is is no right um is cannabis a real medication now normally in my powerpoint slide these would come up one at a time but in this in this way it just all pops up at the same time so um i sort of give away my answers right away but yes it's a real drug and here's what it can it can help for and we have we have really good emerging evidence that it's useful in things like pain in poor sleep in tremors anxiety and ptsd seizures um and inflammation okay so here's the stats here's what it looks like this is this is real life data from our from my clinic okay so this is for pain specifically for pain you can see here okay that of these people the predominant people had some improvement right in pain and this is all comers of pain right most of them can you imagine three like maybe a third of the patients had a significant improvement in their pain so you're talking like at least a 75 reduction and when you look at the dose it's an average of 25 to 50 milligrams per day 76 of our patients had an improvement within the first month this is actually improving as we get more data and we can be a bit more aggressive in our dosing um 82 right 82 had some improvement at the three-month mark right and the reason for this is because we can we can titrate the or or help the patients adjust their medications or their their um their yeah their medication um as we see them in follow-up and you look at this the average pain and this is pain again all cameras not just parkinson's patients so all comer pain their average pain that they said that they quantified was 7.4 out of 10 so it's pretty significant pain 7.4 out of 10 is pretty significant and the pain reduced by almost 48 by almost half okay so this goes down to about three point eight okay and again fourteen percent of patients improved by more than eighty percent when you look at these numbers this is this is comparable to the opiates okay except that we know that opiates have other issues like addiction um dr lim we have a question if you are up first something um there's a question here are there any issues with interactions with other parkinson's disease medications great question so and i'm going to touch on that a little later but i will answer it as well now the answer is is that cannabis does or cbd and thc they do interact or they can interact with medications now specifically to parkinson medications the answer is it depends because parkinson's medications like i like i had mentioned earlier isn't just one thing will it interfere with cinematic dance or carbidova the answer is no but will it interfere with some of the other antipsychotics or antidepressants that you may be con on as well the answer is yes will it be uh will it interfere with or interact with benzodiazepines which some parkinson's patients are on for instance for sleep the answer is yes and so it's important and we've realized this to have a team manage your care okay so you know i'll be the first to admit even with all my training i am not a drug expert okay um you know there's just too much to know but pharmacists i mean that's their job they are drug experts so that's why we have clinical pharmacists on our team to review all of our patients to make sure that there are no drug interactions so kind of a long-winded way to answer it but yes the answer the short answer is yes it can interfere with parkinson's drugs or inner interact we do have another one here does the dose include thc so yes so these doses are 25 to 50 milligrams of cbd okay i should have been more clear here sorry 25 to 50 milligrams of cbd and there is a little bit of thc and usually the doses of our thc are in the one to two milligrams and the reason for the thc is mostly mostly because none of the none of the cbd that we get in canada is hemp derived which means that there is always some amount of thc in our cbd now i will say that actually this may be a good thing because thc is really it's often needed for cbd to act better or to be more effective so a little bit of thc with more cbd actually is better but this is a cbd only dose this is just for cbd okay so let's look at the tremor so this one we don't have as much data and you can see that the numbers aren't very much but there are there is some improvement okay and so some improvement in our in our uh in our tremor patients uh just because the reason that our numbers aren't very high is most of the patients who are being referred to our clinic is for pain and anxiety and so um again most people experience some improvement and again a significant improvement in tremors um and the dose again about 25 milligrams per day is on average what these patients were uh had effect on so what about insomnia more data right so this is for people uh who have trouble sleeping average dose 26 milligrams per day again of cbd thc also has a huge benefit but we use it more cautiously especially in our parkinson patients because there is a risk of of uh hallucinations with with uh with or uh hallucinations or cognitive issues with um with thc and so we tend to use it cautiously i will tell the attendees here that cbd actually counters the effects of thc so if you have a predominant cbd like let's say you're on 50 milligrams a day of cbd adding say 5 or 10 milligrams of thc is not the same effect as going on no cbd and just taking 5 or 10 milligrams of thc okay so cbd actually directly counteracts the effects of thc and so you can see here that cannabis in both cbd and thc together can be hugely um [Music] effective at treating insomnia right so again you look i mean you know yes a significant number of people didn't find any benefit that's okay right but a great majority of people had significant improvement okay 83 at three months and then anxiety all right so when you look at anxiety um also a lot of people improve okay so 87 over three months average dose about 27 milligrams this is again predominantly cbd not very much thc at all because we know that long-term consequences of thc actually may worsen depression and anxiety um so this is uh you know the point that i'm showing this is really just to show everyone that you know the clinic is a data driven and b we are having data right um you can see here that not very many people get worse right all of these things very little people get worse and so it's safe and it's potentially very effective okay so um are there risks to taking cannabis and the answer is is yes right so there are side effects to cannabis thc i usually break them down into two thc is what we're mostly you know what we hear in the public um that's the stuff that makes people high it make you know so obviously it's side effect or not necessarily a side effect to some people who want it right it makes them high it makes them drowsy this is why it can be helpful in people with insomnia it can make people have um balance issues so they feel a little bit unsteady on their feet which can again we use this cautiously in parkinson patients because parkinson's patients tend to have stability and mobility issues already so we use this cautiously it can lead to dizziness again the same reason that we use it consciously because we don't want to make any of the the uh mobility issue in parkinson's patients even worse palpitations uh dry mouth um [Music] and so uh again and these things right hallucinations and worsening of anxiety and so we use thc very strategically and very cautiously in our parkinson's patients and usually only when there are on much larger doses of cbd so what's the side effects of cbd you know quite literally not very much there are some patients of ours who who report some loose stools or diarrhea i'm actually more convinced from a clinical standpoint that the loose stool and diarrhea is not so much from the cbd itself but rather the oil so the oil that we're using is an mct oil so um a medium chain triglyceride and some people you know if you take oil it's a bit it gives people kind of makes people a little bit gassy and gives people loose stools and i think that's probably more of what the what the issues are from rather than from the cbd but it's it is something that we notice um some people if they take it for insomnia some people get the the reverse they feel like they're totally energized that's rare but we've seen it um and there are some people who develop some lightheadedness or dizziness but we think in our clinic it's probably more to do with the fact that our cbd here in canada always contains some thc and there are some people who are just very sensitive to thc addictions is there an addictions risk so thc there is an addictions risk but you can see it is extremely small so just to show you uh on the line so this line up here is nicotine we know that nicotine is one of the most addictive drugs out there so this is smoking this is why smokers have a really hard time stopping and then you look here this black is alcohol okay we know that our societies have problems with alcohol consumption but for the most part most people don't get addicted to alcohol but you can see that it's got a significant cocaine is actually right up there not that addictive cocaine just as much as alcohol but you look at thc and look at it and this is a logarithmic scale so this is this is like this is orders of magnitude smaller and so you see that it's not a zero right but it's really small okay is there any addictions raised to cbd the answer is long-term we don't know but it doesn't look like it from a clinical standpoint um there are no there's no uh documented withdrawal symptoms so if you stop people are always worried okay if i stop my medication do i get worse in actual fact we found some really remarkable things with cbd whereby as we escalate the doses of cbd and our patients respond what actually they can do is once they reach a clinical response they stay there for like three months and then some of them for financial reasons usually they stop or they don't take it as often and they realize actually that the benefits are still there and so it's not something that i can necessarily explain except for maybe physiologically your body up regulates the receptors and it gets more efficient at this but i have patients who for instance take cbd for pain and after three months you know they would take it every day or twice a day and then after three months they would take it once every third day or you know once a week or twice a week so it's really very surprising with good control and then there are some um there are some studies out there that suggest okay maybe cbd actually can help with other addictions like you know for cocaine addiction or opiate addiction um i have a couple questions here of course sorry to interject again um is cdb obtained by prescription only yes so right here yeah so it's going to be right here so the answer is no um you don't you don't have to get um cbd through a prescription now i will say this though i'd like to think you know we're two years from the legalization of cannabis in canada and yet despite that believe it or not there is still a lot of grey market stores out there they're decreasing but they're still there and a lot of them have fled to online so i have still believe it or not there are patients of mine who order cbd because a friend told them to order from the site and the site is an unregulated site sorry an unregulated product site they're not they're not health canada approved and so they're selling gray market products and you know the fact of the matter is when i ask my patients it's the same price as the regulator product so i'm not really sure why one would go besides the fact that one may not unders may not realize that that's a great market site and so the best thing to do is if you're looking for it um you know go to a government regulated retail store you can go on the bc website and find out which stores are uh have a license and you can also find out which companies are are licensed through the bcbc government website um so hopefully that answers that question do you want to ask the next question alana first before i go into this sure some really good questions here a couple more can you recommend some strains brands where to buy doctors who we can talk to do you see patients yourself and prescribe cannabis it's a great question and i'm going to answer all of those as we go through i i promise okay um the next one is actually about cbd so maybe you want to answer that one cbd cbd isolate versus full spectrum cbd great question great question so cbd isolates are some companies out there that um that will sell you a cbd isolate um and so the the evidence for the difference between the two isn't great but i can tell you that clinically and from a theoretical and physiologic standpoint full spectrum is probably better and the reason is is that full spectrum allows more synergy so there's this phenomenon called the entourage effect that suggests that in combination the minor cannabinoids or all the cannabinoids act together and the terpenes to provide a more complete response rather than a single pointed response also there is some ancillary evidence to suggest that cbd isolates may not act as well because you'll need higher doses so for instance there's a there's a product on the market for seizures called epidialex epidialex is uh used in the treatment of childhood seizures that's all that it's really approved for certain childhood sweeteners and it's 99 cbd now you know you talk to the company and they'll say that it's a full spectrum but the fact is is that it's 99 cbd so it's actually really close to an iceland um even though it has the other things now if you look at the doses of epidialex for treatment of seizures you're looking at between 800 to 1500 milligrams that's a lot so if anybody has ever purchased cbd you'll know that a usual standard 40 ml bottle of 25 milligrams that's usually a standard is a thousand milligrams and so when you look at the epidiolex to treat childhood seizures you're looking at consuming one entire bottle twice a day right so it's a lot um and so it's a bit anecdotal so i can't don't go don't quote me saying that isolates are are not as effective because we don't know but based on all the information out there and try to gather everything um and putting it all together my sis my my opinion my medical opinion only is that the full spectrum is more efficacious or acts more or acts better or more effectively than the isolates and one more question yes um perhaps you can comment on this uh my doctor and neurologist told me there is no real proof that cbd works well that's so so i can say that unfortunately a lot of my colleagues continue to say things like this when it's not true and i've been trying to single-handedly speak to all of my colleagues across bc and across canada about this first of all um you know if they ever say things like that you can tell them about the phase three trial for the epidialettes that i just mentioned so that's medical cannabis epidialex is the is the cbd uh for childhood seizures that has phase three trials so um to not get too technical phase 3 trials where you get this randomized double-blind control trials is the gold standard for evidence and there is phase 3 trials for epidialex in childhood seizures and so there is lots of emerging evidence to say that cbd is useful a lot of the neurologists and a lot of the gps they just they say that because they don't know and so what i've been trying to say is that instead of saying no why don't we co-manage the patient through for instance through perceive md and then we can all learn together right and so that's what we'll be doing so for instance a lot of the um a lot of the physicians the ep the neurologists who did epilepsy at vancouver general hospital they didn't know anything about medical cannabis but their patients were all on it so what did they do is that we work now directly with them so we see all of their patients who are on medical cannabis uh or who are on cannabis and also happen to have epilepsy so now we share their patients and we manage the cannabis side and they manage the epilepsy side they're the pharmaceutical epilepsy side and we work together as a team so i think that that's a much better approach than saying nope there's no evidence don't go and try it okay so if that's all uh for now i'm gonna answer some of those other questions that were asked um but here so i think this is one of the questions i was asked should i just go get my canvas from a store and just try it out myself right because everything is legal i can just go to the store now i will tell you this going to the store and getting it from a medical uh prescription exactly the same product okay i don't want you to think that the store has sub has um has products that are inferior to the medical realm it's not it's exactly the same so you say okay well why don't i just go to the store to buy it well there's a few reasons one is that it's always better to get a medical practitioner involved if you're really trying to treat a medical problem right that's my fee that's my that's my stance on everything i mean if you have diabetes and you're trying to treat diabetes with your diet you should really try to employ the the help of a dietician so that you can do it properly and so that's one thing the second is that um in the medical route you you can get uh compassion pricing so if your income is below a certain level a lot of like perceive md for instance can help you register with uh with a producer that can get you a discount whereas if you go to a retail shop they're not going to give you any discount you just pay a retail price the third is in regards to pricing as well when you get a medical document for your for your cannabis um you can write it off on your taxes because now you get a medical prescription it becomes a medical um uh it's prescribed by by a physician so it becomes a medical expense so you can write it off on your taxes and some of the third party plans um are covering it okay um so those are the reasons the the and and you know it's it's here as well so the no medical supervision do you really want to just go and buy from a retail store and then try to dose it yourself you know if you're getting side effects who do you ask if there's drug interactions which we already know there are who do you go to right so those are the reasons that i usually give patients say hey like why would you go try to do this on your own when you clearly have um you know a medical condition for it why don't you employ um the services of of a practitioner now i will also say right now that all of our services are free okay so i don't want people to go out there and say well i would employ a medical service but if i could afford it but i don't have any money all of our services are covered under msp so as long as you are you know you you have provincial coverage you will not pay anything to get our services i mean obviously you'll have to pay for the product because we don't control that but our services you know you see a pharmacist you see a nurse you see a doctor all free how much is a cost this is another one of those questions that i always get okay so in general it's about i would say on average about nine or ten cents per milligram so if you're on 50 milligrams a day you're you're about five dollars okay um and a capsule they've come and come down in price about the same so you know if you're on 20 milligrams a day for instance you're spending two dollars a day okay so in a month that's about sixty dollars a thousand milligram bottle is about ninety dollars and depending on how how much your dosing is right um some people can get away with ours we have some patients who use 90 dollars every two months and some patients who use 90 every 20 days okay um and so you can see that again there are there are benefits right if you're spending you know 145 or 135 dollars a month it's you know and you and you'll be eligible for for instance compassion pricing and you get 20 percent off or 15 off and you get a tax deductible i mean it adds up right um this is the question that was asked okay so how do you get to be seen so we uh you can just have your gp refer to us okay um and i can give alana all of the referral information we can we even have a referral sheet that the physician just fills out and signs and then sends to us so we are a referral only clinic but again we are 100 covered by msp um we require referral either from a gp or your neurologist or any other doctor and what's the benefits of seeing us well you see a pharmacist to make sure that there are no drug interactions that we need to be careful about you see a nurse that can help with your intake and answer any questions you see a doctor who can also help and then you see an educator or a coach that can help you that can help you register with a licensed producer help you register for compassion pricing uh help you find help you place your first order and then you know once you get your product and it comes for instance in a bottle and you look at it and you're like i have no idea how to take this the educator can walk you through like okay this is how you take it and now we're doing everything virtually so you could just do it from the comfort of your home we use um a virtual care platform called ollo health that we can you know connect with you on by video or by phone and then we can help you through and this is what we help you with right okay so dosing side effects drug interactions education so that's it so this is the this is the uh the uh website for um perceive md this is our phone number in case you want to call us um yeah or you could just email us okay and again alana i'll give elena the whole package of what we need what you need to get a hold of us um some more questions here um can i ask for a prescription from my family doctor absolutely so yes any doctor can can fill out a prescription if your family physician or your physician is not has never prescribed cannabis before i can tell you that they're probably going to say no and the reason they're going to say no is because to prescribe cannabis is not the same as prescribing any other drug it's really health canada has really bungled it up and it's and it's quite it's it's not necessarily complicated but it's very different than their usual practice and so um yeah but if they've prescribed it by all means yes they can prescribe it and if you want they can send it over to us and then we can we can take that medical document and submit it on your behalf and help you and you know so you can use any part of our service right so if you say okay i only want to use your educator service you can have your family doctor um send us the medical document and we can we can send it to one of the licensed producers on your behalf and we can help you educate and we can help you apply for compassion pricing all that stuff that i suspect their office wouldn't want or wouldn't necessarily offer you and i'm not sure about this question if i'm reading it properly do you take pt from usa and cost i'm not sure what the pt means products maybe do we take products from the usa uh maybe guest 879 can you elaborate patient patient maybe oh do we take patients from the u.s um maybe maybe that's what it's saying so we can we can take private patients um [Music] yes uh and we can uh but it would have to be private paid because they wouldn't be they would no longer fall under the bc uh provincial coverage if you're from out of province we it would have to be private pay again mostly because the provinces don't have an agreement with each other for medical cannabis and for virtual if you're from the us it becomes a challenge because then we have to we have to um recommend the product that you have to go look for in the us which doesn't sound hard but the difference between canada and the us is in terms of regulations so um in canada the the federal government and health canada has mandated that all the licensed producers be uh regulated which means that they control you know things like dosing there has to be certain uh criteria for quality and for consistency of the label so if it says like 25 milligrams per mil that there is about 25 milligrams per mil in there so it's like accurate packaging in the u.s those regulations don't exist which means that the package can be anything and it could be completely different what's inside the package and so it's unfortunate which means that in the u.s you could have a much more variable response all right thank you um another question does cannabis help with dopamine levels the answer is no so cbd can affect things like your serotonin and your dopamine and your norepinephrine receptors but cannabis in and of itself does not increase your dopamine okay so now that's not to say that the it doesn't help with the parkinson tremor okay so you just remember that the parkinson tremor is there because of dopamine uh nerve cells have died or have been injured and they therefore can't act on subsequent uh nerves so it's like one nerve here that's dopamine releasing that acts on this nerve and this stops working so this nerve doesn't work normally okay but this nerve can be regulated directly by cbd okay so for instance if it's a hyperactive nerve it can be attenuated so it's less active just like dopamine would but it's not dopamine whereas cinnamon and the other dopamine agonist actually go in and give the body more dopamine which does the same thing to this to this nerve okay so it's called the different nerve okay and can we get a free consultation an initial consultation yes like i mentioned everything is free except for the products again we i don't control that but the whole assessment um this whole thing about perceive mb is free if we get referred to perceive is the consultation virtual yes yes we have moved to virtual for covid and also to better serve our patients um and also we realize that a lot of our patients they have mobility issues so being seen at home is better um yeah so for those reasons we've decided to go completely virtual um i don't see any more questions in the chat box but i have a question of course um so you know i think many neurologists might be cautious in recommending cannabis use and do you think this has something to do with the concern about the hallucinogenic effects or do you attribute it to something else and is there a high risk for hallucinogenic effects uh for people with pd or or does it just vary from person to person it's a good question so uh off the bat it definitely varies from person to person but the issue really how with neurologists or actually any physician who doesn't consider or won't consider recommending or or trying cannabis is really their own biases and no matter what i think sometimes um people may forget that physicians are human so they're just as human as anybody else we're we're not superheroes which is to say that there is inherent like we live our lives and we still get biased by things around us so you know if people or physicians have uh a son or a daughter who got addicted to cannabis or a friend's friend who got addicted to cannabis or they deal with addictions medicine themselves and they see people addicted to cannabis that they would say no this is not a drug but my argument for uh to that would be the opiates look at the opiate crisis that we're in right now okay it's a terrible crisis people die more people die from opioid overdose than from kovit but i would challenge any person to undergo major surgery without opiates no one would do it it's inhumane okay so the point being that cannabis just because cannabis has been abused it doesn't mean that it has no medicinal benefits because it does and so the problem is is that people tend to bring their own biases into their practice because we're just human and there isn't great there isn't great evidence yet but i can tell you that lots of things that we do in medicine don't have great evidence okay i'm sure that i'll uh some people here i'm certain of it must have been given gabapentin as a prescription drug in the past now i would challenge any of you to ask your physicians to show you what the evidence for gabapentin is and i can tell you that it's quite bad same with the opiates not great evidence for chronic pain use but we do it same with surgeries most surgeries have no good evidence that they work but we do it what i'm trying to say is i'm not saying that surgery is bad or that the opinion is i'm just organ pendant is bad or that opiates are bad i'm just trying to say that there are lots of things in medicine that we do that doesn't have great evidence because we learned over time that it works okay when your appendix bursts and we have to go remove it there's no evidence for that right no one did a trial to say okay if we didn't remove it versus if we did remove it do you die because you wouldn't be able to do that study but surgeons will remove that appendix that's all that's all i really have to say about that sure that's understandable you know i think that oh sorry just one other thing i just wanted to say because there was another point that you made there um that i didn't answer which is the other thing this is that most physicians think of cannabis as thc and so yes and i already mentioned it i am very cautious about giving my cannabis patients thc okay about giving my pd patients thc because a if they already have imbalance issue or dizziness at baseline and i gave them a whole bunch of thc and it just made it worse they're gonna fall and they're gonna break a hip and i'm gonna make them worse so for sure do i want my parkinson's patients high no usually not right but there are some instances actually when the disease is so debilitating that maybe getting a little escape from the reality of the terminal illness is actually a benefit but cbd on the other hand isn't doesn't have these issues right and so that's the problem is that a lot of the people when they when you ask them with medical cannabis they think oh you're going to smoke it and you're going to be thc it's really very far from what we do at the clinic yeah i was just going to say yeah that's understandable on the one hand despite its legalization for sure there is some stigma that is still attached to it and perhaps a misunderstanding between cbd and thc so i think when people think of marijuana they think of being high which is really attributed to thc um and a couple more questions here as well does cannabis help with stiffness so the rigidity i'm pro i think that question is probably referring to the rigidity that parkinson's patients feel where it's almost like things get stuck and the answer is is maybe and i don't know the answer necessarily because we don't we don't have good evidence for it and the reason that i say is maybe is because when you physiologically what causes the stiffness or the rigidity in parkinson's patients it's actually not to do with their muscles it's to do with their nerves okay it's the damage in their nerves that cause the sort of cog wheeling okay and that cog wheeling is if you can fix the nerves um the with cbd you can i guess theoretically or physiologically improve that rigidity now if it's strictly a muscle rigidity because there are some rigidity or stiffness from the muscles itself i don't know right there is some suggestion though that cbd is anti-inflammatory so if it's from inflammation then the answer is maybe it does help um but yeah i don't know the answer for sure okay great another question if my doctor or neurologist refuses to refer what do we do so you know if you try um and you really can't get referred uh we can you know we recommend usually like a walk-in clinic okay um to get a referral and if you really can't we have a no refusal policy all right and perhaps you can comment on this comment my mom was on gabapentin for years and it didn't do anything yes i saw that comment actually it's uh it's like what i said right the elements were kevin pence and it just sort of made me laugh when i saw it because uh i know lots of people like this and um and this is exactly one of those things we give things in medicine all the time based on what someone else may have told us and we've never really looked up the evidence and there's no evidence for it that's why gabapentin doesn't do anything does cbd help with pain yes and so that's why i put the slide up again to show you that it does help with pain your own you're looking at almost a 50 reduction and this is a really good question here how about patients already having hallucinations yes great question so in patients already having hallucinations i would certainly um opt for minimal thc which means that again like another reason not to just go to the to the retail store to get this different companies have varying amounts of thc in them so even though the bottle may say let's say 25 milligrams per ml of cbd the amount of thc in there is varies from accompanying the company some people have like 0.8 or 0.4 milligrams per mill and some people go all the way up to one or two milligrams per mil of thc and so if someone already has hallucinations our team would be very certain um to make sure we choose a product for the patient that has the lowest amount of thc in it um and this and and just mostly cbd uh and the cbd can actually potentially help with some of the hallucinations we have time for a couple more questions do you have patients who take is that patient yes so there are yes so i mean you know we've seen i want to say probably like 2700 patients now so you can imagine that we've seen just about every drug out there in terms of combination uh and so yes we have many patients on quotations it's a pretty common drug um and that's why our pharmacists work directly with the patient and the physician to make sure that okay if we're gonna start and there's a potential interaction these are what to look out for and that's why we see our patients regularly in follow-up so unlike you know some other clinics you know that may say okay here's your prescription for six months go away we make sure that we see we see our patients regularly because i mean it's a journey it's a journey that we go along with the patient okay and one more question here what would be or two more questions what would be the best time of the day to take cbd so there's no real best time to take cbd um it really depends so there are some patients that we have for instance that have predominantly insomnia issues and so we tell them to take it at night you know a few hours before they sleep but there are but but sometimes and it lasts the whole day the next day so it really depends on the person and that's something something that we usually try to help the patients figure out um usually the oral oil or capsule lasts for about eight to twelve hours okay and so you know it depends if you're trying to to help with the tremors in the daytime you may take you know twice a day in the daytime and at night or if you're mostly for tremors and it only bothers you in the daytime maybe you're just taking a daytime and not at night all right and what does oh sorry does thc build up or accumulate in your body so the answer is yes thc and cbd probably do accumulate um they're very lipophilic so they do probably stay in fat um but does that mean that you get addicted or does that mean that you actually get tolerant um and the answer is is we don't know there's some suggestion in the literature when you look at the addiction studies that um that people who use like a lot and i'm talking like a lot like 5 grams 5 to 10 grams a day that they do get withdrawal symptoms but 5 to 10 grams a day is is a i can't i mean for a lot of people they may not realize how much that is but that's an astronomical amount okay i think we have time for one last question here um uh two more questions then and i think that we can wrap it up here um i love that you guys have these really great questions thank you it makes for a better presentation i agree when we have that dialogue um how do we decrease drowsiness in the morning when taken at night for insomnia good question so you can either try to take it earlier in the evening so that its effects are not lasting as long so for instance if you're taking it two hours before bedtime and then you're finding it that it does help you sleep but in the morning when you get up it's you still feel drowsy or a bit groggy for a remaining two hours then you may push the dose back uh to take it two hours earlier at night or you can reduce the dose and the last question if using cbd should i stay away from alcohol i mean in general unless one is consuming a copious amount of alcohol probably not i mean if you're drinking you know one to two glasses of wine for instance a day is fine you know if you're drinking you know half a bottle of wine a day then that's a problem but it's not really a problem so much with the cbd because they tend not to necessarily interact it's more problem with the alcohol consumption and the fact that you're going to get drowsy okay great i think we can wrap things up now uh it's a little past two o'clock dr lam i want to thank you so much for taking the time out of your busy schedule to deliver such an informative presentation for our pd community it really was great and i also want to thank everyone for your great questions um and i'm happy to pass along that information that dr lim um was saying if you send me was that the referral form yeah i'll send you a referral form and some information that they can provide that patients can provide their their family doctors and you can look online as well um both on perceive md and concord medical center you know we're in the transition phase right now but i'll send you both information sure and then i can uh email it to the registrants today so thank you so much and have a great afternoon my pleasure thank you everyone thanks bye-bye bye you", "0U_VnKq42XI": "hello everyone I'm Rick boxer I'm a urologist at UCLA and I am happy to be able to speak to you about cannabis and the urologic practice my colleague Neil Baum helped me with with this and I always give him all the credit he richly deserves and so in the this particular program we'll cover how does cannabis work the myths associated with cannabis safety of cannabis and the urologic applications the my journey to learn about cannabis started when I saw a patient a number of years ago who had been esthetic renal carcinoma he was in the intractable pain and anything that we gave to him was of no benefit and so therefore we he came to me and said I'd like to try cannabis and what do you think and quite frankly at that point I had no knowledge about it whatsoever nor did my colleagues I thought about it and and after he came back and had a very particularly terrible experience because the person who was supposed to help him could not help him and it was about seven or eight years ago in Los Angeles before that was when was only medical and so I decided I was going to learn more about this and as I learned about it I wrote about it and have been speaking about it but more importantly I wanted to share my knowledge with my colleagues because this is a patient driven and a patient driven medication and people want to know about it and it's only the best thing for your medical care to know about it I'm in no way advocating it I'm just simply saying knowledge is important so with that I want to proceed the responsibility of a urologist I believe is to just know a little bit about or even more about the use of the cannabis now it just the tip of the iceberg is some of the conditions that may be helped and we'll talk about those conditions in a moment but there is so much to learn about cannabis and one of the problems is that because it's Schedule one that is it's not allowed really to be researched within the universities the Schedule one has prevented and has become an obstacle to knowledge which i think is wrong so all of us end up having anecdotes and stories by patients and that is not the best way of guiding our care for the patient we really need to have evidence base on medicine and that evidence-based medicine will come but first the obstacle of being on schedule one like heroin or LSD has to be overcome 95 percent of us live in a state in that has either medical or fully legal matter of marijuana and only if you live in Nebraska South Dakota or Idaho is a completely prohibited otherwise your patients have the access to medical or for that matter recreational but we're doling and we talking about access to obtaining marijuana for medical purposes interestingly enough it's been illegal for so many years and it's been it's been considered to be dangerous all the way back into the 30s and far before that but in the 30s when there was reefer madness or than the 40s movies that that portrayed it as as a terrible drug well if you go back you find out that the Declaration in penance was written on hemp paper and so people have known about this for a long time the consumption of cannabis is based on speed rate of metabolism and choice there are various methods by which you can you can consume you can smoke or you can vape you can hear this person is using a bong which is water pipe you can consume in in candy or foods of some sort and what happens is that if the person takes cannabis by smoking or vaping you they get a much rep more rapid concerned by the cannabis you it's eaten it's a much slower effect because it has to be metabolized well under those circumstances some people will take one or two pieces of candy or or a brownie or a piece of candy in a candy bar and say oh nothing's happening and then they'll take a second or third piece and by the time the third piece or fourth piece is ever consumed the the effect will become multiplied that's why people need to be very cautious when they take medication through food which is metabolized now it's very interesting to me that the vascular system the lymphatic system and the nervous system have all been well described for hundreds of years and yet the endocannabinoid system was only discovered in 1992 and as you can see from the receptors the receptor of CB 1 which is THC which is more the the portion that people think about when they think about affect psychologically or neurologically or cv2 which is also known as CBD and people think well how can possibly have a medication or a drug that affects all parts of the body I mean literally soup to nuts and we are urologist we know the difference and so we have to wonder what is it about this drug this Mitali the CBD or TC that really affects everything well the fact is that there are different receptors for CB 1 against CB 2 and CB 2 are principally the ones that that will affect things that your urologist want to take care of particularly in reducing inflammation or reducing pain and so when you understand that the receptors throughout the body are different then you understand why CBD and THC and generally marijuana will affect different people in different ways the facts of about cannabis are that it's been used for thousands of years and it's but I showed you the number of states 33 states and history Columbia where it's medicinal should be um this Columbia is also recreational um it's off-limits for scientific investigation it's classified as Schedule one as I mentioned be same as heroin and LSD and in fact there's more research been done on heroin and LSD than on marijuana because of all the laws and truly became a and has become a political plant and there's limited evidence for abuse yes it can be abused but there is limited evidence and that's once again because the research does not allow people to really find out what is in that plant the plant has a hundred and forty-four chemicals within it and we only know of a few so cannabis and evidence-based medicine is critical in my mind because that's what we've been working on as to clinicians all of our professional lives patient values and preferences and best evidence and clinical expertise all Center in evidence-based medicine and since it is truly a patient driven medication people don't will not go to a doctor generally speaking a urologist and say what do you think I should take and the urologist starts off by saying take cannabis that's not going to happen what happens is the patient comes in and says I want to take cannabis how will that affect me because it's um it's been controversial and and promoted by lots of different organizations and groups and of people finally the National Academy of Sciences the medicine looked at it and put out in nineteen ninety nine twenty one years ago of a book that showed that the it is effective conclusively effective for chronic pain nausea and vomiting with chemotherapy that is chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting as well as muscle spasm and MS now those are the three things that that the National Academy is founded it is conclusively helpful for but there are complications and that's why the complications and pediatrics and pregnancy is that you the grade there is greater number of NICU NICU admissions in women who smoke marijuana or consume marijuana while pregnant there's also premature births and underweight well you think about it if those women were to take any other drug even alcohol for example or or other drugs such as cocaine which are much much more addictive of course they too would get greater number of ICU admissions and premature deaths that doesn't excuse it but it just shows you that that drugs are bad for pregnant women there's no conclusive evidence that it causes heart attacks strokes and diabetes it doesn't cause respiratory diseases such as chronic like chronics cigarette smoking there is some thought that if you smoke every day multiple marijuana cigarettes it would have some lung disease or issues but knowing very very very few people do that and actually including in California for decades people were smoking considerable amounts of marijuana and and studies show that they really were not affected like they would be had they been smoking cigarettes it does not improve immune competence and some people have even thought it would be good for treatment of testicular cancer there's no evidence of that whatsoever but for cardiovascular effects it does elevate systolic and diastolic soon aunt after consuming marijuana causes tachycardia increases sympathetic stimulation decreases a time to angina and there is a slight increase in Aminah and MI for one hour post marijuana use so now just like everything else in life you gotta take consideration any comorbidities and so therefore if someone were to have significant cardiovascular disease you would say that it's a bad idea to smoke marijuana for any purpose now another myth is that it's a gateway drug that has been disproven repeatedly and yet it is repeatedly spoken about and so it's all you can do is try and try again the National Academy of Medicine in the Institute of Medicine in 1999 the same book that I reference before has indicated that it is not a gateway drug but what we really need is research not anecdotes so that people will be able to know what - if it indeed is helpful another myth is that it causes cancer does not and when a person comes in to be seen and they ask about cannabis in the medical in a minute and see that only has medical marijuana and frankly just the knowledge of knowing what in a state that has recreational as well or adult use as well the you just have to say let us look at what is eat what is allowed in each state and that is for the medical purposes but and also it's good reference for you to be able to determine whether or not there's medical marijuana that would be helpful in any particular state and you can say well I guess that's at least anecdotally if not evidence-based that it might be helpful so for example in Illinois interstitial cystitis is a qualifying condition for the use of cannabis and so if a person were in California and they said well I've got painful spasms because of interstitial cystitis you could say to yourself well it is allowed in Illinois there may be proof that it is helpful and I I can't god I cannot prescribe it but I certainly can say that it is recommended or at least possibly used in Illinois cachexia due to cancer is another common condition that is that people use cannabis for to stimulate their appetite terminal illness hospice care chemotherapy induced nausea muscle spasms that's why I put in interstitial cystitis here because if it helps them MS muscle spasms maybe an interstitial cystitis as well or for that matter other muscle spasms it's it's been stating to me how well in Parkinson's spinal stenosis spinal cord disorders and we course see patients that have and have those conditions which resulting geologic illness PTSD rheumatoid arthritis sickle cell anemia at least the pain associated with it intractable pain and every state has the the ability or I should say has stated that if doctors find a condition that is diagnosed as debilitating then marijuana in a medical state can be recommended pain is the most common reason for for using the medical marijuana 100 million Americans have chronic pain and so this is the reason why chronic pain is the most common by far and away the most common reason why people use medical marijuana others is multiple sclerosis chemotherapy induced vomiting nausea and cancer as I listed before so you can see that over 50% of the people will want to use medical marijuana for chronic pain why again why 50% greater 50% use marijuana for pain well in 2016 214 million prescriptions of opioids were used more than 60 million Americans consumed acetaminophen on a weekly basis over 30 billion doses of NSAIDs were were given and 80 million aspirins are consumed a day not all of course are for pain but that's 117 aspirin tablets for every man woman and child in the United States the opioid crisis in the United States is is absolutely an epidemic and unfortunately know about epidemics now but is that an epidemic rate as many as one in five whose are opioid addicted received opioids as prescription for non-cancer pain 11 million abusing opioids and a million thousand people are go to the ER every day for opioid misuse the the most chilling thing is 72 thousand people who die every year and that is more deaths there are more deaths since a year 2004 opioid than all the deaths that occurred on the battlefields in every war since 1775 it is a spectacular amount of people who have have died and as it turns out marijuana is a could be a substitute II and some individuals and does not kill and this is the reason why it doesn't kill I think that this is the most important slide there is why do opioids kill and T C does not and the reason is the receptors the the cannabis receptors are in the in this portion of the brain and in the cerebellum the opioids are in the this portion but most importantly they are in the brain stem for breathing and so this is the reason why opioids kill and cannabis does not there has never been a death due to overdose of cannabis but seventy-two thousand people a year die of cannabis overdose in the United States as time has gone on it's become more and more legal in various states but more importantly and in this particular sideshows it that Americans believe it should that medical marijuana for sure should be legalized sixty-two percent versus thirty four percent and just in 1969 when when I went I was when I was in college in medical school 84 percent thought of what should be illegal and only twelve percent legal so attitudes have change and that's why your patients are coming in to talk to you about it so the summary is cannabis is safe it is not a gateway drug and it has several urological applications you can see that annual desk 435,000 from tobacco seventy five thousand from opioids none none from marijuana a hundred from peanuts so you can see that even even peanuts are more dangerous than marijuana the finally one joke by Bill Murray I find it quite ironic that most dangerous the most dangerous thing about about weed is getting caught with it so the dangers are few the the potential benefit is great and in it in this particular talk I hope I was not trying to convince you to use it but I'm trying to come to you about and educate you about why some people do so thank you very much if you wish to contact me there is my email address I wish you a great day thank you", "pMMfp7lEyB0": "CBD is taking over the wellness industry the Center for medicinal cannabis says the UK is home to six million CBD users who take it in supplements cosmetics and vape liquids and with some of the best known pharmacies and health shops stocking up UK sales alone are expected to exceed 1 billion a year by 2025 advocates claim CBD can help with a seemingly endless list of conditions from anxiety to acne but what exactly is CBD does it make you high and most importantly to the bold claims behind these wellness products actually stand up to science CBD more formally known as cannabidiol is the cannabis extract but no that doesn't mean it can get you high so that's THC THC is the primary psychoactive component in in cannabis THC and CBD are both cannabinoids in the cannabis plant they differ because THC is intoxicating and CBD isn't and it has produces very little side effects to better understand health claims it's useful to split CBD into two categories wellness CBD and medical CBD wellness CBD products are available off the shelf in health shops and pharmacies CBD oil is one of the more popular ones but it's also made its way into shower gels bottled water gummies and even tampons people claim that the wellness DVD helps with general aches and pains anxiety daily stresses and sleep but there's little evidence to say that it actually does help with this and now the NSA is cracking down on the sale of wellness CBD products under a law they're classified as normal foods this means the claims that they make and how safe they are need to stand up to testing before they can be authorized for sale there have been a few studies now where they've taken bottles of CBD from health food shops and looked at what's inside them and sometimes they found that there's actually teach seeing them little or no CV some of them have alcohol in them to the level which they could be considered sort of an alcoholic beverage if companies don't adhere to these regulations by March 2021 then their products could be taken off the market the second type of CBD available is medical CBD there are a small number of approved medicines currently available on the NHS that contain much higher doses of CBD and there is some evidence to show that they may be effective at treating certain conditions that's epidural X which is approved for two very rare childhood epilepsies and then there Sativex which is licensed for like pain and spasticity in multiple sclerosis only doctors on the specialist registrar can prescribe these on a named patient basis with very little scientific evidence about the effects of wellness CBD and what the shorts or long-term risks are the Food Standards Agency says healthy adults should think carefully before using it and if you're pregnant breastfeeding or taking medication you shouldn't take it at all I also think that when it comes to CBD there's probably a really big placebo effect out there sort of global placebo effect because people are looking for something in their life that can really help them and they're not getting that from their general medications so then they're turning to sort of herbal medications and those having medications should be a quality standard that we all agree upon [Music]", "WMNFyC15q-Q": "hey y'all it's Cody from sleep populace and in this video I'm going to introduce you to my favorite CBD products for sleep now a lot of CBD goodies in the market promise to help folks slumber but in my opinion these four are the absolute best now what are they well you'll just have to keep on watching to find out all right first things first let's chat a little bit about what CBD is now if you haven't checked it out yet I highly recommend that you take a peek am i what is CBD video which I'm gonna put right there I think yeah and it goes over what CVD is how it feels the research that's been done into its side effects dosage all things like that basically like it's a full rundown of CBD as a compound but in case you don't have time right now or simply don't want to watch it I will give you a little bit of a breakdown right now but what CBD is so CBD or cannabidiol is a compound found on the flower of the cannabis plant it's one of more than a hundred different compounds or phyto cannabinoids contained on the flower and they range and feel and type but the two most popular ones are probably CBD and tetrahydrocannabinol or THC however unlike THC CBD is not psychoactive and it doesn't trigger hallucinations or intoxication it's usually used in oils creams and pills to treat things like joint pain anxiety poor appetite and even poor sleep I should also mention that it's totally legal to buy and consume hemp derived CBD in all 50 states as long as the product doesn't contain more than 0.3 percent of THC alright now that we've gone over a little bit about what CBD is let's get into my picks for the best CBD products we're falling asleep and I want to start with my absolute favorite CBD product for spalling asleep fast which is the CBD PM tincture from CBD MD now this little baby contains both CBD and melatonin so it is literally designed to send you off to snooze town in a flash and when I tried it myself I found that it pretty much did that within five to ten minutes of taking it I felt totally relaxed and like I was drifting off to Dreamland with ease another thing I liked about this tincture was that I didn't really experience any next state grogginess which is pretty unusual for a melatonin based product so if you're looking to fall asleep super fast and need to get up and go the next day I think this could be a great product for you another good thing about it is that a 500 milligram bottle of the tincture only costs $45 which is pretty affordable when you compare it to other see many products on the market next up is what I find to be the most relaxing CBD oil and that's the American hemp oil from American hemp and I say most relaxing because I found that this oil had a really nice sort of like calming effect all across the body within 15 minutes of taking it I felt like tension in my shoulders was being alleviated my mind was quieted and so it helped me to fall asleep at night for sure but I also found that it was really just nice for lounging around the house reading a book watching TV and when compared to other products that I've tested I found that the effects lasted for a longer time around an hour and an hour and a half so if you're looking for a subtle CBD oil that'll sort of carry you through an afternoon or maybe carry you through your bedroom time routine I would highly recommend this one as I found to be very relaxing however it's like caveat is that a 2,500 milligram bottle of American hemp oil retails for $140 which makes it one of the more expensive ones I've tested next I want to share my favorite CBD oil for general use and that's the CBD premium oil from CBD MD now you'll recognize the brand from the first one I shared with you all for falling asleep fast but this one is different in that there is no melatonin here it is all CBD oil and I like it for general use because it helps me fall asleep at night but I also found that it had a really nice subtle relaxing effect during the day you know if it was like a weekend day and I was just hanging out I could take it go see friends go to the gym you know do errands and I found that it was just a really nice Zen tone I was highly recommended for general use and something else I really like about this oil is that you can choose your flavor so you go on the website and they have like four or five different options so you can choose the flavor that's best for you and something else I like about it is that a seven hundred milligram bottle of the CBD premium oil from CBD MD regionals for seventy dollars which puts it in a nice mid range between the least expensive ones the most expensive ones and finally my absolute favorite value buy has got to be the CBD oil from some soil now here as 600 milligram bottle retails for $30 and a 1200 milligram one retails for $60 so it's definitely more in a budget friendly zone for those of you who want to try CBD but maybe we don't want to fork over more than $100 to try it and even though it's less expensive than some of the option other options on this list I'd say that it's just as good it helps me to fall asleep fast and it made me feel really relaxed during the day so I think it's a great option the only thing I really don't like about the CBD oil from Sun soil are the flavor options and either comes in chocolate mint or cinnamon and personally those just aren't tastes that I like well folks that does it for my guide the best CBD products for sleep for more sleep related content and resources make sure to go to sleep obelisk

Jason MacDougall I'm a professor of honestly 0 del University and I also too committee at the arthritis Society so cannabis is my family of hem the hem family and marijuana is pretty much the same thing it's just more of a slang term so we prefer to adhere to the scientific naming of cannabis cannabinoid is a hammock it's found within the plant the cannabis plant and it can also be a chemical that mimics the cannabis plant so it could be man-made or it could be naturally occurring in our bodies so they're actually three different types of cannabinoid there are the fatal cannabinoids which are the ones that are found within the cannabis plant the synthetic cannabinoids which are the man-made chemicals the pharmaceutical preparations and then they're the endocannabinoids which are the naturally occurring cannabis like compounds that a caramel produced in our bodies there were many active Cannabis the two most well known ones are THC and CBD THC stands for tetrahydrocannabinol and that's the psychoactive component of cannabis CBD is cannabidiol and that has been shown to be effective at controlling pain and inflammation and but it doesn't have the psychoactive properties the same way that THC does so medical cannabis is the cannabis that's prescribed by your doctor and could be an either the herbal form either a synthetic form and there's some evidence to show that it can be effective in alleviating arthritis pain as well as inflammation and fatigue different ways of administering cannabis can be either smoked or ingested in oral form baked into cookies or produced in the oil of butters but they're also synthetic cannabinoids that can be taken as a tablet or as a spray underneath the tongue different strains of cannabis different types of cannabis and they vary and the amount of THC and CBD that they contain and it's important to know that because they may have different impacts in various populations of patients we'll just like any drug there are a number of different side effects associated with cannabis and so it may not be appropriate for all arthritis patients so we really really need more research try and understand the safety profile of the different strains of cannabis there's been a lot of experimental evidence to show that cannabis can be effective in treating the pains of arthritis as well as the inflammation and helping with fatigue but we really need more clinical studies to try and understand benefits and potential limitations of using cannabis so further research into medical cannabis is required so we can understand the different subpopulations of patients who may be responsive to medical cannabis we need to find out the effective dose of medical cannabis some of the interactions with other drugs as well as looking at different delivery systems you", "pbawJAp7Khk": "cannabis use has been on the rise but one area of cannabis that is not commonly discussed is its effects on mental health so in today's video we will be discussing the effects of cannabis and its association with various mental health disorders in the united states more than 11.8 million young adults reported using marijuana in 2018 and in 2011 there were nearly 456 000 drug-related emergency department visits in the united states where marijuana use was mentioned in their medical records well what is cannabis and what is it made out of cannabis is a well-known drug which is known to alter the mind and body it is also known as pot weed ganja marijuana and many other terms [Music] people either smoke cannabis through a hand-rolled cigarette or through vapors and edibles cannabis is derived from the plant cannabis sativa which contains high amounts of thc this stands for delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol this contains a psychoactive component that makes people feel high the other component of cannabis is cannabidiol which is used to reduce pain and inflammation [Music] now that we know the components of cannabis you must be wondering about its effects on the brain and body [Music] when a person smokes cannabis thc and cbd go into the lungs into the bloodstream once the chemicals are in the bloodstream it is transported throughout the body though the after effects of drugs are experienced at different intensities general effects include increased appetite for food laughter and joy and the ability to hear see smell taste and feel drastically increases [Music] focusing on the short-term effects of cannabis on the brain cannabis creates tiredness difficulty in remembering information concentrating and confusion it can also lead to anxiety fear and reduce the ability of a person to react quickly thus making it dangerous to drive or operate equipment short-term effects also include psychotic episodes including paranoia delusion or even hallucinations however the long-term effects of cannabis use are severe the ability for the brain to remember information concentrate make decisions can significantly decrease as well as the overall iq these effects can be permanent even after cannabis is stopped and can be experienced differently depending on the person especially on age now that we know about the effects of cannabis on the brain let's dive into its effects on the body in the short term cannabis damages blood vessels decreases blood pressure and increases heart rate these can further cause the person to faint become prone to heart conditions or get a heart attack if a person continues to smoke cannabis in the long term they can experience problems with their lungs this can increase their risk of bronchitis lung infections chronic cough or increased buildup of mucus in the throat cannabis can be used for both medicinal and recreational purposes and in canada 330 000 canadians are using marijuana for medical purposes [Music] some pros of medical marijuana is that it's safer to use in opiates it's less addictive it's a great muscle relaxant it's less in tremors and those with parkinson disease it's ease pain in people with multiple sclerosis it's managed nausea and weight loss in people of glaucoma and research has shown promising results for ptsd however you can build a tolerance to medical marijuana causing one to continuously increase their dosage to relieve pain in addition it's not readily available in all countries as every country has different laws regulating its use recreational marijuana usage is controversial in canada it is legal to use and has reduced the black market network of cannabis distribution increasing consumer safety and utilizing taxpayer money for other uses however recreational usage has negative impacts such as its long-lasting effects on the brain and increased risk for mental health issues now let's dive into the age demographics of cannabis usage as shown in this graph we can see that the majority of cannabis users are below the age of 44 with the highest rate of cannabis consumption being in the age group of 25 to 34 and the lowest rate of cannabis consumers above the age of 65. but what's really interesting is that a literature review conducted from the year 2000 to 2017 saw that the highest increase in cannabis use was observed in the older adult population 50 years or older and specifically though 65 years or older had the greatest increase in marijuana use some correlates of cannabis use in the older age group were listed in the study and included being male unmarried having various chronic diseases and psychological stress as well as the use of other substances such as alcohol tobacco and illicit drugs question that often comes to mind when thinking about cannabis usage is how does frequent marijuana use increase the development of mental disorders such as psychosis schizophrenia depression and bipolar disorder and is there even a link between cannabis and these mental health illnesses well for starters cannabis is prevalent in 50 of psychosis cases thc has been linked with causing positive psychosis symptoms and neurocognitive changes by altering the prefrontal cortex and reducing synaptic density in addition psychoactive effects in marijuana varies depending on the amount of thc consumed also it is suggested that endogenous cannabinoids the ones made by our own bodies have protective effects against the psychoactive impacts of thc a study looking at risk factors of psychosis development cannabis users suggest that adolescents between the ages of 15 to 18 had more psychosis episodes compared to control subjects maternal cannabis use or using cannabis while pregnant may also contribute to psychosis in the child during later stages of their life cannabis and schizophrenia a mental disorder where people receive reality through hallucinations delusions and disorganized thinking studies suggest that marijuana exposure might be one factor that interacts with many other factors to become a possible causative agent in schizophrenia however there is not causal relationship between the two similar to psychosis adolescent exposure to cannabis is associated with a higher risk of developing schizophrenia compared to adult cannabis usage overall more research needs to be conducted to examine the complex relationship between cognition cannabis and schizophrenia several longitudinal studies show that cannabis placed individuals at a moderate risk of developing depression unfortunately they were unable to determine if it caused depression also cannabis was associated with increased risk of school dropout and unemployment which may indirectly cause depression thc has psychoactive effects which regulate mood and has been associated with increased anxiety symptoms several studies concluded that cannabis placed individuals at a small risk of developing anxiety however similar to cannabis use and depression there's little evidence to suggest that cannabis causes anxiety several studies show high rates of co-occurrence of cannabis and bipolar disorders cannabis has shown to worsen manic symptoms in those with pre-existing bipolar disorder and might also contribute to the genesis of manic type symptoms in those with no pre-existing bipolar disorder if you or someone you know is addicted to marijuana there are many treatment options available first it's important to educate yourself on the risks and dangers of cannabis see a therapist or join community programs to meet people who are going through similar experiences thanks for watching please make sure to like and share this video and subscribe to the demystifying

As Nate was getting into high school, the aggression levels just really started spiraling out of control. He randomly started running\ninto other classrooms, punching people for nothing. It took four adult men and\nhandcuffs to bring him down to the ground, cuff him and restrain him. At that time, he was taking\n18 pills every single day. And it wasn't even helping. I started researching the\nmedical marijuana states. We were able to come to California. I remembered seeing the\nbig neon cannabis leaf in the window, I'm like, \"Well\nthat's gotta be where we have to go.\" (laughs) (upbeat music) - [Interviewer] Why don't you\ntell me a little bit about your family, you have three kids. - Okay, my name is Jenni Mai. I have three sons on the autism spectrum. Each child is of course so\ndifferent, like any other child, and as far as them being on\nthe spectrum, Nathan is what is considered to be at\nthe very severe end. And rather than trying to\nfind the right medication, they just gave him more\nand more and more of it, and that was really the\nonly solution they had. I did not want him being\nchemically restrained in a bed, being (crying) taken care of by strangers. I'm sorry. I had come across this little video clip of a young boy who was just\nrepeatedly punching himself in the head. - [Reporter] 11 year old Alex\nEkels is severely autistic. His self-destructive\nbehavior brought on by-- - And it caught my attention because it was something that Nate had done. His parents were talking\nabout giving him some kind of an oil. I was confused, because it\nsounded like it was some kind of a marijuana derivative,\nand I was actually shocked and maybe even a little bit disgusted. - [Reporter] And after a\nfew months of treatment, the Ekels say they saw\na dramatic improvement. - Within just a few\nminutes of this boy taking the oil orally, he was\nsmiling, he was calm, and he wasn't hurting himself\nanymore, and I'm like, \"Wait, what just happened there?\" (laughs) I watched it a few more times, and I was completely\nshocked and desperate. - At that point, Jenni\nand her family just moved from Wisconsin to Missouri. Two states where getting pot\nlegally for really any reason is super difficult, but particularly medical\ncannabis to treat autism. Currently only 12 states include autism as a qualifying condition. Five other states and\nthe District of Colombia are considered autism friendly, meaning doctors can\nrecommend medical cannabis for debilitating conditions. So that leaves 33 states\nwhere you can't access medical cannabis to treat autism at all. - I was raised in the Nancy\nReagan \"Just say no\" era. - Say no to drugs, and say yes to life. - I would have never in\nmy life considered this to be a medicine, but I\nbasically told my husband, \"We have to try that.\" - Like most illicit drugs, the scientific and medical research of\nmarijuana has been challenging. But the tide appears to be turning. The first large scale\nclinical trials underway in Montefiore medical\ncenter in New York City. And it may be the key to\nunlocking access to treatment for children with autism, nationwide. Dr. Eric Hollander is leading that study. - I've been involved in research\ndeveloping new therapies and treatments, in\nautism spectrum disorders for about 30 years, and there's a big need to develop treatments for the\npoorer symptoms of autism. - This study focuses on a new\ncompound called Cannabidivarin or CBDV, it's an extract from\nthe cannabis plants similar to CBD, it doesn't include THC, the psychoactive drug that gets you high, and what Jenni uses to treat Nate, but it's the first step\nto studying cannabis to treat autism. - This particular\ncannabinoid has some effects on some of the underlying mechanisms that we think are essential to autism. The problem behaviors,\nthe destructive behaviors, and also in some of the\ncompulsive behaviors, or repetitive behaviors or\nperseverative behaviors, so it gets at a key mechanism\nthat we think is important. - There is reason to be optimistic. This new CBDV based drug is similar to one that's already been approved by the FDA to treat a severe form of\nepilepsy that shares some of the same symptoms that\nDr. Hollander is studying. This new research could\nhelp cement what has largely been anecdotal support of\nusing cannabis to treat autism. But while that research is\nongoing, parents like Jenni are moving to states that\nhave more lax marijuana laws. For Jenni and her family, that\nmeant packing up everything and moving all the way across the country. That decision may sound\nextreme, but for Jenni and Nate, it's been worth it. Their lives have been transformed since first visiting a dispensary. - We got home, and he\ntook a hit immediately. We got this one. - [Nate] Okay. - And within, not even five minutes, it was just like a light switch. He was happy, and just kind\nof looking around like, he had never seen the world\nin that way and he was smiling and looking at me, and\nI just knew right away, 'cause nothing acted that\nquickly or that positively ever. - Jenni has learned a lot since moving her family out to California. There she joined forces\nwith fellow mom, Ronda, to start the non-profit\nWhole Plant Access For Autism. Now it's a team of moms\ndedicating their lives to helping other families\nnavigate the challenges that come with getting cannabis\nfor their autistic kids. - I feel like a lot of people\nthat come to our booth, someone in their lives has\nbeen touched by autism, and they don't know that\nthis is an option for them. Other times we get people that you know, come to us after the event, they email us or they find us on social\nmedia and they want to learn. And that's kind of what we're\nabout, we're about educating. - We decided to take a\ndrive out to Joshua Tree. I had him vape and take an edible right before we left the house. He saw that I saw taking\npictures and most of the other pictures that I've\never taken of him in his life, it was kind of a vacant stare,\nhe wouldn't really look, he wouldn't really smile, and\nhe ran over in front of me and sat down. He sat there and he posed for a picture, like everybody else would\nin a situation like that. (sniffs) And I just, I'm like, \"That's it. That's basically his birth picture.\" You shouldn't have to go\nthrough the whole gamut of medications and side effects\nand long-term consequences of some of those side effects\nin order to get to it. Just look at cannabis as another tool in your tool belt to try. - Thanks for watching.

cannabis calm today we're talking about cannabis for seniors so we'll discuss why cannabis might be the most beneficial for all age groups we'll discuss why cannabis might be the most beneficial to seniors of all the age groups we'll talk a little bit about dosing and why that's so important what about drug interactions and then how to maybe gently nudge the senior in your life to giving cannabis a try hi my name is Andrea McHargue I'm a cannabis wellness coach and educator at reveal cannabis calm at that website you're gonna find lots of great stuff including a free video and a free recipe book for you about cannabis plus you can check out my online upcoming events or my online classes there's lots of stuff going on there so please head to reveal cannabis calm thank you here in Canada where I am seniors really love their cannabis in fact for first-time users of cannabis seniors are the quickest growing group which I think is so exciting but this isn't just a Canada wide phenomenon these same the same pattern is happening all over the world that more and more seniors are coming to cannabis because they've heard about how beneficial it might be so how could they benefit what are the conditions that some seniors are stuff is suffering from that cannabis might be able to help well arthritis is huge what about neurodegenerative diseases things like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's and dementia cannabis has been shown to help with all of those and there's many exciting studies coming up about this topic pain cannabis is excellent for pain helps with depression it helps with cancer and the side effects of chemo or radiation it can help you get a good night's sleep and a good night's sleep can make all the difference in the world for all your other conditions it helps with increasing your appetite helps with eye pressure from glaucoma it helps with brittle bones and there's so much more but seniors are also the group who may suffer from the most stigmatization from this plant even if they were consuming cannabis in the 60s and 7 is the huge anti-drug propaganda you know that just say no campaign didn't really get started until the 80s so even if they tried cannabis and loved it and their youth they may still have gotten the same program even but all of us have gotten about how evil this drug is so it might be really hard to convince them that there's some therapeutic value and seniors have lots of questions about this but there's not a lot of reliable resources for them to turn to it's very difficult for most seniors to talk to their doctors about cannabis because most doctors at least in Canada don't have a real clear handle on how cannabinoids work in the body so let's talk about dosing here because this is really gonna be make-or-break for everyone not just seniors but if we think about dosing we're thinking mostly about THC so THC is one of the components in the cannabis plant and it provides that high or you fork or stoned feeling at high doses which some people really enjoy and they need that uplifting perk but for some people that's really off-putting but in low doses you don't feel any of those things so starting with a very low dose of THC around 2 milligrams is a great way to start or you could avoid THC altogether and stick to some of the other cannabinoids so lots of people have access to CBD and it is excellent for pain and sleep and inflammation and for mood or there's some other molecules that the cannabis plant grows none of them make you feel high or stoned except for THC so maybe looking at cbn or CBD or some of the other beneficial properties that the plant produces or if you only have access to high THC plants THC doesn't actually grow on the plant when the plant grows it grows a compound called THC a and in order to get THC we have to heat it up so you do that by lighting your joint or heating up your vaporizer or cooking your cannabis for a bit before you infuse it into butter and oil and putting it into an edible if you do that process first which is heating it up it's called d carbon if you don't heat up your cannabis your high THC cannabis you're left with high THC a cannabis which still has many of the same properties it's anti-inflammatory it helps with brain cells it helps with throwing up and nausea it helps with sleep it helps with muscle spasms but no psycho activity so maybe thinking about THCA is a way to approach dosing and again there it is start with really small doses to start what about side effects so yes cannabis has some side effects all the side effects that you hear about are from high THC flower CBD even at very high doses does not have any negative side effects except for some people don't deal well with the oil that they're taking like it's a lot on their gastrointestinal system the oil so CBD no known side effects THC has them all but all of these side effects dissipate with time so just like when you're starting to take a new pharmaceutical medication and the doctor says you know you might have a headache or you might not sleep well for a couple of weeks but it'll go away the same thing happens with THC most people get used to the side effects and they don't bother them anymore here they are so paranoia and anxiety dry mouth dry eyes hunger no munchies sleepiness short-term memory loss like if you ever can't find your keys Racing heart and this is very startling for seniors the racing heart usually lasts about 15 or 20 minutes and then goes away but it's still scary and blood pressure might be affected so actually your blood pressure might lower because cannabis causes your your blood vessels to open up to dilate a little bit so those are some of the common side effects that you can get from THC and again that's very dose dependent so I always suggest to people who have lots of cannabis sorry lots of conditions or lots of or there are lots of medications to speak with a cannabis specific doctor here in Canada we have access to them for free you do most of the appointments just over the computer over or over the phone so you don't even have to leave your house in the States it's a little bit trickier you have to be in a legal state and then find a doctor who will write you a prescription some of the things that they might look for our if you or the senior in your life is taking prescription medications that the doctor has said to them don't consume grapefruit while you're taking this prescription med you must be careful with CBD as well the same enzymes that break down certain drugs CBD interferes with them so your drugs don't get broken down as quickly which means you might have higher levels of those pharmaceutical medications in your bloodstream then you're supposed to so it's important to speak with a doctor if you're on any um drugs but interact with grapefruit things like opioids benzodiazepines which are for sleep and other psychotropic meds and a sleeping meds all of those can have an interaction with cannabis as well and seamless um blood thinners I don't think I have it on here but if you you're on coumadin or a blood thinner it's very important to speak with your doctor I recommend Apollo of cannabis clinics I just really like their model of patient care and there's a link down below so that you can get set up with them if you'd like and here in Canada lots of seniors lots of people think that the only way to take cannabis is to smoke it and it's really exciting for them to see that there's other ways to consume this plant that don't have to do with smoking people smoked for a reason it's quick and it's convenient and as soon as you consume cannabis but via smoking you start to feel relief instantly it doesn't take very long but lots of people don't like the smell or the taste of cigarette of joint smoke so um people are moving to vaporizing which is a small handheld unit that heats up cannabis flour so you put some cannabis bud or flour in the device it heats it up and it vaporizes the molecules so it vaporizes the THC and the CBD and you inhale the vapor and exhale the vapor so it works really quickly but it doesn't have any of the same smell or the tar or anything that we associate with smoking so moving to a dry herb vaporizer is a good option for many people just because it works so quickly edibles or capsules so lots of seniors prefer to start with capsulized cannabis oil because it's familiar it looks just like a regular pharmaceutical pill so people are familiar with it it also makes dosing really easy because they come in pre dosed they come in pre dosed little capsules edibles are a little bit more tricky because they have to be metabolized and sometimes when you get older your metabolism doesn't keep up so it could take quite a lot longer for the Edible to kick in so just being aware of that that to leave a really long time between edible doses to make sure that the dose is working transdermal patches are great for those people who forget to take their meds you just slap one on your arm and then next week you slap a new one on it's a slow week slow release CBD or THC mixture under the tongue tinctures are fantastic too you just drop some cannabis oil under your tongue and hold it there for about half a minute and you feel relief relatively quickly within about 15 or 20 minutes again no smell and it's very discreet but in my opinion the like gateway drug for people to get on to cannabis is to give them a sab or a lotion when you apply cannabis cream - let's say painful hands or feet it works very quickly and you don't there's no possible way for you to get high so even if you gave even if you tried a very high THC cream you might get excellent pain relief but you'll have no psychotropic feelings so for lots of seniors once they see or feel the benefits of pain relief from topical cannabis they're more interested or curious about taking it in a different way so how do you convince the senior in your life to give cannabis a try here are some things that I've come up with just some thoughts that maybe you can chat with them about so lots of like we talked about lots of baby boomers once tried cannabis a long time ago and now they're coming back to it so maybe talking to them about the difference of how some cannabis plants are grown now that there's lots of producers and growers who are growing for medicinal purposes maybe they're going to grow the best strain for sleep or for pain relief it's not all about getting high anymore so talking to them about that talking to them about how cannabis is much much are potent than it was in the 60s or 70s maybe about three times as potent so if somebody was used to smoking a joint back in the day and they decide to light one up now in 2020 it could be a very bad experience for them so giving them that information again try starting with topical or maybe a capsule because it looks more familiar and be considerate about the cannabinoids you use maybe you stay clear of THC like we talked about if you have questions about this or anything else to do with cannabis please just drop them

notification bell that's the most important thing honestly you turn it on to all so you can like i said stay up to date on my videos but um real quick before we jump into the segment i just wanted to say so i wanted you guys feedback i think i'm going to go and we're going to do this but um so i'm thinking about doing a uh hour-long 45 to an hour long show like four times a week and just going over you know top top eight to ten stories you know putting a you know so you can watch it all the way through you know 30 maybe 30 minutes i'm going to be experimenting but i'd love your feedback do you guys i mean i want to be able to deliver more news in a more efficient way and then obviously then also what i'd be doing is i'd be splitting up all those clips and then releasing them individually so you can kind of choose if you want to watch the full thing or you know the individual clip um i love you guys feedback on that but regardless of that though let me know down let me know down in the comments but yeah let's jump into the segment okay so um also i want to say happy birthday to my mom love you mom anyway though let's jump into this article by bazinga this is by andrew ward this came out january 14th 2021 title is cannabis brand cookies expands into non-psychoactive mushroom space with caps okay fascinating stuff so you know plant touching you know plants right no not necessarily plant i guess it's more of a uh mushrooms or more but what is the fungi i don't know specifically but natural right comes from the ground and so they're obviously with cannabis legalization i think we are definitely gonna see an emergence of we've already seen it start to emerge but uh different you know mushroom legalization in other in certain places as well as you know we're starting to see you know different types of therapies like mdma and other other types of drugs that are really really useful therapeutically so i'm very excited to see that let's go over what andrew writes so there is so cannabis brand cookie is expanding its line to include non-psychoactive mushroom formulations the california-based company is rolling out a capsule line called caps the three in one item combined mushrooms with cannabinoids and terpenes fascinating they're doing that caps aimed to expand its consumer's cognitive well-being using a certified organic formulation cookies partnered with mushroom extract brand namex to source its mushrooms it also worked with manufacturer uh blue river to encapsulate the mushroom uh cannabis formulation so an expansion long and development cookie's founder ceo hip-hop artist gilbert uh anthony milam jr aka burner says the company has experimented with expanding its mushrooms for years the combination of non-psychoactive mushrooms with cookies strange genetics was a natural choice he says caps are available in two varieties a day-centric blend okay um so what's next for cookies and caps so the company just inked a supply deal with next green wave holdings incorporated plans to introduce caps to cookies branded retail locations later in the year for now the company awaits further legislative reform so it can eventually expand into the psilocybin space okay interesting so they're this is really smart though they're already starting to um you know they're going to start to expand on the non-psychoactive right non it's not psilocybin yet but they're going to be you know laying in infrastructure i've talked about this before if you use cbd to expand your infrastructure and expand you know expand you know get start to roll out your brand it's a great way to do that because you can avoid a lot of the regulations right but you're still establishing the infrastructure and the time that's needed to set that up so it's really smart but legislation obviously will depend on this but this is super fascinating stuff you know we've like i said we've seen the expansion of though uh you know the different the mushroom space right um and psilocybin we definitely will see in the next like five five to ten years we'll see a massive amount of different legalization decriminalization with mushrooms and i think it's great to see i mean you know a lot a lot of benefits potentially so it'll be fascinating stuff but i'm just going to end this here because i gotta go it's really quick i'm about to go eat some dinner with my mother um but yeah guys very excited for you know um let me know about the new format if you guys would be interested in that i'm just probably gonna do it probably i'll get the best feedback once uh once we roll out a few of those episodes but i think that'd be a great way to you know cover a lot of ground quickly and then also give more options to you guys you can just choose you know short clips or the long the actual full episode going over different news um but i'll give you guys more news on that you know i'll give you more update on that in the next couple days probably do the first episode here pretty soon but uh pretty cool though to see uh but pretty cool here to see you know cookies and other brands uh start to expand into the potentially the psilocybin area but i think it is from a business standpoint really smart they're going into non-psychoactive right now to then allow for laying infrastructure down for the future when there's psilocybin as well but that all obviously depends on uh you know political happenings and yeah there's just so much other news do i want to cover so that's kind of why i really started realizing i wanted going back to what i was saying i really want to do those full hour episodes anyways though pretty cool stuff to hear about from cookies my name is lmc if you guys knew the channel hit the

Daniel the executive direct to there's new regulate and in place there called the MMPR or the marijuana for medical purposes regulations patients are only able to access medical cannabis with a prescription from their physician in the mail from companies that are called licensed producers licensed producers are companies that have been approved by Health Canada to grow sell and distribute cannabis to patients who have a valid prescription it used to be that patients were able to grow their own cannabis or have someone grow it for them or actually buy it directly from Health Canada that's no longer the case in the current regulations patients are only able to get their prescription or their medication filled by a licensed producer and get their medications sent to them in the mail a lot of the in Meishan is found on the internet and there are some very reputable resources out there such as those found at the arthritis Society website other resources which are reputable include those from Health Canada that administers the medical cannabis program in Canada there's a lot of other websites that are available for patients websites that are hosted by licensed producers those are the companies that produce herbal cannabis but it's important to know that and understand that not all websites are created equal not all information out there is true and accurate it's important to compare one website to another to ensure that you're getting the appropriate information it's often very intimidating for patients to go and talk to their doctor about anything and medical cannabis having such a stigma it's especially anxiety provoking and it can be very effective if you're well prepared when you go to that meeting it can be very effective for you and also very useful for the physician that you're seeing whether it be a physician that you have a long-standing relationship or a physician that you're seeing for the first or second time it would be very welcomed by the physician if you had documents stating your condition with your treatments that you've tried in the past as what you've failed and what you're currently using and that will help them to determine where you are at in your disease course as well as where you might benefit in terms of therapies going forward if you're still nervous or anxious about meeting your physician to discuss hirable cannabis or any other therapy the arthritis Society has a great guide to helping you prepare for these difficult conversations medical cannabis a medication like anything else and if you and your physician decide that medical cannabis is the right treatment for you you should be able to have a conversation with your doctor about medical cannabis you should be able to ask them all sorts of questions that hopefully they'll be able to answer and help guide you through your usage and initiation into medical cannabis some of the questions that you could ask your doctor include things such as how do I take medical cannabis how do I adjust the dosage how do I get it delivered and am i safe when I use it what kind of things can I do when I'm using hirable cannabis can I go to work can I interact with my family and how is it going to change me other types of questions include is it going to affect the other medications that I'm taking do I have to be monitored in any special way and just like you have questions about other medications you can ask the same questions about herbal cannabis medical cannabis refers to prescription cannabinoids which can be capsule it refers to phyto cannabinoids which can be either herbal cannabis oils or even a pharmacologic preparation in the form of a spray that you spray into your mouth this can be obtained from a pharmacy physicians who are prescribing medical cannabis should be comfortable prescribing all ranges of cannabinoids not just the plant sometimes capsules are much more effective for certain patients and are more appropriate for any number of reasons first off they are covered under most public and private insurance plans and it might just be easier if they're not able to inhale if they have lung disease or for any other number of reasons so if your doctor if you and your doctor are talking about herbal cannabis and whether it's right for you or not and they don't bring up other options such as capsules sprays oils you may want to consult with a different physician who is more comfortable with the variety of cannabinoids that are available in clinical practice you", "LrPQrcRx0F4": "- Hi, I'm Dr. Tracey Marks, a psychiatrist and I make mental health education videos. CBD or Cannabidiol has become a popular go to drug to use for a variety of problems. If you don't know that much about CBD, here's the quick back story. The marijuana plant also called cannabis, is made up of over 100 chemical substances called cannabinoids. The most abundant cannabinoid is THC or tetrahydrocannabinol. It has mind-altering properties. The second most abundant\ncannabinoid is cannabidiol, also known as CBD for short. It does not have the\nmind-altering properties. So, when people refer\nto marijuana, the plant, they're usually referring to something that has a combination of THC and CBD. Marijuana is illegal in many states but more and more states are allowing for the\nrecreational use of marijuana as well as medical use,\ncalled medical marijuana. With medical marijuana, the amount of THC you get can be adjusted such that you have a\nhigh percentage of THC or a low percentage. CBD on the other hand is legal because it does not have the\nmind-altering properties. So that's the landscape of this situation. There's only one FDA-approved CBD prescription medication,\ncalled Epidiolex. It's approved for a specific\nkind of seizure disorder. But you can get CBD without a prescription and it's being marketed\nfor all kind of problems. Pain, anxiety, PTSD, depression, and ADHD among other things. However, there really isn't\nstrong research evidence showing that CBD consistently and effectively treats these disorders. For example, the Veterans\nAdministration did a big analysis looking at several studies for the use of cannabis and pain and PTSD. Now, just to be clear, they\nlooked at studies using cannabis which included THC and CBD. Nevertheless, in the\nVA analysis, they find, they found what they call, low strength evidence that cannabis may\neliminate neuropathic pain but there wasn't enough\nevidence that it was beneficial for other types of pain like arthritis. And this was using cannabis with a THC/CBD content of 1-1 or 2-1. The 2-1 means that it had\ntwice as much THC as CBD. What's low strength evidence? Low strength evidence means that the testing was not very rigorous or there may have been\ninconsistent results, like one study was positive while the other one was negative. To really have strong evidence, you need to see results\nthat can be replicated so each time you get the\nsame kind of results. There have been other organizations that have analyzed data and\nconducted their own research. And to date, the evidence\nis still inconsistent on the ability of cannabis\nand especially CBD alone to improve these disorders. In fact, in November 2019, the FDA published a news\nrelease on their website warning 15 companies for illegally selling\nproducts containing CBD. I'll post the link to their website so you can see the companies that received the warning letters. The FDA makes it completely transparent. They even give you a link to the letter that they sent to the company. Yikes. The FDA is serious. They even have sharing links so you can spread the\nword about their warnings. I don't know how I feel about that part. If you visit the site in this letter, you can see that it looks\nlike a great source of CBD, a very legitimate looking business. You may say, I thought CBD was legal, so why is the FDA saying\nit's being sold illegally? Because if you make\nstatements about a product healing or treating a disease, the FDA considers your product a drug. And if you're marketing a drug, you have to follow very strict regulations usually around showing effectiveness and establishing safety. The FDA also has rules\nabout marketing products as a dietary supplement. So why is the FDA being\nso hardcore about this? They speak to this on their website about their concerns for safety. Here's another page where they talk about what you need to know if\nyou're going to use CBD. As with any supplement, just because it's natural, doesn't mean it won't\ncause problems for you. Some of the side effects\ninclude liver injury and changes in alertness. Also, it's still unknown what\nthe long term effects will be for people who use it regularly. And get this, there were animal studies that showed decreased testicular size, sperm count and testosterone. And these changes even\noccurred in the male offspring when the mother's were given CBD. Do these findings cross over to humans? We don't know. It may not, but you won't\nknow until you know. Does this mean you shouldn't use CBD? Not necessarily, but it does mean you need to\nbe aware of the safety concerns and the fact that it may not work for you. In my own practice, I've seen people say that\nit helped with their pain more than it helped with their anxiety. And it seems to be pretty hit or miss. The reason I don't officially\nrecommend it to patients is sourcing issues. When I drive home from work, I see signs on the streets\nsaying, get your CBD here. How are these people\nmanufacturing this product? On the FDA website, it says that they're\ninvestigating some reports of CBD containing unsafe\nlevels of contaminants such as pesticides, heavy metal, and THC. So, I think we need some more control over how you get the product. When it comes to using CBD, I think that we're still\nat the beginning stages of exploring and recognizing\nwhat disorders it can help. The good news is, the research on the medical\nuse of cannabis has not stopped so just because we don't\nhave good evidence now, doesn't mean it won't come. The drug Sativex is approved\nto treat neuropathic pain and other types of pain, but it's not available\nin the United States. It's still in the clinical\ntrials phase here in the U.S. However, this drug contains\na 1-1 ratio of THC to CBD just like the drugs in the\nVeterans Administration studies. So, does this mean we really do need THC to get the therapeutic effect of cannabis? If so, that can mean\ntaking CBD alone is a waste because it subjects you to side effects without giving you enough benefits. These are questions that are\nstill need to be answered. So hopefully in the near future the science will catch up and we'll have a better understanding of what CBD can actually do and how much of it you need to do what you want it to do. In the meantime, it's experimental to use it for pain and other psychiatric disorders. Just investigate the source of it, look into the company that produces it, and be aware of the side effects. See ya next time.", "zYFmmX2MxZQ": "Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe coming to you from\nSpineCare in St. Joseph, MI. In this video we\u2019re going to ask: can CBD\nOil really help with relieving sciatica? Is it effective, and strong enough to actually\ntackle the pain? Or is it all smoke and mirrors and too good\nto be true? Let\u2019s find out! Before we start, though, I want to say in\nfull disclosure that I\u2019m not benefiting from or promoting any product or brand of\nCBD oil. This video is just my personal thoughts on\nthe matter that I wanted to share. If you\u2019ve ever suffered from sciatica, you\nknow how much of a nightmare it can be. It pretty much makes almost every daily activity\nuncomfortable and inconvenient. For many suffers, they rely on over-the-counter\npainkillers to make it through the day. And in more severe cases, pain management\nthrough opioid pain medications, steroids, and injections may be prescribed. It\u2019s no secret that the opioid epidemic\nis real, and many people have reservations about taking something that has a high risk\nof side-effects, including addiction. That\u2019s why the appeal of CBD is growing,\nsince it offers the potential for effective pain relief on top of being natural, non-habit\nforming, and having little to no side-effects. No doubt, CBD use is also growing steadily,\nand is being used for treating conditions such as anxiety, insomnia, chronic pain, and\nmuch more. So let\u2019s take a look at how CBD may help\nrelieve sciatica pain, and start by going over what exactly CBD oil is and where it\ncomes from. CBD, or cannabidiol, is commonly known as\nhemp oil. It is a form of cannabis, which includes the\nwell known marijuana plant. Cannabis contains a number of different compounds,\neach with different effects on the body and mind. The two main active ingredients are Tetrahydrocannabinol,\nor THC, and cannabidiol (CBD). THC is the part that produces the characteristic\n\u2018high\u2019 of marijuana, while CBD is associated with therapeutic qualities and is not psychoactive. Producers of CBD have developed cannabis strains\nthat have virtually no THC, primarily hemp plants. The oil produced from these hemp plants contain\nless than 0.3% THC, which means it is not intoxicating and DOES NOT have any mind-altering\nproperties. Due to that, CBD oil is federally legal in\nevery state and does not require a prescription. I want to note, though, it is also not regulated\nby the FDA and is considered a supplement. Next, let\u2019s move on to some key aspects\nof sciatica. If you\u2019re unfamiliar with sciatica, especially\nits causes and symptoms, and want to know more, I\u2019m going to provide a link in this\nvideo\u2019s description to another video I\u2019ve done that goes over it in more detail. So check it out after watching this video\nto learn more. Sciatica is pain that travels, or radiates,\nalong the path of the sciatic nerve. This large nerve begins in your lower back\nand forks into two (left and right) to travel from the buttocks, into the legs and feet. Sciatica has a couple main causes, with the\nmost common being a lumbar herniated disc that presses onto and pinches a nearby nerve. The other is due to spinal stenosis, which\nis when the spinal canal (where the nerves travel through) narrow and close off, again\npinching nearby nerves. The sciatic nerve is very sensitive, and when\nit becomes compressed or irritated by one of the reasons above, it may cause symptoms\nlike mild to debilitating pain, tingling, or numbness into the areas it travels. One of the things that makes sciatica pain\ndifficult to treat is that it is often a combination of two different kinds of pain, nociceptive\nand neuropathic. Nociceptive pain is caused when nerves are\nreacting to tissue damage, which sends signals to the central nervous system (your brain)\nthat something has gone wrong. Neuropathic pain is when the nerves themselves\nare damaged, usually through compression causing inflammation and irritation. So what is it about CBD that makes it potentially\neffective in taking on sciatica pain? It\u2019s this: CBD stimulates a part of the\nbrain called the endocannabinoid system, a system responsible for communicating \"good\nand bad signals\" throughout your body. When CBD stimulates this system, it can change\na bad signal to a good one, which may have the ability to alleviate both neuropathic\nand nociceptive pain, as well as helping to reduce inflammation. Currently, though, studies on cannabis, including\nboth CBD and THC, are still in the early stages. I could not find one definitive study directly\nlinking CBD use and pain management of sciatica. However, the process in which CBD works is very\npromising and could be an all-natural alternative to opioid drugs and other painkillers. I can say though, that CBD oil WILL NOT cure\nany underlying issue causing sciatica, such as spinal stenosis or a herniated disc. So please do not take it as a substitute for\ngetting the proper care you need from a licensed healthcare professional! For those sciatica sufferers that have tried\nCBD oil, please leave your experiences and results in the comments section below, all\nof us would like to hear from you! Also, if you have any other comments or questions,\nplease feel free to leave them and I\u2019ll get back to you as soon as I can.

they all have acronyms I can't remember what they all are the other marijuana cannabinoids are also important and a lot of research is suggesting that our bodies need these camera noids to be able to function properly but because of the way marijuana is looked at throughout the world it's becoming harder and harder to get these nutrients vitamins compounds one of you want to call them into our system now that it's becoming more recreationally acceptable is a little bit different but still we are not exploring nearly as much as we need to be in order to be marijuana is basically in everything plant hemp fibers can make clothing paper renewable fuel you know plastic you know the the marijuana itself the bud the flower if you will yes like Oh active properties has relaxation properties you know has all these different things and we don't explore it enough so I encourage everyone to try something new whether you have it if you've never tried CBD before try a high CBD strain or a high CBD cartridge fan or you know even they sell CBD crystals now they're a little bit expensive but they're worth it they help you relax but you need to try different things in order to really understand where marijuana is going for the future CBD is a fantastic compound that really helps anxiety depression stress you know body relaxation all of it in CBN is actually something I've been looking for in the closest place I can buy it is Vermont and you need a medical card for it and I don't have one so it's all just a big game at this point but I seriously encourage everyone watching this video to go out try something new try you know if you've not eaten edible before try an edible it's a completely different kind of high if you've never smoked dad pen before you use a dad pen if you've never taken a dad like you know I'm dab rig before smoking dad ready try something new as far as marijuana goes and then you will start to understand where the world is taking this whole product that's my little spiel for today I hope you enjoyed it hope you guys have a great day more to come", "2cJle9bsfV8": "Well there's a long history of research looking at the effects of cannabis in Parkinson's Cannabis extract contains lots of chemicals and most of the directed research is focused on two main components which is THC and cannabidiol THC or tetrahydrocannabinol\nis the psychoactive compound so that's the compound that will give you the high\nor the hallucinations and obviously that's not a desired effect! And if you take THC\nin combination with cannabidiol actually that reduces that effect of the\ncannabis to some extent We've been quite interested in the past and looking at the effect of cannabis in Parkinson's We did a study using an extract of THC and\ncannabidiol together in a capsule form to see whether there was any benefit for\ndyskinesia and unfortunately didn't show there was any benefit at all for dyskinesia We asked patients whether they felt better in terms of other symptoms There was a suggestion actually that cannabis extract THC and cannabidiol together might be of benefit for sleep or pain and those are aspects that\nwe're hoping to explore more There are also possible neuroprotective benefits\nof cannabis - in the lab work that we've done we've looked particularly at THC and shown that it has protected nerve cells from dying in our cell\nculture model, and we're hoping to build on that in in animal models. And it seems\nto work on particular pathways which we know are important in Parkinson's - so THC\ncan rescue mitochondria (which are the engine houses of the cell) - protect them\nfrom being damaged and it also influences a pathway which is known as\nthe PGC1 Alpha Pathway which we know is important. The\nwork we've done to date has been in cell culture models.

"P3rnV_ADXWI": "hi everyone so my couple days ago I think around saying the week's time on the loose Bruce cake lists had sent these here right that there's a little bit blurry but it's sunset cannabis oil soft gels and it's an indica and it's see that the THC there's sixty of them in here and they're two point five milligrams of the THC now if you do not do any type of weed regular or you just don't touch it or then this this review is not for you this is a review for people that you know smoke like weed what regular or you know also take the edibles now I mean if you're smoking like I don't smoke that much of it I I don't need to smoke my tolerance isn't that high [Music] like eggs not doing it you wouldn't do this because it would his tolerance is so high it's I guess it would be a waste right so I'm going to do it because I want to see how many it takes for you to start to feel something so um should be interesting so I'm gonna start you know I'm not gonna go crazy and take the whole bottle but I'll take mmm that's a little bit sticky the little cannabis little egg okay here we go Oh take that off okay so um it's 6:30 right now they're just they're just small hang on make sure none of those they're they're just like oh my god like the tiny little things if you can they're just small so let's start with five that's a low dose two three four okay hang on and this so there's five will count as I put them in the mouth that would probably be better okay so one to three I'm gonna do these two together Hey five okay and like I said it's 6:30 um I just want to see how many it tastes and then it would be good to know like if you're not a if you smoke weed or take the lo2 edibles but it's not like you you know let's say say you smoke like four joints a day let's just say and did an edible here and there then you know what this you may want to know how many of these you need they do have what is it two point five milligrams of THC and point seven point seven milligrams of CBD so you know why it's a win-win like you can if your body hurts depending how many you need it would probably not hurt and I'm just wondering though like I'm I'm just wondering this is why I'm doing this just to see okay so I'm gonna wait a bit um let's wait till I'll wait you know about 45 minutes that's how long I'm gonna wait and then I'll come back and there need a way well take not will I'll try a little bit more and then I will keep going until you know I noticed something and if I don't notice anything I'll tell you I don't notice anything I'm hoping I do but so I will be back and move on we will see what this does we'll see if it does anything we will yeah well see because usually like I start like when I get um edibles it's usually like like 30 milligrams or 30 milligrams I can feel like it's you know why did these I don't I'm not familiar with the cannabis oil soft gels the this I have never even liked sunset is the brand name so what if they come into effect faster or something I don't know I have no idea anyways I'll show you those geez I'll show you the bottle she's a little bit blurry that's not bad I guess right there you'd have to like stop it but there's the sunset the indica that's all the information there no you have your warning don't operate a driver machinery huh oh it says after cannabis use coordination reaction time and ability to judge distances are impaired no kidding second makes me wonder what will these do and this has our edge got these from one of a follower on YouTube on the loose Bruce keep lists okay I'll be back okay it's 721 and I'm still not feeling anything the sun's starting to slowly go down over there so I'm going to take small now a little bit sticky they give here if you got warm warm palms okay so there is four and I gotta get one more it's there okay so one two I'm trying to spread these out so you guys could see there they are five it's probably both 725 now okay they're going down to the belly so I will come back a little after 8:00 and either be taking some more or telling you guys how I feel okay so it's the last time I took those pills like the the five pills was I think it was twenty five after eight and then I decided while I did I made so I had to make supper and stuff like that so I did that and then I thought okay well you know I should wait a little bit longer so it's now eight forty eight and I'm starting to feel something but it's like kind of like you know like at at the end of a night like if I didn't take anything else I would probably just go to bed like you're like that like you're kind of like at the at the end stage it's a little bit weird to be at the end stage first but um so you know why I'll try another five it'll be 15 I'll show you if you hear anything that's just and okay so there they are [Music] okay so right now it's 849 I'm sure this is gonna be like pretty good and a little bit because you're just like I don't know like say this is this is it here you're just kind of like like there so I'm probably gonna go take a shower and let you guys know when I feel a little bit different or whatever oh yeah it's 1008 and yes these like I feel good not the point of like throwing up and stuff like that but um it's been like a little bit over an hour since I took the lot of stuff but before I go into that so thank you for thank you for donating board and there's like McDonald's and Coca Cola and cannabis MO and GoPro either they sent him like coupons or whatever and then over here money - whatever and then I put on well we put on on the loose Bruce cake list because he gave and said to put dope so I figured I'd show that that's the donation board [Music] you probably hear Edie he's he's um recording okay so this is what I'm I'm going to have to do cuz I don't know if that came in or not but my I think it did okay well give me like I'm gonna stop this I'm gonna look at the the footage fast and then I'll come back and then continue on okay so it did come in that's it's good like you guys will be able to see it about the OData the donation board Edie like he doesn't care what somebody sends me it said I'm a rock if you if you picked up like a stone from your driveway even a pebble and sent it to him he'd put your name on that donation board he's like it's pretty good guy but liked like that um or with that or however you would say it [Music] yeah like this is a if I would to say like how this feels it feels like like a sativa right now I guess like it you're not tired you have some energy but you don't really doing too much so and like it's 10 14 right now like 10 15 now so I thought well you know what I'll try five more and then that should be it that would be like a total of 20 but like 15 is doable but you're not gonna live Italy for like body-wise like how your body feels like you feel pretty good and oh my god I'm not even just let's not talk about that okay so here's the pills take five oh so you get a total of 60 so [Music] 60 pills so that would be if you're just never really did this stuff it probably last you like two months are close to it you know what this is like a piss off because like the bottles here and like my hand has the pills like there's one too well capsules in there like so I can't really hold the pill because my hands aren't that day and it's just like a struggle to get the last pillow and you don't want them to fly all over the place either so okay so there there I got it yeah you know what I don't know I didn't I should but I don't know what the price of these are but I would I would definitely I get some of these anyways wait so here's the oh my god there's four and then there's five so so they're all gone see yeah but like I didn't really I was unsure about these and now I guess I'm sure oh yeah I'm not really hungry for anything like I don't feel that I'm by getting the munchies I was like if I smoked like a joint I would get the munchies pretty damn bad but oh no it was today or yesterday but Tim Hortons has their pumpkin spice stuff like pumpkin spice flavor Timbits and donuts and and lattes and teas and ice caps and um muffins so earlier I went there and I had got a pumpkin spice latte and I got his cinnamon roll there that he likes cousin like pumpkin spice stuff and well he likes pumpkin pie but like I just cuz falls like the favorite favorite like my favorite time of year I just love it Hey [Applause] is the pumpkin spice nothing it's smells so good like I would I love the smell of pumpkin spice so much that I would if it can always smell like that I would love it it was so good you don't you could just like nibble on it and um it's just really good I'm for one of my eyes yeah I feel remember my eyes but I take I take I took a shower

pains than do the 20 and you know what if you need a little bit more than it's not gonna hurt you so anyways that's it that's all bye", "BzmZ_sb5dZk": "Cannabidiol -- also known as CBD -- is so\nhot right now. It\u2019s sold in pills, as an oil, in gummies,\nas a cream, a vape liquid, and even in bath bombs. CBD is one member of a group over 100 chemicals\ncalled cannabinoids that are produced by the marijuana plant. Tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, is another,\nmuch more famous one. It\u2019s the reason weed gets people high. So THC and CBD are produced by the same plant\nand their structures look really similar. Which raises the question: could you fail\na drug test by using CBD? Even though the structures of THC and CBD\nlook very similar, they act quite differently in your body. So far, the evidence suggests that CBD does\nnot get you high, nor does it produce any of the other classic THC symptoms: hunger,\ndizziness, hunger, difficulty concentrating, hunger, nausea, hunger, elevated heart rate,\nhunger, dry mouth, hunger, hunger, and the munchies. And what about drug tests? Urine marijuana drug screens test for one\nspecific metabolite of THC. They don\u2019t test for CBD. But there\u2019s two pieces of maybe bad news. First, because the structure of CBD and THC\nare so similar, some scientists were concerned that CBD might be converted to THC by your\nstomach acid. It\u2019s not too crazy of a hypothesis. Acids catalyze ring closures every day of\nthe week. And a few years ago, some researchers did\nin fact use a delicious sounding mixture called \u201csimulated gastric fluid,\u201d which is basically\nacid, table salt, and a few other things, to convert CBD to THC. But they did this reaction in a test tube. Or a beaker. Or maybe an Erlenmeyer flask. The point is, it wasn\u2019t in a person. A few studies since then have fed people pretty\nhigh doses of CBD and tested for THC in their blood and stomach contents, finding none. But CBD isn\u2019t out of the woods yet. The bigger problem is that, because over-the-counter\nCBD products are not regulated by the FDA, there\u2019s no guarantee that you\u2019re getting\nwhat the label says you\u2019re getting. Back in 2017, doctors at UPenn analyzed the\nCBD and THC concentrations of 84 CBD oils, tinctures, and vape liquids, and found measurable\nlevels of THC in 18 of the samples -- that\u2019s more than 1 in 5. The levels were generally low -- but possibly\nhigh enough to set off a drug test. By the way, in that same study, only 26 of\nthe samples had CBD levels within 90-110% of what was on the label. If you\u2019re in the market for CBD, make sure\nyou look at that specific product\u2019s certificate of analysis first -- this a test performed\nby an independent lab to make sure the label is accurate. Make sure that the lab checked for THC, too\n-- sometimes you\u2019ll see relatively high levels of THC, right there in the fine print. You should also know that CBD has not been\nFDA approved for concentration, anxiety, stress, depression, pain, or almost any of the other\nthings it\u2019s being advertised for. As of right now, there\u2019s only one FDA-approved\ndrug containing CBD, for hard to treat seizures. So, could you fail a drug test by taking CBD? We gotta remind you that we\u2019re a YouTube\nchannel, and not a doctor, but our conclusion is: if you\u2019re 100% sure that your product\ncontains CBD and nothing else, you\u2019re extremely unlikely to fail a drug test for marijuana. But, given how often CBD products are not\naccurately labeled and how often THC was detected in them, it actually seems plausible that\nyou might fail a drug test because of a mislabeled or poorly analyzed CBD product. So in the end, your mom is probably right. Better safe than sorry. Have you ever had any unexpected CBD experiences?

Medical marijuana: Here's\nwhat you need to know. The law: Is it legal? Under federal law, marijuana is\nillegal to sell, possess or use, but 33 states plus D.C.\nnow permit medical marijuana for qualifying patients. Thirteen states have passed laws\nallowing limited-potency cannabis-based products, and\n11 states plus D.C. legalized recreational use. The treatments: What does it\ntreat, and does it work? There is a growing body of\nresearch that suggests marijuana may be helpful for\ntreating certain conditions. >>Kent Hutchison: Not a cure-all. And\nthis is true for cannabis. The evidence base is\nsomewhat limited. The report by the National Academy of Sciences\nfound evidence for pain and for sleep and for nausea and\nmaybe there\u2019s some growing evidence for anxiety, but we are\nstill waiting on more scientific studies to be done. >>Other studies suggest\nthat it could help treat PTSD, manage nausea\nfrom chemotherapy, and ease pain from MS and other\nconditions. Considering the alternatives to\nmarijuana, some doctors hope more research will\nfurther validate  cannabis-based products. >>Peter Grinspoon: With cannabis,\nyou always have to ask, \u201cAs opposed to what else they\u2019d be\nusing?\u201d If they\u2019re using it instead of\nopiates for pain, it's much safer than that. So\nwhile cannabis is not without its harms, and it\u2019s\nnot without its side effects, it's almost always\nsafer than what else you would be using. >>The process: Can a doctor\nprescribe it? State laws vary for medical\nuse, but in most cases a patient would first need to\nvisit a state-certified or trained medical\nprofessional. They can't prescribe\na product or dosage, but can provide formal approval for\nmedical use. >>Scott Gebhardt: A\nphysician has to do a history and a physical\njust like a regular doctor visit and make sure that\nthey have a condition that will qualify them for\ntheir card. >>Typically, a patient would\nthen need to apply to their state registry, which\nwould issue a card that allows them to purchase\nmarijuana at a dispensary, which can offer hundreds of\nproducts with a wide range of effects. Remember, potency\nvaries by strain and form, and it can often be\ntouch to gauge a patient's tolerance.

and this video should not be used in place of real medical care if you have a medical condition please see your doctor now with that said let's get into it in this video I will be discussing a medical marijuana product available to patients in the state of Florida such as myself I'm a medical marijuana patient with my card and I'm able to buy these products legally here in the state of Florida with my medical marijuana card now that we've gotten that out of the way let's get into talking about the Delta 8 ratio true pot from true leave a medical marijuana dispensary and manufacture here in the state of Florida I have not sponsored and this is not a commercial this is just a video that I'm making for you guys because I like talking about medical marijuana products and that's just what I do on this channel I hope you guys like this video and if you do you could always give it a thumbs up so I can know that let us discuss the Delta a true pot from true leave made for us with the truly true stick battery ice or it's not a commercial I like to do the cheesy commercial voice because it's just fun brain so honestly I tried to be a little bit entertaining in these videos in addition to being educational because I'm really no I um I don't know I'm not really qualified not a scientist I'm not a doctor I'm not any of those things I I just like to read about the products to learn about products and I'm very very fascinated by medical marijuana I started out as a pretty big skeptic up the whole thing to be honest with you just a side note I didn't really understand it and I didn't understand how can this how can this possibly help medical patients with serious illnesses but I've done a lot of research and it's pretty crazy I also don't want you to think that I'm just plugging this as like snake oil or whatever I don't want you to think that I'm trying to make you think you should use medical marijuana if you don't use it already this video is for people that are basically already using medical marijuana or people that are very curious about the product and they want to learn more or whatever but it's not I'm not trying to tell you that like oh stop I'm not telling you to toss that subtitle I'm not telling you to stop taking your meds I'm not telling you to stop seeing your doctor I'm not telling you to do any of that [ __ ] at all but so ever I'm just trying to die just trying to talk about products man I'm just trying to talk about medical marijuana products so please don't get mad please don't get angry at me I'm just just doing what I like to do which is this for now [Music] [Music] you may have a lot of questions about the Delta a true pod from Julie I know that I did when I first heard about the product myself so let's go over what exactly this product is composed of what it is and then we'll talk a little bit more about the Delta eight THC cannabinoid which is one of many many cannabinoids that can be found in the cannabis plant so what is the Delta 8 ratio true pod and what's in there exactly so this is a cannabis oil vaping pod made by true lead it's for use with the true stick battery so this is the true stick of rose gold thing and this is the true pod that goes inside the true stick is your battery and the true pod is your pod for vaping according to the packaging for the product the contents are as follows the Delta 8 ratio true pod from true leaf contains cannabis oil and terpenes now what's in that cannabis oil exactly the cannabis oil in this pod so it says on the packaging contains approximately 125 milligrams of Delta 9 THC or THC for short 125 milligrams of THC 8 it also contains 125 milligrams of CBD so this is a ratio pod meaning it contains equal parts of each of those three main cannabinoids of course there are other cannabinoids in there too it doesn't the packaging that the product is composed of CBG in the amount of 0.9% it also has cbn in the amount of one percent of the product but the main cannabinoids in the product that appear in the greatest quantities are the delta 8 th see the Delta 9 THC and the CBD so those are the ones that we're gonna be focusing on for this video and really I want to talk a little bit more about Delta 8 THC specifically and what it is what it's known to do or what what we think it does at this point with the research that we have and the information we have available based on any research that's been done and based on the most reliable sources that I could find for this information which I will link below so that you guys can double check my facts and make sure that I'm not just spouting a bunch of BS or you can just check to make sure that what I said is true so I'm gonna link you my sources below so you can do some research on your own as well so let's talk a little bit more about the pod before we talk about the Delta 8 THC specifically the pod isn't just made of Delta 8 THC like I said it has Delta 9 THC and it also has CBD this is the first time that I've seen a product in Florida have Delta 8 THC so I was really curious to know what is Delta e THC em what's what's that for why what's the purpose I'm gonna tell you everything that I could find out about Delta 8 THC in just a moment again we don't know everything we don't know what I don't know everything there is to know about medical marijuana whatsoever and I know there's a lot more to learn there are so many different cannabinoids and we don't even know about all of them I don't know we don't even we don't even know exactly how many different kinds there are in the cannabis plant but there's a lot of them it's just we see THC and CBD probably the most out of any of the cannabinoids in products so this situation we have Delta 18 which sets this product apart from the rest with Delta 8 THC it's slightly different from l-29 THC again I'm not a scientist so I'm not gonna talk too much about what scientifically and molecularly makes this different from Delta 9 THC but that's what you're here for anyway so I think what I want to talk about is the effects that it's the Delta 18 is believed to have according to my sources to paraphrase some information about Delta 8 THC from the National kin Institute's drug dictionary Delta ate THC is an analog of THC with anti nausea anti-anxiety appetite stimulating anti pain and neuroprotective properties also Delta eight exhibits lower psychotropic potency than Delta 9 THC however it is also a psychoactive cannabinoid so it will give some THC like effect and I mean in this situation in the Delta 8 th c-pod situation you have also Delta 9 THC in there you also have CBD in there so we're not just looking at we're not looking at the Delta 8 THC to describe exactly what this pot is gonna do for you because it's not just Delta a THC but I did want to touch on what that specific cannabinoid is and does because it is in here and we haven't seen it in other products yet in Florida that I know of what jumped out to me about the Delta HC because some of these you know properties and believed effects that THC 8 is believed to have also come from the THC or from the CBD or from both like appetite stimulating that's it's known that Delta 9 THC does that too however in Delta 9 THC isn't typically believed to be an exile it ik or an anti-anxiety property with THC Delta 9 THC when taken in too high of a quantity your anxiety might even be like triggered by that like and I've experienced this myself I have most more recently started to experience that too high feeling if I consume too much THC in one sitting I wonder after having used this product if that would be possible with Delta a THC so I don't I don't know for sure because again with this product there's Delta 8 th see there's Delta 9 THC and there's CBD in there in equal parts of each so I don't know if it's just the Delta a THC that I'm experiencing when I experience with what I experienced with the product it could be a combination of all three cannabinoids I don't know it could be all of those and it probably is that it's probably the effects that I feel from the product are probably thanks to all three of those cannabinoids I would think because I'm consuming all three of them but I will say that if you're somebody who has experience being too high on THC and doesn't like that feeling and gets too anxious with that kind of a thing you might like this one because I felt I've used it I've used it multiple times as many of you probably know I am somebody with anxiety and that's with or without medication it's just anxiety I just have it it's just constant so so the prospect of using a product that could potentially heighten my anxiety is terrifying and I hate that idea and it scares me but with the Delta 8 th C pod I have had really good experiences with using it and taking multiple hits of the product and not going over my threshold of feeling good and you know not crossing over from the I feel good to the oh my god I am insane and I'm losing my mind I'm so high feeling I'm able to not cross that line with these products even if I hit them well times and when I see these products I mean the Delta a true pod but I also mean with ratio products like a CBD to THC one to one ratio product as well those products have been really really good for me because they do give me the psychoactive effects without the anxiety so that's a beautiful thing for me so I've had a really good experience using using ratio products THC and CBD one to one products are a very happy place for me for my condition and my and for my life so that's been great and the same is true for the ratio Delta a true pod I feel like it gives me an uplifted sort of feeling when I use it but I don't feel super high or stoned it doesn't make me feel super different and might like in my mind it doesn't make me think differently it just makes me feel calm and it makes me feel like tranquil and it just helps with my issues and my anxiety so as you can see I've used it quite a bit there's a lot of air in there the product comes filled up with oil to the black stopper bit and I've used up quite a bit of this one because I like it but it does beg the question for me does the Delta H th see Delta 8 th so you have something to do with the way that this product makes me feel because I do feel like it gives me some psychoactive effect a little bit but I could still see myself using this product during the day and being fine being just as productive as ever being just as awake as ever and being able to carry out the duties that my day entails so for me this is like a great anytime any day product even as somebody that doesn't have a super high tolerance for THC anymore and who does know what it's like to feel too high man what what's about the whole getting too high thing and I found an article today I was reading I'm gonna link that below as well so you guys can read it it was by a medical doctor and so that's always a good sign for me I'm like okay this is something I can I can trust this article at least a little bit because it's somebody that has credentials to be talking about this stuff who wrote it the lady who wrote this article mentioned that there was a study where found that just a few milligrams THC could definitely be the difference for some patients between feeling calm and tranquil that nice stone or whatever feeling that is when you only ingest a little bit of product and then crossing over into the line of like oh no my skin is crawling I'm freaking out I'm too high feeling like there's a very very small window for some people that takes them from feeling good to feeling not so good anymore I know that some of you guys are not worried about that at all because you are like Lak back in April of this year who is hitting the truth pod really heavy and is able to consume a lot of THC and not even feel not even feel anything probably like you are using cannabis that regularly yeah you you will need a lot to cross over from feeling fine to feeling weird you'll need a lot like so but for me for someone like me who can feel the difference between using a one to one product versus a pure THC product oh my gosh there's a difference there for sure if you are one of those people and you might like the Delta a true pod or just really probably a lot of the different one to one CBD to th the ratio products on the market where you have the THC but you also have a balancing effect of CBD that can help kind of cancel out the anxiety that might come from using too much THC in one sitting like I said there are going to be resources in the links below for you guys to read if you want to continue your research on this I totally recommend it I think the more that we know the better and that's all you know I just think it's cool to research and to learn more about these products that we are ingesting and that we're using as medical marijuana patients in Florida or wherever you are it's just it's good to know about this stuff so I don't know I've found it really eye-opening and really cool in my research and my learning about all of this stuff so that's why I made this channel and I why I keep making videos because it is something that the cannabis plant is so interesting to me and I keep feeling like my eyes just keep getting opened more and more to the potential healing properties of the planet and the things that it could potentially be able to do for some people and it's just really cool it's just a very interesting matter and you know the fact that it's just legal in some states but also becoming rapidly more legalized in more and more states as time goes on and the public perception of medical marijuana is possibly changing and shifting a little bit as the years go on that all is so interesting to me so that's why I'm here that's why I'm doing this and I hope that some of you like this video if you enjoyed it cool let me know in the comments what you think let me know if you've tried the Tru pod in the Delta 8 ratio strain or variety and let me know if you have anxiety and if you've found something that works great for you and your conditions once again I'm not a doctor and I also want to reiterate that I'm not here pushing any products on you and I'm not here pushing medical marijuana on you if you're somebody who doesn't use it then that's fine I don't know why you're watching this video but that's okay but if you are someone who uses medical marijuana already maybe you'll like this product I don't know it's not you know a little bit more about Delta 8 THC possibly and yeah I don't want people to feel like I'm out here pushing some kind of agenda on any of you because I'm not it's do your life do whatever you want I don't care and I'm gonna do whatever I want like that's how it works just we all have our own lives but I am I happen to really like learning about cannabis and sharing what I can learn about it with you guys and I know that some of you guys enjoy watching my videos so that's why I'm here that's why I keep doing what I'm doing and I hope you guys liked it so honest I thank you all for watching and thank you for being patient with me as I took a little bit of a hiatus from posting videos I do want to say you can expect to see me again pretty soon and I think I hate to make any promises anymore because I know I had a few times where I was like I'm gonna post this week I'm gonna post I'm gonna post this week it's gonna be fun I'm not dead I'm gonna post a video but then I didn't I wasn't dead I just there's been a lot going on you know I have school I have other things I have things going on so I don't have as much going on now though this week as I have been previously so maybe you'll see me more than you have been lately please let me know also in the comments or wherever you wanna let me know what else you want to see what what is the next product you want to see on my channel and we'll see what we

yes actually I had I haven't smoked weed lately but I used to smoke the lot so I'm sure I did mostly I get really nauseous with weed hangovers actually I don't get as much as with alcohol extra jiazi I just extra hungry in the morning when I wake up headaches decreased cognitive function nausea fatigue these are all symptoms that one company claims could come from a weed hangover jumping into a hot market lively has developed a supplement that supposedly helps negate these effects it's been approved by Health Canada for sale and is already available for purchase this little pill claims to change the game for weed consumers i sat down with Dimitri Buda bitching he's the CEO of fully owned Labs Inc the creators of lively hey Dimitri thanks so much for joining us so tell me about your company and what it is that you do our company's phoneme lab stink it's a mongrel based nutraceutical company that develops products that enhances and optimizes overall cannabis experience and cannabis lifestyles and how would you characterize a cannabis hangover cannabis hangover may be characterized by by the following symptoms it's you know typical lack of energy like a motivation like a focus loss of concentration may have a little bit of a short-term memory issues and so what is your company developed counteract its effects yeah we we tried we actually assembled a team of different scientists h DS and naturopathic doctors and we came up with a solution that would include very well known science backs ingredients natural ingredients these are non G non GMO our formulation consists of a set of vitamins set of minerals and set of botanicals but there is some skepticism so I would ask people if they thought this was tackling an actual condition I have heard stories about people being like hi at work and how it affects the way they work any kind of narcotics and probably have some sort of hangover I think in my mind if you have too much of something hell even if you eat too much you always feel like you're gonna be hungover on that in a sense you know but I do think it does have an effect yes if it is a real thing finally I wanted ask people if they had heard of any kind of hangover medication before and if that's something they would ever take themselves definitely I definitely think there's something like that out there yeah I mean I wouldn't be opposed to it I think I would depends on two things one the price of it two the constituent elements that are in the pill well many experts claim that a steady intake of water the night before will dramatically decrease or even completely prevent any sort of hangover Health Canada's approval of this pill may help you the next morning in case you make the mistake of forgetting that unfortunately it can't

"THC is the main psychoactive component of\ncannabis, and one of a class of compounds known as cannabinoids. Cannabis tends to be relatively low in THC\ncompared to its levels of a THC precursor, THCA. Heating the cannabis plant, however, causes\nthe conversion of THCA to THC, which is part of the basis for heating or burning the plant\nfor use. The effects of cannabis may vary depending\non the variety of cannabis plant and its associated levels of THC and other cannabinoids, but\ncommon effects of THC include: euphoria, sedation, stimulation of appetite, impaired cognitive\nfunction, analgesia, and anxiety. THC is thought to exert most of its effects\nby binding to receptors called cannabinoid receptors. There are two known cannabinoid receptors,\nCB1 and CB2---both of which are g-protein coupled receptors. CB1 receptors are found throughout the nervous\nsystem, while CB2 receptors are primarily found on immune cells. THC acts as a partial agonist at cannabinoid\nreceptors, meaning it binds to these receptors and generates a response that\u2019s a fraction\nof what other substances that bind to the receptors can generate. THC interacts with a number of other targets\nas well, but it\u2019s thought that its main psychoactive effects are mediated through\nits action at CB1 receptors. Activation of CB1 receptors is thought to\nlead to the modulation of the release of various neurotransmitters. It\u2019s not fully understood how this translates\ninto the characteristic effects of THC, but the activation of CB1 receptors in different\nareas of the nervous system may partially explain the effects of the drug. CB1 receptors in areas like the cortex and\nhippocampus, for example, may be involved in the perceptual and cognitive effects of\nTHC. CB1 receptors in areas like the basal ganglia and cerebellum may be associated with\nsedation and effects on movement. And CB1 receptors in areas like the spinal cord and\nbrainstem may be linked to analgesic effects.", "GcU_3pPWcqU": "hey everyone what's up my name is Jessica welcome or welcome back to drinks with Jessica today I'm gonna bring you all a little informative video on how to clean your system of marijuana this is actually something that I'm going through right now I had been on probation before that was like about a year and a half ago so I had to clean my system for that but in exactly one week I'm gonna take another you a test which is a urinary analysis because I am going to court to try and get my case sealed so I decided to put this video together and kind of maybe help out anyone else that is in need whether you need to take a urine test because of school because of probation or something else that is really common that I've heard a lot of people doing is they need to clean their system of marijuana for jobs or job interviews even so I feel like this video can apply to just more than one person and I thought it would be helpful to tell y'all what has worked for me and cleaning out my system so tip number one is to stop smoking weed the first step to cleaning your body of marijuana is to stop smoking marijuana the first time I went on probation I was probably smoking for about two years straight or so I'm mostly smoking every day multiple times a day and it took me over 50 days starts showing negative on a drug test and I'm a pretty tiny girl there's not too much fat on me and it took me that long to actually show up negative on a drug test like I feel like that's a pretty long time so basically if you're having your user it will take you a lot longer than just your average 30 days so be prepared if you are planning to take a drug test because it will take you a little bit longer however one of my friends that actually need to be clean because they were also on probation um it only took him two weeks luckily for him he's pretty skinny he has a very high metabolism and stuff so it only took him a week to two weeks so it kind of just depends on your body the more fat you have in your body the more likely that the weed will stay in your body because like that's where the weed is held in fat cells another mouth so obviously if you have more fat in your body you're gonna tend to show up positive for a lot longer and if you're heavier user you will also show up positive for a lot longer step number two the next thing that you're going to want to do is to exercise a lot I really recommend this because I feel like this tip really helps you cleanse your body exercising will cause you to sweat and which will help get rid of like the marijuana in your body I personally like to do a lot of cardio and then try to cleanse myself because I feel like that lets me not exercise as much but gets the job done I'm sweating I'm working off fat and yeah but any exercise would help I'm sure like swimming there playing basketball any physical activity should do the job I personally just do cardio and yeah I find that to be effective so the next thing is to drink water or teas green tea I heard is really really good I really like green tea and black tea those are just my preferences sugary drinks and stuff that isn't really good for you and my coffee if you put a lot of creamer and sugar in it like that's not really gonna help you rid your system you are not gonna want to doing cranberry juice trying to detox yourself because that's something that you're gonna want to do on the day of your drug test and I'll mention wine later just kind of stick to water and team the four tip I have for you is to eat healthy this is kind of like self-explanatory like I said the more fat that you have on your body the more likely that the marijuana is gonna stay in your system and if you're eating fatty foods that's just gonna help the marijuana stick to that really gonna cause you to keep coming out positive some foods that I've read that help get rid of marijuana and your body is broccoli I think asparagus orange is a really good um also fiber not to get gross or anything eating foods that are kinda make you not only pink but also make you go number two really help you cleanse your system because you're just flushing your body letting everything go you know my tip number five is to stay away from nicotine and CBD nicotine just helps the marijuana stay in your sister for a longer time than it needs to be CBD has been known to miss guy drug test and making them show positive for marijuana even though that your system is clean obviously don't know 100% if this is true or not I just read a lot of articles saying that if you do smoke CBD that you are a little bit more likely to show up positive for marijuana than if you weren't to smoke CBD so personally I would just try and stick away from that for the month while you are turning detox I have a couple tips for the day but when you are taking your drug tag my first tip is to not give them like your first or second key of the day is to wait maybe till your third or fourth I have you to hide a drug test at 8:00 a.m. and I literally woke up this is Phoenix sorry guys where was I okay so I've had a drug test at 8:00 a.m. so I even specifically woke up like two and a half hours before the drug test just to make sure that they didn't get like my first P of the day and if you're worried I mean that's something that you should really think about my second tip is to drink cranberry juice this day a lot of probation offices and even like regular offices that do urine tests aren't going to care if you drink cranberry juice or a lot of water to dilute yourself they just want you to go they don't want to be standing in the bathroom either while you're taking a piss so I really recommend drinking a lot of water they're not gonna care they just want you to go and do your business so they can be done with this product Thursday you know what I mean if you are going to a place that are [ __ ] and they're like oh your pees not yellow enough like we need you to have yellow pee or something you can also take b2 pills and that adds the color yellow to your pee so if they are complaining you can just take up one of those pills and then the last thing is you're gonna actually want to take the middle part of your pee you're not gonna want to take like the first stream of pee or like your last stream of pee you're gonna want to take with in the middle kind of like pee outside of the cup for like one second and then pee what's in the middle of like your stream I guess and then don't put with the end of it that makes it apparently that's like the best way to do it it's kind of hard but that's what you're going to want to do the last tips that I have that will hopefully save you is if you think that you're going to get away with not smoking weed and drinking one of those like marijuana detoxifier you're mistaken because those don't work I've known multiple people that have tried those and all the times they have come out positive still so I really don't recommend those and for all my people that are on probation I have known a guy that saw someone do this this kid brought in somebody else's pee to put in the cup you automatically get charged with the felony if you bring someone else's pee for a UA so really don't do that it's done like they still test you even if you get caught and this kid actually came out negative so he got charged with a felony but still came out negative so that really sucks I don't recommend it no matter what if like you're worried about it whatever just go in and take the test because like you never know try all these things it might work out for you if you're really really really worried about it then I would recommend just drinking so much water in so much cranberry juice so those are all the tips that I have I really hope that this video is helpful for someone and helps you detox up marijuana and I can't wait to start smoking again I've been so ready to start smoking again yeah that's basically it thank you so much for watching please subscribe or like this video and I'll see you all in my next video bye guys", "rTae4UVA-aU": "there hello gorgeous we are making medicine and the medicine that's been utilized is CBD and that's an agent that has been proven to help treat patients with intractable epilepsy CBD is a non psychoactive compound so by inhaling it or ingesting it or just in taking it into your body you're not going to have that psychoactive response to taking that medicine so our first step is we're gonna take the feedstock material from cultivation you dry it out and then we actually blend it down so it's in a workable form once it's in that state we go through an extraction at which point we're going to receive or capture a crude oil extract from that we go through a series of purification methods in order to concentrate it even further we're creating a tincture or a capsule or any other product you can imagine that it's going to be delighted to treat somebody cannabis is being utilized in a wide variety of applications and there's a lot of data out there that supports the efficacy to its use and so hopefully we see a national kind of revolution for the use in treatment using medical marijuana products", "maYo_VHRg_c": "I do want to quickly bring into the conversation the chief medical director of a medical marijuana clinic dr. Bonnie Goldstein you prescribed medical marijuana and dr. Ordon raised some really interesting points of when might you be able to substitute a more dangerous medication with one if appropriately prescribed marijuana could provides benefits how often are you seeing this in your clinic so in my practice I'm absolutely seeing patients get off of prescription medications opioids is the number one their pain medications like non-steroidal anti-inflammatories anxiety medications sleeping pills for sure also other things that for some patients they're on multiple medications for certain conditions and what's happening is they're able to at least back down to maybe one or two instead of three or four one of my patients even called cannabis the one-stop shop because she was on pain medicine anxiety medication depression medication and sleeping pills and she was able at the age of 27 she was on all of those medications and was able to get off specifically in the elderly I'm just curious are there more concerns about say side-effects or do you have to think about the dosing differently if this is something a senior is truly considering we have to be very careful with dosing and the general rule from in the cannabis industry is start low and go slow start very low dose and titrate up but what I also recommend which many people don't realize is that there's a lot of combination products out there that have both CBD and THC and studies show that they work better when they're together so not all of one or all of the other and what happened in California is we kind of went one way towards the THC as medical cannabis moved on and now in CBD is being reintroduced combination products allow the CBD to buffer a lot of the unwanted side effects of THC but still help with the underlying medical condition should seniors who are already on other medications out there specific interactions they should be aware of yes there can be interactions and certainly so things like blood pressure medication if you take too much cannabis on top of your blood pressure medication your blood pressure can go down and you are at a risk of fall especially if you're getting up out of bed to use the restroom or something like that we also know that blood thinners can interact with some of these medications and many elderly are on those and so it's always good if you're on other medication to have a physician who understands cannabis to at least go over medications with you so that you can make sure you can avoid those kinds of interaction raise that red flag because that is the one concern I had watching this segment and my one concern as I've seen the evolution of the marijuana industry rapidly growing over the last few years it's that I do believe that marijuana has a valid place in medical treatment we will only learn more and more about how to dose more doctors will specialize as you do but then there's this other side of it where it's just one big party how do we bridge that gap where people all of us take marijuana seriously as a medical treatment well I think for most people you know if you overdose on cannabis it's very psychologically uncomfortable it's it's trippy what I call it and I tell people once you do that you're never going to go back there again most people know how much is too much and they usually figure it out but in general I think that some of the new regulations coming out are good regulations edibles should not have a thousand milligrams in them it should be limited to a smaller amount because some people see a candy bar package and you even showed it up on your screen 180 milligrams that's many many doses for most people that is not and most people see a candy bar and say oh I'll eat the whole thing so unfortunately without regulations it got a little bit crazy but I think the regulations are going to help especially with the edibles in general with the other types of property of compounds that are out there like topicals or inhaling most people are able to regulate it and figure out what works best and I'm glad with kids and adults to adults like their sweets because you both seem concerned that they were lowering the dosage now but 10 milligrams of THC is a significant dose for someone who's naive to it I mean I would argue that that's maybe too much if you're trying you know that's a big dose of sort of me that's a good development and I could tell you you express some concerns from the elderly that they were putting that requirement in place it sounds like the seniors you were discussing know how to they do and a lot of it very trial and error themselves so for you how did they find like how do your patients find you where do they go for resources on this so they can safely think about incorporating this if this is something they're open to well most people are going online and looking to see who might specialize in this there's just about a medical cannabis conference almost every week somewhere in the United States where you're going to find doctors that are learning about this it needs to be in the toolbox of every doctor now because if you're practicing you know family practice and you're writing prescriptions for all kinds of different medications this is just another tool in the toolbox to be able to talk to your patients about and again doctors are free to talk to their patients about medical cannabis as long as they don't misrepresent anything I think many doctors think they'll put their license at risk if they talk to their patients about this but they will not we are free to speak about it with our patients I will say Leslie

Tom chives and I'm Tracy McCray recently the US Food and Drug Administration approved a form of medical marijuana for the treatment of seizures associated with two rare and severe forms of epilepsy and it really seems like we hear more and more about people using marijuana to treat all sorts of medical problems and to help overcome the side effects of some traditional medical treatments 30 states and the District of Columbia currently have laws legalizing medical marijuana in some form here to discuss is internal medicine specialist and addiction expert dr. John Ebert so medical marijuana legitimate for medical use so since we last spoke about this the National Academies of science came out with a report and that report essentially summarizes all the available medical literature looking at the efficacy or the effectiveness of it and the safety of medical cannabis and what they found was that it is very effective for three specific conditions and one of them is spasticity the other one is chronic pain what was that first one it's so spasticity so muscle spasms so some people that have spinal cord injuries or some people who have multiple sclerosis can have incredibly painful spasticity the muscles spontaneously spasm very painful it's like a charley horse but constantly okay right it's effective for that it's effective for nausea and it's effective for chronic pain and specifically neuropathic pain or pain that comes from a nerve so what's interesting about their findings is they didn't have a lot of data that actually supported that it was truly effective for the indication that the new drug approved by the FDA is indicated for which is which is epilepsy or these severe forms of epilepsy there is some existing data but but they didn't have a lot I think it's important for patients who are interested to are interested in exploring this as a methodology to talk to their clinicians and and and really ask the question would it seem like the the condition that I have might be effectively treated by medical cannabis and those clinicians I think need to have that information or there is if that information is available on the internet and can be searched and can be learned so that they can share that with their patients is there some science behind it you know why it works yeah so there's been lots of science in the space which has somewhat been impeded by the fact that under federal law medical cannabis is illegal so there's no research so there is there has been research okay um you can actually and there has and is ongoing research so it is possible to have approval to do research with medical cannabis so there's there's research suggesting that is effective for these conditions so why why does it work well what's interesting about so I certify patients for medical cannabis and when I speak with these patients a lot of them are interested in medical cannabis because they nothing else really seems to have worked and most of the patients that have certified have been for chronic pain they say I want to try something new and I say it might be effective for pain and one of the things that they they really struggle with as some of those preconceived notions about what it is to smoke pot you people are traditionally smoked tied in what it is to use medical cannabis very different experiences so if someone smoked their medical marijuana cigarette for non-medicinal purposes you get a hundred and four different chemicals in there states like Minnesota that we are in now have actually limited their program to two of those chemicals so of the hundred and four possible chemicals that you get when you smoke a joint if you will you only get two of them in Minnesota and those two are tetrahydrocannabinol which is the the molecule that gets people high when they smoke in cannabidiol now we think that the cannabidiol has some very interesting important therapeutic properties it doesn't work like tetrahydrocannabinol but it can actually help with pain as an inflammatory it can actually help with pain to reduce nerve transmission which is how it might be working for seizures and epilepsy that new medication approved by the FDA which I'm not sure if I can mention on the air here or not but that new medication is basically just pure CBD or cannabidiol and most of the states have that as one of the molecules that you can get when you are when you're subscribed or you're approved for medical marijuana in your state so in the state of Minnesota the use of marijuana is illegal but it is legal for medical purposes is that right so so it's a great question so under federal law it is a Schedule one anything derived from cannabis sativa which is the parent plant for cannabis sativa and cannabis indica the two main types of plants we think about as being the source for cannabis cannabis any derivative of cannabis so any extracted molecule from it or any part of the plant is illegal under federal law it's a Schedule one de a medication saying there's no approved use so basically that's where heroin lives and LSD and ecstasy they're all scheduled ones so we can't use it clinically the states have decided based on states rights issues that we as states will approve it for not only medical use but recreational use and the way they've indemnified clinicians like myself or protected them from losing their license is essentially all we do as providers and most of the states are set up this way as we as providers just certify that the patients have a qualifying condition now those qualifying conditions vary by state we have thirteen in Minnesota different states have different ones and some of them have approval for depression and anxiety we don't have depression anxiety for example so it varies by state and some states actually give their providers the opportunity to say it might be helpful for this I'm gonna prove you for this and basically the state then sub contracts with companies who sell the the product through dispensed Suri's so if i came to you and you were convinced that i had chronic pain or particularly if it was neuropathic nerve type pain and eyes and you said okay i'll give you a prescription where would I get it filled and what would it be so a good point so we would never prescribe it we can't prescribe it because no pharmacy dispenses it so I would certify you and say you have chronic pain and I would go into the the the database basically from the Minnesota it's actually run through the Department Health I've actually looked at all the states that have medical cannabis laws and most of them run them through the Department of Health one one state had through the Department of Commerce and so but most are run by the Department of Health so it's not some fly-by-night it's actually the the State Department of Health running these these these these programs so I would certify you for chronic pain and then what would happen is you would get an email saying you're certified and then at least in Minnesota two weeks later if you paid your processing fee you would get a essentially a car to go into the dispensary and you would work with the pharmacist employed by the companies contracted with the states and they would actually recommend products for you to use when we're just about out of time we are yes I know when you came in you said the one thing I need to do is unseat the myth so what myths do you want to set straight so I think there's a lot of preconceived notions among the patients that come in and they say well I don't want to smoke pot and I don't want to do these things and and the grandkids are laughing at me and these sorts of things and it's a very different experience and so I've tried to do two things I try to not use the term marijuana I try to use the term cannabis I think we need to look legitimate it as a therapy I need we we need we need more data but I would legitimize it and patients are worried about addiction there's no there's no data suggesting that it that the at least the products that we are providing in a medicinal manner or addictive there that patients will not become addicted these in fact some of these molecules that we're giving them have actually been used to treat addiction such as cannabidiol Wow well interesting right I guess we've come a long ways we have and we will continue to so you or you think truly for certain conditions marijuana well you don't call it marijuana kanata cannabis cannabis yes is is okay it seems to be effective so yes the data is clear that in some conditions medical cannabis is effective for those treatment of those conditions all right we've been talking about the use of medical marijuana with internal medicine specialists and addiction specialists doctor dr. John Ebert thanks so much for being with us dr. Hebert thanks for having me", "fYMCA_Tg_vk": "Welcome to Endoca's beautiful organic\ncannabis fields. Come I'll show you Well, in order to make a good cannabis extract\nyou need good starting plant material. In my hand I have a cannabis plant it\nsmells fantastic. In order to make a nice extract you need to obviously dry the\nplant material first. Come let's go to the lab I'll show you how to make an\nextract. Welcome to Endoca. My name is Henry Vincente and today I will show you\nhow to cannabis extraction using ethanol We will use cannabis material which is\nthe leaves and the flowers all in one Very important to use organic so that you\nknow there is nothing inside that can harm you. There are over 4,000 different\nvarieties of cannabis now the one I chose has a lot of CBD inside. You could\napply the same method or what kind of cannabinoid eschews so called ethanol\ntake a ball put the plant material inside so the process has to be very\nfast. You don't want the ethanol to touch the plant material to a long time. If it\ndoes you get a lot of other stuff inside which you don't want. You just use enough\nethanol to cover so that we can separate the plant material from the cannabinoids. You need to be fast in this process because we can only stir for three\nminutes so I use a plastic spoon. You don't use mechanical devices because you\ndon't want to create a spark. If I create a spark now everything will burn. You mix\nwell then we have to separate the ethanol from the plant material. I do\nsimply by taking a sieve and put it in another Bowl. It can drip a little bit\nyou know there's still some alcohol left This was the first filtration now we're\ngoing to do the second filtration in order to remove the plant material you\nhave left, and we do that by using a simple coffee machine\nIt can heat your material and it can filtrate and we start with the\nfiltration part coffee filter, take your spoon you take now the material on the liquid\nand you pour it into the filter paper and you see the process starts. In order\nto accelerate the process we change the paper, every time a single filtration has\noccurred if you have more material you just continue until you don't have any\nmore, and like this and it's dripping beautifully. Now it's time to cook so\nwhen you cook at home you can use many different things I have here an example\nof a rice cooker which works fine a pot and a heating device works also fine and\na water distiller. Now my favorite is the water distiller because if you cook with\nany of these methods we need a cleanroom box like this for those of you who\ndoesn't have a box like this you can cook outside but to make it all easier\nlet's use the water distiller. Now this is the process where we separate the\nethanol from the cannabinoids. The time it will take for the full separation\ndepends of course of how much material you put inside I use a bowl to collect\nthe pure ethanol that's going to come out here because you can you reuse it\nagain and again we give it some juice and we wait so now the question is when\nto stop I can see I have 80% of my original ethanol volume so that's\nindication that it's time to see what's going on inside you open the lid slowly\nand look inside and you can see that is very little material in my case this is\nthe time to stop just to be sure not to breathe it here we go and be careful\nwhen you pour because there's very little material you don't want to lose\nit and now I'm going to show you the final step using the coffee machine what\nwe have to do is remove the remaining ethanol from our extract put it on the\nheating device turn it on and we wait best is to wait for 24 hours so that\nyou're sure that no ethanol is left I already did this and as you can see from\nall the work with it we have very little material the final test is a quality\ntest we do it by using a paperclip dipping it into the material and you use\na lighter you light it fast and see what happens if there is a spark you know there is \nstill ethanol left so you can see comparison see it's burning then you\nneed to put it back on the heater but in our case it was well done. To make a\ncannabis extract at home you need a lighter\nfilter coffee machine some small bowls, two bowls\nsieve plastic spoon coffee filters alcohol cannabis. Put the cannabis into\nthe bowl cover with cold alcohol steer three minutes with plastic spoon filter\nthe alcohol through the sieve filter again through the coffee filter it still\nuntil 80 percent of the initial alcohol volume is gone pour into a small ball\nhit the small ball with the coffee machine for 24 hours to remove the\nremaining alcohol. To check if there is any remaining alcohol use a small spoon\nand the lighter if there is any remaining alcohol the product will\nproduce sparks when burning with a lighter keep heating until you don't get\nany sparks anymore Enjoy your cannabis extract Stay tuned\nnext time I'm going to show you how to purify the extract and turn it into pure\ncannabinoids in my hand is 99% CBD beautiful crystals See you next time", "4PiXghNEITI": "all righty let's jump into it guys today I want to talk about CBN cannibal null so you might have heard of CBD CBG THC and of course the one I'm going to talk about today cbn all of these are cannabinoids a cannabinoid is a compound that acts on the cannabinoid receptors and these can actually be endogenous compounds called endo cannabinoids so they're produced naturally in the body but the ones we're talking about from from marijuana from cannabis come from about four different classes that are the predominant ones CBD as we've seen lately some farmers have been breeding CBD dominant hemp CBD dominant cannabis to have something like twenty to thirty percent if not more CBD by weight now this is opposed to of course the THC strains that we've seen going up and up and up for the last you know thirty four years were originally probably in nineteen sixty seventy the amount of THC in pop was around something like fifteen to twenty percent and now it can reach as high as forty to fifty percent literally half the weight could be THC so you might have heard that CBD tends to be something that will relax you it tends to what people say is a antagonized THC so people like to get these half and a half strains but I don't want to talk about CBD today because CBD I think it's it's a great kind of annoyed but there's far too many products on the market for CBD and there are varying quality and people like to say it's it's it's advertised often as non psychoactive but the truth is if you take a lot of CBD it's certainly psychoactive like I've had muscle spasms and kind of LSD type thoughts from taking close to half a gram of CBD at once so CBD and low dose is short you know you could say it's not psychoactive but in higher doses it totally is so that's just a total crock of [ __ ] what I want to talk about though is a cbn because the thing about CBD is at least what I've noticed CBD and high doses causes raised heart rate as you take more and more CBD you will get a raised heart rate and yet it's supposed to be anti-anxiety so it's kind of interesting that you know you could be taking it for anxiety and it could actually give you more anxiety if it raises your heart rate cbn on the other hand tends to be more like a benzodiazepine it's much much more of a sedative and it's indicated for sleep it's indicated for for anxiety for as you can see marrieds medicinals one of the biggest brands of kind of these patches they even make THC patches but of course only in the states that will sell them with the medical cards and licenses and whatever or the legalized states but they do sell like totally legal CBD and I think CBN patches are are legal in most states and they say okay muscle spasms inflammation and somnium so my personal experience and I have right here a cbn cartridge I also have the tincture so I'm going to show you right here I've only found one website one manufacturer that will actually make CB and isolates well they're not totally isolates they still have the terpenes but there'll be cbn predominant with no THC so you can buy these online totally legal and they work amazing for anxiety and sleep like CBN in my opinion is one of the best cannabinoids other than of course if you want to talk about THC but I'm just talking about legal stuff about you know totally legal THC in some people including myself can cause kind of paranoia and panicking in higher doses whereas CBN I never noticed any of that is literally just like a pure fact it's not psychoactive in kind of like giving you weird thoughts it's more of just like a straight downer so yeah Pollak Expo sells a tincture this they sell carts I have the cart right here it's citrus flavored you know they are a little pricey from what I've been told then again I don't have my medical license so and and I don't really like to eat see all that much because like I mentioned it has kind of split effects sometimes you trip out sometimes you don't but CBN has been great for me for helping me sleep helping me relax it's not addictive no it's not a habit-forming and these these extracts have that full terpenes so so you know it's just there's last things that say they can be anti-inflammatory they can the terpenes can also be some what's that eight sedating by themselves it's not just the cannabinoids but you want to get kind of the full plant so it's nice that this manufacturer Pollak Expo does have full terpenes you can literally like smell them in the tincture you can taste them there's some limonene and like other terpenes that are definitely there adding to the aroma and possibly to the effects so yeah I'd highly recommend CBN if you have trouble sleeping if you try chamomile valerian skullcap you try these kind of GABAergic substances maybe you use benzos for sleep at the current moment maybe you don't use anything but you're having trouble sleeping I would definitely give CBN a try it seems to be the least hazardous and the least kind of severe kind of kind of I guess has at least trade-offs in my opinion it's just it's just not addictive there's there's no withdrawal tolerance or any of that so it just seems to be if it works for you it'd be a good solution as opposed to these other things everyone likes to think that chamomile and valerian are sort of like non-habit-forming the truth is they are their studies if you google like NIH like valerian like here and age valerian withdrawal like a guy checked himself in the hospital he was using valerian every day where is it let's see if I can find it I probably can't find it now but yeah so it's like this I think this is just an article but there was a study like 15 year 14 year old 50 or 58 year old man was taking valerian for many years he stopped because I guess he was in the hospital and he had pretty bad withdrawal yeah I was in there for a lung nodule so he wasn't being given his prescription that's a big issue a lot of these non prescription and prescription drugs you've been taking them you may be something happens to you you're in a car accident you get jailed overnight for some [ __ ] and you don't get those substances and boom like you're in an existential crisis so you know I tend to to favor the substances you know ethnobotanical zand and herbs just just that are not addictive that don't have a physical dependence because at least at least if you get in a jam you're not going to go into some kind of physical existential crisis you know not having them and there's cases where people have died in jail because they were on some you know they were they're pretty heavily on something and then they didn't get it you know heroin other things like that they literally the CEOs you know ignored them and they died from withdrawal so I'm not saying that's gonna happen from taking valerian for a while you probably wouldn't die if you you know got in a car wreck or got stranded but it certainly be unpleasant and it could actually you know you could be looking for water and stuff and you you know you have a survival scenario and because of these withdrawal symptoms you're not able to perform the way you should and you die because you're not on top of your game so yeah be aware that you know these these other kind of sleep supplements like valerian and chamomile they've been shown to have GABAergic behavior so anything that's going to hit the GABA receptors for the most part it's gonna and it's going to impart a kickback effect from the brain and it's going to induce a tolerance and it's clearly dose dependent and it's also dependent on the period periodic periodicity so how often you take if you take it daily that you know definitely has to it if you take high doses that definitely has to it so definitely give CBN a try if anxiety and insomnia is your thing I'm going to post a link in the description it's actually a affiliate link I never really do affiliate link stuff but this bender provides an affiliate program so you know if this information helps you out you know probably make other videos with with with other things I find helpful yeah definitely you know check out those links there cartridge there's prefilled cartridges there's tinctures there's vape juice that you can get and you can fill your own like if you have a kangertech or like a box mod you can fill that up yourself the prefilled carts you know the one right here it's it's from the kind pens it's you know it's it's a mediocre cartridge there's nothing like special about it I mean if you do have your own atomizer you have one of these high risk high ohm high resistance babes probably gonna get it you're probably gonna get a better vape from that so I'd recommend just buying the babies filling up your car if you have a nice car otherwise this is alright these carts definitely I think it's the carts is cheaper cheaper than the tinctures yeah thanks for 70 bucks actually they do have a fifty dollar tincture but but the the cartridge is thirty-five so if you just want to give it a trial see if you like it might just want to buy the cartridge now there are they do list other things like the CBG CBD CBN mixes and I will say that I have all of them have their CBD 5,000 milligrams isolate and I'm just not really a big fan of CBD anymore like I said I have found though that CBD and a lot of people say this THC and CB CBD can activate each other you don't need much but just like CBD alone tends to be you know in FX's but then when you add a tiny bit of THC somehow there's an activation some kind of synergy the the same thing I think happens with CBN if you just take a little bit of CBD with it they they activate each other so in any case CBG on the other hand you could talk about that even though this is really about cbn so CBG tends to be non psychoactive not really much of an effect I have it I've taken it anecdotally I can tell you that it really does not have much of an effect physiologically that's you know immediate but but it's supposed to be really helpful for inflammation for for like tumors sarcomas for all kinds of like physical ailments like illnesses it's shown to have some great effects so as a health supplement CBG you know seems to be pretty good but if you are just looking for something for your mental issues Sam Niang xiety things like that there's really no point of taking CBG is it's somewhat expensive and it's really just kind of like fish oil in terms of you know health effects so they do sell mixes of CBG with CBD and CBN and I wouldn't I wouldn't recommend them for any kind of really anything but a physical ailment I haven't noticed much it's more of a health supplement so yeah CBN great sedative similar to benzos much less habit-forming much safer you know give it a try let me know what you guys think hope this video helps you and Church a thought out", "MSzIYGWRXbE": "- [Narrator] You've probably already heard about cannabidiol,\nbetter known as CBD. It's exploded in popularity with claims of treating everything\nfrom insomnia to diabetes. - That's the only thing that would help me with my migraine headaches. - [Narrator] It can be consumed as an oil, applied to skin, or inhaled it as a vapor. We know CBD is a component of marijuana, but it's derived from hemp,\nusually does not contain THC, and won't get you high. The game changer for the\nCBD industry came when President Trump signed a farm bill legalizing hemp cultivation. One prescription drug\ncontaining CBD has been approved for treating two rare forms\nof childhood epilepsy, but the vast majority of\nwhat we know about CBD has been limited to personal experiences and unproven animal studies. - More often than not, things\nthat look good in animals, when you go into humans,\nthose effects aren't there. - [Narrator] According to a\n2018 Harvard Health Blog post, scientists say they still don't know much about how CBD affects the brain or which doses and\ndelivery methods work best. For example, if you put a few drops of CBD under your tongue, you\nmight consume 10 milligrams. But some researchers say you\nwould need 30 times that amount to reach a threshold\nthat can relieve stress. And since CBD products\nare primarily marketed and sold as supplements, the U.S. Food and Drug\nAdministration doesn't evaluate whether these products\nare safe or effective. That means if you buy a CBD\nproduct, you don't really know how much CBD is actually in the container. There's no denying the\nCBD revolution is upon us and the marketplace is buying in. However, there's still\na lot of TBD about CBD.", "JRqt7DCQnIs": "when you sort of create a robust healthy human then you know you can tolerate more of these things that doesn't mean you should holler you should force yourself to tolerate them but right you know in many of the people that we work with you know cutting out alcohol altogether to begin with is very important but then adding some of that back in can certainly have benefits for multiple reasons can we talk about CBD and THC we both live in states where that's legal now yeah and I can tell you I first started doing CBD oil last year and just to help out with with sleep I've heard people talk about you know it's good for back pain and all this other stuff and I found the curcumin is actually way way better for back pain than the CBD oil was for me although I haven't tried the lotions and stuff like that but then also THC and edibles especially like the OL spray or like a vape pen before going to bed I found that that helps me out a little bit with sleep if I'm if I'm struggling with sleep so I know there are obvious upsides and downsides I like to get some opinions on this we asked some data we don't even need it and we were we were actually talking about this over breakfast that's the kind of guys that we are yeah so the interesting thing is that CBD on its own based on the data that's available should not help with sleep so basically when they've looked at it and they've given people CBD alone or CBD plus THC the CBD alone can actually cause alertness and it may be to do with how CBD and THC affect cortisol metabolism there's some other stuff of it you know the the signal the ways they signal you know so some people may sleep worse if they take CBD and but when you add THC then people seem to sleep better so there's like a there's a synergism there however I can say for personal experience that I've tried CBD alone before bed and it certainly seems to help it certainly does seem to help me sleep and why that is I actually I actually don't know I don't have a study to say this is why I think there's the you know there's gonna be an interaction with all the other things that are going on in the gut CBD has certainly been shown or you know to improve got information got health I don't think that's an issue for me but that's particularly animal studies and now it's been translated CBD is now being used for in cancer therapies and for epileptics and they're starting to use it in people with inflammatory bowel disease so can certainly have a number of benefits I haven't tried the CBD plus THD THC was more of a thing I did in my teenage years but but have both been shown potentially to help with sleep the the potential downsides are obviously then can interfere with cool summers harbors and all this other stuff so if it's not causing it if it's not causing you benefit then you know there's no there's potential downsides for taking it so I mean we do think you know particularly for people you know heavy marijuana users there is some risk of mental health issues if that's coming from THC or other things you know of is obviously the the strength the concentration of THC in marijuana has increased dramatically over the last few decades so there's there's multiple factors that play there if you're taking 10 milligrams of THC with 30 milligrams of CBD before bed you know you're probably well under that that risk first hold but there are studies that show that it interferes with hormone metabolism called slow metabolism so it's just it's at the moment is kind of a try it out and see if it benefits you but equally you know we roll back to our continuous message which is why aren't you sleeping in the first place right you don't want to medicate yourself to sleep you want to find out what it is it's causing your poor sleep in the first place similar to the melatonin in the apple meadow that can help but but that is a band-aid off the band-aid that you not having enough melatonin because you're exposing yourself to bright lights at night all you know it's something like that right and so I think the micro dose with are the few times where I've done edibles where I get a like oh I can't do anything else besides eat potato chips today I just I don't like the feeling and so I I tend to I tend to avoid avoid that but I also have found that the mental health thing so I have the mental health problems running my family my dad was schizophrenic my brother was schizophrenic killed himself and so I know like that's the reason I won't do psilocybin and other things because there's a potential for you know even though I think I'm well past the age at this point where those symptoms would present themselves I do notice that the couple times where I've tried that an edible that is like Oh like this is too much the next day I it's like the roller coaster there you can't have the high without the low sort of thing and the entire next day I'm just like oh wait I should be happy right now but I cannot be happy this is a thing this is a story for anything that you take to try and change the way your brain functions but what we usually say is there's no biological free lunch right you can't ask your brain to do something which you wouldn't normally do and then expect it to be completely normal after so nootropics are a classic example you know you take these compounds are supposed to increase brain cognitive function various brain functions but it might increase function in one area but it makes you less good in another area and then so maybe well I will do I'll take a nootropic usually book the only time I do is before a podcast yeah and I know in afternoons I all I have this brush yeah yeah there is a nootropic crash for me I thought maybe I was unique in that because I've never heard anyone else talk about it but no I'm certain if experience the same and there are some some nootropics that are basically just like the kitchen sink everything's in there and this sort of light switches everything on you definitely notice a difference but then you gotta come down later so I often liken it to taking MDMA where your lights switch everything on you feel great and then you know a few hours later you have this you have this big come down and it's not the same for everybody again it's something that you have to experiment with yourself but but you know again we go back to why isn't your brain functioning as you would like it to why do you feel the need to take something to enhance your brain function are there other things you could be fixing and therefore you don't need to take that it's propak in the first place you know that's always where we're gonna go back to and then if you know occasionally you need to try something like that you just need to be aware they're asking your body or brain to do something you wouldn't normally do you might gonna you're gonna pay for it later yeah from either the THC thing is not to a point where it's or at least that I feel there's any sort of psychoactive effect it it's it's like micro dosing that's like one or two milligram sort of thing and the thing that helps me with is with the sleep is it prolongs the the period where I stay asleep another thing that has really helped me and I I've had to get really sort of diligent about it and I screw up still all the time water I drink a lot of water during the day but I stop at 5:00 p.m. I stop drinking liquids of 5:00 and that way I don't feel compelled to get up at 3:30 a.m. to pee which but sometimes when that happens I get up at 3:30 a.m. and I'm like I'm up I can't get back to sleep now and so I found those two things for me in the water is probably way more helpful than the THC to be honest with you so just something to think about any other words about THC no it's not something that really interested me on the c-word site about the stuff that's free like sunshine I'm very excited about where as yeah sunshine deficiency can definitely cause insomnia so like you can fix that first before having to buy a supplement we so we the one reason why we talk about CBD is because again it might help with people with inflamed guts and we see a lot of those so we know a lot of people who feel they've benefitted from taking you for some see yeah so that's an interesting thing that you bought up recently is that maybe you have some problem that's stopping you from sleeping and then you take another thing that makes that first problem worse and maybe introduces another problem but the net effect is still positive and so your sleep does get better yeah you", "cOTAOZUu80Q": "when the cedar fire broke out and encircled rudy ray as his home he doused himself with water and made an impossible decision my house is now on fire couldn't stay in there so I come out and basically made a decision to run through the fire line i covered my face with my hands losses fingered that ear because the fire was coming from that angle Rudy ran through the flames and survived the water combined with heat from the fire created steam so intense it peeled off 75% of his skin his nerve so badly damaged his sense of touch immediately turned cold he was found disoriented and in shock along the road hours later doctors had to put him in an induced coma for two months and the next year of his life was spent in a hospital bed at UC San Diego Medical Center during that time I was having complications with the medications and the fact that some of these medications being opiate-based were overdosing I was slowly dying from having this in me so long so doctors decided to try medical cannabis as they slowly introduced it to his body he says his blood pressure went down his muscles relaxed and there was no need for morphine and then asked him if they just want to come pick it up dr. Mark Wallace is with UC San Diego's center for medical cannabis research he's been studying cannabis and its use for chronic pain for nearly two decades he says his studies reveal cannabis is a safer and more effective treatment for pain than opioids it's just inverted you with the THC and pain as the THC levels go up in the blood pain won't go down until the point where actually starts going in the opposite direction as the levels go up pain you might expect are worsening and so there is this therapeutic window a therapeutic window where just the right amount of cannabis treats pain and replaces opioids for about 70 percent of his patients the bottom line is I I prefer to visit medical cannabis before we resort to an opioid i I think cannabis is much more conservative I think it's lower risk there's never been a read or to death from medical cannabis or cannabis look at all the deaths annually from opioid use Reyes says while he survived the fire research like this is keeping him alive cannabis has made living with burns bearable seventy-five percent of my outside skin is now missing that nerve that tells me pain so in order to have any sensation anything like that it's always itching it's always quality it's always and I could hitch to the point of bloody it won't make any difference I smoked a little marijuana or ingest a little marijuana because there's different ways to ingest it now and that goes away do you know how many pills it used to take to do that a plethora of pills to do with one little plant can do so instead of swallowing pain pills he smokes marijuana consumes edibles and this stuff is aloe vera base and soothes his skin with cannabis creams while spending small amounts of time under the Sun this is my chocolate mint in his garden I've expanded and learned more to the point where I'm taking care of other herbs beyond it even though his studies reveal benefits to medical cannabis dr. Wallace says more research is necessary to pinpoint dosing but the research has been almost impossible since marijuana is still a schedule 1 controlled substance right alongside drugs like heroin LSD and bath salts the DEA has it listed as a drug with no medical use the National Institute on Drug Abuse says 9 percent of people using marijuana become dependent the organization also says several studies linked its use to an increased risk for psychiatric disorders but again more studies are needed to actually know how because it's federally illegal it makes the it makes it extremely difficult to do research and the reason is is because since its scheduled 1 the only source for it is there is the government NIH and that source of medical cannabis does not represent real world so the push continues from both patients and researchers to make cannabis more accessible especially to those living with chronic pain facing an opioid addiction I'm in California and immediately you see he gave

suppositories you guys ready for this they are so medicinal so potent they're actually ten times more potent than uh taking something orally and not psychoactive so you get all that medicine without the psychoactive effects and they're very hard to find they can't find them in any dispensers so i'm making my own so we got some cocoa butter and you want to use cocoa butter instead of coconut oil because coconut oil melts at a lower temperature coconut butter will stay solid at a higher temperature cocoa butter so we're melting the cocoa butter and we have some butter and i just got it on amazon and then we have the um rso pico pool can't extract full extract cannabis oil and i'm gonna let the cocoa butter melt a little bit and then when it's almost done i'm going to put the rso in [Music] i'm using a double boiler method here so the pan has water in it and the water is boiling and heating up the cocoa butter in here there's no coco there's no water in the cocoa butter it's all cocoa butter melted so now i'm going to add the rso whole extract cannabis oil i actually have endometriosis so i'm going to use these pod stories for me to get major cramps so i'm going to use this depository like a tampon and use it for that you can use them for menstrual cramps back pain different cancers if someone has nausea vomiting can't take anything orally this is a good way to get the medicine in all right now i'm going to install the uh little molds i have some little molds here they actually have suppository molds that you can purchase but this is from magical butter for edibles but i'm going to use it for repositories it's a nice little shape but you could use a straw if you don't have mold and just use like some medical tape or you can melt the end of it and then fill it and then just cut it about an inch all right so we're gonna fill this and then i'm gonna use the extra as like a top of the lotion [Music] little bars down here make nice little um like topical bars so i'm gonna let them cool and then i'm going to put them in the freezer and they can stay in the freezer for up to six months [Music] okay we're ready the suppositories are done you're ready uh total it was about 730 milligrams of rso and we used about two thirds of the mixture so these have about 486 milligrams 90 there so total is about five to six milligrams each us start low go slow you could easily melt these again and add more rso if it's not enough um i'm gonna use them for endometriosis and menstrual cramps you can use it uh rectally as well [Music] it's best to store it in the fridge or freezer and it can be stored up to six months but you could it's starting to kind of melt a little bit um you could make them in a thinner straw and cut the straw into little sections if you prefer they also have suppository molds that's how you make suppositories and for more information follow ask nurse colleen", "SM12-6QEfLI": "what's up everybody we're here in the smash lab and today we're gonna be making some very very strong THC oil using 17 different rosin pucks [Music] the thing about these rosin pucks is they are still loaded with THC we haven't been pressing super high pressure lately we've been doing around 650 to 700 so there is a lot of rosin left over in these the great thing is we've got a new teach egg tester so we're gonna find out just how many milligrams is left inside this oil at the end the last video you saw when our boss drank that entire thing he was completely loaded we are gonna find out just how many milligrams that was and we anticipate this one's gonna be a lot stronger so stay tuned to see just what the measurement comes out to we'll start by getting a little bit of coconut oil 60 milliliters and our beaker over there and warm that up to about 140 degrees for 5 minutes alright so there's our 60 milliliters what we're gonna do is add it to this larger beaker because we're gonna be putting the pucks inside here we need a little bit more space [Music] all right so we're gonna let that heat up for a few minutes it's at about 170 degrees right now okay so our oil is now at around 125 degrees we're gonna go ahead and start adding our pucks like I said we have 17 bucks right here if you want to take a look at these you can see these things are cake this thing has got a nice yellow color still kind of sticky smells great wish you guys could smell this we're gonna start by adding 2 at a time try to save a little time here so I'll take these two right here take a look at these I want you to see what they look like before and after they're gonna be a lot more clear and that oil is gonna be bright yellow by the time I'm done with these two so let's go ahead and have these in there make sure they're fully submerged and boom as you can see we can easily add two at a time in here as we lose a little bit of oil we might have to drop down to one at a time so this all depends on how much oil you're using [Music] all right so it's been about five minutes we're gonna go ahead and take a look at these pugs make sure we got all the rosin outside of them it was about five minutes and we're doing two at a time it's important to know that you can even do seven to ten minutes depending on how your puffs look after we're gonna take a look right now you can see that the oil is already a completely different color than it was originally so these do look pretty clear we'll probably go ahead and let those sit for about two more minutes make sure we get everything out and then we'll completely remove them [Music] okay so it's been two more minutes let's go ahead and remove these our first one here as you can see that was a lot more clear take a look at our oil here it's got a nice yellow color it was originally clear so we're gonna do is go ahead and squeeze the rest of the oil out of these pucks here okay so our first two pucks got them right here as you can see those things are really clear we pulled a lot of rosin out of those here's a one we haven't done yet next one we have done as you can see there's a lot of rosin inside of these puck still what we're gonna do is bill the other 15 bucks in there on a time lapse to save you guys time and go ahead and see how this oil tests out at the end okay so that was the last puck we just did all 17 as you can see these are completely clear now we pulled all the rosin out of those as you can see the oil is way dark way darker than last time we assume is gonna be very potent we're gonna go ahead and test it out but first we've got Adi carbon so let's get that last puck out of there [Music] okay so we just removed that last puck and we turned the temperature up a little bit on our hot plate we're trying to get around that 220 to 240 degrees range we're gonna let that boil sit there for about 10 minutes so we can de carve this is gonna activate all the THC that's inside that oil this should take about 10 minutes but we're gonna pay attention to the bubbles that are forming as you see those bubbles that means it's d carving and once those disappear you're pretty much good to go [Music] okay so next we're going to do is take a nug Smasher 37 micron bag and strain the oil through it what that's going to do is get rid of any of that plant material was left over [Music] all right so what were left with is 20 milliliters of completely activated THC oil what we're gonna do is use our new teach egg test machine a lot of you have been recommending this to us you really want to know how many milligrams of THC was in a in the oil when we were done what this does is it uses light to analyze the oil and give us the total cannabinoid count we know that flour that we pressed was predominantly THC however if you were doing heme it would give you the CBD results as well the only thing is it only tests up to 15 milligrams of THC or total cannabinoids per milliliter so we're gonna have to dilute our rosin oil right here in a twenty to one ratio with coconut oil so we'll do that now all right so let's get our scale zeroed we're gonna add a point 400 grams of clean coconut oil right here alright next we're gonna add point O two of our rosin oil [Music] turn this on alright so we're testing isolate infusion we're doing coconut oil temperatures about 75 and the infusion has been deep carbs we're going to go ahead and begin the test first we got to ensure the tray slot is empty which it is okay let's just calibrate yeah and while that's calibrated we can go ahead and add our oil to the tray right here [Music] all right all right we got the results ten point six times twenty so two hundred the point six times two would be [Music] so two hundred and twelve per milliliter and how many do we have twenty Destin that's that's a lot for one person to drink that's pretty heavy all right so extremely potent oil right here we just got this tea check yesterday we've been playing with it for the past two days really cool device we were really interested to see how many milligrams this was 4240 that's a lot more than most people would do in one dose like we did last time thanks for watching the video and make sure you stay tuned for next time hey guys make sure you check us out at Doug smasher com2 check out all of our awesome products we also have tons of great information on our site including calculator tools & Turf

doesn't produce any acute drug effects so we wanted to bring that into laboratory and test that assumption what we found is that oral dosing doesn't produce much in the way of a drug effect or impact drug testing when the substance is pure when it's vaporized though we did see discriminable drug effects they were not THC like so people didn't report getting high but they did feel a subjective change in how they felt mostly positive not really negative and we didn't see anything in the way of impairment of cognitive performance when we added some THC to the mixed we used a cannabis that was high in THC or high in CBD and low in THC we found that people reported modest drug effects again no impairment of cognitive functioning at the doses we tested but you know relatively strong drug effects we also found in this study that acute dosing with that high CBD low THC cannabis could produce a positive drug test in some individuals the other interesting finding from this is that in consistent with other studies that have been done we found that women tended to be more sensitive to the drug effects than men so women reported stronger drug effects overall especially in the vaporization and the high CBD low THC drug conditions and they reported greater ratings of irritation of their throat when they were inhaling the drug this is a stepping stone study so it's a very small study with a single dose given one time so you know obviously from here we there are a number of ways we want to expand on this a number of directions we want to move forward at some point multiple different doses and and different formulations to better replicate all of the products that are on the mark at the moment", "Fmzkyt7AQzo": "what's up everybody welcome to the channel today we're gonna be making cannabis and to use powder so let's get into it so the first thing you want to do is measure out your cannabis all right now I'm gonna put our candidates in our mason jar now we going to D carve our cannabis so we're going to be using MCT coconut look at a cheese fool no some lava lecithin see your mason jar alright guys the number put a lid on a mason jar and then put this in a pot and let it simmer for about two hours so she's getting [Music] now we're gonna filter onto the canvas [Music] [Music] so now we're gonna add 1 cup of tapioca maltodextrin now I'm gonna add the cannabis if you use coconut wall to the pound so now we're just gonna double strain the powder so what we're gonna do now is test out this powder it's supposed to be water soluble so you're gonna find out right now hopefully I didn't waste my week making this stuff but gonna find out so we're gonna put a water in here now I'm going to ask them with powder [Music] alright guys so this is the end result it did dissolve man so it really did works thank you for watching this video don't forget to Like share and subscribe peace", "6M5vTfGskPU": "[Music] I'm Ian Mitchell I'm an emergency physician in towns British Columbia at the royal inland hospital I'm also an associate professor in the department of emergency medicine at the University of British Columbia and locally I'm a clinician at the can solve clinic today I'm gonna be talking of a tale of two drugs those drugs are THC and gabapentin we're talking about their history how they've been used their research basis and why physicians feel that those two drugs are so very different and should be treated so different I'd like to begin with some history in the history of cannabis begins millennia ago cannabis is one of the oldest domesticated plants in the world going back it's used in to ancient China and Egypt in the Western world we found out about cannabis through India where physicians brought back cannabis to be used in North America what was used for over a hundred years by some of the best known physicians in the English world including Sir William Osler who believed that cannabis was the best treatment available for migraines at that time Canadian drug companies fought amongst each other over who provided the best quality cannabis to Canadian physicians and patients cannabis was criminalized in 1923 in Canada for reasons that are still unclear the history of gabapentin is much more modern gabapentin was invented in 1974 by drug company called parke-davis parke-davis as well as distributing cocaine and cannabis also invented pcp ketamine and gabapentin really the party people love drug companies gabapentin was approved for sale in 1993 for the treatment of seizure disorders we look at the mechanism behind these two drugs cannabis affects the endocannabinoid system we all have a system within our body that responds to cannabis and also responds to chemicals within our body that are similar to cannabis these chemicals called anokhin of annoyed help to regulate our mood or sleep and our appetite on the other hand gabapentin works on a different system it was initially designed to work on gaba receptors however later research shows it actually effects calcium channels on nerve terminals looking at the research base of these two therapies we find that the research that's been done in cannabis is overwhelmingly looking at harms over 90% of the research money that was ever spent was focused while looking at the harms of cannabis very little was spent looking at benefits part of the difficulty in studying cannabis is there is no supply of research cannabis in America to look at the benefits the government will give you as much cannabis as you want to study the harms but if you're looking to study the benefits of cannabis you are not allowed to have any that's recently been reversed however the cannabis that the government has been sending to researchers has been of low quality and containing mold and has been unable to be used in research studies can is not much different in Canada red tape and hurdles mean it is more difficult to study cannabis in Canada than it is to study heroin turning back to gabapentin we can look at the research and gabapentin as being part of a criminal enterprise that really focus on a physician called dr. scott rubin who was incarcerated for falsifying data in research studies he played a big part in the researching of gabapentin and its uptake by physicians Pfizer the drug company marketing gabapentin realized that there was little money to be made in just the seizure management aspect of gabapentin so they sent sales people out to doctors offices to convince them to use it for many other conditions in populations that had never been approved for children old people as a result gap in and a huge uptake among physicians but ultimately Pfizer had to pay out the largest consumer fight in history 430 million dollars for their fraudulent Mis marketing activities we find that this pattern continues however with industry paid physicians still be much more likely to prescribe Gavin looking at what effects these medications have on people both gabapentin and cannabis they have a similar side effect profile our side effects include dizziness sedation coordination problems cognitive impairment people are often very much more concerned about the mental health aspects of cannabis and how there are some adverse effects associated in that way particularly with schizophrenia what we understand is there is an association with cannabis and schizophrenia if people start using cannabis at a very young age and they are prone to getting schizophrenia their symptoms may come out earlier and be more severe but it does not appear that cannabis by itself can make someone schizophrenic it can only affect people who are already vulnerable to this condition there's also the myth of the amotivational syndrome this is an idea that stoners sit around all the time and are very lazy and that just hasn't been borne out by research turning back to gabapentin we find that we have new concerns about mental health and gabapentin from recent research we know that it increases suicidal ideation and that's most often in people between the ages of 15 and 24 people who are much more prone to be suicidal already it's also impairing for driving gabapentin is both drugs can be abused both cannabis and gabapentin we know from older research that approximately 1 in 9 people who use cannabis recreationally may become dependent on it although this is based on old figures and may not be reflective of current conditions physicians were told that gabapentin was not addictive was not abusable and this of course is not the case there is a large illicit market for gabapentin particularly in prison it helps to make the effects of opiates more prominent unfortunate also helps to increase the rate of death associated hope you know there was a withdrawal symptom from gabapentin that is not as severe as with alcohol but is still unpleasant and no one should ever stop gabapentin cold turkey because of this withdrawal syndrome cannabis has been very heavy rig heavily regulated since 1923 was made illegal it was made partially GLE in 2001 in Canada with the advent of medical cannabis and we had full legalization of cannabis in 2018 gabapentin remains unrestricted in canada available by prescription it does not require triplicate as opiates do or other addictive medications do gabapentin rescheduled in the United Kingdom due to epidemic of misuse the Canadian Medical Association the standard for Canadian physicians holds that the evidence is insufficient to use cannabis for neuropathic pain they are supportive of gabapentin and that certain research have called them out on this saying that they're been overly cautious about cannabis per se the CMA has been somewhat silent about gabapentin their journal the Canadian Medical Association Journal has articles noting the abuse the over prescribing and the lack of efficacy of gabapentin but the Cana Medical Association at this point has no moves to restrict physician prescribing of gabapentin of note there is no Sunshine Act in Canada so it is difficult to know who is getting paid by companies to help prescribe gabapentin moving on to some myths there are a rich mythology around cannabis first being that it is common to have cannabis that has been contaminated with fentanyl this has never been proved to be true there's no confirmed samples of cannabis with fentanyl in it fentanyl is actually destroyed if people smoke it in a joint it has to be smoked in a different way off aluminum-foil there's also the terms indica and sativa that are still commonly used at one point this represented difference between the two types of plants and fateh actually the type of effect they would have on people however over the last few decades hybridization amongst these plants has rendered these distinctions meaningless and is no longer possible to look at a name to look at a label and tell what is in that plant or what the effect it's gonna have on a person myths around gabapentin are few there was a gentleman in the UK who was claiming that after taking gabapentin he became gay I haven't read any research studies supporting that so far looking at the clinical indications for these medications for cannabis we have indications for chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting for spasticity for PTSD and for chronic pain but many people have raised concerns about cannabis being a panacea and applied to every condition out there and we hear this especially for physicians but just for comparison I'd like to read off the indications for gabapentin and what people are prescribing that form and we find that doctors are prescribing gabapentin for acute pain chronic pain post-operative pain neuropathic pain they're prescribing for tremors seizures and muscle cramps they're prescribing for depression mania herpes zoster tardive dyskinesia restless leg syndrome fibromyalgia cancer diabetic neuropathy interstitial cystitis arthritis anxiety pancreatitis chronic cough occipital neuralgia migraine bipolar disease drug dependency alcoholism alcohol after all opiate withdrawal and benzodiazepine with all doesn't work for all these things the evidence just isn't there it's unclear whether gabapentin works for much of anything however we've seen a tremendous rise of gabapentin and that's come from large amounts of pharmaceutical money being used to promote the drug it's being heavily up taken because now physicians are much more concerned about prescribing opiates or restricted by the college for prescribing opiates for their patients so they have to turn to an alternative the fact that it may not work very well sinks to the bottom there's a perception of safety with gabapentin that is really not true we now know much more about its side effects and its impairment risks there's been a tendency of physicians to say well if the gabapentin is working is not working for you that we should increase the dose and there's been many studies showing that increasing the dose does not add to any pain relief but only increases side-effects nonetheless this is a very common prescribing pattern within British Columbia so if we look at the protocols for treating neuropathic pain because one of the main reasons that gabapentin is around gabapentin is certainly high up on the list when we look at an algorithm for a managing neuropathic pain that comes from the pain family physicians they also include opiate analgesics and tramadol which are terrible drugs for neuropathic pain and have significant side effects cannabinoids only appear as a third line agent unfortunately if you look at the evidence to support gabapentin which is the first-line agent I'll quote from a study here there is moderate to high quality evidence that anticonvulsants are ineffective for the treatment of low back pain or lumbar radicular pain there is high-quality evidence that gabapentin toys have a higher risk for adverse events these are medications that do not work well for the indication that they are prescribed and they have significant side-effects and yet they are among the most commonly prescribed pain medications from physicians today so this brings us now to a state of reality pain and evidence-based medicine we have limited evidence-based medicine about cannabis because for many decades we weren't allowed to do the research and we're in a research deficit so we don't know how well cannabis works for many conditions on the other hand with gabapentin it's been researched thoroughly and what we're finding is that it has been well researched enough to know that it does not work for most conditions it's prescribed for and it has significant harms so there are many patients with chronic pain and some of them will be helped by gabapentin but is a very small number and certain does not justify the number of prescriptions being written for this medication there are very few prescriptions written for cannabis because physicians shy away from this from lack of knowledge but it can certainly be an effective medication for patients and if we move on to a summary from one of the gabapentin studies it reads even absent clinical trial trial data it is possible that drug X may help some patients who have clinical features of neuropathic pain in the same way that not every patient responds to medication with proven eck efficacy for the condition there are some patients who may respond to medications even though efficacy was not demonstrated in a clinical trial the problem is that throws out evidence-based medicine says you shouldn't pay attention to studies I think you should pay attention to studies but the studies haven't been done for cannabis with this equipoise and what we understand certainly some patients are going to be helped by gabapentin and it doesn't mean that needs to go away but it needs to be far more restricted than what it is and physicians need to consider the cannabis with a similar side effect profile and more effect on neuropathic pain maybe a more appropriate selection for these patients and they should consider where the research comes from and the bias behind these both of these medications thank you", "PCvTnFYks2M": "what's up very bossy boy mastermind here a Cahan theme Ohio cannabis live we're back with another video make sure you like subscribe and watch the end for a chance to win a free grinder piece another mastermind hit what's up everybody boy mastermind okay Anthony before our cannabis live and we're back with another review video today we're talking about Vireo Vireo hope I'm saying that right tinctures one-to-one tinctures okay see you know how we roll it's not opened let's see what it said on the back here product facts this is a one to one CBD TAC team share the net volume is 12.5 milliliters that it says doses per container 25 versus doses per 0.5 milliliter and it says two point four one milligram THC and two point three four milligrams CBD per dose says here cannaboids per package total TAC is 60 milligrams total CBD is 58 milligrams other cannabinoids is a CBG cbn and then there's C BC and CB v is a victory this was manufactured on the 15th of October and packaged on the 22nd of October with an expiration date of October of 2020 says here was tested on October 23rd 2019 so now we've got all the way and again this is a cannabis oral solution and I'm gonna go ahead and open it for the first time and see what we got here first thing we got this gold sticker silver sticker on the box I like to save my boxes sticker is kind of having my style but we'll get it off here okay sticker is cracked that's what happens when you break the seal on it all right here's what we got all right interesting way of showing it still sealed they're essentially the same information that's on the back up box is also on the bottle this is actually a lot smaller compared to the other tinctures that I've tried Firelands and grow Lyle there's our 30 milliliter bottles this is only a 12.5 milliliter PO it does have the measuring on at point two five milliliter all the way up to one full milliliter see that here and I'm gonna go ahead and go for the full dose folks holes I can get it's actually pretty clear almost translucent there I dropped a little bit but you can see here it's pretty dang going clear so lift tinctures the always one-up kind of lean your head back a little bit open your mouth try not to put the applicator in your mouth and get it under your tongue leave it here for like 30 seconds or so maybe a minute if you can stand it taste what do it tastes like definitely tastes like CBD and cannabis oil mixed together this is not flavored like the Firelands scientific one that had a man or CV I mean a mint or citrus flavor I don't know when do another one take one for the team and impressions I do not like the way it tastes you could definitely use some type of terpene flavors or botanical flavors or some other flavoring would definitely be beneficial it says here it's balanced I would say that the taste of THC oil with CBD oil is balanced it's not a horrible nasty CBD taste or it's not a horrible chase he takes for me it's just not the best of tasting I've tasted better tinctures kind of kind of irritating the back of my throat a little bit don't too much like that I'm gonna wait a minute or so to see if I feel anything else but so far not really feeling anything yet usually with these within a few minutes I usually start to feel the relief and the effects for the price this was on sale at Burning creations when I first it but the price I believe is still like about $50 which was one of the reasons why I didn't buy it at first because you get more with the fireline thing sure with this one I've got some information here about this company putting that up here for you to take a look at it see read up on the company a little bit some of the literature that I was given kind of a little bit more about the company was all involved with it sounds like a pretty nice company I definitely would like to try some of their other tinctures they have several different ones this is just the one that I thought would make sense for me because I'm gonna big one to one into the one type patient so that's why I went with this one but I would also like to try a couple other ones that have the app but you know as I'm showing you here a TAC one and CBD one and then they have like instead of 1 to 1 and 15 to 1 which is something similar to what the Farland scientifics folks have as well for comparison and I eventually do another video it will compare all these different tinctures that I've tried there's one more company I need to try before I can do that video and then after I did that and I could actually give you guys kind of a rundown of all the different tinctures and the places try them all so one more to go and I'll be able to give you a good spectrum over all the different textures that are currently available so you know it's been a few it's been a few minutes haven't really noticed significant effects maybe a little bit of an effect kind of a I guess the key word would be balance it's not it's not an overwhelming effect just a little bit of relief so I mean I would say there is some effectiveness in it everybody's gonna have a different type of need with this product you might need the one-to-one you may need the CBD focused you might need a TAC focus you might need one CBD and one TAC so there may be various combinations of this product that you might need and maybe not just this one for me personally I think I would want to try a couple more different ones that they make before I could give a wholly totally honest review love it whether I recommend it not so I'm not gonna say no or yes if I recommend it or not I'm just gonna say so for the product I think my main feedback is we should get more per bottle it should be a 34 rounds which would be in line with what the other processors are doing and I think they should actually if possible those are my two main feedbacks for it price-wise compared to the other teachers the pricing is reasonable for this type of pink shirt so it's not an issue there I definitely think the packaging is okay there's nothing wrong with the packaging it's not too bad wasn't too hard for me to open it so I think that was cool and like I said I like that they have more than one teacher to pick from so you kind of have a variety of the figure out what works for you so yeah won't hurt to give them a try if you decide to but look dad I'm going rap [ __ ] boy mastermind I can't you know how the campus lies if you like what you see make sure you eat

Thank you for joining us. My name is Ed Bottomley\nwith the Michigan Medicine Department of Communication. The Michigan Regulation\nand Taxation of Marijuana, also known as Proposal 1,\nwas passed by the voters of the State of Michigan\non November the 6th, 2018. It became a law on December the 6th. The law allows for the personal possession and use of marijuana by persons\n21 years of age or older. Now that recreational\nmarijuana is legal in Michigan, what should you know\nabout its health effects? That's why we have our\nexperts here with us. We'll introduce them in a moment, but first a few housekeeping items. You can submit questions\nat any time, even now, for our panelists to answer\nduring the Q&A portion of today's chat. Questions can be submitted\nby commenting on this video but please know that if you do comment, your name will be visible to\neverybody else in the chat. We're not going to mention\nyour name on here in any way, but just please know\nthat it will be visible to others participating. If you prefer a more anonymous option you can also send a private\nmessage to us via Facebook. If you can't stay for the whole chat, or if you want to share the\nrecording with a friend, a video of the chat in its entirety will be available on our\nFacebook page, and we'll also be loading it up to our\nYouTube page soon after. So on to our expert. We have three Michigan\nMedicine experts here to answer your questions today. If we could go down the line, just a short introduction from you all? - Okay, I'm Dr. Meghan Martz. I'm a research fellow\nat the Addiction Center within the Department of\nPsychiatry here at Michigan. I primarily research\nadolescent brain development in relation to substance\nuse risk and resilience focusing on alcohol and marijuana use. For example, one of the studies I'm working on is a nationwide study following nine- and 10-year-olds over the course of 10 years. It just started; it's\ncalled the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development Study. So I'm really interested\nin longitudinal research, impacts of substance use on the brain, and also risk factors that might preexist certain people toward that. - My name is Meilan Han and\nI'm an adult pulmonologist so focusing on the lungs. Much of my research actually\nfocuses on the effects of tobacco smoke and the\nlung, but as you all know there are lots of types of\nsmoke, so today we'll be talking about the effects of\nmarijuana on the lungs. - My name is Dan Clauw,\nI'm a rheumatologist in the Department of Anesthesiology. I lead a large pain research group called the Chronic Pain and\nFatigue Research Center, and our group is very interested\nin the medicinal benefits of cannabis, especially for\nthe treatment of chronic pain. - Thank you all for your intro. Let's start with the questions. I know we have a variety of\ndifferent specialties here so if you can't answer the question, we'll pass it along the line. First question, what\nare the physical effects of smoking marijuana? Anyone wanna take that? - I'll take that, Ed. - Thank you. - The endocannabinoid\nsystem, the system within the human body that binds\nto the cannabinoid molecules that your own body produces,\nis widely distributed through the human body, and so most people when they think of cannabis, they think of some of the side\neffects like getting high or getting the munchies, or they think of some of the potential\ntherapeutic benefits such as treating pain\nor treating seizures, which are some of the\nwell-described benefits. But it turns out that\nthe body's own internal cannabinoid system does a lot of things. It affects memory, it affects stress, it affects sleep, it affects\na lot of different things and so people need to be aware that when they're taking cannabis, that there are receptors\nwithin the human body that that binds to that do a whole bunch of different things, and that's what leads to a lot of the effects,\nboth good and bad, that occur from smoking\nor ingesting cannabis. - Is it a question, if I\ngo to the pub and drink a couple of beers, is it a\nquestion of certain people can take more marijuana or it has\ndifferent effects on people? - Yes, so marijuana,\npeople will fairly rapidly, like a lot of drugs like\nopioids, will fairly rapidly develop tolerance, so that\nthey need to take more to get the same effect. That actually doesn't\nhappen to any significant extent with alcohol. You can upregulate the enzyme\nthat breaks down alcohol, but an alcohol blood level\nof .10 will make everyone somewhat impaired, and a level of .20 will make everyone really impaired. There is no relationship at all between someone's cannabis blood level\nand how impaired they are. 'Cause a chronic smoker\ncan have a very high cannabis level and not be impaired at all. And someone that's cannabis naive that's never smoked before\ncould have a very low amount of THC and be quite impaired. - [Ed] See, that's fascinating. - And relating to someone\nwho has never used it before using at high doses, there's\nactually been research showing that people have\nincreased likelihood of experiencing panic attacks\nor high levels of anxiety. A lot of times when you think of marijuana you think of it relaxing\nyou, but especially in young people and people\nusing it for the first time, they might actually\nhave increased anxiety, especially in high doses. - Fascinating. The next question that we\nhave, is smoking marijuana less harmful than smoking cigarettes? - I'll take that one. So interestingly, we actually\ndon't have quite as much long-term data on smoking\nmarijuana as we do cigarettes. It's a little bit more\ndifficult to quantify. There's a lot of ways that\npeople might inhale marijuana, whether it's a joint or\na bong, or vaping now, as opposed to cigarettes,\nwhich are a little bit more quantifiable because patients typically get cigarettes that are the same size and they know how much\nof a pack they've taken and can kind of report that over time. It's much more difficult\nto get information on marijuana, particularly since it's not been legal, either. So the data that we have\non smoking marijuana just isn't as good, so what we do know is that it irritates\nthe lining of the lungs and can cause kind of increased\nmucus and a chronic cough and phlegm production, so it's\nirritating to the airways. We do know that if patients, for instance, smoke marijuana and tobacco,\nit can actually make it worse or if patients have a history of asthma, smoking marijuana can actually\nmake the asthma worse. There actually are also\na lot of carcinogens or cancer-causing compounds in marijuana and so there are also some\nof the same theoretical risks to smoking marijuana as there\nare to smoking cigarettes with respect to\ndevelopment of lung cancer. Having said all that, we don't\nhave great long-term data for all the reasons I just mentioned on smoking marijuana to\nwhether it definitively causes some of the same\nthings that tobacco causes. So for instance, chronic\nobstructive pulmonary disease or emphysema or even lung cancer. We just are lacking some of that long-term epidemiologic data, but\nthe theoretical research certainly is still there. - That's very interesting. You touched on other inhalation devices. The next question that we\nhave, it says what about using bongs, vapes,\nother inhalation devices? What are the risks there? - So for any way of smoking\nmarijuana that results in smoke, that's gonna be a bit more\ndamaging to the lungs. Smoke in general is actually\ndamaging to the lungs, whether it's a cigarette\nor not, interestingly, even being exposed to wood-burning stoves. Some parts of the US actually\nuse wood-burning stoves a lot. Even that is associated with developing chronic airways disease, so in general, regardless of where it's\ncoming from, smoke is bad. There's a little bit less theoretical risk for things like vaping, just\nbecause it doesn't generate those same burnt compounds in the smoke. Having said that, again,\nthere are a lot of other compounds in marijuana\nincluding carcinogenic compounds that are still going to\nbe taken up by the body, so I wouldn't say, at least for some of those theoretical risks\nthat there's any necessarily completely safe way of taking, inhaling, marijuana that\ncomes directly from plants. - Thank you for that. The next question that we have, what risk does marijuana pose to kids and teens? - Yeah, I can talk about that. Yeah, so what we know is that typically for all drugs of abuse,\nalcohol, marijuana, that the earlier you\nuse, the more damaging the effects tend to be. So what we're really concerned\nabout is earlier use. Usually we say around age 14 is typically what we define as early\nuse, but some people, some kids are actually using before that. In relation to brain development, which is my area of focus,\nthere are certain areas of the brain, particularly\nin the prefrontal cortex, the frontal area of the\nbrain, that are associated with cognitive control, decision making, so really important skills,\nespecially for young people as they're learning and making\ndecisions in their lives. And those areas of the brain\ndon't really fully mature until actually the mid-20s. And so we are especially\nconcerned about that in relation to what kind of effects\nwe're seeing in the brain. And the research in our lab\nhas found, in particular, effects of marijuana use in\nthe reward areas of the brain so how people process\nand interpret rewards and also in terms of emotion processing. So we are seeing some impacts. We don't really know\nhow long these impacts are on the adolescent\nbrain, but again, studies like the Adolescent Brain\nCognitive Development Study, the ABCD Study, hopefully\nwill be able to have a better understanding\nof the long-term impacts on the adolescent brain, especially if they've started using early on. - Great. The next question we have,\nthis is an interesting one. With regards to emotional\nstatus, someone says, is it fair to say that\nsmoking marijuana is good for violent people to keep\nthem at an even level? I imagine in terms of emotional status, in terms of calming someone\ndown, does anyone have any thoughts into that one? It's probably a tricky one. - Yeah, I don't think that\nthat would necessarily be a quick fix to it. I think because like you were saying, it can have different impacts on people and especially the dosage,\ntoo, if you're having a very high-level dosage,\nit may not have that calming effect, necessarily,\nand if you're interacting with other substances,\ntoo, you may not see that. - I don't think any of\nus would feel comfortable saying that that's a\nknown medicinal benefit. I would say, though, if you\ninteract with police officers or things like that, they will say that they don't find the people that are high to be nearly as problematic as the people that are drunk or using other drugs because they will be more ... But again, having said that, I don't think any of us are advocating or recommending it as a treatment, no. - The next question follows\non a little bit from what you spoke about, Dr. Martz,\nwith regards to the risks. What should parents tell their\nchildren about marijuana use? - Well I think any kind\nof psychotropic medication you're taking, whether\nit be legal, illegal, it changes the way the\nbrain processes information and it can have effects,\nnot only physical effects, but psychological effects as well. So I think just being\naware of trying things early on, because it can\nhave impacts on your brain. And I think, especially the\ntime when it's a very sensitive period in terms of brain development, and it's not worthwhile to\nadd in external substances that might have a negative\nimpact on your brain. - Thank you for that. The next question,\nshould marijuana be used to treat aches and pains? - Well, the first threshold is there's a lot of things\nwe can use to treat aches and pains that are not drugs at all. There's a lot of non-drug therapies that can be quite effective\nfor treating pain. Exercise is probably the\nsingularly most effective therapy for treating any type of chronic pain, getting better sleep, reducing stress. So when we move into\nmedications for treating pain we don't really know exactly\nwhere cannabis would lie, but I do wanna make\nthe distinction between the two elements of cannabis,\none being CBD or cannabidiol, versus THC; THC is the\npsychoactive component of cannabis. There are a lot of emerging\nstudies that CBD alone can be effective to treat pain. And CBD has virtually no side effects that we know of right now. It's not psychoactive. It has no addictive potential. It really doesn't have\nhardly any side effects, and so if people are moving\nin the direction of cannabis to treat pain, they should try CBD alone and then perhaps a high\nCBD/low THC form of cannabis as the preferred constituents of cannabis that would be most likely to treat pain. A lot of people right now are using the high-THC forms of cannabis\nto treat pain and they're overshooting the dose that's\neffective to treat pain. A low amount of THC is more effective than a high amount of THC to treat pain. And what we see, if people\ndon't watch programs like this and get medical guidance\nabout how to use cannabis appropriately, is they're\ngoing to the dispensaries, which are used to catering\nto the recreational user. They're dispensing mainly\nthese very high-THC strains of cannabis or of the edibles or whatever, and those are not at all\nthe strains that people should be using for most\nof the medicinal effects of marijuana, especially the analgesic or the pain-relieving effects. - Thank you for that. The next question we have, a\nlittle bit of a different one, what about edibles? What about consuming or eating marijuana? Is that safer than smoking? - No. Until you know what you're doing. So edibles are the preferred\nroute of administration for treating chronic illnesses like pain. But the biggest problem that\nhas happened in every state that has legalized\nmarijuana are a big spike in emergency room visits because of people overdosing on the edibles. The edibles are incredibly\npotent, and if someone that hasn't ever smoked or\nhasn't smoked cannabis recently or used cannabis recently\ntakes one of these little gummy bears,\nthey will be super high for 12 to 14 hours, they'll be paranoid, and every state has seen a big jump in these emergency room\nvisits, some of which are kids 'cause these look like gummy bears. So you have to be particularly careful with the edibles around\nchildren, but the other thing that people are unaware\nof is the edibles take around three or four hours\nto have their peak effect, so the other thing we see\nhappening with the edibles is people take a little bit\nof a gummy bear or a brownie or whatever, and they\nwait about a half-hour, it doesn't do anything, and then they eat the rest of it, and it\nstill hasn't done anything, so they take the second one,\nand then it starts working. And they get higher and higher and higher and paranoid and delusional. And it really is scary\nfor someone especially that is cannabis naive to get that high, and they really will, then,\noften end up in the emergency room or hospitalized for a workup to try to figure out\nwhat's wrong with them. - It is probably better for the lungs, if we only care about, but\nmaybe not for the whole person. - And it's better because\nwhen you get the right dose of the edible, it'll last a lot longer and when you take it orally\nyou don't get that big increase in the THC level\nthat makes you high, so again, as someone who's\ntrying to teach people how to use this appropriately\nmedicinally to treat pain, I'll have them use edibles\nas their preferred route but start at a really,\nreally, really low dose and go up very, very slowly, and be aware of how long it takes to\nwork, 'cause this is again one of the things that\nwe see people think that because they don't get an effect within the first 30 minutes to 60 minutes, that they should eat a second gummy bear, and therein lies the\nproblem because it just ... - Well, there's really no,\nat least in many states, I think, regulation over what the dose would be in that gummy bear, is there? - Correct, again that'll\nbe one of the good things about the new law in the State of Michigan in contrast to the old law that supposed to be a medical marijuana\nlaw, is we will have much better provisions for\ntesting all the cannabis and labeling it so people know\nexactly what they're getting. They know the strength,\nthey know what concentration of THC, what concentration of CBD. Right now, some of the better dispensaries in the State of Michigan are\nproviding that information to patients, but that's\nnot in any way mandated and people don't generally\nknow what they're getting. - This is really, really\nfascinating information here. What does the research show\nabout the use of medical marijuana for pain or nausea relief? - I really talked about it already. We used to think that\nis was the THC component of marijuana that was necessary for pain and now we realize that\nCBD might be at least as important, if not more important. It probably is the THC\ncomponent that helps nausea. The way THC works to\ntreat pain is it actually makes everything, all sensory experiences, less unpleasant than\nthey would otherwise be. But it actually is more of what\nwe call a dissociative agent and it turns out that opioids\nwork in much the same way, is that neither opioids nor cannabinoids actually do anything to your pain. You just don't care as much about it. But this is why we worry\nabout adolescent use is when people start using marijuana, they don't just not care about their pain. They don't care about other things in life and they have amotivational syndrome. So all of us that are promoting\nthe legitimate medicinal use are really worried about adolescent exposure.\n- And I think it's important to point out that it's not a treatment for the\nunderlying condition, per se. Some people think marijuana\nmight cure certain things, and it just helps alleviate\nsome of the symptoms that you have, and it's\nimportant to distinguish that. - [Dan] Correct. - This is an interesting\nquestion to follow on from that with regards to the effect of marijuana: Are you seeing any academic changes with students who use recreationally? - In more recent research we\nhaven't, to my understanding, seen big impacts on academic achievement. I think that there is a\ncultural shift happening where in prior decades\nmarijuana users might have been seen as stoners and\nthat kind of subculture. Yeah, exactly, and I\nthink as it's becoming more normative to use,\npeople aren't necessarily viewing it as that way,\nso I think that's where we're seeing that shift\nin academic consequences. But also, recent research from monitoring the future study here at Michigan, which I was a part of when\nI was a doctoral student, did find that there has been\na fairly substantial increase in college students using\nmarijuana for the first time that they're just recently finding. So it'll be interesting\nto track that over time if it is having an impact\non college students because we are seeing\na pretty big increase in first-time marijuana\nuse among college students where we didn't see before. - The next question that we have, this is an audience\nquestion from Facebook. I'm worried about the\nreproductive implications for our young folks and their\nchildren to be, thoughts? - That's a legitimate concern. There are data suggesting\nthat there may very well be developmental issues\nassociated with smoking marijuana during pregnancy, so I think\npeople should not do that or be aware that that is\npotentially dangerous. - Yeah, it's not in my line of research but just from a personal\nnote, I had a baby recently and I went to a class, a birth\nclass and child-rearing class and the nurse was saying\nthat no amount of marijuana is safe from her perspective. I think in terms of alcohol use, there might be a little more variability, especially with breastfeeding,\nbut from my understanding I think they're not sure\nyet how much is safe. And so they're recommending\nnot using any marijuana when you're breastfeeding or with child. - Okay, and the next audience question, is cannabis, CBD, or THC being used to treat epilepsy effectively? - Yes, so CBD, under the\nbrand name EPIDIOLEX, was approved a couple\nof months ago to treat Dravet syndrome, which is a\nrare childhood form of epilepsy. It's thought to be more broadly effective in a lot of different\ntypes of seizure disorders but so far, it's just\napproved for two rare types of childhood epilepsy. And that product that's\napproved is actually derived from the marijuana plant,\nbut then they get rid of all the THC and all the other things, so although it is CBD, or cannabidiol, more or less pure, it was actually plant grown and then they get rid of all the other non-CBD\nconstituents, so the kids that get EPIDIOLEX are\ngetting pretty much pure CBD. - Okay, the next question\nthat we have, should people with chronic conditions\navoid using marijuana? - I guess it depends on\nthe chronic condition. If you have a chronic lung\ncondition I would say yes. So the data does suggest that it can make loss of lung function worse,\nfor instance, if you've got chronic obstructive lung\ndisease or if you've got asthma, it can definitely cause\nincreased irritation of the airways, could lead\nto more flair-ups, etc. So I would say,\nparticularly if you're gonna smoke it, use with caution. Oh the other interesting thing,\nwhich I forgot to mention is that marijuana actually\ncan carry organisms, so for patients that\nare immunocompromised, there have been reports of\ntransferring fungal infections, actually, by smoking marijuana. There a fungus that goes\nby the name Aspergillus. So if you have a patient with\nany kind of chronic condition that impacts the immune system, it does set them up for risk\nfor this potential fungal infection, it's definitely been reported. So that's another group in which I would avoid smoking marijuana. - And also there's been a\nnumber of research studies showing that people that\nhave a family history of schizophrenia should be\ncautious when taking marijuana because it might bring about the onset of schizotypic symptoms\nearlier than if they hadn't have used marijuana, so there\nis a link with schizophrenia and marijuana use as well. - Yeah, that was the next question, so thank you.\n- Oh, okay. - The next question that we have, and this is an interesting\none, it's legal, so doesn't that mean marijuana is safe? - Well, you could say the same thing about cigarettes, alcohol. - [Ed] Lots and lots of things. - I think the personal health aspect of it you need to consider. Yeah, is it better or\nworse than certain things? We don't really know that. I don't think there have\nbeen any deaths directly attributable to marijuana\nas there have been with alcohol and nicotine,\ndefinitely see very high rates of death associated with that. But we don't know the impact on driving and other kind of outcomes. - For certain tradeoffs\nwith certain classes of drugs, it's easier to\nmake, so I am often asked to talk about cannabinoids versus opioids in the context of chronic pain. And that's actually pretty\nsimple because if you go down the list of all the problems\nassociated with opioids and all the problems\nassociated with cannabinoids and you look at the benefit\nof both classes of drugs, cannabinoids win by a long shot. It's not even close. Again, you cannot die of\na cannabinoid overdose like 50,000 people in the US are dying of an opioid overdose. There are good data\nsuggesting that when states put medical marijuana laws in\nplace, that the overdose rates go down by about 20% and\nthere are likewise good data that a lot of people are\nusing cannabis legitimately to treat pain to come off of opioids and many people can successfully do that. So in narrow areas where\nthe two classes of drugs are easy to compare to\neach other with respect to the benefit and side\neffects, there's actually not a lot of data that opioids even work to treat chronic pain,\nwhereas there's more data that cannabinoids do work\nto treat chronic pain. And the side effect profile\nof opioids is so much worse that it's pretty easy to\nmake that kind of judgment. But for most other things,\nall drugs when you ingest them have side effects and toxicity,\nand dangers, and problems. - And there is an addictive\npotential of marijuana. About 9% of users meet criteria\nfor cannabis use disorder and I think almost double\nthat number if you start in adolescence, so cannabis\nuse disorder is a real thing. It's probably not worse\nthan opioid use disorder but there are some people\nthat do become addicted to marijuana, which a\nlot of people don't think that there is an addictive\npotential to that, but there is. - Fantastic, you answered my next question.\n- Oh, my gosh! - So, oh actually, you know what? Dr. Clauw, you might have\nanswered my next question. Is it possible to overdose or have a bad reaction to marijuana? - Absolutely. Again, this will be seen\nin the State of Michigan when the law is fully\noperationalized and people start to really use it recreationally. Every state that has passed\na recreational marijuana law or legalized marijuana\nhas seen a big increase in these emergency room\nadmissions and things like this. So absolutely, in part\nbecause the marijuana that's been bred and grown\nover the last 20 to 30 years is so high in THC content compared to, again, I will acknowledge\nI went to the University of Michigan in the '70s,\nso when I was smoking in the '70s I was purposefully\ntrying to get high. But again, the THC\nconcentration of marijuana in the '70s was 1/20th,\n1/30th what it is right now. And that, again, is the\ncomponent of cannabis where almost all of the safety issues seem to be from the THC,\nso we've taken a drug and made it 20 to 30 times more potent and we're exposing large\nnumbers of people to it. So yeah, there's concern about that. - Okay, the next audience\nquestion, to clarify, does use affect the genetic\nformation of sperm or eggs? Is there anyone who can talk on this? - [Dan] I don't know. - Any questions that you\nguys don't feel comfortable answering, we'll get\nan answer and put that in the comments section. - I don't think the\nanswer is no, actually. And again, people, viewers should be aware that one of the big problems with cannabis is because of its still\nbeing a Schedule 1 drug. It's really put a damper on research. And until recently, the\nNIH wasn't even allowed to fund research that could\nshow any beneficial effects of cannabis, so part of the reason that we're hemming and hawing\nwith a lot of these questions here is that there simply hasn't been the good quality research\ndone that needs to be done before this gets widely consumed as if people think it's safe and effective for everything that it's touted to be. - And it's challenging to\ndo that kind of research because you can't, for\nexample, give one group of pregnant women high doses of marijuana and the other group low doses. There might be animal work\nthat could look at that but it's a challenging area of research. - Yeah, and here we have another audience follow-up question; this one\nis talking about research with regards to lung capacity. This person says, Harvard\nstudies seem to show an expanded lung capacity\nwith longtime users and that it's recommended for asthma. Depending on who grows your\ncannabis will determine the carcinogens put out when\nburned and that it's a natural inflammatory, antibacterial,\nand antifungal. - Well interestingly, at\nleast from what I've read the slight potential increase\nin your total lung capacity is probably related to\nsmall airways disease that then leads to air\ntrapping and an inability to actually completely\nget out all of your air, which actually leads to what we would actually call hyperinflation of the lungs. I wouldn't say it's actually\nincreased your capacity. And then we see that\nsame airway inflammation in asthma and other types\nof chronic lung diseases. So I actually don't\nview that as a positive. There's, as far as I know, no evidence to suggest actually that it would have an\nanti- either bacterial or antifungal effect,\nat least in the lung. And as I mentioned, it actually can carry with it organisms that\ncan lead to infections in individuals with\nchronic immune suppression. So yes, there is gonna\nbe variation depending on where you get your marijuana from and how it's processed, but unfortunately a lot of that, at least\nfor the inhaled forms, is not really standardized right now. So without an FDA lab\nthat's going in and checking on a production plant regularly and checking to see if it's the same. Even if you got it from the same grower, they could have some\nmold infect their plants and it might be different\none year from another year. That's just sort of with any, I think, type of farm industry,\nso if you don't have the regulation there's\njust really no way to know about concentrations, contaminants, whether things are the\nsame from year to year. So at least in my mind it's\nstill a potential lung risk. - Thank you for that. And the next audience\nquestion, since the law is to make marijuana regulation comparable to alcohol regulation, based\non that, the health effects of marijuana should be gauged\nagainst those of alcohol. How do the medical experts\nview the health issues for marijuana based on those of alcohol? I deem alcohol far worse\nfor teens and young adults, especially if it's compared\nto daily or weekly use. Would the medical experts\nagree or disagree? - I think it depends. I think if you're taking a\nvery high dose of marijuana especially the different\ntrends in marijuana like dabbing, for\nexample, which is a really super-concentrated marijuana,\nvery high levels of THC, so if you're consuming\nvery high levels of THC on a daily basis, it's\nhard to really compare. In some ways they are kind\nof like apples and oranges. And I think another\nthing with young adults and adolescents is they're not typically using one drug or the other. There's a lot of co-use, using together, and I think as people get older, especially with marijuana users, you'll see people that are\nlike, oh, I won't touch alcohol but I smoke marijuana every day. But typically in younger people, they are using different\ndrugs and so there might be some interaction effects\nwith using drugs together, which could be a potential problem. - Okay, next question from the audience, what effects/damage does marijuana smoking have on the heart as well as the lungs? Can anyone speak to this? - [Meilan] I'm actually\nnot aware of anything. - Acutely, some of the\nonly deaths that have been perhaps attributed to cannabis ingestion, right after smoking there\nis an acute cardiovascular increase in blood pressure and heart rate. And there are a couple of case reports where this probably triggered\na myocardial infarction or a heart attack in someone. So with the acute administration,\nespecially someone that isn't used to it, it'll put their blood pressure up, put\ntheir heart rate up. And then if you have preexisting\ncoronary artery disease that could be problematic. I don't think in general\nwe think of the heart being an organ that is\notherwise adversely affected with chronic administration,\nbut in acute administration that's well known to occur. - Okay, and the next audience question, can anyone speak to your\nopinion of marijuana in pregnancy in the first trimester? - [Dan] Bad idea. - This one, the next\nquestion that we have, Dr. Clauw, I think this\ngoes back to a question that you fielded a while ago. I don't want to drive while high. How long does it take for the effects of marijuana to leave my body? - So this is a really big\nproblem that hasn't in any way been solved is sort of the\nlegal issues of impairment because right now in\nmost states if you have a detectable level, you can be charged with driving under the influence, and you could be a chronic\nsmoker that's last smoked 30 days ago, but if you get in an accident where someone was killed in an accident and because you were in the accident you're gonna get a urine drug screen, you can, and in some cases\npeople are charged criminally, even though there isn't evidence\nthat there was impairment from the cannabis at that time. What we should be doing, but we don't do, is police should really be\ndoing roadside impairment tests because, other than for alcohol, there aren't any other drugs that you can accurately say that the level corresponds to a certain amount of impairment. But there's a ton of prescription drugs that people are taking and driving. People are taking opioids and driving. I don't want them driving. They're very impaired. But that's not illegal right now again unless you can be\ncharged with driving impaired. But in general, we're not\ndoing wide urine drug screens on everyone that's in a\nmotor vehicle accident to see all the different drugs they may have in their system. - Very interesting. The next question, what are\nthe effects of mixing marijuana with alcohol, tobacco,\nor prescription drugs? - Well, with mixing alcohol. I was in a meeting with colleagues and they were talking about\nsome of their research and they were calling it greenouts, which are like blackouts with alcohol, and that people that were using alcohol and then marijuana, they might have higher likelihood of greening out. So I don't know if it's\nsometimes about certain people are more likely to experience\nblackouts than others. Maybe there is some association\nwith greenouts, too. This isn't really my area of\nresearch, but that was just something that came up in a conversation. And again with, I think, younger people as their brains are\ndeveloping, these different neurotoxic substances in combination tend to have more cumulative\neffects than in isolation because they're interacting\nwith different areas of the brain and on different receptors, so typically when they're\nusing more substances together it's more problematic. - Yeah, the only thing\nwe can say, I think, with some certainty about the combination, and I'm not trying to be\npro-cannabis in this regard, but other drugs of abuse,\nlike alcohol, opioids, benzodiazepines, all work in the brainstem to decrease your respiratory\ndrive, your breathing drive. And there's a high rate of\noverdose from all of those drugs and from combinations\nof all of those drugs. And a lot of the famous overdose deaths, the actors or people,\nit was co-administration of opioids with alcohol,\nwith benzodiazepines, and so those three\nclasses of drugs are known to be a deadly combination. Cannabis doesn't add,\nagain, I'm not advocating throwing that in the\nmix, but if you're gonna be doing polydrug use,\nthat would be the one that would be the safest\nof a bunch of unsafe things because of the fact that\nit's not gonna cause the respiratory suppression\nand the overdose. And again, people have homed\nin on the opioid epidemic, appropriately so, but there's\nstill a tremendous number of overdose deaths from\nbenzodiazepines alone, from the combination of\nalcohol plus benzodiazepines. And again, that is one of the only places where I think we can\nclearly say that cannabis wouldn't have the same safety issues. - Thank you for that. Dr. Han, here's a question for you. Can secondhand marijuana\nsmoke affect nonsmokers including children? - We just don't have great data on that. We don't have great data\non secondhand tobacco smoke so now let's extend that one more. If we look at, I guess,\ntobacco smoke as an example, again, I had mentioned smoke\nin general's not great. Even having kids around\nwood-burning stoves is not great for their\nlungs, particularly, for instance, if they have\nasthma, but can ultimately increase their chronic lung conditions. So if I was to guess and to extrapolate, I would say it's not great\nto have small children around any kind of smoke,\nregardless of the source. But the kind of medical literature we have on it, it's just not\nsomething a lot of parents are gonna report, and so it's just very difficult data to try to collect. - Thank you for that. We have another audience question. Are there comparable studies\nbetween chronic marijuana use and a lack of hitting\nyour REM cycle, causing a full night's sleep to feel\nlike almost no sleep at all? It doesn't matter if we talk. - Well, I haven't studied this directly. But I have been interested in this. I've tried to look at this in our data. We haven't been able to do it yet, but in talking about how we\nwould set up this kind of study it's interesting 'cause\nI think if you go into the dispensary there are\ncertain strains of marijuana where they advertise that\nit will help your sleep. Some people might just say,\noh, marijuana helps me sleep better, but we don't know\nwhat the effects are. It may not always be a\nbeneficial thing for your sleep. So I think it's a little\nbit mixed in terms of how it does impact your sleep. - Let me just say\nsomething, though, is that we've been talking about\ntwo specific cannabinoids, THC and CBD, that are in cannabis,\nbut there are 80 of them. And 78 of them, we don't\nknow hardly anything about, so there are three different\nstrains of cannabis, indica, sativa, and ruderalis. And what you'll hear from\nthe recreational users is that the indica is more sedating and the sativa's more\nactivating, keeps people awake. And if that is true, that\nprobably was more true in the past before all the inbreeding of strains and everything. But when that used to be\nmore true, it was probably some of those 78 other, minor cannabinoids that were having those\neffects that we don't know hardly anything about, and so that's why I think it's so hard to understand. 'Cause THC would be\ndirectly somewhat sedating and a lot of people that use\nmedicinal marijuana for pain will primarily take it at night and find at least by self-report, that\nit helps them get to sleep and it helps them stay to\nsleep, but I'm not aware that there have been good sleep studies showing that that's high-quality,\ndeep, the kind of sleep that we're trying to get people to have. - And you know, after\ntoday's Facebook live, we can also talk to our sleep\nexperts like Dr. Chavin, and see if they have any\ninput on that as well. Next question from the audience, does cannabis affect the\nparts of the brainstem that control main body functions? - No. Again, there are no cannabinoid\nreceptors in the brainstem. This is why it doesn't cause\nthe respiratory problems that it does, so that's\none of the only good things about, I shouldn't say\nthe whole brainstem. The brainstem is big. But again, there are no\ncannabinoid receptors in the respiratory drive center. A lot of the areas of the\nbrainstem are totally devoid of cannabinoid receptors where they have a lot of opioid receptors,\na lot of other drugs that are affected. - And the next question\nthat we have is with regards to K2, Spice, synthetic marijuana, synthetic cannabinoids,\nhow harmful are they? - Quite. They're called synthetic cannabinoids because in assays they'll bind\nto the cannabinoid receptor but they are so different than\nwhat we've been talking about that I think people should really put them in an entirely different ... A lot of issues with those drugs, no therapeutic benefit of those drugs. So I really think those should be put over to the side as just bad. - [Meghan] And distinct. - And distinct, yeah, very\ndistinct from marijuana. I think we're sort of doing\ncannabis a bit of a disservice by calling those drugs\nsynthetic cannabinoids. - Then the next question that we have, and I don't know if any\nof you can speak to this, can the essential oils\nof the cannabis plant such as RSO cure conditions\nsuch as Crohn's and cancer? - This is another big\nproblem with cannabis is the route of administration,\nso people are taking cannabis in all sorts of different ways. They're using it as a topical, they're using it in tinctures. They're using oils, they're using edibles. And what we do know about cannabis is that it's very poorly\nabsorbed and very poorly bioavailable, so if\nyou put it on your skin and you don't put something\nelse with it like alcohol or something that's gonna\ndrive it through your skin, it won't really have any known\ntopical effects even though a ton of people are using\ntopical CBD and products. Same with the oral routes. We're recommending an oral\nroute of administration, but one of the big problems with cannabis is there's tremendous differences in bioavailability,\nand the average person, if they take a gummy bear\nor oral cannabis product, only about 10% of that will get absorbed and the other 90% will just pass through. But if they take that same\ngummy bear with a fatty meal, 30% will get absorbed,\nso this is a big problem with the edibles is that\nthe amount of an edible that you get will be\nhighly dependent on when you eat a fatty meal or\nif you eat a fatty meal. Much more will get absorbed if\nyou eat it with a fatty meal or if you eat a fatty meal right after. And that's a big difference,\nespecially with THC, a twofold or a threefold\ndifference in THC concentration is the difference between maybe the amount that would cause good pain control and the amount that would\ngive you high and paranoia. There's not a big, wide\ntherapeutic window for THC. There's a fairly narrow\nrange that would give a therapeutic effect\nwithout a toxic effect. - Okay, and the next\nquestion is with regards to, does marijuana use\nlead to other drug use? - I think people refer to that\nas the gateway hypothesis. And typically, we find that that is not necessarily the case. That there's nothing\nnecessarily about marijuana that makes people want to\ntry heavier drugs, per se. I think the argument\nmaybe stems from being around marijuana users,\nlike the social context. But I think the research points that it isn't necessarily\nsomething about marijuana that leads to other, heavier drug use. - The next question,\nthis is one I feel like we touched on with you, Dr.\nHan, and you, Dr. Clauw. If we could touch on it one more time, how is eating and drinking\nfoods that contain marijuana such as edibles different from smoking? - It will be somewhat less predictable what the effect will be,\ndepending on what else you eat and drink. Even the orally available\nprescription drugs that we have, the THC analogs that are now approved in the United States\nfor treating AIDS-induced anorexia and for post-chemotherapy\nnausea and vomiting, those drugs are very poorly bioavailable. That's just a known fact, and those drugs would have all the same\nproblems as a gummy bear, is that if you take that\ndrug with a fatty meal two to three times as much\nof it will get absorbed so that's still a big problem, and there's a lot of drug companies that\nwork on drug delivery systems that are trying to figure out a way to put either CBD or\nTHC or both into a drug and make it more predictable absorption so you know that, if\nsomeone takes that pill, that they're always gonna absorb 20% and then you know what\nthe therapeutic effect and the toxicity will be. - Do you think that the\nrelative dose absorbed is more reliable when it's smoked? - Yes, it is more\nreliable when it's smoked. - That's a bit of a catch-22, right? So you're gonna get a less\nreliable dose with the oral administration, but there's\nthe risk to the lungs from the smoke and the other\ncarcinogens with smoking. - Yeah, I wouldn't even put it that way 'cause I think we're strongly\nrecommending against. The only time that I would\nsay someone that's trying to use it medicinally\nshould vape that smoke is when they first start trying a little bit of it to try to\nsee what kind of a gummy bear they might want by putting\ntheir toe in, but for chronic administration.\n- Nobody yet. - Even vaping I think is gonna cause a lot of the same\n- Yeah, I agree, there's other compounds.\n- Right, yeah, and it's just far better, if people\nare using it chronically, it would be far better, tinctures, oils, edibles, then you're not having any respiratory issues.\n- Right. - 'Cause that doesn't necessarily filter out all the bad things. - [Dan] No, it doesn't\nfilter anything out. - [Meghan] Exactly. - So it looks like we've gotten\nthrough all our questions, all our audience questions,\nbut I want to make sure we get everything out today,\nso I wanna go down the line and ask you, do you think\nthere's anything we've missed that you'd like to talk\nabout, and what is a takeaway that each of you would\nwant our audience to know to take away from today's session? If I could start with you, Dr. Martz. - Yeah, I think in relation\nto the adolescent brain and marijuana use, just\nwhat we tend to see is that earlier, heavier\nuse is more problematic, so delaying use, much the way\nwe have delayed alcohol use to age 21, pushing back\nthe age of first use is really important from what\nwe've found in the literature. So, yeah, just delay and delaying youth. - So we talked about it. We are lacking some of\nthe data, long-term data although the interesting thing is that, with respect to the lungs,\nthe tobacco companies have been arguing for years\nthat we didn't have data that conclusively linked\ncigarettes with lung cancer and things like that, so I think just from a respiratory health\nstandpoint, there's just no safe kind of smoke, regardless\nof what the compounds are. But marijuana, in particular, we know it does irritate the airways. We know that it can make other\nrespiratory conditions worse. We talked about the\npotential for infections, carrying infections in patients with chronic immune conditions. One thing I didn't mention;\nthere actually is some other data, again, none of the\nmarijuana data is great, but there are some reports,\nand I've actually seen this, which is why I tend to believe it, there are some case\nreports where marijuana and smoking marijuana can\nlead to bullae in the lungs or even holes in the lungs. And I actually saw this in\na patient several years ago. Admitted to the hospital,\na young gentleman, no other really risk factors\nto have a hole in the lung other than he'd been smoking joints. And so that is another\nkind of rare side effect that has been reported. I'm not aware of any data\nto suggest that marijuana is good for the lungs,\nand I think otherwise, at least from a lung\nhealth perspective it just represents risks, not\nonly to the individual who may be smoking but\nalso, as was touched on, I think just in general,\nthe concept of exposing others to secondhand smoke is always, at least from a theoretical\nstandpoint, a concern. - So not all cannabinoids\nare created equal. The people should be aware\nthat there's a lot of stuff in cannabis, the two\nmain ones, CBD and THC. I'm extremely optimistic about\nthe therapeutic potential of CBD and I think that's\nstill being explored. I'll bet we find a lot of\nimportant uses for CBD. I'm cautiously optimistic\nthat low amounts of THC in the right settings can be helpful, but what we're seeing is\nthat if people won't watch programs like this or don't get\nsome kind of medical advice, and they just go to a\ndispensary, they're gonna get the high-THC forms that are probably not of any medicinal benefit for anything, and are gonna have a lot\nof, again, side effects. Now if someone's a recreational user and they're trying to\nget high, then so be it. But I think we're trying\nto give a perspective of how people might use this more from a medicinal standpoint. If they're using it\nrecreationally, at least be aware of some of the potential side\neffects associated with it. And again, we're not\nseeing, in part I think, because very few US physicians\nhave had any training in any of this, so the\nnormal sources of information for a patient are not available. - So what you're saying is,\nlet's reconvene in five years. - In two years because this\nfield is moving very rapidly. - So that's very interesting, too. - Yeah, yeah. - Well I appreciate all your expertise. I appreciate you fielding all this hugely wide variety of questions. Thank you for the questions\nfrom our audience. If you've just tuned in,\nif you tuned in halfway, this will be on our Facebook page and we'll also be putting it\nup on the Michigan Medicine YouTube channel as well. So Dr. Martz, Dr. Han, Dr.\nClauw, thank you so much. And thank you to everybody\nwho was a viewer.", "0JKenIQcExE": "in recent years hemp and CBD products have grown in popularity our grace Morris took a look at the benefits and possible side effects of CBD right before coming to Elan senior Victoria Rodriguez had major surgery I had my spleen removed I was particularly painful so she turned to cannabinoids or CBD to manage the pain it's just so healing like on all different fronts for CBD NC manager sandy king CBD has also made a difference in her life for ADHD I haven't had to take medication for over five months just you know using the CBD oil instead after the passage of the farm bill in 2018 states were legally allowed to grow hemp hemp is a form of the marijuana plant with very little THC or the active ingredient in marijuana that causes a high CBD is a chemical that comes from the hemp plant it has been touted as having a wide variety of health benefits and for Rodrigues those benefits are real if I have just a little bit of it it'll give me like calmness and like help me feel less anxious but also help with physical pain that I'm dealing with it's like it's the it's snake oil at this point it'll kill almost everything the problem is is not a lot of good research the Food and Drug Administration has only approved CBD to be used in some prescription epilepsy medication but it's not weighed in on its other uses Robin Lee a pharmacist at Total Care pharmacy says that's why he doesn't stock CBD there lots of people make in CBD products and since they're not regulated there's no way to know precisely what you're getting you have to rely on the people and that's kind of made it sort of the Wild West selling CBD while CBD can be consumed in a variety of forms it doesn't come without its side effects that's part of the problem because CBD does have an effect on your liver it can increase the metabolism of other drugs so you can either for the most part block metabolism of certain drugs which will increase the amount of drug in your bloodstream and while the research might not quite be there yet it's hard to know if that's true for a broad spectrum of people or if it was just for that one person or if it's a placebo effect some still swear by CBD it's not a cure-all or an end-all be-all but it's definitely a nice way to decompress at the end of the day at Grace Morris Elan local news the CBD industry continues to grow in 2018 the industry made almost two billion dollars in sales", "H-KD67mwVC0": "so what does 500 milligrams of THC feel like well I can tell you that it doesn't feel good it kind of feels like this okay so it's a little over two weeks ago that I was given ten drops of cannabis oil and the dosage was played down to me and I wasn't sure exactly how many milligrams I was taking it was said that it was diluted and very weak and I was given ten drops and I have never ever taken anything cannabis related in my life so obviously it's gonna hit me harder I wasn't planning to take it I thought the worst that can happen is I'm gonna be extremely relaxed and calm and I haven't really done a lot of research into THC and cannabis oil and the effects on what it does to you so I took the ten drops under my tongue kept it there had a bit of a bitter taste didn't taste much else and then afterwards found out that there was 500 milligrams of THC in those 10 drops so I didn't know if 500 milligrams was a lot or not because I've never really put much research into the actual effects and what the dose is is law when I read online that 500 is extremely high and I was seeing a lot of people there are regular cannabis oil users or THC users I saw how it affected them I thought to myself well I'm either gonna feel weird and go through like a sleepy zombie State or I'm just gonna feel okay so an hour went by I felt okay and I decided to leave the house because I actually forgot that I taken it I carried on swimming and we were doing a whole bunch of things as I was leaving my skin was so hot like it suddenly felt like in that split second I was fine doesn't feel anything in the next second it just hit me and my skin felt so hot like there was a con air blowing on me and it honestly felt like heat a so I went up to it and I faltered and when I put my hand closed it felt like cold air but as I stood back that that air blowing on my skin for that I was on fire I literally felt like I couldn't handle the heat the next thing that happened is just almost like the wall closing in and like tunnel vision and it was just black everywhere except right in front of my eyes and it felt like like like falling or furutaka like you at the top and as you drop it's like that whoop kind of feeling like everything closing in your stomach jumping and I was horrible I felt like whoa something's not right and then I remembered I took ten drops of cannabis oil and I thought to myself okay maybe it's bringing on some anxiety because I've suffered with anxiety attacks and I managed to calm myself down over the years and control it it just got worse and worse and worse my heart rate shot up so high that it I could feel it jumping on my chest now thought okay it's definitely anxiety but my heart the way my heart was going and felt completely different to anxiety so on my very very bad anxiety attacks where I've got rushed to the ER I had a heart rate of 140 beats a minute now if you think about it to put it in perspective your resting heart rate is about 60 beats a minute it can range between 60 to 100 but usually your resting heart rate is about 67 so 140 is for me if I'm boxing or if I am on a treadmill and I'm running or on the elliptical machine or skipping doing those intense things your heart rate is about at 140 so now I imagine being at a resting heart rate and suddenly shoot up to 140 where it feels like you're running on a treadmill and you're out of breath like you you're running that fast but you're not so your breathing doesn't match your heart rate your brain doesn't match your body's activity and everything's just out of synch so that's classic anxiety symptoms I thought to myself I just gotta calm down so much my heart rate shot up to a hundred and seventy two beats a minute now that's the highest I've ever seen it even when I've exercised and when I used to do MMA training my heart rate ever used to go to 172 I think 165 was the max I've ever seen my heart rate I felt like my heart couldn't take it I had this burning sensation through my chest like almost like when the letter s it is building up in your body and you're training hard and you feel like your muscle cannot take the weight if you lifting a little bit too heavy feels like I'm also gonna take I had that same kind of burning feeling in my chest and my heart was racing so fast on top of that I had this funny feeling like it was it was just like my heart couldn't cope with a the beats per minute and I lay on the bed I got managed to get to the bed and I was struggling to speak because my heart was going so crazy that I couldn't get the words out like I was freaking out inside and I was told with it that's the weird thing I didn't feel the effects of the THC besides those physical responses like I was I was going through all of this but in my mind I'm like just relax it's anxiety and even though my heart was that fast I'm like you're just gonna freak yourself out more and I was talking to myself to calm myself down using my diaphragm to breathe and slow my heart rate slow my breathing control everything but it just got worse and worse and worse when I checked my heart rates again and weights up to 180 and it wasn't like a panic attack where it stays high for long and then oops it just stayed constantly a tip from 180 dip down to 172 to 165 and it didn't go below 165 it was between 165 and 172 for about seven hours so even though the HC is considered safe there are extreme cases where there are complications so if your heart rate stays too high for too long you can have a heart attack my blood pressure was extremely high eventually we call the paramedics because I didn't feel like I was gonna make it now I've seen lots of stories of people taking too much and especially if it's their first time they think that they're gonna die and they have anxiety and freaked out I've been through so much anxiety over the years and has so many anxiety attacks where I was rushed to hospital and this fall so different my mind was still there like I was still thinking everything and I honestly felt like I was I was blacking out and my heart was going way too fast and my heart couldn't take it they called the paramedics the paramedics came my heart rate was still extremely high my oxygen saturation was so low because I wasn't breathing properly I was trying to control my breathing so much that I eventually slowed my breathing down so much that I stopped breathing basically they had to stand over me and told me to take deep breaths because I basically lost respiration and I wasn't getting enough oxygen in my body so I made a conscious effort to suck in air but I struggled so much to breathe it's almost like a disconnected feeling and I have read that so that you could become disconnected but you don't know where you are I knew exactly what was happening around me I could feel every single thing I could feel muscles in my face I could feel the inside of my ears I could feel all my muscles I could feel everything it's scary because then you start feeling so lame almost like I couldn't really move much then I would try shake myself like just like the little jerks and jumps to like wake myself up because I could feel like I was slipping away - I don't know passing out or blacking out and the funny thing is in that clip where you see me laying on the bed there my blood pressure was so high it was 190 over a hundred ten I think somewhere there and I thought I had glasses on I'd fought like you know when you put glasses on they're a little bit too tight and you can feel the bands on behind your ears I could feel that and because my blood pressure was so high my veins were so tight there I didn't have two losses on it was just those veins and the whole time I thought I had glasses on because of that feeling my blood pressure was extremely high my heart rate was way too fast and that's lost him for seven hours it's the last longer but off those first seven hours those were the worst so having a heart rate go that fast for that long it can be dangerous and having a blood pressure that high and if it rose higher along with that heart rate is extremely dangerous you could have a stroke you can have a heart attack it's very easy so even though it is a natural compound and there are no reported deaths from cannabis the complications or ever stating and I've never felt that scary in my life through all the anxiety attacks that I had and everything that I've been through with thoracic outlet syndrome that feeling right there was the scariest feeling I've ever had when I had anxiety I used to think that I was gonna die and eventually you know you're not gonna die even though you feel like it with us I just I couldn't control it obviously I take it such a high dose that my mind was only focusing on negative things as much as I was trying to stay positive and talk myself through it and the paramedics actually brought the stretcher they wanted to take me to hospital if my blood patient didn't go down and they stayed with me for a quite a while because I saw such tunnel vision and my blood pressure was so high I think I just like to zoned in I honestly thought that they took so many hours to get there and it felt like it was nighttime reading where in the clip you can see I'm laying there as it's fall early evening I think there was 10 past 6 or so so I was really like out of it I doesn't feel good at all my whole family around me none of them had ever seen me look that bad I didn't see myself making it out of it my heart was feeling so strained it was about three days after that that I still felt like I couldn't do anything because just getting off the bed walking around the house I felt like my heart was pumping so hard like it like it was overused then drained from the day before so it was just like the next week I had no energy I had left so much energy I wasn't myself at all I doesn't feel good I had the worst headache and obviously such a high dosage was way too high for my body to handle and I had no tolerance to it and it wasn't something that I've ever wanted to try or thought to try so it was a stupid decision to even want to try it and that's why I just got to be careful with what you take sometimes doctors will prescribe you medicines and things and they just don't work with your body they react differently and your experiences can be totally different to somebody else so you everyone can be laughing and having a great time and then you are freaking out and having the worst time and just now you get a complication and like I honestly thought that I wasn't gonna make it and it was an exaggeration because when I look back at the footage that I have the way I look in the video freaked out and not looking good at all my heart rate I got felt that and I can still feel that I can think about it and feel that scared feeling that I felt and it wasn't just because I was having some weird experience from the THC it was just it was pure anxiety and pure fear and yeah it's not something that I enjoyed at all I know I should have researched first it was one of us things that happen so fast that you make a stupid decision and it can affect you it was one of those kind of things because I love to research everything down to a tee before I take it when I had my thoracic outlet syndrome when I was on tremor doll I took like three tremor dolls and I threw the Box away because of all the first of all the way it made me feel I fall I couldn't feel like myself didn't take my pain away and all the side effects so I threw it away and cured myself naturally and this was just one of those things where it wasn't planned at all and just happened like in that split second I was like okay let me just take ten drops I mean what 10 drops gonna be and ya had the scariest 7 hours of my life fortunately I came right I eventually managed to stand after seven hours I managed to get up stand I felt horrible and weird and zoned out but I felt a little bit more relieved that I felt like myself I felt like it just slowed down enough to a point where I felt I felt okay and I could I could go home so yeah that's my experience it's a horrible experience now I know there's I've really got so many messages from people all over saying it took too much and if you want the right those who just message me or if you want proper CBD oil with no THC I'm not interested in any of those things I'm not interested in any of those kind of questions telling me that I took way too much because I know it took way too much for myself but this was just something I thought I'd share because there are so many websites that you read and and obviously it's promoted as a safe thing to take and obviously if it's measured properly and in the right dosages then it can be safe and it can be useful for many things but if you're just taking it and you don't have any knowledge about it and you're taking too much like I did it can be scary and it can be dangerous and just now you're taking a higher dose and your body can't handle it and you end up having a heart attack or stroke or something that could have been avoided because you don't know enough so I hope my experience can just hope somebody make the right decision and not just take some research first I have been struggling to train I've been back to training maybe once or twice but because I've been so busy at work I haven't like got myself back into training and making videos on regular basis so I'll get back to making all my podcast series that I was trying to work on before all of this happened I hope this can help somebody and at least make them think before they try something I'll see you guys soon", "UEfhjR8CQys": "i'd like to welcome you here to the seminar thank you so much for joining us whether you're joining us live or you're viewing this later as a recording we are so happy to have you with us my name is naomi hoffer i'm the program manager for the sherry servado berson brain cancer survivorship program and with us also in the background here as part of our program is alexa greenstein who is our survivorship nurse practitioner and mary des tree who is our marin expansion program liaison who's expanding our supportive care services for survivors and caregivers to our marin patient and caregiver community this webinar is part of our regular living well after brain cancer treatment webinar series which is part of our growing survivorship program thanks to a generous donation from cherie cebrato brisson i know many of you many survivors are interested in medicinal cannabis and have heard a lot about it but there's a lot of questions so what do we know and what don't we know we're going to talk about that today with our experts so first of all we're going to be talking a little bit about the history and overview what is cannabis and what are the components what are the therapeutic uses what do we know that it's used for and what it might be beneficial for we're also going to hear about the research and current findings that we know exist right now what do we know about this and um then turn around what this means for you as you're considering using this for your own therapeutic uses so after we hear uh from our panelists we're gonna have some time at the end for q a and we invite you to submit your questions using the q a box and then we're going to have an after the show segments where we will hear from survivors and hear how those who are using it for brain tumor recovery and management of side effects how it's going for them and we'll have a chance to hear from you as well and hear your questions so i feel very privileged and honored to introduce two speakers with us today who are very well versed in this subject matter dr donald abrams is the immediate past chief of the hematology oncology division at san francisco general hospital and professor of clinical medicine at ucsf he has an integrative oncology consultation practice at the ucsf center for integrative medicine the osher center for integrative medicine and we are pleased to have him also as part of our regular survivorship programming at the ucsf brain tumor center alongside his expertise in cancer nutrition and botanicals dr abrams has a long history of interest and involvement in clinical research that evaluates medicinal marijuana on various patient populations he co-authored the chapter on cannabinoids in cancer in the oxford university press integrative oncology text that he co-edited with dr andrew weil he co-edits the national cancer institute's cannabinoids and cancer website and he was also a member of the national academies of sciences committee that published the health effects of cannabis and cannabinoids current state of evidence and recommendations for research published in january 2017. we're really honored to have him with us today and we also have dr eduardo rodriguez dr rodriguez is a glioblastoma or gbm clinical trial data scientist in the brain tumor center at ucsf he is a trained physician who graduated from national polytechnic institute in mexico city and also holds a master's degree in clinical research from ucsf dr rodriguez currently serves as co-principal investigator in the study on the impact of cannabis on the quality of life in patients with central nervous system tumors we are truly grateful to have him here as well to share his latest research with us we'll first hear from dr abrams and then from dr rodriguez and then back again to dr abrams but dr abrams thank you so much for being here and i will now turn it over to you thank you naomi it's a pleasure to be here so as mentioned i am going to start out by giving you a little bit of background on what cannabis is what cannabis isn't what we know about it and how long we've known what we've known so yes so this is my topic uh what do we really know i want to start out by reviewing a little bit the history of cannabis and what it may be useful for so this is the so-called siberian ice princess it's a mummy that was very well preserved in the ice in siberia she was so well preserved that her tattoos are actually being copied i understand by some millennials but in any event she turns out to be under an mri scan a woman in her mid-20s who appears to have breast cancer that spread to her bones and around her waist was a belt that had a pouch at the end of it and in the pouch were the flowers of the female plant of cannabis sativa suggesting that this woman dated about 2700 years ago knew about the potential medicinal benefits of cannabis it's postulated by the anthropologists or archaeologists or whoever makes these hypotheses that perhaps she was using cannabis to treat the symptoms of her cancer if not perhaps even the cancer itself and again i think that's a bit of a leap because we don't know that everybody in this tribe wasn't buried with cannabis around their ways so cannabis has been a medicine probably for the last 3000 years it's one of the oldest known psychoactive plants cannabis sativa or cannabis indica its reported first use again was 3 000 years ago in china south of mongolia made its way along the silk route to the indian subcontinent and then further west into the arab world where it was widely used as medicine cannabis was brought to the west by w.b o'shaughnessy who was a british east indie surgeon who was working in india and saw all the potential benefits of cannabis and brought it to the united kingdom at that time it had many uses supposedly as a pain reliever a relaxing agent anti-inflammatory against muscle spasms and also for seizures at the beginning of the last century in the united states most of the forerunners of what we recognize today as big pharma had cannabis products available for physicians to prescribe to their patients cannabis actually fell out of favor uh in 1937 with the introduction of the marijuana tax act where the mexican word for the drug was used to sort of fool physicians the act was introduced by a prohibitionist who felt that widespread use of cannabis by african-american jazz musicians and mexican migrant workers was going to lead to increased crime and mental illness in the united states so ultimately cannabis was removed from the united states formulary we know that cannabis is potent because of chemicals called cannabinoids which are present in the plant we believe that there are at least 400 different chemical compounds and of those about 140 are these structures that resemble delta 9 tetrahydrocannabinol which is actually the main psychoactive agent in the plant delta 8 tetrahydrocannabinol has been studied in israeli children with cancer and felt to be an effective anti-nausea medicine for children getting chemotherapy and then all of us are quite familiar now with cannabidiol or cbd which again is a related compound to the delta nine thc again in addition to those three cannabinoids there are at least 100 others and there are other compounds in the plant itself that have medicinal benefit so again some of the non-tetrahydrocannabinol cannabinoids are cbd which i'm going to talk more about cbn which is a breakdown product actually of delta 9 thc and many people who use old cannabis which is rich in cbn says say it's very useful for sleep cannabinogirol or cbg is another non-psychoactive cannabinoid similar to cbd which they say is going to be the next cbd as yet it has not been studied in clinical trials but people are trying to grow plants that have more cbg than current uh strains do i think a very interesting cannabinoid is tetrahydrocannabiurine or thcv which apparently decreases appetite decreases appetite for food for alcohol uh tobacco and also for opiates so this is uh if we're going to go about developing individual cannabinoids as medical treatments this one is one that we might hear more about in the future and in addition to the uh cannabinoids there are also flavonoids and terpenes which give the different strains their characteristic smells and it's felt that all of these work together in the plant to sort of balance the effects of the delta 9 thc which again is the main psychoactive component so it's sort of like the other compounds provide the yin and the yang or the yin to the thc's young if you will so they help increase and augment the beneficial effects of thc and perhaps decrease some of the adverse effects so since cannabis was removed from our formulary we haven't learned a lot about what it does therapeutically because it's very difficult to study since it's a schedule one compound which means that it has a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use according to our federal government but over the past 70 years since cannabis has been prohibited we've learned a lot about how it works basically all of us have two different types of receptors for those cannabinoids the cb1 receptor is one of the most densely populated receptors in the human brain unfortunately we don't learn about that in medical school that shows you the extent of reefer madness the cdb1 receptor is distributed widely throughout the whole body and this receptor is found in all animal species down through sea squirts the cb2 receptor is was originally not felt to be in the brain but subsequently has been identified but not at the great density of the cb1 receptor the cb2 receptor was initially found in cells of the immune system in the spleen and in the peripheral blood in the natural killer cells and the b lymphocytes suggesting that this receptor has something to do with immunity so why do we in all animal species down through sea squirts have cannabinoid receptors you've never seen a monkey smoking a joint well similar to our own endorphins our own endogenous opiates that we make we also make endocannabinoids we make our own cannabinoids chemicals similar to thc and the other cannabinoid compounds the first was identified by my friend and colleague rafael machulim at hebrew university in jerusalem felt to be the father of cannabinoid chemistry and he named it anandamide after the sanskrit word for bliss subsequently another endocannabinoid to arachnodonyl glycerol has also been identified so why do we and all animal species have this system of cannabinoid receptors and our own endogenous cannabinoids the endogenous cannabinoids are synthesized on demand and when they complex with the cb1 receptor they cause changes in the cells particularly the cb1 in the brain cell which lead to changes in our appetite in control of immune function muscles and pain in our thinking in our nausea etc and when these endocannabinoids complex with the so-called cb2 receptor they're also involved in alterations in our immune function in cell proliferation cells dividing inflammation and also pain i think michael pollan says it best michael is a berkeley journalist who wrote the book the botany of desire and he has a whole chapter on cannabis and he says the reason that we in all animal species have these receptors and endocannabinoids is to help us to forget and in his next book the omnivore's dilemma michael is trying to gather his own food and in each chapter it's about gathering food and in one chapter he's sitting in the woods holding a rifle on his shoulder holding very still actually crouched in the woods and he said this is painful and out of the blue he postulates that the reason that we in all animal species dependent on praying pr e for our food have this system is to help us to forget pain so with that in mind the activities of both thc and cbd for example do both share analgesic or pain relief as their main probably activity thc unlike cbd is psychoactive the cbd is felt not to be psychoactive but it is anti-psychotic for people who have those sorts of illnesses and it also decreases anxiety so i think it really depends on what we mean by psychoactive it's obviously acting in the brain it just doesn't get you high and we live in a society a puritan derived judeo-christian base that thinks that being high is something that's not something we should strive for and that's something that's a whole other discussion so you know cbd has sort of catapulted to the top of the most favored cannabinoid list because it doesn't get you high but it i think it is psychoactive and we know that again as michael pollan predicted that in states where cannabis is licensed and available for patients there has been a marked decrease in prescription of pain medications anxiety is also anxiety medications have also been released it was mentioned that i was on the committee at the national academies of science engineering and medicine that reviewed 10 000 articles on the health effects of cannabis and cannabinoids and these are some of the conclusions that we came up with as far as what it's most beneficial for the largest body of evidence is really in patients receiving chemotherapy that connect cannabis and cannabinoids particularly are licensed and approved to decrease nausea and vomiting we all appreciate that cannabis can increase appetite and again it seems to be very useful in patients who have chronic pain particularly most of the clinical trials have looked at patients who have neuropathy or pain generated from damaged nerves and cannabis in this situation seems to be much more effective than placebo and probably as effective as the currently prescribed gabapentin or neurontin i see many patients in my practice who really enjoy cannabis sometimes just cbd sometimes thcs sometimes both as a treatment for their insomnia saying that it definitely helps them to sleep and then the question of whether depression and anxiety are relieved i guess can be uh answered a little bit by the graph on the right showing that prescriptions for anxiety medications are markedly decreased in states where cannabis is available depression less so but definitely decrease so cbd again has gone from being an unknown cannabinoid to being uh the most favored and i attribute that to my friend and colleague sanjay gupta who did his first special uh weed in uh 2013. and in that show he showed charlotte figgy a young girl recently deceased who had refractory childhood seizure disorder go from a child that couldn't do anything because she was constantly seizing to the happy smiling girl on the right just after taking a drop of a cbd oil under her tongue and this ultimately led to gw pharmaceuticals developing the drug epidiolex which is now licensed and approved as a cbd treatment for children with this disorder prior to the large studies of epidialex there were really very few clinical trials on the use of cbd in humans most of the information that we had to rely on came from test tube and animal studies very few clinical trials of cbd existed but the in vitro and animal studies do suggest potential therapeutic applications we actually did a clinical a survey of patients at three integrative medicine centers in san francisco chicago and san diego as well as clients in 10 dispensaries in those cities asking people using cbd dominant products what they are using it for and as you can see here 50 reported pain is their main symptom that they used it for but fully 63 or two-thirds were using cbd for pain relief again 44 for anxiety a third for insomnia and 20 for depression and that's cbd dominant we also asked how effective this was and people rated it in all of these situations eight out of ten as far as being quite effective again this is not a placebo control trial but this is the sort of information that we need to provide us with sort of avenues to determine what we should study next personally however i think cbd is a bit over the top it's now a 23 billion dollar industry and at the farmers market at the ferry building we were surprised to see a cbd sunday for sale that was sold out and now there's cbd infused clothing that claims to prevent soreness before it starts and then last week or a few weeks ago stress zoo elephants are being given cbd oil to help them chill out and stop fighting i'd love to know if that worked or not so i am going to turn the session over now to my colleague who is going to talk about what we know about research in cannabis in brain tumor patients particularly thank you so much dr abrams we will hear again from dr abrams and invite him back and now i'm going to invite dr rodriguez to come up and as dr abram said to talk more about the the research being done currently with brain tumor patients at ucsf dr rodriguez are you here yes hello naomi hi i cannot turn and turn on my video it's been disabled right now um well thank you very much for an invitation and i would like to thank to all the participants for their interest in this this talk um and i think thank you to dr abrams for that good introduction on what's the overview of cannabis so now what i would like to address is what is uh naomi can you tell me if you're seeing my slides please yes we see it yes perfect um i would like to address what is being done in the realm of uh specifically neuron ecology with cannabis as dr abrams mentioned the research really in humans is being poor to say the least because of many hurdles and i think it's mainly because of all the legal aspects of it so i'm going to reiterate a little bit of what dr abrams already said so the potential uses for cannabis to treat nausea and vomiting induced by chemo radiation uh to help increase the appetite and therefore the weight in our patients when they are undergoing chemo radiation and cannabis moderately improved chronic pain and the only kind of not likely to have a role in depression is cbd uh although this is debatable because this all has been done only in um animal experiments and as we probably know too uh measured depression is a little bit tricky as well and uh like dr abrams mentioned most of the patients that report using cannabis say that it improves their sleep quality so medical cannabis as an anti-cancer the first article that was released let's say was in 1974 which actually was on a press release by the washington post where they claimed that marijuana psychoactive component thc slowed the growth of lung cancer breast cancer and virus-induced leukemia in laboratory mice and prolong their lives by as much as 36 percent i think this is um unique in the sense that it was uh first published on a paper rather than in a scientific journal and then afterwards the the scientific paper came out in 1975 and this is uh kind of like a screenshot of an enhanced image of course it's not the original uh image of both of those articles however it got the attention of the federal government and it was when when it got investigated and then it was put under schedule one by the dea which again it poses many legal hurdles uh since then uh there are there have been many efforts to try to prove that it's actually an anti-cancer agent but again most of the efforts have been done in animals and cells and much of the research has been done in thc because of the mechanism of thc is well known and cbd as well and information on the beneficial effects of non-psychotropic cannabinoids is right for in vitro and animal studies like i already explained and specifically to address the brain tumor realm is tricky because um most of the studies or most of the drugs are being developed to try to use as therapies to be effective in vitro or in animal models in rats or mice or monkeys but then when that is translated to humans it doesn't always work so that's definitely a place where we need to improve the the research that we are doing um on this realm in the brain tumor space cbd has shown remarkable results in vitro uh like dr abrams mentioned uh this this was first shown by uh the israeli group um but the mechanism unfortunately for which it prevents tumor growth is not fully understood there are many theories on why they do it uh some of them are they say because it depletes uh oxygen to the to the tumor cells and that that's a feasible uh mechanism but it's not proven um yet and there are very few clinical studies on cannabis and cannabidiol like i we already explained uh however uh all the in vitro and in vivo and animal studies suggests a potential therapeutic applications so what's the evidence in humans that we have so far where i have a few examples here and this is this was actually recently published on a systematic review that we that we did so we did an exhaustive review of the literature and we pulled some of the uh articles that we thought they were the most not only the most interesting but the the ones that add to the literature and in this topic so in 2006 in spain uh this is also a friend of dr abrams manuel guzman um conducted a pilot clinical trial study of thc in patients with recurrent glioblastoma and what he did was inject thc at different concentrations and different schedules in nine patients um unfortunately what this showed was um that it didn't even help so can you see my pointer uh naomi yes we can perfect so so these arrows this is just what i i just want to go over this really quick uh these are the mris of the patients and this curve what it shows is the growth of the tumor in in centimeters and cubic centimeters and the arrows is when uh thc was administered so as we can see actually didn't stop it uh same for here and this is this was uh patients who needed a resection so this drop that we see in in the tumor is uh the resection and then this is after resection so it actually didn't help however it was a small sample and of nine patients only and um and some of the measurements and some of the uh how it was applied it can be debatable but it was it's a step in the right direction uh in 2017 in england uh dr susan short conducted a two-part safety and exploratory efficacy study uh and what i like about what we like about this study is that it was randomized uh if people are not familiarized with this is when people are assigned assigned randomly to a specific treatment or placebo in this case so it was assigned to thc and cbd on a ratio one to one that means that it has equal parts thc and cbd and or to the placebo which was i think really while while there were undergoing uh those intense hemosolomide treatment in patients with recurrent glucose stoma um so the first part it was only six patients and it was just to to try to see if it was safe and it was well tolerated by patients and they determined that it was so they moved on to the second part where 12 patients were assigned to to cbd and nine cbd and thc and nine patients were assigned to placebo uh in this case they were it was actually demonstrated that it was safe and it showed good results for survival um in this case it is one of the best studies i think um the only issue is that is a small sample and it cannot be generalized to everybody as you can as you can imagine uh the results of 12 patients can be generalized to millions of people so that that's the caveat in this study but it's a again it's a study a step in the right direction and i think that this is um setting the basis for further research and then uh on one of the society for neuroecology meetings uh dr nicholas blunden published this poster the developing role of complementary cannabis therapy and glioblastoma treatment and uh he at the university of jail he administered oil concentrate of at least 50 milligrams of cannabinoid per day uh for at least one month plus uh standard of care treatments this means radiation or chemotherapy so but it was just voluntaries uh it was not directed to specific patients so it was to whoever wanted to participate in the study so 23 patients were registered and 15 of those 23 were using cannabis so they observed good results compared to low use or no use of cannabis meaning they improved their symptoms and they improved their their more tumor improved or got stable but the issue uh and i wanted to to remark really these words it was at least 50 milligrams and at least one month this means that it was not the same concentration for everybody and it was not the same time for everybody that they were using so again uh it's a step in the right direction but it's not necessarily the best way we can not generalize with this type of results and then in 2004 on the on the opposite side of the coin let's say as you probably know there are other efforts that have been trying to show the hasterts of consuming cannabis and i i like this paper as a good example on how some evidence can be misleading so in in this paper what they did it was a retrospective which means they went back to the electronic medical records of patients over time of a large amount of people but it was 130 000 patients from kaiser uh who filled out the questionnaire from 1977 to 1985. what i think is interesting here is that it was very close to that initial paper that was released in 1975 so so maybe the people people actually didn't answer sincerely because of fear of being stigmatized by either the government or their other members of society but they were at least 25 years old and patients were followed for 21 years retrospectively they were not actually followed they were not calling them in real time for 21 years and he identified 19 000 20 000 to round up people who use cannabis at least once the issue with this is that he categorized all these patients as cannabis users and that's problematic because if you used only once let's say that these are uh recent grads or even grad students level or on in the age range they could have been trying just for fun and he categorized them as them using cannabis he found that nine patients who ever use cannabis at least once per month develop glioma so again this is problematic because out of the 130 000 patients that we started he derived conclusions out of nine patients so um we need to put in context uh not only from the research point of view but also in time what's happening in society at that point and what's the age of the group so i will take these results with a grain of salt and now so after we pulled all that information uh dr nicholas wutowski who you may or may not know and see in the clinic uh he's a neuro-ecologist and he's a director of clinical research in in our department he observed that a good proportion of his patients were using cannabis for some kind of issue for sleeping for anxiety and they were saying that they were feeling better however in science and in medicine we cannot just say because my neighbor told me that this works i'm going to prescribe it we need evidence so we decided to do a observational study observational means we are not doing any interventions we are not giving cannabis to anybody we are just surveying where we are asking people how they use it and this is because of the legal barriers mainly uh the federal legal barriers so so and and we want to see how cannabis is actually impacting the quality of life of our patients over time so we decided to use uh quality of life because that's our main goal is to improve quality of lives of our patients um and we want to see if there's any differences between people who use cannabis in real time versus those who don't use cannabis in real time so what we are doing is we are enrolling patients we ask them a series of questions and then we every three months we ask them the same questions slightly different but essentially it's the same idea to try to see what how they are feeling and for one year uh i understand that this is not the the best the ideal will be to following them until they they get better or until they don't want to keep participating anymore however we have certain time constrictions so so we follow them for one year and then we try to analyze uh what's happening with quality of life so therefore all patients can participate in this study we have people who use cannabis and people who don't use cannabis and both are equally helpful for our study because we need we need to see if it's working and we need to see uh we need a comparator group so this is uh and what we have found so far um uh today we have enrolled 81 patients in our study out of 216 we are aiming for that for that number 200 people is fairly balanced we have 50 50 males and 31 females and they have various degrees of using cannabis i think it's interesting that the the females that decided to participate are the most balanced so it's almost 50 50 split which is great for for results and for us to be able to drive conclusions and then generalize those and um these are the main reasons why people are using cannabis in our clinic this is not that they are being prescribed is mostly uh why what's the symptom that they or the the reason why people think that is helping them so we have the the majority of people is actually using it to relieve any kind of symptoms and i'm going to go over that shortly uh some people think that is use is is helping them for the tumor treatment and of course we have the recreational users which is totally fine and then we have other other symptoms and in other symptoms we include include sleep aid and anxiety relief we understand that this is a disease that can create anxiety in people and this is definitely a an important point to make so these are the specific symptoms why people are using um cannabis which um they're similar to what dr abrams showed us before uh on the survey on cbd and the dispensaries uh is slightly different and we have here that the majority of our population is using it for because they don't feel hungry because of anorexia and they are trying to improve their appetite and their their weight for anxiety for depression in other we said we are including here um other symptoms that are not don't fit in any of these categories for migraine and for sleep aid and the rest of them are um i don't i don't want to discard them just out of hand but i think these are the more important ones and interestingly enough pain relief is actually not one of the main reasons why people use cannabis in our clinic again this is self-reported this is people are using cannabis uh because they think that is helping them with this kind of symptoms one of the interesting questions that uh is pushing for this uh research study is that when we ask people before using cannabis how they felt and this is on a scale from one to six and six is the worst they have ever failed and one is the best status let's say that they can feel uh before using cannabis they report a four a score of four which is fairly high and after using cannabis it shrinks down to to 50 to two so almost normal uh again this is self report and i know this is subject to some things that we call bias and and this is for recall by us because we are just asking if you remember where how you felt before using cannabis please let us know how you felt so there may be some some biases there but i think this is this is still really interesting and it's a good motivator for us to try to explore more of what's happening here again this is self-reported it's not actually what's happening so now um to measure quality of life we use a series of instruments we call it so surveys really that have been validated in large amounts of people and and we try to compare this right so the bars when the when the bars uh overlay that that means that it's not statistically significant but i think it's interesting to see how users people who use cannabis actually feel more fatty more nausea and more pain this is interesting because we will expect the opposite however this is how people start when when they they initially go into our study this is how they start so now the interesting thing will be to see if three months from now this this curve actually switch and the people who don't use goes here and and the people oh sorry the people that don't use goes up and the people that use cannabis goes down that will be an interesting flip to see uh we don't have enough data yet to show you those those data but um this is the this is how is the baseline of our patients and same for functional scales uh this this is actually the opposite the higher the score it is the better it is and the lower the score it is the worse it is so uh physical functioning role functioning emotional functioning and cognitive functioning uh all these are actually statistically significant and again this is how people enter into our study and what we aim in the following months or years is to to evaluate this data on on a time lapse basis so the conclusion and we think that uh this phenomenon also that we are seeing of how people using cannabis are actually doing worse it's not because of cannabis that they were doing worse is because they feel they have more symptoms and therefore they resort to cannabis so we need to prove this over time of course and we have we think this because 58 of our patients have a high grade glioma which is an aggressive glioma so and they are subject to feel more symptoms and this is why we think this is true however we need to complete enrollment to further evaluate cannabis over time and compare to non-users so the general conclusions here is that more formal studies like this one even if they are observational are needed but if they are controlled uh in a more controlled environment like placebo compared to placebo or compared to different concentrations of cannabis are needed to to prove that it's actually working it's also important to know that there are some interactions that we may or may not know because it hasn't been studied and it can be interfering with treatments and other medications that patients might be taking so we need to know more about this and we definitely need involvement of community physicians scientists lawmakers especially and other stateholders is needed of course in community patients are included because this is this is mainly driven for the benefit of our patients and we remember that what is observed if you come across with some paper or some press release that it claims that cannabis is helping for x or y reason uh if it's only been tested in test tubes or animals that doesn't necessarily mean that is going to work the same in humans and this is why we need more research in humans so having said that this is an invitation for everybody to join the study again we welcome both types of persons people who use cannabis and people who don't use cannabis they are equally important to our study to to come if you have any questions you can reach out to me or you can reach out to the general clinical research coordinator line and if you scan this qr code if you have an iphone or a newer android you can scan it and it will take you to this flyer and you can have that information thank you thank you so much dr rick rodriguez that's really uh great information and i feel like we need to kind of put a pin in this and invite you back when we get more of your study results so um thank you um mary has put in the chat box uh the contact information so you have it um i apologize for the clicking sound i don't know if that's gonna resolve itself because um dr rodriguez's mic but uh hopefully it'll resolve itself now so now we're going to turn it back over to dr abrams and really talk about what this might mean for you and some practical considerations thank you naomi uh really appreciated dr rodriguez's presentation and i i do want to note that many studies have uh found that same finding that the people that are using cannabis at the beginning uh have more symptoms and maybe that's why they turn to cannabis because they're not getting relief from their conventional therapies so what does all this mean let's put it together first of all often we're asked what is the best way for me to consume cannabis i see a lot of older women with cancer who go to the dispensary and they're told only eat a quarter of the cookie these are people that feel that inhalation is bad and eating is good so they eat a quarter of the cookie and nothing happens so they eat another quarter and nothing happens so they eat the whole cookie and then they call me three days later after perhaps a visit to the emergency room with a not very good feeling saying they're never going to do that again so they're describing the pharmacokinetics or what happens when we take thc by mouth it takes a very long time to reach a peak plasma concentration about two and a half hours and there's a delayed onset of activity which is why people say nothing's happened so they they consume more by mouth and then when you take the delta nine thc the main psychoactive ingredient by mouth when it goes through the liver on the so-called first pass metabolism the liver breaks the delta ix thc down into an even more psychoactive metabolite so that's why people get more zonk if you will when they eat edible products on the other hand if you inhale cannabis either via smoking or vaporizing not vaping i hate vaping that's the wrong word i'm sorry vaporizing then the effect is much more rapid the peak plasma concentration occurs in two and a half minutes and very rapidly declines over the next 30 minutes and since less of it goes through the liver than when you take it by mouth you create less of that 11 hydroxy more psychoactive metabolite so i tell patients if they would want better onset over better control over the onset the depth and the duration of the effect that inhalation is probably better than oral ingestion and when i say inhalation i mean vaporizing which means vaporizing the plant i've as an oncologist i've been quite concerned about this trend towards vaporizing an oil because i definitely know the long-term health effects of inhaling a vaporized or combusted plant but not an oil and i think that panned out to be a concern so i'm all in favor of vaporizing plant or even smoking in a bong or even cigarettes because i don't think the danger is very large we now have tinctures and oils and in fact even chewing gums and when you put these in your mouth you immediately absorb some from under the tongue and then except for the chewing gum you swallow the oil or the tincture so you get the sort of benefit of both inhalation and oral ingestion and i think more and more people are turning to these oils and tinctures people also in my practice have claimed that suppositories work who grows all the cannabis for the government research said that he doesn't think thc could be absorbed rectally but many of my patients make their own suppositories out of olive oil or coconut oil i forget and they say it definitely works and then there are topical products that patients often can use and get at a dispensary and find them very useful for local pain in arthritic joints or or muscle pain so there are many many different options for cannabis now again as an oncologist i am quite anti-sugar i think sugar is the worst thing that patients with cancer patients without cancer could consume so i am not a fan of the chocolate chip cookies that you see there i don't think edible cannabis products are ever medicine because of the sugar so as i said for better control over the onset the depth and the duration of the effect i feel inhalation is optimal it achieves the higher peak concentration and a shorter duration effect the slow onset of ingested cannabis may prompt one to overdose i mean you it's not like an overdose on an opiate you just feel uncomfortable and you need to get in a dark room and sort of lie down again the topical products uh probably have less systemic absorption uh and may have some benefits systemically but are probably best used locally so what are the potential side effects of cannabis well again particularly if people are not used to using it dizziness is possible especially if you stand up too quickly cannabis can increase the pulse rate and it can increase or decrease the blood pressure and that's why people who use cannabis and then stand up too quickly may experience dizziness dry mouth is common and again drowsiness is that a side effect or a desired effect i think for people who are looking for help with sleep it might be a good thing euphoria again there's that sort of being high is that a side effect or is that a desired effect uh you know i guess it's all not i have a beholder i certainly think that people who have a life-threatening disease are entitled to have some euphoria i think cannabis induced euphoria in my opinion is much healthier than the intoxicating effects of alcohol the blood pressure changes i mentioned red eyes headaches relaxed muscles and then there are some people uh who get paranoid uh increased anxious or depression and that's not good impaired memory is something that happens acutely but uh people who use cannabis chronically uh don't have any evidence of impaired learning or other cognitive issues on long-term follow-up tests we're often asked well what is the right dose and you know who knows what product people are talking about so it's highly individualized again everybody's cannabinoid receptors may be genetically different so some people smoke cannabis and they always get euphoric and some people smoke cannabis and get depressed and some people get paranoid and some people get no effect that could be set or setting it could be the cannabis that you have but it also could be the genetics of your cannabinoid receptors so giving a dose is difficult what we tell people this should be in quotes and have a s-i-c in parentheses after it because it's not grammatically correct but it rhymes so we like to say start low and go slow so start at the lowest possible dose and increase slowly to get to achieve the desired effect somebody asked the question 50 milligrams seems like a high dose while dr rodriguez was talking and i didn't catch whether that was thc which would be a high dose or cbd which in fact would not be a high dose because clinical trials of cbd have looked at up to 600 milligrams that's one thing about cbd people take from 10 to 600 milligrams that's a quite a wide range so again start low and go slowly but it's the mantra is go slow and then again you know talk to your doctor and see if they can help studies have shown that most physicians although they're in favor of medical cannabis don't really know enough about it to advise the patient so what i do is i tell the patients go to the dispensary tell the bud tender or the person behind the desk what it is you're trying to treat and ask them what might work another question that we get all the time is what is the right ratio of cbd to thc that i should take and again in animals cbd seems to reduce the psychotropic effects or the high if you will of thc when the ratio is eight to one or greater cbd increases the psychotropic effects of thc when the ratio is two to one or less so that's all in animals unfortunately and we don't really know that from humans and this little uh 18 to one eight to one four to one two to one one to one comes from care by design cbd which is a cbd uh company and this is what they uh postulate are the effects of the different ratios i tell my patients that the only ratio that's been studied in the medical literature is one to one and that is what the drug nabixamols is which is the drug that 12 patients got in the study that dr rodriguez described compared to the nine patients getting placebo so particularly for my patients with brain tumors who ask me what they should take i say well the medical literature right now supports a one-to-one ratio of cbd to thc so other safety concerns again older people people with cardiovascular disease coronary artery disease should be cautious i never say avoid really but should be cautious about use of cannabis and both thc and cbd interact with the system in the liver that breaks down prescription medications particularly cbd may cause a inhibition of that system so that prescription drugs are going to build up in the bloodstream and could become more toxic so that's why i'm often concerned about my patients who are taking these very highly concentrated oils of cbd or thc fearful that it may alter the dose of their prescribed medications leading to potential toxicity in our studies of the medical literature we really found that the only adverse effect in the lungs in people who smoke cannabis is increased uh cough and sputum consistent with chronic bronchitis we in fact did not see any evidence of increased lung cancer perhaps even some suggestion of decreased lung cancer and again people who have had bad experiences with cannabis excessively paranoid or depressed or too anxious should probably avoid it and then there's this rare condition that we're learning more and more about as more people use cannabis on a regular basis hyperemesis which means uh too much vomiting so you get repeated and severe bouts of vomiting uh in some patients it's a rather idiosyncratic reaction i would say because we think of cannabis as being an anti-nausea and vomiting medication but some people i guess because it's working in the brain on that center might get it triggered in the wrong direction and there are medications that people use to treat this some antipsychotic medications or many people say taking a warm shower is very helpful so do not drive if you're under the influence of cannabis is a recommendation that we're going to make but you know i'll tell you what studies are very unclear about what's happened in states where cannabis has become available recreationally whether or not there's increase in auto accidents is unclear and i think that people under the influence of cannabis actually are safer drivers than people under the influence of alcohol when this has been studied in laboratory conditions people under the influence of cannabis tend to drive more slowly and they weave a bit more but they stay within their lane this is quite different from alcohol when we looked at the adverse effect on newborns in women who used cannabis during pregnancy we did not see that many babies were born with a slightly lower birth weight but otherwise there were no long-term damaging effects but we're going to recommend that if you are pregnant you might want to avoid cannabis although many women who have prolonged morning sickness have found it very useful in the 60s and 70s and i think their children came out pretty normal so i just want to share a little bit about when you go to a dispensary you might be overwhelmed by the selection of products that are available so this is a menu from a dispensary that was online that i took a screenshot of you can see that the names people have done studies on these names and green dragon at this dispensary is not going to be necessarily the same plant as green dragon at that dispensary there's indoor and outdoor well why do they tell us the difference between indoor and outdoor well cannabis connoisseurs believe that you can really tell if something is grown outdoors in the sun and wind and rain or indoors under fluorescent lights and artificial fans and hydroponic water dripping or whatever so uh you know people feel that maybe indoor sometimes is a little more jangly as they say then they tell you if it's a sativa or indica and most of what you get in dispensaries are a blend of sativa indica it's unusual to get a pure product sativa in the folklore is felt to be up and mental whereas the indica is felt to be more down and physical so if you're having trouble sleeping you probably don't want a sativa if you're having trouble getting motivated you're not going to want an indica dominant blend and then this dispensary was just starting to look at cbd content the third one down has more cbd than thc the top two are the opposite and then they give you a little wine spectator one-liner a bright and cerebral sativa with euphoric overtones so you know we've come a long way in the cannabis world cannabis business i find a lot of patients that i see however are older a little confused they take a lot of different medications and they don't really want to go to a dispensary so a few years ago two pharmd's two pharmacists graduating from ucsf school of pharmacy came to me and said what would you think if we opened a dispensary and i said well that would be great so a year and a half later they came back and said you know what we found out it cost a million dollars down to open a dispensary so instead we started a concierge cannabis practice where we'll talk to patients and for a monthly fee we'll find out what meds they're taking what they want to treat and we'll send them as part of the monthly fee a tincture that we make up for them so many of my patients have benefited from talking to the folks at med1 specialty care their phone number is listed there in the spirit of full disclosure they want me to be more involved as a consultant and an advisor but we have at this point in time no financial relationship so i do offer this to people that are not cannabis sophisticated that might want to experiment with some cannabis products but aren't interested in going to a dispensary and being overwhelmed with all the selections that are available which certainly when i was growing up in the 60s was not a problem that we worried about so with that i'll thank you for your attention and hopefully we have time to answer some questions thank you so much dr abrams that's really wonderful information um dr rodriguez i'm going to invite you back up we do have questions uh that we had in the queue and please feel free to submit your questions using the q a function we do have about 10 minutes for questions so here's one of them i think i'm going to direct this to you dr abrams can you overdose if you consume too much cannabis again the uh overdosing usually means you know dying and and having your respirations turned off there are very few cannabinoid receptors in the brainstem which is where our respiratory center is so in fact there has never been a report of an overdose and it said that you would need to smoke 700 cigarettes in a very short time to overdose and that would be from carbon monoxide poisoning and not from cannabis poisoning thank you so much here's a question that came in um what are your thoughts on rso i don't know what that means but maybe you know yeah it's named after uh somebody who's currently on the lam this is a highly concentrated uh full cannabis extract oil that is being touted as being a cure for cancer and as dr rodriguez told us there is very little evidence in the medical literature that cannabis cures cancer i think if cannabis is going to have any benefit in any cancer it's going to be brain tumors because of the high concentration of the cannabinoid receptor in the brain but this oil and i'm not going to say the name of the man who is rs because i don't think he deserves that sort of publicity is something that's sold to patients and it's what i said i was concerned about highly concentrated oils being able to interact with people's other medications in a negative fashion so that those medications may become more toxic thank you so much um dr rodriguez this might be for you or for you as well dr abrams of email do you know if um medical cannabis is covered by insurance the answer is no no okay all right and for your study as well um eduardo it's there's no uh coverage as well they have to get it on their own and purchase it on their own as part of your study yeah but there's no cost for that it's just link surveys so there's no cost to be part of the study uh the only caveat that we have is that we we prefer people who are being treated at ucsf just because we also are pulling data from their medical records to to be a little bit more detailed on what information we get so if you come from outside of ucsf you will have to share those with us separately and that will that will be another layer but we can discuss if people are interested thank you so much um okay how do i know how many milligrams i'm getting if i'm smoking rather than using a tincture is there a measurement no no you don't know okay okay um and what sort of vaporizer would you suggest people buy any opinions on that well i mean we studied the so-called volcano vaporizer which is not a portable you know all of the studies that we've done have been done in the in-patient setting in the general clinical center research center at zuckerberg san francisco general the volcano is a table top centrifuge it looks like with a turkey basting bag was the original thing that you use to fill up by a heating element and a fan fills up this bed the company that makes the volcano stores in bickel has a number of uh hand-held portable vaporizers uh they are again much more intricate than a vape pen where you inhale oil um as i mentioned very concerned about inhaling oil into the lungs as a potential way to damage it so i would go for a portable vaporizer some people enjoy having their own volcano it's not cheap but it does deliver a vaporized cannabis which is probably associated with less harmful particulate matter than actually smoking a cigarette but a water pipe is also an acceptable way okay thank you so much and this is kind of a little bit of dovetailing on that what is the difference between vaporizing and vaping could you explain that again because you mentioned that in your i mean people people make use them synonymously but i think vaping has really come to be the term used for those little you know things where there's oil in one end and you inhale and it heats the oil and you're inhaling heated oil that is vaporizing an oil but that's become synonymous with vaping and oil vapor rising is heating to below the point of combustion the plant and inhaling that those vapors from the plant that hasn't been heated to the point where it's going to flame up and become ash but where it's just going to vaporize the active chemicals so i'm all in favor of vaporization but vaping has become a nickname for vaporization and i think it means something else okay thank you um in any of these studies how can you account for the possibility that people don't want to mention anything about their use of cannabis for example it's stigmatizing for their career um dr rodriguez do you want to address that first and then okay yeah uh fortunately this information that uh at least in the united states all the information that we collect is protected by hipaa so we do not disclose it and even if we share this information with others like we do in scientific meetings uh we do not disclose any any information that we call identifiers meaning dates of birth uh workplaces uh names uh even initials sometimes uh we change all those things to to be as anonymous as possible and um at least in our study of course this is study by study but in our study that information that is given to us does not go into the medical record so it's not subject to be reviewed by insurance or other third parties it just stays there for research purposes do you feel that that's the same for other studies as well they would protect that information uh in in our practice in our clinic yes um elsewhere i will i can speak for them okay thank you all right is there likely to be much political motivation either party democrats or republicans to remove cannabinoids from schedule one with dea federal government if not how is the cycle ever broken to do more research um rely on international studies anybody want to take that it's a very difficult question actually it involves many layers from my standpoint i think it's going to come down and probably dr abrams can say his own opinion is going to come down to how much money can people make unfortunately uh rather than how house impacting actually people's lives i don't know if there's i'm pretty sure there should be a partisan division there but i don't know if one side is more inclined to to move forward than the other well i think we'll just have to wait and see what comes up in the debates but uh my namesake the current has been the best president we've ever had on cannabis i have to say and it's because of what you said dr rodriguez he's a businessman and he appreciates that it's money and taxes and now pretty much every state has medical cannabis and even recreational cannabis and his opponent has always been an anti-drug person so i'm a little concerned okay thank you um there is a question about sugar use but i think i'm just we might table that um because that's a big discussion in and of itself and maybe we'll do another talk about sugar and cancer um so i'm going to read this question out this is one that that might be um difficult to answer because it's quite specific but dr abrams and dr rodriguez if you had an oligodendroglioma and it was 40 surgically resected would you go on a cbd thc regiment to hopefully resolve the remaining tumor so i'm just going to read a little bit more i do occasionally take um 90 to 90 10 ratio of cbd thc gummies in hopes that it will cure me i have no issues with my traditional cancer treatment side effects i only take these on hope to eliminate the remaining tumor so this is about tumor reduction any any thoughts about that for oligodendroglioma um yeah like we we uh stated before i think that um people need to be treated on a case-by-case basis uh these results that we are giving out on research is on the general level it's not an individual specific um but but like we mentioned we don't have uh the medical evidence to say that this will help in humans at least at least not not right now yeah i think that's the saddest thing i see in my practice or patients who are treating a potentially treatable sorry my dogs are being fed now people with a potentially treatable malignancy uh maybe not a brain tumor but who come to me having waited to see me for a number of months who now have a disease that can't be cured so i would say no you need to treat the remaining tissue the way dr rodriguez and his team would say to treat it and do not think that cbd or thc in any ratio will work thank you so much and i i think we're we'll have time for maybe just one quick question if you if you could um stay for one more uh why is thc associated with prop 65 label identified by the state of california to be a carcinogen to cause reproductive harm anybody want to take that one i think they have to say that about pretty much anything that they don't know enough about okay okay well i think that's all the time we have for questions from uh dr for dr abrams and dr rodriguez i want to thank you both so much for your time your expertise we really really appreciate it and um thank you again for for being here and thank you to all of you for joining us for this presentation it's wonderful to have you here we wish you well and hope to see you again in a future webinar [Music] you", "J42pmHV8ZEk": "Transcriber: Almudena Torrecilla\nReviewer: Rhonda Jacobs When I was 33 years old, I was diagnosed with breast cancer. And like so many who've gone before me, that diagnosis changed my life. It changed the way I look at the world. And it led me to two very common questions that one starts to ask when diagnosed\nwith a life-threathening illness. How did this happen? And what do I do now? Now this isn't a story\nabout self blame. These are just common\nand natural questions that come from many in times like these. I actually found the questions empowering. This is actually a story about how those\ntwo questions led to a realization that I think can help\nto change the conversation around what means to be and stay healthy. So back to my first question: how did this happen? See, (Sigh) I felt like I had done\neverything right. What do I mean by that? Well, if I ask you, what does\nit mean to be healthy, to live a healthy lifestyle? What kind of answers do you get? Regular exercise? Balanced diet? Taking your vitamins? Annual checkups? Limiting toxic exposure to chemicals,\npersonal care products? Well, by all of these\naccounts, I was healthy. I had done the work. So I was angry, and I was frustrated that I'd followed the rules\nand I still found myself sick. Now, I had a friend \nwho a few years earlier had been diagnosed with breast cancer. And when it came to being healthy, she put everyone I know to shame. So I knew she would understand\nhow I was feeling. When we got together, \nshe told me something that would eventually change the way \nI think about health. She told me that her journey \nhad taken her to a place where she believed whole-heartedly  that she had not in fact \nbeen truly healthy. Not at a whole person level because \nshe'd overlooked taking care of herself at the level of her thoughts \nand her emotions. So what she was saying \nhad some subjective merit to me because I can relate to suppressing\nmy own thoughts and emotions maybe in order to please others, or taking on the stress\nof trying to juggle a thousand things. But then the pragmatist in me just wanted to brush that off\nas a little too woo-woo. Then again I had, you know, tackled all of these. And here she was standing\nright in front of me, the picture of health and vitality. So what could it hurt\nto look into this a little further? So down I went through\nrabbit hole number one: mind-body medicine. And for those who of you don't know, mind-body medicine\nstudies how our mind, mood, thoughts and emotion affect our body. So that would be things like \nstress management, stress reduction, like going for a walk in nature, \nunplugging from technology, getting a massage, meditation, (Sigh) mindful breath-work, and thought and belief awareness. So this would be something as simple\nas being more mindful of our thoughts, or something more concrete \nlike cognitive behavioral therapy, where you become actively aware\nof your thoughts and behaviors and then replace them\nwith more positive alternatives that in turn elicit\nmore positive emotions. I also started delving into stories that highlight the mind's ability\nto affect the body. Like the peer-reviewed account\ndocumented by Dr. Klockner in 1959 about a man who he called Mr. Wright. Mr. Wright was diagnosed\nwith terminal cancer and given only days to live. With tumors the size of oranges \nhe had heard or a horse serum that was said to be effective\nagainst cancer and he begged to receive it. His physician, Dr. Philip West,\nreluctantly agreed but was astonished to find\nless than a week later his patient was out of his death bed \nand joking with his nurses. Now, this went on for months until Mr. Wright read a newspaper article stating that the serum was a quack remedy and he suffered an immediate relapse. Now, Dr. West, testing out a hypothesis, said: \"Well, don't believe everything\nyou read in the papers,\" and then he proceeded\nto inject him with what he said was a super-refined, double-strength\nversion of the drug. Really it was water. \nBut again, the tumors melted away. Mr. Wright was the picture of health\nand vitality for another two months until he read what he felt\nwas a definitive report stating that the serum was worthless, \nand he died days later. Now, this is just one of thousands\nand thousands of examples that highlight how the mind\ncan affect the body. And, so I had my anecdotal evidence, which\nincluded the example of my own friend, and I'd like to say that I took\nwhat I learned and put it into practice and lived happily ever after. Of course, that's not what happened. And I don't think I'm alone in that, because many of us hear about how stress\nand emotions can affect our health and how mindfulness meditation\ncan make a difference in our lives and all of that, but many of us also \ndon't do anything about it. I had the stories and the theories, but what I really needed\nwas hard evidence, science to prove that it was true. I mean, we've all grown up\nin a world of, you know, Newtonian, science-based thinking, meaning if we can't see it\nor measure it, then it's not real. So I, like maybe, maybe many of you, didn't start to put these ideas\ninto practice just yet. What I did, and this is now getting into \nthe second of the two questions that I alluded to earlier,\nthe \"What do I do now?\". What I did is I started using\nmedical cannabis at the recommendation\nof my nurse and other patients. And it helped immensely with pain \nand nausea and anxiety and all of the really fun staff\nthat come along with cancer treatment. I also started joining online\nmedical cannabis user communities. And I was in awe at the spectrum of issues\nthat cannabis was helping with. Intractable illnesses that weren't\nresponding to other forms of treatment, like MS, fibromyalgia, PTSD,\nTourette syndrome, IBS, epilepsy, chronic pain, autoimmune\ndiseases ... I could keep going. The list goes on. But I started to wonder, how was it\nthat cannabis was helping with all of these unrelated conditions, because I can't think of another\nmedication out there that would be able to help \nwith so many illnesses. So how did it work? Well, down I went\nthrough rabbit hole number two, and this was a deep hole. In a nutshell, I learned that the reason that cannabis was working \nfor so many different conditions is because it interacts directly with \nour body's own endocannabinoid system. The endocannabinoid system is\na little known but massive bodily system responsible for maintaining homeostasis,\nthat's balance, in the body. It consists of a network of \nneurotransmitters called endocannabinoids as well as receptor sites, the most well-known being the CB1 and CB2\nreceptors, and enzymes. Think of it kind of like\nthe traffic lights of a city, keeping the streets moving smoothly. But if a light goes out anywhere,\nit will cause problems. Congestion, confusion. Cars and people will keep moving, \nbut without the guidance and the rules, the flow just won't be as efficient \nand far more susceptible to accidents. It's actually been called the most\nprolific and integrative system in human health and homeostasis, and even dubbed\nour body's own master system because of its role in maintaining balance\namong all the other systems of the body. Now, this is important because all illness\ncan in fact essentially be boiled down to some sort of imbalance in the body, whether genetically induced or otherwise. Now, if you haven't heard of this system\nbefore, you're not alone. And if you are hearing about it \nfor the first time, you may be wondering why on earth you haven't heard of this\nepically important system until now. And it's partly because it's newly\ndiscovered in around the 1980s, but also partly because\nof the stigma around cannabis, for which the system is named. Because scientists discovered the system when they were trying to answer\nthat same question: \"how does cannabis work?\" So they learned that compounds in the\ncannabis plant called phytocannabinoids actually fit near perfectly\nwith the receptor sites of the endocannabinoid system. So used properly, this plant\ncan help to activate, tone and support the endocannabinoid\nsystem when it's out of balance. So it's a pretty amazing plant. To say I became obsessed with\ncannabis and the endocannabinoid system is an understatement. I buried myself in research papers,\nlectures, courses, certifications, learning everything I could about cannabis as well as ways to keep\nthe endocananbinoid system itself healthy and balanced. Because while it's easy to say, \"wow, look at this amazing\nplant that we have; it's able to help\nwith all these chronic conditions and balance the body,\" and obviously I believe that; I've dedicated part of my life\nto spreading the message that cannabis is medicine. But it's equally important\nto look beyond cannabis as a single cure. Because when you look closer, you'll see\nthat cannabis is an important ally, but it's only part of the puzzle. So, let's use that example again\nas the endocannabinoid system and the traffic lights. Except for in this scenario, cannabis\nis like the friendly police officer that comes in to direct traffic\nwhen the lights are out. So the officer's doing their best, and certainly it's helping to keep traffic\nmoving in a more organized manner, but we still have to figure out\nor at least try to figure out how to fix the lights. So how do we go about fixing the lights? How do we support and heal\nthe endocannabinoid system when it's out of balance? Well, it just so happens\nthat one review study in particular looked at 325 other studies that all focused on what helped\nand hindered the endocannabinoid system by focusing on key\nendocannabinoid health factors, and here's what they learned\ndirectly affect the system. Exercise, and notice I wrote\n\"Pleasurable Exercise\" there - it has to be something\nthat you enjoy doing. Okay? Diet and supplements.\nSo a couple examples that I'll give you. Herbs and spices contain\nsmall amounts of phytocannabinoids, the same compound that cannabis contains. And certain healthy fats can actually\nhelp your body to synthesize its own endocannabinoids. Environmental exposures. So some pesticides will actually\ndownregulate the endocannabinoid system, have a direct effect with it. There are a few others\nI'm going to share with you. But before I do, I just want to bring\nyour attention to a sentence that really jumped out at me\nwhen I was reading this study. It said that the endocannabinoid system represents a microcosm\nof psychoneuroimmunology. And I had to look that last word up. In case some of you don't know,\nI'm going to break it down. Psychoneuroimmunology is the study of the interaction\nbetween the psychological processes, \"the mind,\" and the systems\nof the body, \"the body.\" So really it's just a fancy way of saying\nthat metaphorically speaking, the endocannabinoid system represents\na microcosm of mind-body medicine. So now hopefully you can see\nwhere this is all coming full circle and coming together, I hope. Because here's what else was shown\nto affect the endocannabinoid system: Chronic stress. So they looked at stress from pain as well as stress\nfrom thoughts and emotions, so repeated feelings\nlike anger, guilt, depression - something that is chronic\nmeans more long-term. That was shown to significantly impact\nthe endocannabinoid system. And activities that elicit \nthe relaxation response. So that would be, again,\nkind of that walk in nature or doing some yoga, getting a massage. They consider osteopathic\nmanipulation in that study. So why does this matter? Well, I said before that we live\nin a physical world, so for many of us if we can't see it\nand measure it, then it's not real. I told about how I had heard stories\nabout how the mind can affect the body, but I still didn't give it the same weight\nthat I would give to nutrition and movement and medicine. But when I understood\nthat my own endocannabinoid system, my master system for maintaining\nhealth and homeostasis, required me to start taking care\nof my thoughts, my emotions, my stress, my beliefs, it finally clicked for me. So I want to leave you\nwith a scenario to imagine, an idea of how this information can help\nto change the conversation around health, like I said in the beginning. Imagine if the message that we heard from\nour physicians and public health officials sounded like this: \"Listen, what if I told you that there's\nthis really important bodily system, call it a master system, and if you can keep it functioning well, it can do wonders in allowing your body\nto innately keep itself healthy, heal itself and improve the quality of life for those\nwith biological and genetic illnesses.\" If I told you there was\na system like that, would you want to know\nhow to keep it strong and healthy? And I think most would answer yes to that. And then they would go on to say, \"Great, \nso think of this system like a stool. Each of the legs represents\nall that's required to keep the system functioning well. And here's why we compare it to a stool. Each of those legs is an integral part\nof keeping that stool stable and balanced. If we remove a leg, or even shorten a leg,\nthe whole stool starts to wobble and becomes less efficient,\nless stable, less balanced. So let's design a plan for you\nthat incorporates all of these concepts as part of a healthy lifestyle.\" Imagine. Not only is that proactive,\nbut it's empowering. And I invite all of you to consider\nwhere your stool is wobbling. It's been said that mindfulness could be\nthe next great public health revolution. I believe it's only a matter of time\nbefore mindfulness, stress reduction, thought-belief awareness is every bit\nas important as seeing your doctor, taking your vitamins, eating a balanced\ndiet and getting regular exercise. And maybe the endocannabinoid system\ncan help to catalyze that. It's my hope that the more we understand\nthe ramifications of this master system, the more we'd be willing to develop\na truly integrated approach to whole personal health. Who would have thought\nthat cannabis, the gateway drug, could actually form part of the gateway to\nthe next great public health revolution? Thank you. (Applause)", "7ZD-NQWruX0": "the cannabis plant does not produce THC tetrahydrocannabinol directly instead it first produces the precursor to THC called THC a which is tetrahydrocannabinol ik acid decarboxylation is the chemical reaction responsible for the removal of the carboxyl group which converts the THC a into THC what is a carboxyl group without going too deep into the chemistry is a single hydrogen and carbon atom with two oxygen atoms that are all bonded together and grouped to the THC a molecule eater time causing this bond to break is decarboxylation why break the bond THC a is non-psychoactive meaning it won't get you high the reason THC a is non psychoactive is because it is too large of a molecule to fit into our brains cannabinoid receptors compared to the THC molecule which is smaller without the addition of the carboxyl group now you may be thinking that doesn't quite my sense I smoke weed all the time and it gets me high if it's only THC a how am I getting high without the THC in the weed what happens when you smoke or vaporize cannabis is you're applying heat and D carbing it breaking down the THC a into THC and destroying the carboxyl group as you smoke it how do i decarboxylate just set your oven to 122 degrees Celsius or 250 degrees Fahrenheit leave you the cannabis in the oven for an hour or two and it'll be fully decarboxylated and ready for edibles can wrap the cannabis in tin foil or put it into a mason jar to reduce the smell it's also worth noting that THC a converts the THC at a rate of 0.87 seven so that means that one gram of THC a will convert into 0.87 seven grams of THC this rate is used when calculating THC percentages in stores when you see that your cannabis in the store has a percentage of 22% THC it actually has a higher rate of THC a and they're converting it to THC using this percentage can you overcook the cannabis when decarboxylated and ruin the THC there's a lot of misinformation floating around the internet about decarboxylation some of it routes from one poorly done study that made this graph the study led many to believe that a lower temperature was needed and any temperature above 250 degrees Fahrenheit would rapidly destroy the THC content in the cannabis however this study was flawed as it was heated on an open glass surface exposed to air as well as being an extremely low THC percentage to begin with as you can see in this chart there is less than 15 milligrams of THC per gram at the peak of the experiment for a hexane concentrate or any concentrate that is a very low THC percentage less than 1.5% to begin with it's less than starting with but a more modern study found some more relevant information in the study that dissolved 25 grams of Keith in 500 milliliters of coconut oil their solution sat for two months before beginning the experiment to ensure that it was fully saturated they submitted this solution to several independent labs which found that the solution was free of any CBN CBN is the molecule that is produced when THC degrades or is overheated the THC a solution was set on a hotplate stirrer with a temperature probe set to 122 degrees Celsius and the hot plate set to 350 degrees Celsius the temperature probe ensured that the heat did not reach above 122 degrees Celsius inside of the solution what's the solution reached temperature a timer was engaged for 24 hours samples were taken off at every 6-hour interval at 6 hours it was found that only 0.1 milligrams per milliliter of CBN was found in the solution and at 24 hours zero point four milligrams per milliliter was found in the solution the experiment found that the THC to cbn conversion was so low that it's not worth worrying about when you're doing adi carb as long as you're not doing it over 250 degrees fahrenheit and you're not doing it for over 24 hours you're not going to destroy your THC while the THC levels of the kief were not disclosed in this study we can assume that 25 grams of Keef is at least 10% THC a and that gives us two thousand five hundred milligrams of THC a that's five milligrams per one milliliter so after 24 hours only 0.4 milligrams per milliliter was converted to CBN that means that only 0.008 percent of our starting ratio of THC a has ultimately been converted to CBN after 24 hours he at 250 degrees Fahrenheit that ultimately concludes you do not have to worry about over decarboxylate in your cannabis I hope this sets your mind at ease when your D car being in the future and good luck making some edibles", "sjqhtoh7xLQ": "so you'll take this part of the plan and that's eventually what becomes the CBD it is yep yep at med farm Colorado's first licensed cannabis research facility CEO Albert Gutierrez walked us through how CBD is extracted from a cannabis plant to oil first it goes to a co2 extractor and is further separated with ethanol we're gonna separate the waxes and fats and we don't want in the product from the cannabinoids that we do want to see VD smell then the ethanol is separated in what's called a rotary evaporator that's usually about 75 to 80 percent cannabinoid content so what is this machine this is a white film evaporator we're loading that cannabinoid content that we just got out of the rotary evaporator into here and we're gonna let that content seep down into this jacket right here so you'll get CBD testing it then 90 to 99 percent purity and we'll test it right after this but that's going to be very high quality products and we call it that the money jar and this idea you might have a little bit as well okay for testing just to see can you extract it more from here absolutely her choreography we can extract it and make it isolated to be booty recessive teen performs a series of tests to know what they're making oil this is just a base and we can make into whatever we need to make out of it what you're gonna make creams tinctures who can make pills CBD can also be crystallized this is the crystallized form in the powder form of that no THC in here strictly CBD is testing at 99.9 percent purity then put into a product and shipped out to consumers buying into the

my daughters were four and two years old and um just i was flawed i didn't think that that i would be a breast cancer patient during treatment bernice o'donnell experienced many common side effects of chemotherapy at the time medical cannabis wasn't legally available with chemo i ended up being nauseous like so many other chemo patients and um to combat that the doctors prescribed anti-nausea medication which was helpful however with chemo you end up having difficulty for me at least um difficulty passing food and then the anti-nut anti-nausea medication made it even more challenging to pass food current day if i had gone through it i would have i would have tried the medical cannabis as of july 1st patients in virginia now have the option of using medical cannabis through virginia's regulated medical cannabis program patients have been able to find relief from the side effects of chemotherapy by using medical cannabis relief for issues like pain nausea loss of appetite and sleep

the pottery in Los Angeles today we're going to talk about cannabis sublinguals people like tinctures if they don't like to smoke anything if they prefer faster method of ingestion or faster activation compared to edibles and it's more direct than say a topical or anything like that it's still getting into your bloodstream and it's still you know if you're taking active THC it's gonna get into your bloodstream as an active cannabinoid a team shirts are good for places where you can't smoke maybe you can't even be seen smoking something just discrete easy to use one you would just take your dose is worth you know whether that's a drop or a full dropper full and you just put it you know open the dropper put it under your tongue and let it rest under your tongue for about 15 seconds it usually takes about 15 to 40 minutes to feel the effects but it could take up to two hours so don't double down until those two hours have passed so the first one I want to talk about is the love potion number seven from Humboldt apothecary this is just a strictly THC tincture technically a sublingual it's in MCT oil and it's got it also has damiana cinnamon kava kava I guess to get the blood pumping if you will considering this one's called love potion number seven that sounds good and then next I've got a CBD sublingual from prana this one there p5 is a non psychoactive or non intoxicating CBD only tincture and this one's got 400 milligrams CBD in it and nothing else besides ACDC terpenes which is your CBD strain so it's CBD flour whole plant cannabis derived terpenes and CBD but there is no trace THC in this this is just pure CBD in terms of cannabinoids this one is a normal eye dropper I just don't have it is childproof on the outside so I can't quite take it out to show you but rest assured it's gonna look like your typical eyedropper it's gonna look like an eye dropper but you in your mouth so the next one I've got a high CBD meta haze tincture from chemistry so this one is interesting because it has CBD a in it CBD a is the raw form of CBD so it still has an extra oxygen molecule but in this case we've got both it's got CBD and CBD a as well as THC and THC a so this is a really nice combination of the raw cannabinoids as well as active cannabinoids you will experience a little bit of psycho activity due to the THC the high CBD should help with any anxiety or paranoia again if you're not comfortable with THC this one's probably not for you if you are comfortable th see this would be a really great awake painkiller or anxiety reliever now we've got a 1 to 1 tincture that's THC to CBD strictly coconut oil cannabis oil nothing more nothing less in a 1 to 1 ratio which is the you know the optimum healing ratio it is going to be psychoactive but it's also going to be very effective for pain relief maybe help you sleep at night as well but this one will definitely have some psychoactive effect so up next we've got something from one of my favorite brands poppin barclays right ratio pack this is a new thing from them you've got a 30 to 1 CBD the THC tincture and a one to thirty th see the CBD tincture essentially what they want you to do with this is create your own ratios they're giving you the full CBD one with trace THC and the full THC one with trace CBD that way you can make your own ratios you can do a four to one or essentially they're giving you the power to find out what works best for you it's a really good product for somebody who wants to experiment maybe try a little bit more THC than they're used to or a little more CBD to see what that does so all in all I like to think that sublinguals and tinctures as opposed to something like a pill or a vape pen stays true to the spirit of cannabis and that sort of holistic natural wellness side of things where you know you'll take a team cheer for it as opposed to taking a pill or a battery vape pen or something it's a very natural way of dealing with things

adults if you search up these topics online there are a variety of different claims being made that either exaggerates or understates the effects of marijuana on teens it can be difficult to know who to listen to but not to worry today we'll look at scientific studies to answer these questions for you welcome to demystifying medicine so what is marijuana marijuana is a drug derived from cannabis plants that is commonly used for psychoactive properties in other words marijuana can alter mental states and lead to intoxication and euphoria this effect is more commonly known as being high two important chemicals found in cannabis are tetrahydrocannabinol commonly known as thc or cannabidiol also known as cbd collectively there are known as cannabinoids thc is a psychoactive component of marijuana known for its ability to make you high cbd is more commonly known for its therapeutic uses and is the reason why medical marijuana can be used to treat a variety of different medical conditions medical cannabis products derived from cbd are commonly used for reducing pain inflammation and seizures marijuana can be used in a variety of different ways including smoking in the form of edibles or tea as well as in the form of an oil or extract which contains increased concentrations of thc [Music] whether you've used marijuana yourself or if you've seen movie characters spark up in late night comedies on netflix you probably already know the short-term effects of marijuana but what happens after the high has worn off recent studies have shown that over time adolescent cannabis users may experience a variety of different cognitive declines these include deficiencies in general executive functioning learning memory and motivation general executive functioning takes place in the very front of the brain it helps with planning and accomplishing tasks monitoring emotions and habits and plays an important role in working memory and attention this is also the slowest part of the brain to develop as it continues to mature up until the age of about 25 years old it was found that daily and weekly teenage cannabis users experience impairments in their general executive function compared to adults specifically in attention and working memory which is the ability to retain information over a short period of time teens were found to be more likely to crave marijuana after their high has worn off compared to adults which can lead to binge-like behaviors it has been suggested that the magnitude of impairment is greater in youth than adults for the functions of learning and memory studies have found differences in the way that certain parts of the brain work between teenage cannabis users and non-users these differences were found in parts of the brain that are believed to influence different types of learning and in parts that help form our cognition these differences however between teenage and adult users were most prominently seen among heavy users it has been implied that daily intoxication during young adulthood can impair the successful attainment of education and directly influences the level of income the heavy marijuana users can achieve for adolescents let's start using marijuana later and occasionally the risks are much lower marijuana may also impact motivation which helps us work on our goals and make our dreams into a reality it has been shown that heavy cannabis use during your teens can lower general motivation later in life across studies it seems as though factors that predict worthlin effects include usage and age of onset generally the earlier you start using and more frequently you use the worse the performance in cognitive functions and mental health throughout the video you may have heard phrases such as it is suggested and seems to indicate so why don't we have results that are conclusive and give us more of a clear answer this has a lot to do with current barriers to research and the limitations of studies being conducted in the united states it is illegal to conduct marijuana research under federal law this means that scientists must use chemical formulations that are not derived from cannabis plant as a substitute for marijuana this raises concerns as to how generalizable the study findings are to the real world even in areas where marijuana research is legal the exact amount of thc or cbd is not usually labeled correctly or clearly on marijuana products additionally there are also different strains of cannabis plants each with different potencies and profiles that play a huge role in how marijuana affects the body [Music] because of these limitations we should take the results of these studies with a grain of salt so what is the conclusion what is the effect of marijuana on teens well the answer is complicated only a few countries legalize marijuana research and the legalization of marijuana is still fairly recent so we need a lot more studies to be absolutely sure but based on what we don't know consistently using marijuana as a teen or adolescent may have serious implications when it comes to your cognitive functions so if you're going to use weed make sure that you assess these risks use it sparsely and safely [Music] do [Music] you", "pmx_A8tQRpE": "[Music] I'm dr. Watson hub I'm an associate professor in the department of neurosciences at the University of California in San Diego and I have been doing essential tremor research or really almost 15 years now and as you might imagine this is a disorder that affects many individuals and yet funding for this area has been much more limited [Music] we have studied various aspects of deception tremor including the causes using your imaging methods and more recently working on medications that may be able to help essential tremor one question I commonly receive from my patients is what about marijuana or cannabis and I think my response is usually we don't know I think many people have questions about that they have curiosities about it in an era that we live in right now we're may be available for medicinal purposes or even for recreational purposes there's this perception that this is a safe option for patients and so probably going back four to five years we had some interest in this I had a little bit of pilot data from some of my patients and so we went about trying to propose a trial to study the effects of cannabis along essential tremor [Music] now at an early stage like that where it's simply an idea and there's not a lot of data to show whether it works or whether it's safe there are very few avenues by which to get funding for that sort of a study and routinely in my experience the area that we typically pursue is going to the international section tremor Foundation IETF and provided some pilot funding to my prior neural imaging grant and that led to a eventual and large NIH trial which right now but when it came to cannabis we were not believing into participation from pharmaceutical companies the NIH did not have enough pilot data for us to be able to pursue those sort of avenues and so we submitted a proposal to the IETF and after a scientific review process we were fortunate enough to get funding and so that is now starting the trial is a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial of two components of cannabis THC and CBD and this is in a very unique formulation this is the first oral capsule delivery of cannabis and so we're in the process of securing this trial to evaluate its advocacy to evaluate its safety and learn much more about this and see whether this is a viable option [Music]", "T9tIe981YFA": "chance the jury will take a field trip to the Middle school to see where the alleged crime occurred. Knew it. Six tonight There is a new product on the market that's being touted as legal marijuana without a prescription. It's hitting store shelves all across the Bay Area. It's something you should be aware of. FOX 13's Josh Cascio reports. Experts have a warning tonight. Sign inside Chillin Glass Gallery in Ybor City reads loud and clear trying this stuff. Delta eight, THC will get you high, Unlike your standard marijuana. This stuff is being sold legally to buyers without a prescription. The difference. What we're talking about here is Dr 90 CBN cannabis of the 80 s being available in hemp. Right. It's available in hemp. It's legal, right still gets you stone, and it's made it legal under the same laws. It made CBD illegal. It's said to be 70 to 75% as potent as the real thing. The best way to think about that is for every two hits off of Delta nine. It takes three hits off adult to hate. So essentially all you all you need is to consume a little bit more in order to feel the same effect right now. The medical marijuana system We have to see a doctor every seven months. On you're fading like extreme prices for cannabis. Some of these patients can't do that. So it allows us to offer an alternative to that whole system, the DEA or Drug Enforcement Agency says it's currently in the process of reviewing the rules surrounding products like Delta eight THC, I'm not surprised because I warned everybody that. It really wasn't medicine for the very sick. It was the camel's nose under the tip, and we've not seen all that We're going to see, says Pull County Sheriff Grady Judd. It should be noted Delta eight will likely show up on a drug test. You could also get it, Do you? Why? If you're driving high on it, what we're seeing here today is not the end result. But the next step. And to find another way to Stone America. I'm worried about the health. Of your loved ones that's going to drive on the same highway with a person that takes enough of this low Delta eight to get stone. So it's not gonna be", "wVlIZkbdwF4": "[Applause] the morning of February 12th 2012 started off pretty normally in my busy medical office in Denver with phones ringing patient consultations pretty much business as usual and I was with a patient when my office manager Joyce knocked on my door that was unusual Joyce never knocked on my door when I was with a patient there's a call for you she said you handle it I said little irritated no this is a call you need to take she said that call would change my life and the lives of my patients from then on the woman on the phone was named Paige and she sounded desperate dr. Shackleford she said would you please see my five-year-old daughter Charlotte and my first thought was no I don't work with children and then Paige told me that Charlotte had been having seizures since she was six months old and she had been diagnosed with a rare genetic condition called dravet syndrome none of the medicines that had been prescribed for Charlotte had worked not one of 17 different prescription drugs and now they wanted to try a horse tranquilizer from Europe and then Paige said something that really stunned to me she said she had been reading that medical marijuana might be able to stop seizures and she said dr. Shackleford will you please recommend some so that we can try it for Charlotte and I was dumbfounded I how could I possibly rationalize recommending that a child use marijuana for any purpose and I was concerned that if I did it it might endanger my medical license but then Paige told me that Charlotte had had two cardiac arrests too at the age of five and it made me think of my daughter Vanessa who was swimming in the ocean and ice skating and eagerly looking forward to starting school when she was Charlotte's age and Charlotte had never experienced any of those things and she might never experience them because 73 percent of children with dravet syndrome who have uncontrolled seizures died before their 10th birthday and when I finished medical school I pledged to use all of my skills and all of my training to sustain life to care for the patient's I was privileged to take care of to the best of my ability to use all that training to cure when possible but to comfort always and so I knew that I had to see Charlotte and I wouldn't necessarily promise to recommend that she used marijuana but I would see her and a few days later Paige and Charlotte came to my office and in the two hours that Charlotte was there she had five seizures one in the parking lot two in the waiting room and two while I was examining her now imagine your child having seizures like this again 300 a week 3 an hour every hour of every day for five years now I had heard pretty much the same thing that Paige had that there was a compound in the marijuana plant called CBD or cannabidiol that might be able to control seizures there was one study on it published in 1980 and I just happened to have read that so CBD is remarkable unlike THC it doesn't get you high and I did not want for Charlotte to get high I also didn't want for her to smoke marijuana in fact I don't want anybody to smoke marijuana because oral dosing is much more effective and so I filled out the necessary paperwork so that Paige could go down to the dispensary and buy all of the high CBD low THC cannabis in Enver an ounce and a half for $800 and Paige gave it to an herbalist friend of hers in Colorado Springs who extracted it into an oil and then Paige very nervously put several drops of it in Charlotte's mouth and I was on pins and needles after this waiting to hear what had happened had it had it worked or had it been a dismal failure had the whole thing maybe been a huge mistake it was like waiting for the astronauts to land on the moon if you remember that and then finally when Paige did call me she said dr. Shackleford Charlotte has not had one single seizure for an entire week not one it's like a miracle and Paige was right it was a miracle for Charlotte but I had known long before I met Charlotte that medical cannabis could work wonders I knew it actually three years before because a patient of mine named Joan in an occupational medicine practice where I was working at the time had asked me to make it possible for her to use marijuana for pain and and I Joan was a remarkable patient but she had been injured in a work accident and was taking more than a hundred percocet tablets a month and the pain was still so bad that she couldn't do normal household chores even cook for her family and she was severely constipated and was worried about being addicted but she had read that marijuana might be helpful for chronic pain and she begged me to make it possible for her to do so so very reluctantly I filled out that paperwork so Joan Cattrall and Joan went out and got the medical cannabis now I say reluctantly because I know nothing about it I didn't know anything really about how to recommend cannabis and there was no medical research on it I couldn't find any articles on it in any of the medical journals that I was reading you see on that classically-trained very conservative physician I graduated from the University of Heidelberg School of Medicine where I did research as a medical student and then I did seven years of post-grad training at the Harvard Medical School where I was also a research fellow I don't usually recommend treatments that I don't understand and I want to know exactly how the drugs work but I didn't have access to any of that scientific data that I normally relied on when it came to medical marijuana what I did have was a desperate patient whose pain medicines weren't working very well and to my surprise and I have to say to my great relief it worked extremely well for Joan Joan was able to reduce the number of percocet she was taking from a hundred a month to fifty than the 20 and then she could stop taking it altogether it was really pretty remarkable now today just six years after I first met Charlotte there are lots more articles in the scientific literature on the medical uses of cannabis and on the more than a hundred different compounds found in the marijuana plant that are remarkable for their medical applicability let me give you an example researchers in California have found that cannabis is a particularly good treatment for pain and it is in fact the THC that is so powerful researchers in Israel learned that nearly half of the patients with Crohn's disease who use medical cannabis no longer have any symptoms of the disease at all and there are tantalizing early indications from from research on the plant that some of the compounds found in the marijuana plant may someday be used to treat cancer now a lot more research is necessary and marijuana is not a panacea or a cure-all but the medical community is now beginning to recognize that cannabis may play an important role in taking care of patients for whom conventional therapies aren't working very well and that is something that most of the 20,000 patients I've seen over the last nine years can attest to I had really no idea where that phone call would lead me six years ago when Paige called but I can say from a great deal of experience that miracles are pretty commonplace among patients for whom nothing else has worked nothing but medical cannabis this is not about pot this is about patients now you may be wondering about Charlotte and what happened this is Charlotte about a year after she first started using medical cannabis what Charlotte is saying here is ballerina ballerina you can see her dancing [Applause] and she's still doing very very well now next time you or someone you love is suffering from pain that's not responding to conventional treatments or has another medical tradition that might benefit from the use of cannabis think about medical cannabis think about the thousands of patients who have benefited from it and think about Charlotte at ballerina it changed her life and it just might change yours thank you you", "mwz9Uu7w6iQ": "so this is the cheap caps your filling machine it's about ten dollars from Amazon or Ebay various other places now it's a springy bit it's got corner points now you'll see that the corner points has little dimples there and the things that stick up whatever they're called screws and that helps it fit together so that's the base plate this is to put the main half of the capsules these are triple sized capsules these holding total 1.37 mils we're actually going to end up with one mil of liquid inside now the thing you need to know is that you can't put in anything that's aqueous certainly water-based liquid because it would just dissolve the capsule these are cellulose capsules the slaves bit of water they just break down obviously you want that to happen in the stomach so you can only really use oil-based or oil pure oils with these things for our purposes here I'm going to be using Nigella sativa or black seed oil or black cumin oil now the syringe here is all covered in Vaseline take it out put some vaseline around that rub a bit and it makes its light so much easier otherwise there's a little bit of friction and then you end up slotting it everywhere so this is one of the bottles of black seed oil I'm actually going to be using two of these to fill 100 1.37 mils capsules which for reasons that will become apparent we'll end up with 1 mil each of the liquid so now we're going to do is and I draw up the oil into the syringe I'm gonna do this in a way that risks making bitterness it's the old nurses method which is you RAM that serine gene as hard as you can and then draw back if you don't quick enough the oil doesn't leak out so much around the neck of the bottle and you get it into the syringe I was going to get rid of the excess air there that's old habits die hard and I was gonna wipe the oil off my hands now all I'm gonna do is literally squirt the oil into the capsules now don't fill these right up to the top because that guide plate that helps fill it that raises an additional height of the capsule so essentially if you fill it all the way to the top there you're gonna get overspill so you want to have you just below the surface as you can see that I'm doing there if you don't spill it everywhere actually it doesn't matter that much it all depends on how expensive the oil is that you're filling with so an alternative method is like I'm about to show which is discard the syringe and just pour straight from the bottle it's much easier to do this when there's slightly less than 1/2 the bottle that's left in there when it's full you're more likely to have over spill and it all comes pouring out so I'm just topping up the various levels there where it's been there's not being quite filled so now this is just literally just fulfilled your capsules if you if it spills over don't worry so much we can deal with that later so we're gonna put this to one side now we're gonna put the caps or via the shorter end the long end holds one mil the short end point three seven mils and we're going to be putting the lids on there or the SHA in the capsule which will basically just contain air now there's a logistical problem here when we fill capsules with powder as they squeezed together the air can expel from the caps your plant and they come together quite nicely because we're using oil that provides a nice little seal so it's not all of the capsules are going to seal together correctly and later on as we go through this you're gonna see there's two that actually fall apart and the reason they're actually is because the long end they weren't all long ends two of them rush to the short end so now we put the guide plate in there use the groose that side ups a groove sign up that holds the capsules in place and enables us now to seal the capsules so that's the liquid we're now going to take the lids once once we remove that plate we're now going to lift up the lids flip them over and clip them in the you see the four holes in the corners they connect with the four screws and now by pushing down we in theory seal all our capsules although as you will see there'll be - they don't make it simply because I put the wrong ones in the holes but that that happens and that's pretty much all there is to it now these capsules are now very very oily on the outside because of the overspill has coated them so now what I've got to do is clean them up where its hemmed here is to see if I can rescue those two that didn't work I don't think I'll bother doing that again I'll just discard them it's much easier we've got a hundred there so now we're going to end up with ninety-eight capsules filled in the matter of minutes using this very cheap device that I got off of an online seller so now the next thing is just to clean up the oil on the outside of the capsules it doesn't really matter so much but black seed oil Nigella sativa is a pretty unpleasant flavor well to me anyway so I'm now quite keen to clean it up please notice the newspaper we're using here is a copy of The Times I would like to say I read it cover to cover but I don't read it and this was one of my wife's papers she doesn't know that I've used it is this morning's paper I think so she'll be looking for that later so now it's just a case of just check any ones that didn't quite seal up properly you don't normally have this problem with the when using dry powder it's just because the the the the seal thing is caused by the oil so now what I'm gonna do is just lift them all off it's clean away everything is all oily put down some clean newspaper and basically just clean up the capsules once they cleaned up I can then put them into a jar and these I will keep in the fridge and that's that it's the simplest process in the world it takes me minutes to do and can save you quite a lot of money now for those of you that want to buy black seed oil if you have any idea about the health effects of this or the suppose that health effects of this the cheapest place to buy this is the Indian wholesalers so the the cash-and-carry places that supply to the Indian communities they sell all the herbs and spices and curry sauce is all those kind of things you find an amazing selection of herbs and spices in there and black seed oil is normally behind the counter because it's a pricey item so go to the go to counter and just ask them for it and it comes in varying quantities I think about a hundred mils is anywhere between four and ten pound depending on what brand that you buy and that's it that is now 98 capsules because the two that we lost flaxseed oil each one containing three Bills of Nigella sativa oil okay do please subscribe I'm gonna be doing lots of more of these videos and yeah I'll see you in the next one", "ByLTxWtdAzs": "[Music] hey guys well it's still a little bit smoky in here from the video that I was just recording before this but I wanted to sit down and make a video about micro dosing I have seen quite a bit of influx of micro dosing products in the dispensaries here in Massachusetts so that has been quite exciting and I thought that well I have some I would share them with you as well as a homemade option first off micro dosing is basically just the form of a consumption of cannabis that is taking smaller amounts of whatever form of cannabis that you're consuming and you know consuming it maybe a little bit more often throughout the day if need be but just not not sitting around and facing a blunt or smoking bomb after bomb and then doing something micro dosing is really about just a little bit here and there it's really the best way that I can explain it and reasons to micro dose probably would be you know you don't want to get super duper high you're not really looking to be very high at one point and then kind of fade off micro dosing is great because you don't get that 2:30 feeling or whatever they call it in that energy drink commercial micro dosing is really great for keeping you kind of at a solid level of slightly medicated versus like that super duper up and then kind of crash down sort of action that you know other forms of consuming cannabis could be you know like if you sit around and have a dab sesh you might be super great for a while but then you're probably just gonna bring your so today I'm going to discuss some different forms of micro dosing from pen form hard candy Lawson jizz tinctures to little bitty baby gummy cubes so thank you guys so much for hanging with me and get ready let's do it it's happening we are talking about micro dosing my first form of micro dosing that I am going to talk about with you is going to be the pen and cartridge form of micro dosing and this is going to be my probably favorite and most used form of micro dosing what's great about the pen is that it is gonna be the quickest activated into your body I guess form of micro dosing that you can you're gonna feel the effects the quickest when using the pen and I guess it's the best way for me to explain that what's great about this pen is that it had a dosed out battery timer if that makes any sense I don't even know if that's like the proper terminology basically when I start pulling it from this cartridge the battery turns on and it starts heating up and for eight seconds it will allow me to pull and draw from the pen and then it shuts the battery off it stops heating and that is my dose what's great is it does have a little ring of lights on the bottom that will say solid and then it blinks when it is ready to turn the battery off so that I know that my dosing is coming to its end I usually will pull on this between 1 and 4 times pending on the settings situation how you know medicated I'm looking to get and I will probably you know come back to this every you know a couple of hours to have my little micro dosing stash so the clouds not like big and like you know like frothy or anything it's just a just a little vapor cloud which is really nice so it's not like super eye-catching you know if you're in public people are gonna be like she's smoking a weed pen it just looks like a normal little ecig I guess so that is a great first option and probably my favorite into micro dosing the second option that I'm going to talk about comes from Netta and that is going to be their 2 milligram dose cubes and what I love about the dose cubes is that they are obviously 2 milligrams apiece so it's a super super low dosage of an edible and there are 50 in a bottle which means that there is a hundred milligrams total in this bottle definitely not something that I would want to use as an option to get you know I wouldn't want to eat a hundred milligrams of this at one time just because I'm eating a whole entire bottle of gummies that's like it's like eating a whole bottle of Flintstone gummies like that's what I feel like I would be doing but they are a great great great alternative to you know going out and buying like a 50 milligram like taffy and then cutting it up into like ten different pieces or something which I feel like I hear a lot of people do so that's super awesome that it's kind of like they managed to figure that when I don't know and they are just cute little they're just cute little cubes you guys see that they smell like a gummy they taste like a gummy they have a little bit more of a like pink furry canvas taste then you know obviously like a regular gummy bear would but they by no means have like a disgusting taste which is really nice I feel like the 2 milligram Gummy's for me personally I'm not sure if they would have an effect on me just because my tolerance at this point is a little bit higher than you know two milligram micro dosing but I would like to take a tolerance break and see if I can get myself to be able to enjoy a two milligram dosage but you know again everyone's body is different that's why I'm sharing a few different dosage options of micro dosing options because two milligrams may be great for you but it's not for me whereas you know a 10 or 15 milligram micro dose may be wonderful for me but might just knock you on your ass or whatever to each their own everyone is different when it comes to the wide wide world of cannabis so the cubes that I have our indica but they do come in a hybrid and a sativa as well I believe they have a CBD or a one to one option the third option that I'm going to talk about is going to be the tincture that I made with my magical butter machine if you guys have not checked out my medicated smoothie video please definitely go on check that out because that is another option of micro dosing that I have talked about so basically a teaspoon of this is about 11 to 15 milligrams of THC this is Bruce Banner strain so it's going to be more of a kind of uplifting strain for some it might make them anxious so I I have this little dropper or like syringe thing here I did not I couldn't find an eye dropper so I found this handy-dandy little syringe in the kitchen drawer on the side of it kind of really worn out there is a little 1/2 teaspoon teaspoon one and a half and two teaspoon mark if you use 1/2 a teaspoon it's probably about you know 5 to 8 milligrams like I said the 1 teaspoon is about 11 to 15 milligrams of THC and this is just a great option to you know either I'd hear smoothie in the morning which is my personal favorite thing to do you could even like you literally could just put this in anything squirt it on top of your salad to go along with your dressing you could put it inside of a muffin in the morning you know like literally there are so many options of things that you can do with tincture that just make it so universal and so great so this is gonna be your third option for micro dosing and kind of just a different more diverse way to micro dose so you know you have to eat this as a gummy and you obviously have to smoke this in pen form but this tincture can be put under your tongue added to food added to drink you know like it can be put in something that you're gonna bake it can be added to something raw there's just unbelievable options with tincture which makes it such a great micro dosing option and the last thing that we are going to touch on as a micro dosing option I feel like I've been using the word option way too many times in this video but we got options anyways these are some hard candies that I picked up from at the dispensary out in Newton garden remedies and they are coconut flavored the dosage per hard candy is six milligrams they also had another option in the coconut flavor that was one Lawson's same size that was 60 milligrams 6-0 versus six so I wondered as I started now and on these because as you guys can tell I have dug into them I wondered if the 60 milligram one tasted nearly as delicious as the 6 milligram one but I have really enjoyed this as an edible micro dosing option the other day I was not able to medicate in the morning you know smoke my bomb or have a few dabs so I decided to crack into these Lawson jizz and the consistency of them is a lot comparable to you know those like maple sugar like maple leaf candies it's kind of like that but it's much more of a harder consistency but still that sort of melt in your mouth feel and they definitely have a great coconut flavor honestly like I hardly even knew that I was eating a cannabis edible which is like really great when it comes to cannabis edible products because as you guys know like nobody likes that like special brownie flavor that's just ah I don't want my I don't want what I'm eating to taste like burnt midis you know so way to go garden remedies on having like such a delicious hard candy as an option and what I like about this is you know it's it's a little bit longer lasting than just chewing on a gummy or throwing some texture underneath your tongue anyways I absolutely love these as an option there really is not not anything in these at all it's literally sugar tapioca sugar cannabis concentrate flavoring that may contain coloring and/or vegetable oils and it says it's just manufacturing at a facility that also processes nuts so that's amazing there is nothing but six point one six percent of THC in each one of these and there were eight in a package and I've already snapped on two of them out of here so I feel like this is something that you could have one in the morning I have one in the afternoon and have one in the evening or you know maybe just while you're sitting at your desk at work this is a great micro dosing option micro dosing is just a great option for I feel like the working man or the working woman just because it is a convenient and discreet and like not over-the-top option of medicating you know like it's not like you're going out to your car and ripping on a bowl on your lunch break you know you're just pulling it candy out of your pocket and sucking on it nobody else can have one because they're yours and only your's I could totally eat one right now but I'm not gonna yeah so basically those are your options for micro dosing that I have had in my cabinet and have access to here in Massachusetts there are other options in form of edibles you know like instead of doing the gummies or instead of doing the hard candies you could have gotten the gummy form of this or instead of doing the gummy to milligram version I'm sure there is a capsule version that is you know between 5 and 10 milligrams that would be just about the same but I would have to say that my favorite is gonna be the pen and then probably the lozenges and then the tincture ooh you know wait a second it might be the tincture and then the lozenges just because there are so many options of things that you can do with the tincture but man this pen thank you guys so much for joining me on this video about your micro dosing options that came from my cabinet just a little bit more of options for patients here in Massachusetts if you did not already know or you know just options that you can look for in a dispensary near you yeah thanks so much for joining along thank you for liking thank you for subscribing thank you for sharing with your friends turning those post notifications on you guys are the real MVP s I say it all the time but I just want you to know it you can find me on Instagram at Jenny wake-and-bake you can find me on Twitter at Jenny weak underscore Bank I now I'm present on you now and occasionally I do simultaneously broadcast here on YouTube with you guys so always be a look on alum block always be on the lookout for that notification in your little phone feed and thank you guys thank you thank you thank you thank you for hanging out with me here and talking about micro dosing I will maybe be in the same place might be in the red chair might be a nature next time you it probably won't be the same time because I'm working on consistency but haven't really figured it out yet", "OzRbCDRw4eY": "[Music] hi this is nutrition Sushma's as well I have a rich experience in the field of nutrition for 33 years including 25 years abroad and in UN and whu-oh as well right now I'm practicing in Bangalore at Swati nutrition our body naturally detoxifies but system could be little slow the most common way of detoxifying bodies by taking more fluids body detoxified still by throwing the waste out of the body like in the form of urine and sweating since THC is fat soluble so we have to avoid eating of fast food junk food and oily food in order to get it into the tissues and cells of the body foods rich in antioxidants would help antioxidants are like Omega vitamin A C and E and those supplementation also could help otherwise taking more colorful fruits and vegetables like a food bowl containing five fruits at least and eating more vegetable salads they help in detoxifying especially taking greens fruit and vegetable juices will work as a detoxifying drink like teenage and beetroot juice or avocado or green apple and any anything which you wish which is green in nature it will help you to detoxify faster another you are naturally detoxifying nutrient could be fiber to throw out the THC from a system through stools fiber rich foods could be legumes grains sprouts etc so eat them more and another flushing nutrient is niacin group of B vitamins and you have to eat nice and rich force like tuna or potato avocado etc foods reaching electrolytes like potassium magnesium vitamin C also could be helpful such as sytrus foods or lemon juice tomatoes being leafy vegetable juice and some other fruits also would be helpful because they are rich in electrolytes aloe vera juice or vinegar vinegar if sometimes added in the diet you know that also could be beneficial and cranberry juice oh yeah they they also are found to be beneficial detox can be fastened if you have enough fluids in your system water is the best beverage that naturally transports and eliminates all the waste from the body through urination and sweating some of the drinks other than water could be like coconut water or any fruit juices without adding extra sugar could be beneficial and make sure that you are drinking it eight glasses of water which is recommended or maybe some extra water to cleanse your system as soon as possible then exercise and sweating also plays a good role in detoxifying the body excessive sweating detoxify his body in a natural way so you have to get more sweating like you can be indulge in those exercises which which make you sweat a lot like walk I mean this walking or running jogging etcetera if you cannot do the exercise like you cannot run our job then taking Sun bath would be another alternative sauna which is indoors like if you don't have Sun then you can relax in sauna and you can sweat a lot so that is also natural way of detoxifying the body rest also has a very good effects on detoxifying the body naturally and make sure that you are getting enough rest for eight eight hours sleep at least sound sleep so for sound sleep you you can have either milk in the evening just before going to bed you know 15 minutes before going to bed because milk has a tryptophan the natural I mean amino acid which induces sleep or if you are not drinking milk or I mean then you are then you can take also chamomile tea just 10 minutes before going to bed so that will end you sleep so you can follow all these tips however prevention is better than cure so if you stay away from margiana would be the best best thing to practice [Music]", "ppKvv2668OI": "[Music] when I was doing a bite here and today we're going to make some high-quality MCT oil using some canvas so there is a couple of steps to this and we do need a couple of different things so everything that we are going to be I have right here in front of us so we're going to need a crock pot for using this method of the making our empty tio which is a batch to the have right here this is some very potent stuff I found this out last night you're supposed to start low and go slow I definitely suggest doing that so when you're going to need for this is some MCT oil that you could pick up if you're in Canada at GNC health has some pretty cheap or if you go to probably any local health food store they're probably gonna have this stuff you're going to need some cannabis depending on how much you want the rear there are calculators out there and I will put a link for a calculator to kind of give you a rough estimate of how potent your your things are going to be like let's if you want to make gummies or stuff like that so I'm gonna put the calculator below and it'll basically just help you decide what you're going to do now when I made this little here I used 38 grams of cannabis as well as I don't know probably like three four grams of Keef and just the mixture of other candidates that I had around so it was pretty potent stuff so if you're going to use okay so to start we need to talk about D carving your cannabis or decarboxylation it's basically turning your THC a into THC which is what you are really looking to do if you're going to ingest cannabis now if you don't decarboxylate it really won't do much for you so what we're going to do so I guess what I should say is you have a couple of different methods of being able to decrypt leave so you can use the crockpot method because on high they usually heat up to around 220 degrees you put it in a calendar and you just put it there thank you news [Music] okay so there are a couple of different ways that you can be box decarboxylate your cannabis so you could either put it into a canning jar you can put it onto a cookie sheet or something like that or something like this here silicone cookie sheet and you can put this in your oven for about an hour at 225 degrees and that will decarboxylate your canvas this is the method that I chose to do this because when you do it inside of a canning jar with the lid closed you were actually keeping in the terpenes now if you were to just decarboxylate on a cookie sheet throw down a silicone on top of that that put your cannabis right on it you are actually going to lose your turkeys you're going to strip them out of your oil and that's something that I did not want to do so the canning jar method for this instance is a pretty good way of doing that because if you're doing your infusion in the same jar that you decarboxylated it you're going to keep all of your terpenes inside your jar which is great so let's start the process so in the oven 220 degrees for an hour what you're going to do is want to take this out every 15 minutes set an alarm and you're gonna want to turn your jar just kind of shake it up make sure that it's kind of everywhere mixed up and every half hour you're gonna want to burp the jar so you're only gonna burp it once burp it in the first half hour period then you take your cannabis out of the oven you are pretty much good to go so I have some footage that I use the making this oil here and this here is a pretty potent oil I had some last night and I can honestly tell you that you should probably really start slow and go from there don't don't overdo it I made some gummies and just like licking the spoons and the bowls I think I got my fill so yeah make some pretty potent oil and that's we're planning on doing here today it's you know so let's get started and we'll go from here [Music] so the reason why I'm wishing it up like this is because I have 473 milliliters of MCT oil and I know that that won't be a full jar up to here so we're just gonna squish it down [Music] all right that one's mixed up you see this mixed up pretty good here let's get this in the MCT oil and we're gonna get into the slow cooker [Music] [Applause] [Music] so the reason one of the reasons why we did it into the canning jar meant that was so that we were able to keep the terpene profile over animus now if you were to just decarboxylate on a tray we wouldn't got the same abilities out of it so we would have lost all of our terpenes [Music] this here looks like it's just to say covering at all and we got maybe like a couple teaspoons left in the bottle [Music] so perfect [Music] [Music] all righty guys so we dropped her in there and now you just gotta let her do or think what we're gonna do is just I guess probably keep filling this crock pot back up with water as imagine it's gonna get pretty hot and we're gonna lose some of its kind of the steam out so we'll just have to keep an eye on so we'll come back and check them in this problem you tomorrow all right guys so it's been about 12 hours now we put it in a little midnight last night it's just a little bit past noon here and 66 degrees Celsius one hundred and forty nine point seven it's temperature that it's been going at on high and if we take a look at her oil when first put it in it was clear oil now we can see it's a nice dark green delicious looking oil let's see if we can maybe get under light here a little bit sassy we'll get you a better shot your moment with flashlights alright alright guys so I've got my measuring cup I've got the strainer that sits in it I've got my cheesecloth what I'm gonna do is take this out of here this is actually pretty freakin hot play with and we're just gonna let it cool off for a little bit and while that's cooling off let me get some cheese bot open [Music] get a couple little laters wrapped around here don't really wanna be able to see through it but I would like to filter out most of those kind of fine once particles so I've got me one of these Curie filters and that's really gonna get all the very fine fine fine stuff out of it so that's what I'm gonna use for the very fine stuff so for now we're just going to pour it here into the cheesecloth get out most of the large particulates and then we're going to do the finds with this year we should have some awesome future oil and then with this taintdroid we can do lots of things with make some gummies well I don't really know lots of things but other than just that using this nature but I really want to make some gummies and that's what I was thinking about doing so if you guys are interested in that let us know and we will make a video for you on how to make gummies you can probably start to see this I'm not sure if you can see some camera not butter there's a nice green oil nice green danger I think what I've done here is underestimated the amount yes I have underestimated the amount the cheesecloth I would need to strain this out [Music] [Music] oh yeah there's quite a bit in this cannabis though [Music] you've got a clip holding this and now we're going to just do we're fine strain into our jar that we're going to store it in a little bit better review here my messy cupboard cannabis all over it alright [Music] all right so I've got a lid wash to clean ready here what I'm going to do is I'm going to stick a notice I got some MCT oil it was made November 5th 2019 and we're just gonna stick that on here now I'm gonna grab a flashlight so we can kind of see this here so we can see here it is a greenish oil we put it in it was Coulier clear clear and now it's a nice green so what you're gonna want to do the store this oil is it want to put it in a nice cool dark place some people recommend putting it in the fridge and that's one of the benefits of the MTT oil if you put it into the fridge it will not solidify like it does if you were to use coconut oil and I believe that also preserves a little bit longer as well so there's definitely some benefits of using the MTT oil so here you have it guys I hope this video was easy enough for everyone this stuff here tastes really good this tastes a lot better than the textures that I was buying from the licensed producers and with 38 grams plus a couple of grams of Keef this [ __ ] it should be pretty good well so we're gonna try some out and yeah we'll go from there [Music]", "UbVHUWSwoFY": "water opioid use here in the u.s. is the highest it's ever been in fact a recent study finds that Phoenix ranks in the top 10 for opioid distribution and a lot of people are now turning to maybe natural remedies to get some help including medicinal cannabis Ryan is at blue door therapeutics in Scottsdale to explain how this is working for some good morning yeah hey guys good morning a great team here at blue door therapeutics and we're talking about opioid addictions folks who have been taking pills for a very long time and need help getting off of them because they are so addictive I want to talk to my friend dr. Gina she's the CEO here at blue door we were talking about acupuncture in the last hour and how that's helping people who are addicted to opioids let's talk about cannabis this time around it's something that you do use here pretty regularly we do we found cannabis has been really effective for patients who are trying to get through acute and chronic withdrawal when they're stopping opioid use and how does it help I mean specifically and I know it's different from patient to patient but how is it helping them well THC that's found in the cannabis plant is an effective opioid substitute without using the opioid receptor and so it's kind of a frontage road to the opioid freeway if you will helping with replacing the neurotransmitters so that patients don't go through the withdrawal or the sickness that they get when they stop using opioids the anxiety feeling like their bodies turning inside out nausea vomiting insomnia etc it helps with those symptoms to get patients through acute withdrawal and then another component of the plant called CBD or cannabidiol helps with a chronic withdrawal and those are cravings or helping patients feel more even-keeled its anti-anxiety it's muscle relaxant helps people sleep so we use the different components of the plants during different times of the process to really help the patient get through the whole thing and a lot of people they think about cannabis to think about smoking a plant they think about a pipe or a bong or some sort of glass to inhale but what you're working with here is not smoke at all I mean these are these are in pill form extracts essentially tell me what we're looking at yeah patients don't need to think that they need dreadlocks and tie-dye shirt and listen to reggae to use cannabis cannabis has really evolved in terms of the concentrates that are being able that are being made right now Marketing I'll give you a few examples this is a spray it's a minty spray it doesn't taste or smell like cannabis it's very discreet and every every single pump of that sprays six point six milligrams we know what the dose is interesting we know what the patient's taking and so we can really help them change their regimen if they need to in order to get through the process they quickly show me the rest of these real quick suppositories great for thoracic pain Listerine type breath mints that dissolve in the mouth are strips that dissolve in the mouth capsules so there are a lot of ways to use cannabis without putting flame to a plan which doctors will tell you they don't want you necessarily smoking anything but there's an extract here Jeana thank you so much we appreciate it and thank you or wonderful acupuncturist I here at blue door some great ways to go about this I mean this is such a big problem in our country now we need to start addressing how to fix the problem these are just a couple of the ways that they're using here a blue door it helps that's for sure thanks Brian", "v-3NEe1QCtE": "[Music] ratios with CBD and THC our hot topic right now combining these cannabinoids in conjunction in different ratios can definitely kind of fine-tune the experience and fine tune the benefits that the consumer feels in in the infancy of CBD research and even marijuana research as a whole I really kind of stick to three different ratios which is gonna be a one to zero ratio THC the CBD very little CBD very high THC which is generally gonna be for your recreational consume where for someone looking for psychoactive relief and then you've got a one to one ratio which is the best of both worlds it's almost like a hybrid you're gonna get the physical symptom reliefs from the CBD you're gonna get some you know cerebral or mental symptom reliefs from from the THC and then the last one that I would say is popular is going to be a 0 to 1 ratio of THC the CBD which is gonna be as low THC as possible and as high CBD as possible this is often found in hemp however there are how cannabis strains coming up with very low THC very high CBD sometimes it'll be called like a 1 to 10 or a 1 to 20 but for all intents and purposes I'd say you've got you know three points in the spectrum of high THC no CBD one to one balanced and then no THC high CBD you know your high THC obviously psychoactive your one to one are gonna be kind of the best of both worlds and then your your high CBD low THC is gonna be preferred by those people that don't want to get high those people that have to you know function on a higher level or don't want to have any sort of inhibition mentally while they're going about their day but they also need some relief from whatever symptoms they they have whether it be mathematically or if they just want to take the edge off you know or if they just want to like you know deal with stress better or just be a little bit more loose you know so little no seam here THC is gonna be very low psychoactivity high th easily very high cycle activity and you know I read one somewhere I don't know if it has any merit but that you know sativas are generally defined by having a high THC and a low CBD ratio and indicas will generally have a little bit more of that CBD as well as a high THC so in my experience as you kind of raise the CBD you're getting less of that racy cerebral effect or any more of that relaxed body effect and eventually as you kind of phase out the THC you can almost diminish the psychoactive effects completely I think that the future of marijuana is going to be extracting THC extracting CBD extracting CVC extracting cbn extracting THC B and then combining them all into a product that has very specific ratios for specific symptoms or for specific desired effects it doesn't necessarily have to be medical doesn't have to be a symptom or an ailment it can just be someone that wants to feel a certain way it wants to feel more intimate wants to feel more uninhibited wants to feel relaxed or stress relief so as we better define these other cannabinoids and we find processes to isolate them and then recombine them in specific ratios I think that's where you're really gonna get this prescriptive effect of marijuana where it's less subjective and more objective [Music]", "oeF6rFN9org": "For centuries, humans have been using substances\nto alter their state of mind. From caffeine, cigarettes and alcohol, \nto more extreme drugs. But as the most commonly used illicit drug in North America, where does marijana fit in? And how exactly does it\neffect your brain? First, we need to understand how the brain functions. Your neurons are the cells that process information in the brain. By releasing chemicals called \"neuro-transmitters\"\nfrom the axon of one neuron to the dendrite of another. They change the electrical charge of the receiving neuron, \nconsequently exciting or inhibiting it. If excited, the signal is passed on. Though it sounds simple, these signals work together and the effect is\nquickly compounded into complex configurations within milliseconds, flushing over the entire brain. This is what happens every single time you think, breath,\nor move. So what is going on in your brain when you \nare smoking marijuana? Well, unlike alcohol which contains molecules nothing like those in our body.\nCannibis contains molecules that resemble those produced in our very own brains. Cannabinoids, though naturally these cannabinoids circulate in much lower quantities\ncompared to the large influx imposed by smoking. Specifically the chemical Tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, resembles a\nnatural transmitter called Anandamide. These cannabinoids are specialized neurotransmitters\nreleased by neurons having just fired. Neurons temporarily becomes unresponsive after firing, to prevent them\nfrom overreacting or being to dominant. This allows your brain to function in a calm and controlled manner. But cannabinoids interrupt this approach\nin some parts of the brain. Instead, they remove the refractory period of neurons,\nthat are already active and cause your thoughts, imagination and perception to \nutterly magnify itself. This means once you begin your train of thought,\nit becomes the most significant and profound thing ever. You can't see the big picture or even recall your last epiphany,\nbecause you are caught up in the momentum of a particular idea, and your neurons keep firing. Until a new idea takes hold, and you go off on a new tangent. These cannabinoids also effect the levels of dopamine \nand norephinephrine in your brain. Often leading to a sense of euophoria, relaxation,\npain modulation and general enhancement of an experience, \nthough sometimes causing anxiety. Furthermore, there are cannabinoid receptors in areas controlling short term memory, learning, coordination,\nmovement control and higher cognitive functions.

The first is to mask any metabolites in the urine. This can be\ndone successfully on the day of the test. The second way is to clean any marijuana\nmetabolites from the system completely. But this process will take at least\nseven days. Either way works well and we're going to tell you about methods\nfor both of them. How to pass a drug test the same day. To start with you need to\nunderstand how drug testing works. Put simply drug tests work by detecting THC\nmetabolites in the urine.  The standard cutoff level of a drug test is\n50 nanograms per milliliter this means that if the concentration of the\nmetabolites is below the cutoff level the test won't detect it. So what you need\nto do is to lower the concentration of metabolites below the cutoff level. But\nyou'll also need to keep the urine specific gravity and creatinine levels\nin the normal range. If they're out of the normal range then your urine sample\nwill be rejected as diluted. Method 1: dilution and aspirin. For this method\nyou'll need: electrolyte powder - this helps keep the specific gravity of the\nurine within the normal range, creatine ethyl ester supplement - this helps to\nkeep the creatinine levels within the normal range, vitamin b2 or b12\nsupplement - this gives urine its natural color,\naspirin. Research shows that taking aspirin before a drug test\ncan produce a false negative. The instructions for this method. Take two\naspirin tablets around four to six hours before the test. Three hours before the\ntest take the following two things: 10 grams of creatine ethyl ester supplement\nand 200 milligrams of vitamin B2. Then drink one liter of electrolyte\nsolution every hour for three hours before the test. Finally, take a home\nurine test before you go to the test center. Method 2. Fast Marijuana Detox\nKit. This is safe and perfectly legal same-day solution to pass a drug test.\nIt's a complex mixture that combines diuretic with the correct amount of\nchemicals and compounds to make your urine look natural. It's not detectable\nby labs and actually comes with a money-back guarantee. The Fast Detox Kit\nstarts working in 90 minutes and stays effective for up to 5 hours.\nIt already has a lot of positive reviews. To get this kit just follow the link in\nthe description. Now let's look at how to get weed out of\nyour system permanently. Firstly what you need to\nknow is that THC is highly fat-soluble. That means that it gets trapped in the\nfat cells of the body. From the fat cells THC is then released into the blood. From\nthe blood part of the THC travels to the kidneys and urine and another part\nreturn to the fat cells. Natural detoxification involves getting rid of\nany THC stored in the fat reserves. This can take from a few weeks to several\nmonths. The length of time it takes depends on a few factors: 1. The\nperson's body fat percentage 2. The amount of weed consumed and 3.\nThe time of usage. People with a fast metabolism, low body mass index or\noccasional smokers will be able to get rid of the THC from their body\nfaster. So permanent marijuana detox is more or\nless a fat loss program. Additionally you'll still need to follow a proper\ndiet and exercise regularly. Method 1. Drink at least 2 liters of water a day.\nWater helps to accelerate the removal of metabolites from your system. Maintain\ncalorie intake. The average woman needs 1,500 calories a\nday to lose 1 pound of weight per week. The average man needs to eat 2,000\ncalories a day to lose 1 pound of weight per week. Eat leafy greens and salad.\nSubstituting high-calorie ingredients with fruits and vegetables adds volume\nto your dishes without adding calories. Adding lemon juice to warm water\nincreases weight loss by promoting digestion and boosting the rate of\nmetabolism. Say no to junk food and red meat. Junk food is always packed with\nunnecessary calories. Eat healthy fiber it acts as a natural suppressant by\nreducing your appetite. Exercise regularly - this forces your body to use\nup calories and burn more fat. But with this method avoid exercising for 2 days\nbefore the test. Take 10 grams of activated charcoal 3 times a day. This\nwill help to remove metabolites from your body.\nMethod 2. Use Premium 7 Day Detox Kit. This kit will help you be clean forever in\njust 7 days. It cleanses all urine blood and saliva\nfrom any traces of weed. It's legal,safe and not detectable by the labs. The kit\nincludes a seven-day lifestyle management plan by a team of\nnutritionists to improve health and wellness. It includes an exclusive\njumpstart that can be used as a one hour emergency flush.\nTo get this kit just follow the link in the description.\nSo to round everything up if you're looking to pass a drugs test and you\nwant something that's proven to work look into the above products. For a\nsame-day solution use the Fast Detox Kit. To remove drug traces over a seven-day\nperiod use Premium 7-day Detox kit.", "zgDzHt_DpUI": "[Music] the Palumbo here with another rx muscle supplement review today's topic is going to be cannabinoid oils and kratom two compounds that are kind of like weird esoteric type things I think a lot of people are really not that familiar with so I figured I would go over them a little bit and see what the applications possibly are in bodybuilding and fitness of course now CBD oil seems to be the new craze now CBD comes from the hemp plant as we all know from the hemp plant we also get you know marijuana you know and in marijuana we have what we call CBDs or cannabinoid oils but we also have you know the THC which is the hallucinogenic aspect of marijuana which makes it appealing for a lot of people to smoke it or vape it or whatever they don't eat eat it whatever they're doing it with these days but the cannabinoids actually have medicinal properties in the sense that they create relaxation in the body they seem to be natural pain killers they help anxiety and a lot of people you know have been using these the great thing is that they now can isolate the cannabinoid oil from the THC so that you can produce a nutritional product that's free of any kind of you know drug like effects I guess you can say in the sense that you're not gonna crash your car you know using them or or be impaired now you know I I've tried several different companies have sent me different types of cannabinoid oils from the pills to a sublingual drop or a head under my tongue which did which worked but didn't really taste so great the pills worked okay Gabe Owens got a new cannabinoid product with it with a branched chain amino acid electrolyte solution with the cannabinoid powder in there and I felt that that was pretty good and but the one I felt the most was the vape pen they had these little vape pens you can vape the stuff what I felt was a relaxation it wasn't anything significant it didn't feel like I took a xanax or it didn't feel like I you know pop the pain pill or anything like that I just kind of felt like kind of at ease type of thing it's kind of esoteric but you know what I think it's really it's one of supplements cannabinoids that work better with people who were in chronic pain or discomfort so in other words it you know I don't have pain or discomfort you know my life's abruzzi all four roses no seriously I'm not living in chronic pain I would like to see you know someone who lives in some kind of disruptive pain those are the people who seem to be reporting the best results from it and I think that's really where the application is so if you have nerve pain if you have something that's you know aching you all the time headaches maybe cannabinoid oil has probably got some good applications do I think it will negatively impact bodybuilding as far as building muscle and burning fat you know so I don't think I don't think you have to worry necessarily that you're not gonna burn enough fat now if it makes you lazy you know go to the gym you know train hard yeah that's not good but I don't think the cannabinoid receptors will do anything you know as far as you know inhibiting fat loss or preventing you from putting muscle which is a good thing because as we know the non-steroidal anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen reduce the inflammatory response to the body and that's that's not good for muscle building we want that in acute initial inflammatory response and the muscles that we train and break down so that the body knows has a signal there to help repair itself the cannabinoids don't seem to affect that inflammatory response which is good and I think that that makes it something that body bells can indeed use now when we talk about kratom okay which the chemical name and that is might rajah mean that's something is too interesting the government wanted to actually be at DEA wanted to make it a controlled one substance which would put it up there with like heroin you know and cocaine that was next it never went through they kind of stopped that bill from being passed because they said you know what we have to kind of let's let's explore this a little more before we need your put this on the controlled one substance list you know the need the knee-jerk responses the the drug companies don't want anyone releasing anything natural that could possibly compete with their opioids if they sell you know their oxycontin and oxycodone and and all the other you know percocet and Percodan they they don't want to lose any of that business so they probably put a lot of pressure on the congressmen to get this thing passed when the other side the science community side said hey you but take a look at this isn't naturally occurring substances they don't really have addictive qualities to them there you know they say that when you take kratom on a regular basis and you stop it you might get a no sniffle that's about the extent of the of the withdrawal so that to me tells me it's not addictive not severely addictive at least maybe the feeling is addictive it might be mentally addictive it's not certainly not physically addictive also one of the things that makes it you know very safe to use and as you know a lot of people wondering how that works well the cannabinoid oils we talked about bind to cannabinoid receptors this kratom actually binds to the opioid receptor so it gives pain relief it gives anxiety relief but it doesn't seem to suppress respiration which is one of the problems with the opioids if you take too much of it you know people die of heroin over those little times if you take too much you stop breathing basically this I guess kratom supplement doesn't cause the suppression of respiration it also doesn't cause the constipation that a lot of the opioids do that's another side effect that people really hate you know you take if you're on chronic opioids on a regular basis cuz you're in chronic pain whether me from back or whatever you know you can't go to the bathroom it's a terrible terrible side effect on it even if you use my five I think you're gonna have a trouble going to the bathroom so this is that this is makes kratom you know a really interesting you know possible substitution for people this is a lot you know pain addiction in this society today even in the bodybuilding world I see if there's a lot of guys addicted to painkillers and whether they're taking it because they're in pain or they're taking it because they're an emotional pain that you know that doesn't matter but the problem is when they want to stop it they can't get off it because there's physically addicted to it so severely so here's a great alternative that is naturally available and that the people not gonna have to pay hundreds and thousands of dollars a year for like they do it you know go into pain clinics and go into their doctors and pain to these oxycontin prescriptions so once again we'll create a negatively impact bodybuilding I think it might more so than the CBD oils do once again you know theoretically if you if you're over stimulating they can add the opioid receptors in the brain sometimes there's an elevation in certain like hormones that could be an elevation an estrogen a little bit sometimes there's some fluid retention and there is some constipation sometimes associated with it doesn't seem to be the case with kratom but we don't know I don't think people have been using it long enough people have been asking me their right dosage I don't really know I haven't tried it yet so nothing I need to try but I'm just saying I don't think it's been around to quantify it and that's another thing we don't really know how pure the the samples of what people are buying are is it a pure form is it cut with other stuff is it are there different you know I guess you could say percentages of product that people can get extracts that are more potent than others these are things that we still have to explore but if you are in chronic pain I'd much rather see you try kratom okay then then not or then use a percocet on a regular basis because that's going to lead down the wrong path and that's not good for bodybuilding we know that already you know also a lot of these you know like opioids like the percocet and the I guess you could save the vicodins they kill your appetite and if you can't eat on bodybuilding terms you're not going to put muscle on so it I think it's an exciting new year I think I like to see natural substances replacing drugs I think the CBD I guess you could say segments is something that that has a lot of potential there whether the government will ban it or not is is still up in the air I haven't produced a supplement with cannabinoid for my species nutrition line because I don't know where the the future that it really lies at this point I'd hate to make a product and then have them pulled off the shelf so there are supplements out there you can try it if you if you're looking for it you can just google it online believe me like I said I know Gabe has a game owned as a really good product he sent to me that I try I think it's called CBD black and it's amino acids electrolytes and CBD powder once again you can try to get these vape pens with the CBD in it and they do work to a certain degree so if you are a personality of suffering in chronic pain you might want to give it a shot I know there's a lot of body bowls with back pain out there maybe even Ronnie Coleman wants to give it a shot obviously he's been suffering tremendously in it with a lot of pain if I were him I would try to create a man to see me together maybe either with a super vape pen of this stuff but anyway I hope you guys learned a little bit about two substances that are kind of you know in the in the shadows right now but are looking to come out of the shadows I like to educate you guys keep you up-to-date for now I'm Dave Palumbo with another rx Muscle supplement review", "Zx3gDgyXgEw": "if you are in the court system and the crime charge involves alcohol or drugs it is probable that you will encounter an alcohol or drug screen at some point in time if you are preparing for an alcohol drug evaluation or have been ordered to provide ua samples for probation you need to test clean removing evidence of marijuana use may also be important if you are required to provide a drug screen for employment purposes if you are concerned over recent use of marijuana you may be wondering what you can do if anything to hasten the removal of carboxy thc proof of marijuana use from your system and this is today's one minute monday topic welcome my name is david jolly testing clean for probation or from an alcohol drug evaluation is one of the main keys in managing a successful criminal case if you have recently used marijuana you may be concerned about detection and interested in removing evidence of use quickly one practice commonly used is a marijuana cleanse or detoxification searching the internet will reveal many products that proclaim to quickly clear the body of carboxy thc another product proclaimed to work well is the use of bentonite clay bentonite clay is made from volcanic ash and is purported to absorb toxicants chemicals and other impurities from the body other recommendations from various scribes include having a healthy diet avoiding bad food avoiding red meat and eating vegetables and food with high fiber increasing your level of exercise but don't exercise heavily for at least a day prior to the test drink tea and lemon juice and drink more water than normal but not too much the day of testing take zinc supplements drink cranberry juice and use a sauna to sweat out the carboxy thc stored in the body there is some evidence that some of these methods may work some of the time however the only tried and true method of avoiding detection is by not using marijuana and time for more legal videos on marijuana use abuse and even videos that are a little obtuse please subscribe to this channel or read our blog you", "HMcaV3V8Z1U": "warning the views expressed in this video are not necessarily the views or opinions of the sponsors i am not a doctor or a lawyer always consult experts when making medical decisions i am a legal licensed medical marijuana patient in my state this is an educational video intended for viewers that are 18 or older in today's video we are going to be talking about delta 8 thc specifically hemp derived delta 8 thc is it really legal does it really get you medicated what's the difference between delta 8 and delta 9. i'm going to tell you everything i think that you should know about delta 8 in this video stay tuned [Music] good morning everybody my name is nate and this is nate on cannabis and today we are talking about delta eight i am sure by now you have heard of delta eight over the last six months or so i've seen it everywhere all over the internet and to be honest i've been extremely skeptical i have a lot of history with hemp products and while i do love full spectrum cbd oils and full spectrum hemp products there is a lot of snake oil salesmen out there when it comes to cbd not all cbd and hint products are created equal and even the really good hemp products that i found and there are quite a few while some do a very good job of relaxing you and relieving stress and anxiety none of them get you stoned none of them get you any kind of inebriation there is no intoxicating effect with any hemp product that i've ever tried that is until now i finally broke down and tried some delta eight thc hemp derived delta a thc and my experience was very surprising as a matter of fact the first time i tried these so these are 25 milligrams a piece right i was so skeptical about getting stoned off of a hemp product that i took three of them my normal dose from delta 9 thc is about 20 milligrams that is personally where i like to be i took 75 milligrams of delta 8 and boy howdy there is not a whole lot of difference between these gummies and the gummies that you would get at a dispensary there's a few differences and we're going to talk about it but before we get into the video i have to show a little bit of sponsor love this video is brought to you by elevate holistics elevate holistics is a telehealth clinic offering medical marijuana recommendations right here in missouri and if you need your medical marijuana card and click the link in the description you can get your medical marijuana card for just 75 now that is an affiliate link but i do not get paid if you click that link and sign up elevate holistics is a sponsor on the channel already i already got their money but if you use that link in the description it will save you fifty dollars off the normal 125 card which means you can get it for 75 dollars and saves you a little bit of money so shout out to elevate holistics link in the description all right back to delta eight so so i was talking to the manager of cassfield dispensary a while back charlie who is quickly becoming one of my favorite people now she knows that i suffer from an anxiety disorder and because of that i'm a big fan of edibles gummies they are longer lasting i don't have to medicate every 30 to 45 minutes to keep my anxiety in check i can take one dose now and go off to the depths of walmart which if you have an anxiety disorder going to walmart is insane if you don't have an anxiety disorder going to walmart is probably almost equally as insane so i'm a huge fan of gummies but she has suggested that i try delta eight because gummies are kind of expensive and i'm not always a big fan of being so medicated that you can't function sometimes that's fun i enjoy it occasionally but most of the time i need to find some kind of relief to keep my anxiety and my panic in check so that i can go out into the world and function as a normal human being so i got some of these delta eight gummies from native hemp and then shortly after i got these i was sent some delta eight gummies from top shelf hemp now this has been about two weeks and i've had a chance to really dive into them so what is delta eight thc well it is not much different than delta nine thc which you should already be accustomed to if you consume cannabis or are a medical marijuana patient here in missouri delta 9 tetrahydrocannabinol is the molecular compound that gives us the intoxicating effect when we consume cannabis right so when we smoke or vape it it gives us that intoxicating effect when we eat it in an edible or consume it our liver turns that delta 9 tetrahydrocannabinol into 11 hydroxy tetrahydrocannabinol which is a complete different compound of itself which gives us a more inebriating effect it lasts longer when you take inedible it's a little bit stronger it doesn't take as much to get you where you need to be so there are already different types of thc that you should be aware of delta 8 is another one now delta 8 is naturally occurring it naturally occurs in cannabis and it is derived from hemp hemp is just a legal definition for marijuana that has less than 0.3 thc in it so all of the delta 8 on the shelves that are being sold in stores is hemp derived it comes from plants with low delta 9 thc and actually low delta 8 thc delta 8 doesn't really grow in abundance in any plant whether it be hemp or marijuana they actually extract it by isolating and extracting cbd and once that cbd is isolated they use a process that includes acids they actually convert that cannabidiol into delta a thc so it comes out cbd then they turn it into delta eight thc and then put it back into products so they cook it into edibles or they put it into a mixture and spray it onto hemp flour or turn it into a distill it into a concentrate like delta eight dabs or delta eight vape carts and because they derive it from actual hemp legally grown him and because delta 8 is not delta 9 it's being sold all across the country but how legal is it actually is it going to stay legal what if you want to sell delta 8 gummies should you be concerned if you possess delta 8 gummies and you're not a medical marijuana patient should you be concerned well to give you a little bit more information on the legality of delta 8 here is matt gunther with the american cannabinoid association congress is the law making body with constitutional authority to write laws and pass bills so the 2018 farm bill which was crafted by congress and signed into law by the president clearly establishes legislative intent that specifically protects hemp as currently defined now this protects the plant cannabis sativa l and any part of the plant including the seeds derivatives extracts cannabinoids isomers acids salts salts of isomers whether growing or not as long as it's below 0.3 delta 9 thc on a dry weight basis this is important because regulatory agencies do not have the constitutional authority necessary to change this law until congress passes an amendment or updates the language of the farm bill in 2022 this federal definition of hemp that protects delta hthc and other emerging cannabinoids remains the law of the land secondly the language of the interim final rule doesn't target delta 8 thc instead it references synthetically derived tetrahydrocannabinols now while delta hthc is structurally considered a tetrahydrocannabinol the language of the farm bill specifies that its congressional protections supersede the classifications found in the controlled substance act furthermore delta eight thc isn't usually synthetically derived now while it can be chemically synthesized from non-hemp derived precursors it is generally derived from hemp via the isolation of cbd again not only is delta 8 naturally occurring in the plant it is also derived from the hemp plant both of these characteristics make the compound federally compliant under the 2018 farm bill you can expect delta 8 products to remain legal till at least 2022. now will the federal government change the farm act that remains to be seen that's if we don't see federal legalization of marijuana between now and then which is still kind of what about urine tests what if you work a job where you're kind of afraid to become a medical marijuana patient because you don't want to fail a urine test or maybe you're on probation and parole and you think well i'm going to take some of these delta 8 hemp gummies that way i don't fail on that urine test when my po pops me are you gonna drop hot the answer is yes you are probably going to drop hot you are going to fail your analysis test if you are taking these gummies because even though its delta hthc going in once your body metabolizes that delta eight once your body metabolizes thc in general it all comes out the same most panel tests are testing for thc metabolites so delta 8 delta 9 doesn't matter what's going in it's all coming out the same so if this is something you're using to get by on that account you might want to rethink your strategy people say that it is the same high without the paranoia or anxiety that some people get from taking edibles or overdoing it when they take edibles it does seem to be a less intense experience so if you are a new patient that wants to try edibles maybe you have a medical marijuana card but you haven't tried any of the brands that are out there yet because you've heard the horror stories of people calling 9-1-1 because they thought they were going to die in some cases they thought they already were dead no charges have been filed against a police officer who admits to confiscating marijuana from suspects and then baking it in brownies and once he and his wife were full and high they thought they'd overdosed and called 9-1-1 i think i'm having an overdose of this still as my wife overdose of what marijuana i don't know if they had something in it can you please send rescue did you guys have fever or anything no i'm just i think we're dying how much did you guys have i don't know we made brownies and i think we're dead time is going by really really really really slow well instead of being charged parallel sorry instead of being charged the police department let the officer resign his wife was not charged either so far police officials have not commented on the case now how do you follow a story like that those are funny stories but they can be scary so if you're worried about having an experience like that delta 8 is a good intro into it for me personally i started taking delta 8 because i can't afford dispensary prices all the time i just can't most people probably can't either delta 8 is about half the price of delta 9 thc it's actually a little bit less depending on where you get it these 250 milligram packages of native hemp delta 8 are actually only about 25 and if you pick them up at cass fill dispensary you can get them on sale right now for 19 so if you are looking for a good intro into edibles delta 8 is a good place to start in my opinion or if you're like me and just can't afford to hit the dispensary all the time delta a really gets me through in between those dispensary runs or caregiver drops delta 8 is a good replacement or if edibles tend to give you over anxiety or panic attacks like they do some people then delta a might be something that you want to look into for that because it is it is less intense i feel less anxiety less paranoia all of that that they used to advertise delta 8 i truly experienced just at a less potency than you normally would feel so just to recap delta 8 is hemp derived thc it is made from converting cbd into delta a thc it is 100 legal for now it will make you drop on a urine test so if you're on probation parole or you're in a job or that's a problem i wouldn't recommend using this or any other cannabis products but they do work and they do work as described as always this is a subjective opinion this is my personal experience so let me know in the comments have you tried delta 8 products what did you think about it i am becoming a huge fan and with the current price of edibles at the dispensaries these may be my new go-to for quite some time as always thanks for watching if you enjoyed this video give me a like comment or subscribe it really helps me out and if you like the hoodie you can find it on my website cured.tv shop thanks for watching", "txywY2CyfKA": "[Music] on the cancer research we find from the beginning that there is a specificity between the type of the extract that were using the type of the strain that were choosing that its ability to kill the cancer cells so we find out that strain number one is attacking colon cancer but doing nothing to prostate cancer to liver cancer and and strain number to extract number two will kill just the prostate cancer but will do nothing to call on them to breast and two things was very unique first this specificity and second the amount that we had to use we use one microgram per ml in order to kill these cancer cells so if you're taking every material in the world have what we called ic50 is what is the amount that you need to use in order to kill 50 percent of the cells so if you're taking rosemary you're taking any other herbs and you extract the active compound for it and we will put on these cells eventually it will kill the cells so I'm taking the colon cells and I will put extract from rosemary I need 50 milligram per ml in order to kill the cells if you take in cannabis you need sixty thousand times less you need one microgram and there is what we call therapeutic window if you calculate the doing this calculation which is a stupid calculation because there is a huge difference between cells growing the plateau and mice to a human being but if you're doing this game you reach that you need to eat 40 kilograms of rosemary in a day in order to kill the cells which is not therapeutic window to be doing this calculation on cannabis you realize that you need one gram two gram a day which is a average and average patient in Israel using thirty four point two grams a day so this was very exciting could you understand that is this work very specifically on this plant on the on the cells it's attacking the cells in a specific way but then we were a little bit stuck we didn't know what is the difference between them because you have many compounds here you don't have just teach in CBD you have hundreds of cannabinoids and hundreds of tear pins in every extract so what are the difference between this and death we realize didn't nobody can read it and for you we develop a method to analyze all these compounds and having disability taking us to the next level that we can really define which compound is doing these effects on the cells so the way we are working today we look on what we call you know in India and the medicine field it's called personal medicine so we're looking on a specific mutation we called the driving mutation on the the mutation that derived the cell to be cancer cell so I cancer it's a given name to hundreds of different diseases we'd put them in a box we said every time that we have one two three four five six we will call it a cancer but they are totally different from each other they have the same mccann the same basic because we call them a cancer and one one one thing is that they are losing the ability to commit suicide and other thing that they are starting to between way to different places so we put them in a box and we said every time that we see all of these Fano type we'll call it cancer but they are different in the way to treat them in different and the mechanism in the cells is different so what we're trying to look we're trying to look very specific we said every time that there were these specific mutation the drive to to this breast cancer to be a breast cancer cell let's say brca1 mutation which is very non mutation so that takes on these cells and now we will screen many many types of cannabis and we will try to find a specific one that will kill just this self with these mutations this is the way we are trying to approach it now and when we finding something like that we starting to look deeper and deeper we try to understand what is mechanism why when you have a brca1 mutation these extract attacking the cells which which pathway is blocking which passwords activating what is changing in the cell that it will die specifically this one on the other hand we trying to understand what is the minimum compound that doing this effect you're starting with 100 compound something like 40 cannabinoids 40 tear pens some flavonoids in every extract so from this one do we need all of them like the intro Hodge effect if Amelia effect or do we need one of them whether we need five of them we are not deciding for room for what is true or not but we're asking them and we have the ability to narrow it down until we find the minimum compound and at least two cases we find that we you need three or four compounds doing the whole effects you don't need all the extract and it's not just one and in these two cases it's not the major cannabinoids not the TT in CBD it's other common cannabinoids in a specific leukemia that we today we know that to kill the cells we know a specific three compounds that's with specific 3 cannabinoids that will always kill myself a few abilities mutation but b3 are not the known one one of them is don't even have a name because nobody define it in the literature before but we know that if you put this compound purified it will do the same effect of the whole extra if you taking one out it's not affecting any more so these are the way we're looking and then come the second round that you started to look on the endocannabinoids how the receptors or which receptors are expressing on these cells and how it's affecting our ability to attack the cells do we need this endocannabinoid the receptors to be on b-cells in order in order to attack them so usually people look on cb1 and cb2 but we have many and can have been receptive with cb3 in GPR 55 and GPR 19 GPR 3 trpv1 TR PP 1 so there is more than 30 receptors which one expressing on this cancer cell that now these extract is attacking them do we need a combination is it a synergism or is it a specific one receptors may be it's attacking 3 different receptor may be into entering all these questions are we are asking them and we have all the tools to look on them and to ask them this is the way we are using today [Music] you [Music]", "h8gq5iWCZrk": "hey it's Gert here with another review this time it isn't on flower this time it isn't on BHO or or other stuff this is I think my second meta believe you that but my first on THC pills these are from MMJ total health care dot CA now if you look at those those look like they're not moving hey but that's oil in there you can see the bubble even that's because they're frozen I keep them in the freezer because I'm going to tell you about some something some positives about keeping them in the freezer but those are three of six I had I haven't I have some others I keep them for when I can't smoke and for when I really really seriously need some some either pain relief or or anxiety relief it is an amazing amazing way to take now a amenable is very very similar if these are 100 milligram each most medicals you will find like a candy is usually around 25 milligrams and I'd say a farad or dose for anybody a fair dose for anybody who eats mandibles on a regular basis teeth down Tim and I think you eat more medals than anybody I know which is cool I mean I see why I'm slowly going that way myself these these pills being the hundred milligram are quite strong now MMJ dosa weaker ones I think 50 milligram and they react differently than food does depending on how you're taking it so this that's why I say this is gonna be a review but the review is really quick the but the understanding of the review see I could end the review right now by saying I tasted nothing I took it two hours ago in ten minutes two hours and ten minutes ago I took them I'm I'm wonderfully medicated I can say that 90% of it is in my body I like how Whomper I heard one person say today like my medicine is hugging me I just feel warm I I feel content my body usually doesn't feel that way except with a good medical or good CBD so I can say okay it's two hours in it's working it's a hunger milligram a MMJ but for most of you who have never ever taken oil in the tablet form and for some of you who maybe haven't even taken a medical yet understanding the the high and I hate to call it the high understanding the medicated response to the medicine is as important especially is more important if you haven't done it then if you have because if you have you aren't going to be fearful of it we only fear what we don't know so when you when you fist physically ingest marijuana in that carboxylated format in okay that means I have step on back okay THC in the plant straight from the leaf I'll just pick any DEA see straight from the leaf is THC a it is not yet active it activates as you heat it to burn it to smoke it if you're going to ingest it to get the most out of the THC the THC first needs to be converted to its active form at through heat so that's carboxylate then once once you have a carboxylate you can eat it as the plant you can squish out the oils you can cook out the oils there are so many ways and I have videos on many of them check them out there are so many ways in which to get that oil out once that oil is out if it is curved actually it's definitely a edible oil and then as long as you can measure it you can put it in these tablets and then people can ingest it that way that gets us to and we've talked about dosing 25 50 milligrams 25 a good starter dose 50 a good regular dose 75 to 100 a really great way for somebody in a lot of pain I had to explain to me really well in the video that I shared in Google today if I can find it'll people over the it's night is that when the body is bombarded with THC and CBD bombarded when the cannabinoid system is overflowing when our endocannabinoid receptors are full and the body still has plenty and plenty of the chemical stored throughout it that is when it creates an environment in which many many pathogens cannot happen cancer cells cannot replicate and they're finding that I mean it used to it used to cover things that penicillin covers now so I just want to get into that and I'm still going way off topic that's practicing Medicaid now we've talked about the dosing we've talked about that we've talked about the pills now we need to talk about our own body system and how we ingest it if the THC can be ingested you know like if we breathe it in it's all almost automatic that it gets into our blood system if we rub it on it is almost automatic if we ingest it it can be on almost automatic it can be absolutely nothing for a couple hours or it can be somewhere in between that's where we start talking about freezing your pills and the oil or dosing sporadically now what I mean by that okay if you eat if the THC goes directly into your into your stomach then the only way for that THC it's after the little bit that collects as it goes down and is collect into the bloodstream there will not do much for you until two hours later when it first passes through the liver that's why the two-hour mark on that opposed people yet most good products carry a warning that you could wait up to two hours for for the effects to take so don't take more expecting hey I'm not high yet it's been an hour you shouldn't be I'm hours and 15 minutes into this and I'm feeling basically the full effect I am NOT over capacitated I am clear thinking my body I think the only pain I still feel is I'm really sore through the hands today but Dublin I'm not feeling pain right now it is quarter after a time two hours 15 minutes in I could have taken this today and been able to look after my son all day long to eat and that's where the trick of dosing comes in a 100 milligram dose taken by a pill will give you very little immediate high it'll have to wait until it gets through like I did and then two hours later however when you freeze them what you can do is you can cut that pill in half you can so now you have a 50 milligram half it's frozen it's not going anywhere and you've got a little bit of time before it melts and you can squeeze that oil under your tongue like like you take your tincture that 50 milligrams is entering your body so much faster and take the other half and or cut the pill in half or quarters and take them in 15-minute intervals there's so many different ways so that your liver isn't hammered at the two-hour mark it is somewhat worked because nobody wants to hurt our bodies but it doesn't hurt your liver there is no damage to your liver the only way that you can damage your liver with THC is maybe a really really high dose being pushed through it and that's why I suggest and thank you Jeff ER for giving me that advice on really high doses hundred milligram or above take that take that opportunity to cut it in half put some on the tongue put some in wait a half-hour do that again then your pills done then that three hundred and fifty milligrams or two hundred milligram pill I did a two hundred milligram fill like that half then half an hour later another half and it was beautiful it was so much calmer so much more collected and you really with the higher ones you don't get all that much more medicated it just seems to last that much longer a good strong dose is really good it creates an atmosphere for your body to thrive and I wish I'd taken some of these Monday or Tuesday I had I had them I had them but I'm so broken so short and so waiting for to find out is my wife going to accept a truce and the possible future for all of us I mean can't we all be adults let's get the lawyers out let's stop spending money on people who want us to fight and let's spend the money on the child and just stop fighting I can do it I really can't I've made mistakes for sure I've made mistakes I got hurt I thought that I it's my second marriage I didn't want it to end I did everything I thought I could to stop it from ending and doing that has probably alienated the person that I wanted to keep see how much I'm gone but you guys tune in to always stay up to date if I don't mention how cookie is doing there or or what's going on in my life people ask so I enter but now back to the review on MMJ THC and their THC pills I have not had their CBD pills yet I have had CBD oil in the edible format like Phoenix tears and I have it here and I can do it and that way I can again medicate without and the any fear of safety concern about my son but um these are the perfect for those who can't smoke for those who want a better body medication the THC pill is the way to go I really enjoy it I love that statement it's like my medicine is hugging me and as one girl who used to be on chemotherapy said why should people chastise me now that I enjoyed my Madison no I didn't enjoy my chemotherapy book but what would we chastise it if she did so what that medicine can be enjoyable maybe life is supposed to be enjoyable maybe this plant has been around this long in this beautiful format and grows in every area of the world and is a M we have a system in our body to accept this plant maybe that's because it's always meant to be a synergistic part of our lives and those of you without you need to just take a look at those of us with we we live a usually happier life my life is a really really happy life I'm just stressed right now and if the stress were gone that has nothing to do with medication my pain no longer stresses me it used to be pain that stresses me now the life is stressing me but I can get rid of that I can handle the pain peace Cheers love and harmony you want some THC pills you get a hold of MMJ total health care in Vernon BC peace", "q2wDcMX5tjU": "[Music] hey it's mad at Rafal studios and welcome to can of a six today we're making cannabutter or cannabis oil in an air fryer now here's what you're going to need to make canna butter and an air fryer this recipe is to make a cup of the butter or oil so we're going to need to start with about 20 ounces that's a cup plus about a quarter cup in order to end up with a cup so we need 20 ounces of butter olive oil or coconut oil when it comes to cannabis you can use half to 1 ounce of cannabis flowers or two to three ounces of rosin chips and optionally you need one teaspoon of sunflower or soy lecithin and for the tools we need an oven safe dish that will fit in the fryer basket some foil and we're also going to need a fine mesh filter to screen it out at the end now as far as the dish goes you need something that's oven safe and we're gonna be able to cover it with aluminum foil and it needs to be able to fit inside of the fryer basket when it's covered with a foil so as long as you meet all those parameters any kind of dish should work there and we're using this Jessie air fryer which is available on Amazon and you can use any kind of air fryer as long as it has the basket like that but I'll put a link in the description where you can pick up this air fryer for $79 alright that brings us to the first step of making cannabutter which is always to decarboxylate your cannabis has to activate it turn THC a which is acid into regular THC to make it more bioavailable so in order to do that we're first going to grind our cannabis and I'm grinding if you're using cannabis flowers you want to use a grinder and grind it up good pull out any big stems and seeds as usual and then for the cannabis or if you're using the pucks the rods and pucks are the rosin chips you're gonna go on to break them up by hand because it's hard to get those to go work inside of a grinder okay but you see this is really a loose material here that inside of an air fryer is probably gonna blow around everywhere I know this because I did a little test with some other dry herbs and put it in there and they just blew it out of the dish so it's very important to do this step and that is to cover with foil your your material so there D carbs and then also this is an air fryer it needs airflow so we are going to poke some holes in this but that's not gonna let as much air in there as we would normally get to the right temperature so we're also going to dakar blogger than we normally do in a regular hub and when it's covered like this okay so we're going to put that inside of the fryer basket and put the fryer basket inside of the air fryer and we have a set on two hundred and fifty degrees Fahrenheit and we're going to put that in for two cycles of thirty minutes each and that's double the time that we normally decarbonize you want to add probably a good idea to take the dish out and let it cool a little bit or use a up oven mitt or just to mix it up with your hands after its cooled off and then do it again because just to make sure that you get a better distribution of the heat okay once you've gone through your two cycles your cannabis is decarboxylated it's time to move on and use to fuse the oil so if you using oil you would add in your oil we're using butter and so now we're adding in the 1 cup of butter plus a quarter cup that we're gonna lose some when we go to filter it out at the end so that's what we had the extra oil and then we're putting that with on this first cycle we're putting it in with the foil again okay and so we're going to go through another and this is a 40-minute cycle and we're going to go through at 250 degrees Fahrenheit still now we're gonna let this infuse for a total of 3 40-minute cycles but this first one we're infusing with the actual lid now that was just to heat everything get it mixed together and make sure all our cannabis is saturated with the oil so it doesn't go flying out on these next cycles so you can stir that up and this would also be the appropriate time to add in your sunflower lecithin that oil is nice and warm and hot now it's going to melt it in and dissolve it real easily and you'll start you'll see that it even starts to emulsify right away soy lecithin sunflower lecithin zarm also fires they'll help combine homogenized all the ingredients together and then keep them together once the Hana butter is made in the end so now we're going back in uncovered this time for our second cycle and you'll notice now that I'm outside because this smells a lot and I got kicked out of the house so notice that the airfryer does smell up your house even more than making canna butter and your regular oven but unlike your regular oven you can very easily take it right outside and plug it in and do it outside very discreetly so just a little tip there that's something that's nice about the air fryer that you can't really do with a regular oven okay and you can see after the second cycle I pulled it out I mix it up again and I put it back in for the third cycle one thing I did notice that the air fryer definitely gets the oil hotter than the regular oven so you can adjust your times if you feel like you're getting a little over cooked or whatever you can reduce the temperatures or the times a little bit but for me it turned out really good and you can see now I'm filtering out the cannabis from the oil I've let it cool off some which is really hot and once it's cool off you put it through a fine mesh filter and you can filter out that plant material which you could also use that plant material for another batch of oil use less oil and you'll get another batch okay and now it's time to use your oil I've got some cool little mold so I'm molding up some of the butter and these little cannabis molds but you could just put your your butter in any kind of mold that you want to use until you're ready to use it and you see this oil is really dark and rich and pretty it seems like it did a really good job but in order to test it I'm gonna have to dilute it because it's way too strong to test in our tester so I'm diluting it ten-to-one here and we'll use our tea check here and see what kind of THC content we have on it and being able to do this test I did find out although I've adjusted the times in this recipe the first time I did it I did not double the time for the for the actual D carb and I did not convert enough of the THC a and a THC regular THC so I found this out by doing tests for both the THC a and the THC so that's why I doubled the actual time but you can see at 26.2 milligrams of per tablespoon diluted so multiply that times 11 it was close to 300 milligrams per tablespoon but once I D carved it again I got that closer to 600 milligrams per tablespoon a really good butter so I hope you did enjoyed this video on how to make cannabutter with an airfryer if you did please hit the like button and subscribe to roughhouse studios for more

started medication, as advised by my psychologist, which has really helped. But, I also started smoking marijuana recreationally and I'm wondering if there's anything I should be worried about. Is it safe to use marijuana when dealing with depression? And this is a really important topic, more states have legalized recreational marijuana. It's becoming a more common question, people we know are self medicating, the question is: pros, cons, when it's good versus when it's potentially really bad. That's right. And I think it's important because it actually acts on some of the same receptors that our first line antidepressants act on, so that serotonin receptor. It affects it, and so it can potentially not only affect how well your medication's working for you, but people who use marijuana more regularly, when they come down from the medication, they actually experience withdrawals like depression and anxiety. So, that complicates the fixture further. And one of my main concerns is, of course, it does affect your cognitive function, also. And so, when it does impact your attention, your processing speed, the way you go about solving problems, you know, all of this is actually going to impact that person's life and also their depression development. One of my biggest fears with the legalization of marijuana is that it's a medicine and yet, we have zero good studies out there as far as if it's effective for things like depression, for some people, what would be the right dosing. Are there people out there, if you're gonna consider marijuana, that you should specifically be working with? Well, yeah, and I think this is potentially one good side effect of legalization because maybe we'll see more studies. Right now, we just don't have good studies about what it really looks like to dose marijuana or what happens to people on a more systematic basis when they use it at the same time as an antidepressant. And so, absolutely, I think if there's, there gets to a point where we can actually be more specific and say yes this is okay, potentially more than that, this dose would be harmful. But the problem is, people use it whenever they feel like it. They basically, they're feeling distressed and the first thing they do is just reach for marijuana 'cause it brings them that temporary relief. Because marijuana does work to calm people down, at least temporarily, it's hard to establish a coping strategy that might take time and resources to develop. And so, we have to get in there and kind of educate people about if you are taking it, you really need to talk to your doctor and be 100% honest about how much you're using. Because I just, I mean, this is me not being a psychologist or a psychiatrist. Depression is a different than beast than I'm trying to calm down, depression is hopelessness. Depression is you either sleep all day or you don't sleep at all. Depression is literally, you maybe had thoughts about suicide, I just really struggle thinking that marijuana is gonna be an answer for someone with true severe depression.\nI think there's even some... That it actually worsens the risk. It seems like it would. My advice would be do not self medicate with marijuana for depression,\n100%. because there is absolutely no good studies out there that show it's gonna help, but potentially could worsen it. Yes. But do talk with your doctor about what's safe for you.", "75kavv_ka4o": "hey everyone and welcome to hemp in a pan today we'll be showing you how to make a simple CBD oil infused butter using an easy to do stovetop slow cook method there are multiple ways to make CBD oil but today we'll be going with one of the easiest methods which is simmering butter inhale over low heat which extracts the trichomes cannabinoids and CBD from the hemp it combines it with the butter making a rich CBD oil infused butter to make CBD oil infuse butter you'll only need three ingredients butter decarboxylated hemp and water or how to decarboxylate how to first convert the CVP a into CBD check out our decarboxylation guide first now you'll wanna use 1/4 of an ounce of hemp buds and trimmings for each stick of butter which is also half a cup of butter and of course the higher quality of trimming the buds you use the more CVP there will be in the butter now before adding the ingredients you'll want to first add some water to the pot the whole purpose of the water is to buffer the butter and health so that it doesn't touch the bottom of the stove and burn since the butter is less dense than water and will flow and no matter how much water you add it's pretty easy to separate from the butter after you're done I use two cups of water for this to give it a good buffer and if you're using a larger pot you can go up to 3 to 4 cups of water I'm now melting the butter in the pot of water throwing in the decarboxylated hemp and then once everything came to a boil I kept the heat on low so that it's barely simmering now you can leave this and check back on it periodically to make sure nothing has changed and if the water is burning off too fast you can always just add more water to the pot you'll want this to simmer for at least an hour and ideally up to five hours to make sure that all the cannabinoids have infused into the butter and for this I went with five hours and added another cup of water halfway through the process [Music] now you want to strain the entire pot through a strainer or a cheesecloth or in my case I didn't have either on hand so I used a new clean t-shirt if you're going with the t-shirt I have to warn you that doing this will ruin the shirt and make sure the shirts clean without any lint or detergent that could get into your infuse butter I waited until a mixture cooled slightly and then poured everything through it was still pretty hot so it took me a while to get every last drop but it was well worth it you can see here that after 10 minutes the CBD oil infused butter is already completely separated from the water if you want to use it right away you can use a baster to remove the water from the bottom otherwise just cover it up throw in the fridge overnight and the next day when the butter has hardened you can easily drain out the water how'd it dry and then store for future use to make all types of edibles or you can even put it into little capsules to make CPP pills [Music] and that's it", "9SFK6jTQFAE": "talk to me about the New Year's Day in in Illinois for your company how did you do you know an incredibly exciting day you know uh decades in the making it was it was phenomenal it was a tremendous amount of support we had the the stores open from 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. we had we had people lining up at 8:00 p.m. on New Year's Eve and at some of the stores and and you know throughout the day hundreds and hundreds of people waiting in line to get through like you said we service over 3100 customers yesterday was phenomenal Cresco has 30 licenses in seven states and Sunnyside is your national retail brand how important will Illinois be in the overall portfolio you know it's our home state and we're incredibly well positioned here to through the through the existing medical program you know when our operator has a 100% market penetration twenty-five plus percent market share which is by far the largest market share in the state we have three of the 21 existing cultivation licenses we're the only one with three we only have one other appear with two and everybody else has one so we're very very well positioned here in our home state to take advantage and make the most of this this new marketplace this new adult use market in what form do most buyers buy you know I think it was it was across the spectrum you've got your traditional flower products you've got concentrates and bait pens and edibles and you know depending on familiarity I think you've got some consumers who will tend to be in that flower concentrate formats and then newer more exploratory consumers the the vape pens and the edibles are a lot more approachable charlie are you concerned at all about the crackdown on vaping the crackdown on flavors and what it means for the future of marijuana no you know what we heard most yesterday was the consumers were very happy to have a safe tested compliance focused product offering that they could legally buy in the state of Illinois that was one of the one of the comments we heard most yesterday that's that is the benefit of legalized regulated and compliance focused cannabis is safe products educate me because I don't know how the system works how do you know that the products you are selling meet a certain quality standard and our set are quote safe that's number one and I don't mean to get on any kind of moral high horse do you have any qualms about selling an intoxicant in a world where there probably is plenty of intoxication already sure so I'll dress the first question first you know regulated compliance focused programs like Illinois in many of them definitely east of the Mississippi they set standards they set quality control standards they set safety standards as it relates to microbial contamination residual solvents potencies etc so you know not a single product can leave our production facilities until it's been tested and certified by a third-party lab that's also licensed by the state so that's you know one of the benefits of that legalized regulated cannabis is these consumers are coming into a licensed store and every product that they're buying will have the the test results you know again as it relates to exactly what's in that product from the potency of the cannabis related constituents and then also any any sort of supplements along with verification that there's no residual pesticides or solvents left in the product any qualms about selling about selling a product that is yet another intoxicant know a cannabis has been around for 5000 years my background of being a regulatory attorney prior to getting into the cannabis space it was one of the things that I had to address prior to entering the industry but to be honest with you is one of the things that I knew I had to offer to this developing opportunity in the US was a background in regulatory compliance to make sure that this industry was developed in the right way I think it's I think we're seeing the benefit of safe reliable third-party tested products entering into a market you know you see the data in in in most states with regulated cannabis you see a significant reduction in opioid abuse in those states so that the data is now showing great support for greater access to cannabis products and Charlie the fact that you have sales tax that's going up as the th THC content in these products goes up so 10% for lower THC as much as 20% on other THC what does that do to the desire you know I don't know that it has an impact on desire because again those it kind of goes by category by form right so the lower THC products are going to be your traditional flower products the increased potency products are the the concentrates that are for you know the more well-adjusted and familiar consumers that are able to handle the higher tolerance and it's also you know it the the price per milligram at that point is lower too so the increased taxes we haven't seen a we haven't seen an impact from that again one one day of data but we really haven't seen an impact from that graduating tax rate believe it you", "tTj5w3uyJ5c": "chronic pain can be a debilitating condition the condition can impact everything from mood health and overall well-being unfortunately many treatment options aren't very effective worse commonly prescribed drugs like opioids are highly addictive they can cause nausea sleepiness and other side effects and they are potentially deadly according to the national institutes of health more than 115 people die each day in the united states from opioid overdose it's become a public health crisis but what about using marijuana for pain relief could that help address the opioid crisis inside science there is some evidence to suggest that cannabinoids a class of chemical components in marijuana plants can be effective in alleviating pain either alongside or in place of opioids as medical marijuana becomes more accessible in the u.s it may serve as a safer option for some kinds of pain relief and help reduce the number of people becoming addicted to opioids but some patients are receiving medical advice from their local dispensary a trend some doctors are worried about instead of their provider giving them information on the cannabis in terms of pain relief they were actually getting their knowledge or obtaining their knowledge from you know people that were that had cannabis shops or marijuana type shops clinical trials are currently underway to examine dosage side effects methods for administering marijuana and its effectiveness at relieving pain armed with clinical evidence doctors can make reliable recommendations for its use as an alternative to opioids so we don't know exactly what to prescribe so we need to know what patients are actually doing so that we know where physicians know what to prescribe the other big piece is really what about drug interactions so we know that there are some drug drug interactions that occur we need to have a better handle on what those drug drug interactions actually look like in order to balance the patient's other medications that they may be taking so that's a big if out there and this kind of research is really important to have done in a well-controlled fashion because you know exactly what the patient is getting so you know the thc component you know how the methods are delivered [Music] cannabis comes in many different forms patients can smoke it eat it vape it or use it topically on the skin also different products have different amounts of thc or cbd the two most abundant types of cannabinoids found in cannabis they both interact with the body's endocannabinoid system but produce different effects doctors are now learning what works best for individual patients are they consuming a thc product with a little bit of cbd are they doing are they utilizing a product that has more cbd and low thc and and basically i think figuring out that ratio for a specific disorder or disease state is also really essential so we'll never know unless we actually conduct the research to figure all of that out the bottom line will pot replace opioids for pain so i don't think it will completely replace opioids for certain types of pain but i think that it probably shares a role so it may decrease the opioid use overall and we might find out that it's a safer option for patients than an opioid prescription which obviously can be lethal for many patients this is inside science [Music] inside

when after a botched back surgery I was left with severe chronic pain this began a cycle that lasted over a decade of fentanyl patch neurontin methadone Norco a myriad of pharmaceuticals that at the height had me over the next decade on 26 different drugs a day what I was left with was overweight depressed unable to work unable to even drive a car but more importantly what I was also left with was chronic pain because we're opioids are an excellent option for people that are in acute suffering they are not the best solution for people having chronic suffering such as mine so I went looking for other solutions about this time I met a woman by the name of K kurta Posse and k was a self-described waken Baker each morning she would wake up and she would pull out her little pink Hello Kitty pipe and she would have a couple of Puffy's so I judged K very harshly I saw her as a drug user but she also told me something very interesting and that was that she was making pot brownies for her boyfriend who had chronic neck pain and that he was able to use or eat one of her brownies before bed at night and not have to use any harmful pharmaceuticals to sleep through the night and that got my interest because up to that point we all had heard the hype around this but all of a sudden I'm like there's got to be some science here so I I started looking for solutions and the first thing I did is I went to a doctor in California who was willing to write me a recommendation to use cannabis and I thought great I'm gonna go and I'm gonna see this doctor and I'm gonna walk out of there with a prescription and know exactly what to do but instead what I got was a sheet of paper with a list of dispensaries and he pointed to one of them and he said this is the Nordstrom of dispensaries so I suggest you go there well I love nor DS so of course that's where I headed so I went over to the dispensary I stood in line I walked up to the counter and I said to the young man behind the counter now that I know is called a budtender and I said okay I have chronic pain what do I use what do I do and out from beneath the counter he pulled a rice krispies treat a bag of caramel corn and a chocolate brownie and I'm looking at this and I'm thinking what how do I use it what do I take and he's like well I have no idea you know I just like this one and it no it kind of makes me and I was like okay great this is not science this is not medicine I need to go and find out more information so I then made my next stop was it heme con well heme con fulfilled every stereotype that I had about cannabis I mean you had your young ladies with the body paint and the strategically placed pot leaves you had the I heart vagina signs along the wall you had the the deafening boom box you know boom boo-boom boo-boom and I'm trying to listen to the vendors and I'm asking them questions and they're giving me answers and and I can't hear anything but what I also heard while I was there was the same girl in the body paint was treating irritable bowel syndrome with cannabis you had the person with the chronic pain seeking answers the social anxiety looking for answers with cannabis so I thought there's got to be something here and I'm since I'm obviously not finding it I'm gonna have to go figure it out myself so I went next and I bought a couple of ounces of something called xxx chem dog and I got it at the granny rate and I went home into my kitchen and I started making this I could not believe that my pain had been so affected by this plant that I had gone from level 8 to a level 2 almost instantaneously when I had taken a puff of it and that no doctor up to this point had ever bothered to mention to me that cannabis was an option how was that even possible so I thought what is it going to take for a doctor to be able to recommend cannabis effectively for treating patients just me so I made this in the kitchen and I can add the oil and I'm looking at it and I'm trying it and I thought okay what is it gonna take so that a doctor feels comfortable actually recommending this for its patient so what are the keys that are gonna be there the first thing is there's gonna have to be lab tests associated with this product if you do not have a lab test associated with the medicine you do not know how many milligrams of each cannabinoid is in there you don't know what you're taking you don't know how to take it and you can't be consistent and frankly a doctor is only going to want to prescribe or recommend something that can be done consistently and accurately the next thing is the doctors going to have to do a very in-depth patient intake process because they're going to have to have all of the same questions that they would ask in treating any disease but then they have to incorporate a set of questions that are specific for cannabis use in itself the next thing is they're going to have to very well understand this plant and the properties of it there are over 500 chemical compounds within the cannabis plant and each one has its own medical potential within it and so how they work and how they work together is very important that a medical professional understands when making this sort of recommendation and the next thing is they're going to have to have a way of giving you specific dosing instructions for each disease that you're treating so that once they do start this feedback loop that they can see what's working and what's not working and refine the data and keep making it better and better I'm a process engineer finding patterns and establishing with data is just the logical way to figure out something and turn it from a plant into a medicine so I went out next and I got a whole bunch of different varieties of cannabis and I was very excited I made all these oils I sent them out for lab results our lab testing and lo and behold I sat down and I'm looking through all these labs and I'm like what am I looking at I have no idea what any of this means I do not understand I don't understand what beta carry a saline is I don't know what Elsa PI I don't know what any of these different components are this so I need to get more education on this because the thing that's fascinating about cannabis is that it is really a pharmacy and a flower because you have all these different compounds within there you know everybody knows about THC and CBD you hear about these in the press there's the misnomer that one gets you high and one is the medicine I would flip that and I would say one isn't of much value and the other one is really good medicine meaning the THC that's a different talk but let's go ahead and stick with this but you also have other cannabinoids in there like CBN and CBN is the one that helps to make you sleepy you have THC v which we believe regulates the insulin uptake in the body so there's all these other you then have all these things called terpenes what terpenes are what you taste and what you smell in a terpene for example in in lavender you have something that's called a little lool that's very calming if you've ever picked up a lemon and held it to your nose and smelled it and had that uplifting feeling that it gives you that's limonene that's also in cannabis so we know that it has all these various components within it and we have to see how they work together I learned about something called the entourage effect now this isn't an actor with a bunch of fans hanging around him this is how all the components of the plant work together in the case of cannabis the whole truly is greater than the sum of its parts because you can buy isolated where they just use one component of it but it is not going to work anywhere as near as well as when you have all of the components together so let's talk about a piece of chocolate cake you could have your flour your butter your sugar your eggs your vanilla your cocoa all of the ingredients that go into a piece of care of chocolate cake but you certainly are not going to have have the experience of eating a piece of chocolate cake and that is a nutshell what the entourage effect is so now we know that we have to have the whole plant so that we have this entourage effect we know that doctors are going to be able to have to dose it correctly but what is in fact a dose because people don't understand that so what a dose is is how much you take and how often you take it if the doctor says I want you to take two in the morning and two at bedtime that's your dose if the doctor says I want you to take one three times a day that's your dose if they say take ten milligrams in the morning and 20 milligrams in the evening that's your dose now what is the therapeutic dose a therapeutic dose is how much is required for you to accomplish what your objective is for example if your objective is to sleep eight hours a night the amount of cannabis that is required to get you asleep keep you asleep and allow you to wake up after eight hours feeling refreshed that is your therapeutic dose if you're suffering chronic pain it's not the amount that knocks you on your butt it's not the amount that gets you high it's the amount that gets your pain under control to a point where you were still a fully functional member of society that is the therapeutic dose it's not just how much you can use so now let's take a look at what is not a dose all right because I hear all the time from people I'll say how much are you taking and they'll say oh I take a one-to-one or I take a one to five or I take a twenty to one well that's great that's a ratio that tells me how much you have one component is in relation to another but it doesn't tell me what they are it doesn't tell me how much concentration of each one is in it just tells me the relationship between two different molecules it's also not the number of drops if I say how much do you take and you say four drops or two drops or five drops if I don't know how many milligrams are in the whole I have no way of knowing how much is in an individual drop and then lastly the most important in the United States in particular where we are not on the metric system however the medical community is a milligram and a milliliter are not interchangeable one is a weight and one is a volume so you need to know how many milligrams of the cannabinoids or whatever the chemical compound is within the volume of whatever the product is whether it's an oil or a cookie or a rice krispies treat alright so let's take a look here at a theoretical therapeutic dose now I want to stay right here before I go any further this is not a particular dose for our therapeutic dose for anything for anybody it's strictly for the purposes of the disc demonstration and I have it up here and I want you to also before I go any further I want to say that no doctor in their right mind would ever recommend somebody start out in a dose this high you always want to start out very very very low and increased slowly until you reach your therapeutic dose but let's take a look at this for a minute we have a recommendation here of a THC dominant medicine that from the doctor they want you to take 25 milligrams a day divided into two separate doses with 1 5 milligrams in the morning when you get up and 20 milligrams about 1 hour before bed they wanted to have several of these different terpenes in it if possible and they want you to take it sublingually which means under the tongue thus the picture of the person sticking their tongue out at you a little bit rolling stones so I'm going to take that and say ok now that you've got this how do we take that information and convert that over to going to a dispensary to buy a product to match it so I'm going to take this as a typical infused oil because it's sibling wool we need to use a tincture or something that can be done under the tongue and let's take a look into a blow-up of the label alright so this on this label I'm going to look along with you it says it's an extra-strength THC product it has 30 milligrams weight of THC within each milliliter the volume so 30 milligrams per milliliter tells you how much is in there we also know that this is going to be about one milligram per drop because we know that a rule of thumb is when you have an infused oil it's approximately 28 to 30 drops per milliliter so in this case because it's 30 milligrams per milliliter it's gonna be about one milligram per drop so in order to achieve the five milligrams in the morning it's going to be five drops and for the twenty milligrams before bedtime you're looking at about three-quarters of a dropper or 0.75 milliliters to achieve that and that will give you precisely what the doctor has recommended for you so I encourage you when you leave here to go to your local dispensaries and look at the myriad of products that are available on the shelves today they come in all forms they come in capsules and waters and all sorts of other things and take a look and go up to the budtender and ask to show you what some of these products are you have the benefit now of a regulated market which means that you now have proper labeling so everything is easier to tell what is in it which really makes eases the way for you to begin your exploration of what cannabis products may work for what ails you and I just one last word of caution remember always start very low and increase slowly thank you you", "5QCxnFnBg7Y": "so here's the deal I'm a mom of two and I get this thing called the six

because I'm not the kind that like smokes weed and gets happy I actually get really anxious and I start hearing things and seeing things but medical marijuana is totally different I'll take a few puffs off my babe I used the serene one by Sir Tara and I will feel mad chill you know part of the reason why I'm trying and I'm using medicinal marijuana was because after I had my first daughter I had really bad postpartum depression - which I was prescribed anti-anxiety medication you know I've been on them for 11 years and I decided a month ago you know I don't want to take this medication anymore and I'm not saying that this is for everyone and everyone should go on this path but for me what it was like I wasn't feeling anymore I wasn't crying anymore I had really low energy as a side effect to these medicines and I knew that there had to be another way I knew there had to be a way to get off these anti-anxiety medications and feel okay with the help of dr. Weiner she said you know when you feel you know anxious or you take this and when you wake up feeling this way you take that and I have to say that's really helped me wean myself off the anti-anxiety medication I find that sir Tara is um it's kind of like a little like a boutique in the sense that you can walk in and be like okay I'm feeling like this so the girl that helps seems like well it sounds like you need more CBD than THC so we're gonna go for a 5 to 1 ratio for you everything was definitely spelled out for me was really well explained I felt super informed and educated on each and every product and I definitely have fan favorites I love the Tom tincture and I love the serene baby [Music]", "iRPq0ozF7fw": "what's up it is 3 p.m on a sunday afternoon thanks for tuning into cannabis legalization news where we explain marijuana so you can change them today we're going to be talking about three policy makers who are just showing their whole ass to the whole world uh let's see we're also going to do an update about mexico and malta and somebody in detroit is suing detroit for just some petty stuff so let's just get right into it hey mickey hey tom oh i can wait i'm reporting from 1937. we have a breaking story that's come across the line for cannabis legalization news thank you for joining us everybody since it's 1937 we're gonna say i hope that you've turned up your radio as opposed to likes and subscribes uh governor ricketts who i'm assuming was the appointed governor of nebraska in 1937 says if you legalize marijuana you're gonna kill kids what was the date of that article maybe that was a march 14th 2021 what march 14th 2021 oh that makes me angry i mean i understand when it's something that is just so wrong that you think it's from like 1937 but when it's from 2021 and it's a governor in a position of power saying that weed will kill your children it is just a lie it's the same type of why we've been fighting against on this program and thank you for joining us by the way uh since 2019 starting with the 19. corn [ __ ] are in charge of nebraska dude period the the balls there's only one nut in nebraska yeah there's nothing i mean like i would i would probably be fine going through life as a cat lawyer in nebraska simply because they'd be like well at least he's not on wheat yeah and you're white and i'm white that also helps this haircut probably doesn't let's see that haircut picture that uh governor pete ricketts is rocking so governor pete ricketts uh gave a press conference as you can see he has adopted the lex luthor-esque uh seriously dude like like evil incarnate is right like yeah stereotype right there right and governor pete ricketts and other prohibitionists in nebraska held a conference on wednesday in the capital rotunda just ahead of a unicameral hearing on medical marijuana legalization mmj is in front of nebraska lawmakers for a fifth consecutive year months after losing ballot approval in the 11th hour last fall following a ruling by the nebraska supreme court governor ricketts said if you legalize marijuana you're going to kill your kids that's what the data shows from around the country um you know that is the biggest lie that i've heard all day simply because uh children are not dying from cannabis they aren't if anything in legal cannabis states children's schools are getting funded children have a harder time accessing cannabis especially in states where the illicit market is allowed to participate in the uh regulated market so all those people that were because you know you know who doesn't card right nikki oh dealers drug dealers don't card and so like i see stuff like this and when i see stuff like the the caps in florida when they say that this is about you know preventing our children our children are going to have brain damage and you're like no well you preventing the 10 percent uh flower cap on thc for medical cannabis or for lawfully purchased cannabis just means that the dealer down the street can be like you don't want those nuggets i got the real thc in my nuggets right here and because it's illegal i'm not going to be carding to see whether or not you're over 21 or paying my taxes but it'll still be a cash transaction this is how you get spice outbreaks and other uh outbreaks of bad drugs when uh you know overall you know my 100 percent and legalization but it's also our harm reduction and how we treat just our perception of of what it is like this is complete [ __ ] like complete idiots see like what the how are you shoveling stupid to your people and then still get reelected like how is this like like like like does anybody even ask like hey where are the kids that are dying like like show me the data show me on the doll where marijuana touched you but let me uh just continue to read some of his stuff and i hope that i don't get too upset about it so governor ricketts we already said that ricketts continued marijuana has big impacts on people's cognitive abilities changes their gray matter in the brain damages their ability to be able to develop their cognitive abilities to be able to think to do well in school this is something that's harming our young people and it continues on through the workforce so uh you know i didn't use cannabis when i until i was in college i've been a c student since i was four and so i know i'm pretty sure maybe if i would have smoked weed when i was in high school i would have done better but but no probably not have you ever gone to school it's exceedingly boring the only people that do really really well are the people that are like oh you listened to what the teacher said kissed her ass a little bit and then did it a-plus this kind of stupid does not do your constituents doesn't do america any favors like this is the kind of [ __ ] that so you're saying a guy who lives in a legal state you or me or anybody in legal states deserves to be behind bars because pandemonium has erupted you know this is it's and then not only that you're saying in order to save the children we need to keep it illegal so that the children can continue to access it through drug dealers as opposed to cannabis will no longer necessarily be something that drug dealers are stocking because people that can actually buy sell and grow it uh on a local level uh and where it's licensed and where the purity is regulated and then not only that where they're like i need to see your id oh i don't have my id get out dude safe access isn't is about uh uh you know it's the the the plant itself being a good plant like good product good known product and it's also about a safe place where you can pick it up like i go to the store and pick it up dude yesterday i just went to uh uh uh stop by have a heart and i picked up this uh for my sponsor washington blood code thank you so much so good um so good dude i've been smoking mids for so long i forgot what good we was like and oh my god this is the champagne the weed but anyways uh uh you know i went to the store yesterday they had a long line and everybody was a good citizen there was no cops no raids like the the kind of civility that happens when it's legal and people don't treat it like the [ __ ] up ignorant type [ __ ] that they're preaching in this like your kids no your kids are in trouble with the law because of this the law is the the issue not the plan this is not you know it's ignorance 101. you know ricketts said that the use of marijuana has a huge human toll sharing examples of two fatalities he says were linked to ingested marijuana or thc let's see the death report on those two fatalities meanwhile how many uh people have died of the coronavirus in nebraska or how many people died of heart disease in nebraska how many people have died of alcohol poisoning or like liver failure in nebraska how many people are dying of cheeseburgers in nebraska but for some reason if you legalize weed children are going to be the one who access it that why alcohol is still illegal because then uh children would would ha not be able to access or the children would be able to access alcohol i mean like it just makes no sense what they're saying the same thinking as like you know in legal states they're trying to put limits on what's already out there but we got to think about the children are you [ __ ] kidding me children will go to the store you're not allowed in the store you've got to be 21 and over so you're there and you've robbed the weed dealer and so now the weed dealer isn't necessarily going to be on the streets no more especially if you regulate your plant correctly and you make it really really easy for those growers to get licensed so suddenly they're trying to go legit because they don't want to be looking them behind them and see if everything's going to get shut down they're going to take everything they own they would prefer to be legal themselves and then again i don't know who's selling this weed to kids but i do know that it's not the licensed operators i mean when you know back in traditional days you know i don't ever recall being asked like hey uh can you prove me who you are and what state or what a idea is you know this is uh this is just dumb this is dumb and it's hurting this this this is the type of [ __ ] that hurts our society in the whole like you know i travel the bus you know to work every day when i when i come in i go through the city and i don't know if you know but seattle's a pretty big city you know and uh we have a huge homeless problem and a lot of these people freaked out like during the uh uh what was that when we had the chop and and all the maggot people were freaking out about like antifa and you know we're just uh uh un uh dystopian society well the thing is you know we have a large homeless population of people living in tents [ __ ] that i haven't seen in a long time and it has nothing to do with legalization but people point to this like acceptance of like but part of the problem is how we view mental health and drug addiction like harm reduction is 100 percent what we should be doing not incarcerating and uh putting things on prohibition like uh dr carl hart billion dollars out of the depend defense department's trillion dollar budget to help the [ __ ] homeless people why why do we do maybe it's because we like seeing homeless people so we can judge them as being bad so that we can be like you know not that guy i got some things going on uh but it's just so mean and so stupid how we do this stuff and so like you know again the ama one of the organizations that ricketts mentioned quoted a january article about a mississippi ballot initiative that said while it's possible there may be beneficial medical uses of marijuana numerous evidence-based studies demonstrate that significant deleterious effects abound and the article also notes that such measures put physicians at risk of criminal and civil liability now the ama is full of scientists and they should be better than that because they should know that the reason why numerous deleterious effects abound is because those were the only studies that got funded and they were trying to find any deleterious effect and then one of the big risk factors is the risk of criminal and civil liability that has nothing to do with the cannabis plan and everything to do with the legality and the scheduling of the cannabis plant agree yeah this type of [ __ ] until it's over so you know if if you guys have not yet i mean like you're not you can't disrespect the office but you can invoke people out of office you know you can't you can be polite but firm and then of course then if you're a trumper you can just forget that america is a thing and do whatever you want until like again you get arrested but don't recommend that you know you're not going to convince these people of this because they're already in belief of stuff that ain't real you know it is this is oh my god dude this is why i smoke some good weed like this is why you need good weeds just to put up with this [ __ ] this this idiot odyssey uh that this guy is a representative of a group of people in america and then he has a bunch of other people that agree with him that you know what studies are you guys looking at where are you why why is this such a thing for you to to deny like prohibition doesn't work right we've had how many billions devoted against uh this plan howard buffett and because warren buffett's kid is crazy and he's an anti-prohibition guy and he's got billions of dollars and so that's one of the reasons why uh macon and and uh not detroit the detroit of illinois decatur uh has had such a hard time in illinois getting more licenses and opting in to allowing cannabis businesses is that howard buffett spends all this money on propaganda and of course like the picture of mr ricketts at the podium he's at a sam podium smart approach marijuana the most ironically named anti-marijuana uh organization in the free world but and this is why we don't have nice things because these well it is not us per se but like the [ __ ] and government the people who are running the show the ones who are the authorities right like ones that are stuck right here in 1957 you know where things were easier because you didn't have to really think you could just depress people and believe in crap and then you know what didn't matter you just had to make sure that you had a good haircut and you're white especially a man and then you could just tell people facts yeah yeah make [ __ ] up [ __ ] and that's the problem like so the ama they're like a roller coaster too and i think anything that is a entity in government is a roller coaster of this opinion on cannabis like with the va you know one year it's like don't do it next year it's like okay we're gonna think about letting you guys do it so it's okay it's not a plant that's killed anybody no one's proven anything and now it's like don't do it again people it's not this conversation is so more about wellness and social justice that at the end all game everything that we preach about this is the greatest hypocrisy we got going on right now oh yeah and the hypocrisy continues because ricketts also cites the american psychiatric association a dubious association in my book if you ever see how antipsychotics work which pdf is 2019 position statement on the matter posted online uh and the document concludes with the apa does not endorse cannabis medicine the words danger or dangerous don't appear in the document however it does say in part policy and practice surrounding cannabis-derived substances should not be altered until sufficient clinical evidence supports such changes well that's effing impossible because of the way that the funding is currently set up the only funding is for finding harm there is no funding in for finding benefit because that would defeat the purpose of schedule one tac if you think about too a a psychological company they're not there to help you get better i mean like the if they were they would be promoting what would help which is treatment and and and consultation and you know they there's no magic [ __ ] pill that makes anything better like whether it be uh schizophrenia i mean it helps but things with treatment need to be done like that's this is just pure fear mongering of taking care of yourself you know the endocannabinoid system i'd imagine you know it's entwined with your nervous system your bone structure seriously throw that freaking back into the pipe of the american psychiatric association uh so this endocannabinoid system that we discovered approximately 30 years ago and i've done a lot of research on predominantly in israel where it's more lawful to actually do research that's objective as opposed to trying to find the harm why isn't that enough i mean like we know that it's a biological system in our body we know why it works we know what it does we know that it doesn't kill people now does it i'm not sitting there saying like we should give it to children no right the stuff your home it's it's that as as dr ethan russo told us and if you haven't seen that episode on cannabis legalization news smash the likes hit subscribe and then search uh ethan russo cannabis legalization news on youtube and you'll find it and he does a great job explaining that this is the chief homeostatic regulation regulation system on your body or in your body stuff doesn't usually get out of whack when you're a kid stuff starts your whack more and more as you get older more and more after you've seen enough rotations around the sun where you're going to get injured or where you're going to get old or where you're going to have pain or where you know you might have um audio audio auto immune diseases like crohn's or ibs or or lupus or or uh so many other diseases that your endocannabinoid system's out of whack on and and the only thing we clearly have is we have a governor of nebraska that's suffering from uh cannabinoid deficiency and we all are paying the price for and by we all i mean like i have to read this and get like so mad that suddenly i become cyclops without his freaking visor and then um not only that you know those poor people in nebraska that actually need access safe access to their medicine what are they doing well they've probably already moved yeah now i'm proud that i cursed not as much as i thought i was going to on this uh i mean really i was heated when i saw the topic i was like oh man oh she's gonna be effing all the time keep rolling on to the next one i'll go back to 1937. hang on [ __ ] let's cut uh okay so the next story is just as bad as the first story tennessee republican wants to permanently block recreational marijuana through state constitution in tennessee yeah and this this one even it gets worse right so representative brandon ogles of franklin tennessee received approval in the house criminal justice subcommittee for house joint resolution 140 which would amend the state constitution prohibit future general assemblies from permitting recreational drug use now the hate and stupidity does not stop there it goes on to the potential constitutional amendment would also prevent the state legislature from ever legalizing rape human trafficking or prostitution without making any another change to the founding document like how are you going to put rape and and prostitution in the same like the thinking here is not you're putting rape in par what was it prostitution yeah one of those things is consensual and then the one with the cannabis that you're putting in there there's no psychological dispute or there's no real psychological damage for adult use cannabis but anyway this is one of those things where i'm so angry and it's 420 somewhere that we can test the official position of the department or the ministry of health of japan this should make me violent so violent that maybe i'll even have more burning eyes after this 420 bumper [Applause] [Music] okay it was all a lie tell the minister japan that it'll kick in i'm sure your anger will [ __ ] well now as we continue on with this one anger is going to continue on ahead of wednesday's meeting yeah although amended the resolution he initially filed to also include the ban on legalization of recreational use of substance on the federal drug schedules list the item first only pertain to sex crimes i mean come on man do we i mean what kind of [ __ ] stupid like how are you gonna ever like first off why do you even need a bill for legal like we're gonna stop like we're gonna make sure no one ever legalizes rape like like was that ever an issue where is the legalization of rape uh lobby that's like you know what we need we need to legalize that uh rape but this is that [ __ ] we're like i'm doing a good thing here but at the same time we gotta get the we people like they're all the same people right yeah because there's there's two stops after marijuana uh the first one is human trafficking and the second one is rape you know according to the ministry of japan cannabis use makes you violent uh man like the problem the real problem with the the laws are that they're so wrong that they like we're not trying to get like censored by youtube we're trying to like say like no there's an endocannabinoid system this is why medical marijuana actually works here's how these other things work you really have nothing to fear about this plant it's terribly over regulated you guys are just causing yourself unnecessary harm because you believe in fat fantasy and lies and remember everybody in this country was [ __ ] brought up to believe that santa claus is a real goddamn thing that brings you toys in order to support your parents to be able to manipulate and control you and then we're like shocked that our leaders are still feeding us lies and garbage so they can manipulate and control us but that's the thing though man everybody's between the santa claus lies and the [ __ ] the government's here to help you lies i mean gary's been swayed government's a little kind of like a wizard like the government is basically santa claus to a certain extent especially in america shout out to rob man thanks for tuning in really appreciate it um love that show up clt be in the grommies man hell yeah and so um i had a point most mostly my point is um sometimes when i read the news out of the south or nebraska i feel like it's before we had technicolor before we had science facts or even knew what the endocannabinoid system is it's a very special time that makes me angry but this is why flower states get a bad rep this is why the flower states when everybody thinks that you're you know uh banjo uh i hear songs coming when i walk you know i mean like it's just you're being a stereotype stop being stupid stupid stop it stop stop hurting your people stop hurting america i mean essentially all gays told the committee this will ensure we never have recreational drug use in the state because it's illegal to drink i'm assuming or smoke cigarettes in tennessee this will ensure that we never have recreational drug use in the state i think it's a very much an expression of the value system we have in the south in this state again evidently you're not allowed to drink or smoke cigarettes in tennessee or maybe not even have coffee where do we draw the line on drugs because like with this unlike with coffee i don't have to filter this through water to make an extraction first off it wouldn't work if i was going to make an extra extraction from it i would do it with a more of a polar solvent you know like an alcohol and or a butter however then sure that's more of a drug coffee is more of a drug than cannabis flour cannabis flour is a plant again the perception of drug use and how we interact with drugs and how we treat things because like you're saying it's a variety of things from coffee to heroin right let's just it's everything it's sugar you know and if we can just learn the chemistry won't be a drug let's all realize how much of a drug sugar is you take the sugar cane and then you gotta process the crap out of the sugar cane so much so that you can strip out any plant material what so frickin ever and then you get what's the chemical composition i know it's carbon hydrogen oxygen and nitrogen because it's an organic molecule but what a hey if you're watching out there and you know the chemical symbol for uh sugar uh and that that that would be of course um uh sucrose not uh dextrose or or fructose uh we're gonna go with uh is glucose because glucose and fructose put together is sucrose that's sugar did you say [ __ ] those we are yes this is what happens when cannabis legalization news get enough gets onto a tangent we should have a tangent bumper but the thing is though i mean come on this is the [ __ ] with the the save the children and the recreational drugs we'll never we don't need this in our not my backyard [ __ ] children and so like if i'm gonna be giving uh their kind of bs lines i should at least look like a cat if i'm gonna say like we need to make sure we have cannabis concentration limitations for our regulated cannabis markets for the children i should look like a cat if i if i'm telling my voters my elected representatives in nebraska that the reason why medical cannabis should not come to nebraska is because it kills children i should look like a cat because you are in a freaking world of fantasy it's not real and you should be robbed of your reality if you're saying dude i you know it's just hard to see that there's so much stupid out there but at the same time i know we have a lot of good people and that's the thing like everybody's like oh this legalization is going to happen tomorrow this legalization is going to happen tomorrow and you and me and then if you're joining us on wednesday you should hit them thumbs up subscribe and then tune in on wednesday we're going to talk about tommy chong and all the weedy smokes for the past 60 years um but that's a point of it man like you know chong probably thought it was gonna be 10 years away 40 years ago i thought it was going to be five years away 10 years ago you know and and then some people think it's going to be tomorrow this year and it ain't because some people think that cannabis will kill kids and not only do they think it they have press conferences where they announce it as if it's a fact and again if it the more act or whatever happens if something happens even though uh what's the shunmu turquoise session where he talks about like it's always a priority for democrats like i'm not gonna see i'm not i will be excited we will go live the day of if something goes through a bill where they say hey like we did it to the moor act originally but i'm not holding my breath man like this is not you know we've we've but we are they've gotten everything off their plate though and so like i'm yeah i'm optimistic that the second half because now we're getting into the 420 time and so uh after wednesday we're past st patrick's day and then it's the next holiday is really easter and 4 20. and so i'm thinking that that's probably where they're going now that they've gotten the senate all of washington's gotten the 1.9 trillion dollar corona relief package uh signed sealed and delivered on to the next one and maybe some of that next one is going to be that uh cannabis package coming out of the senate you know we will be going as soon as we have details on that yeah no i just you know uh being that we're further than we were which is nice but again it's never far enough when people like lance gore hasn't seen his mom and his daughter personally in six years like how does he let the prosecutor that's wrong not even just but not just the prosecutor but the visitation visits like like he hasn't had access like so that nut job in the the buffalo guy the when they the insurgency when that guy took over that [ __ ] got a in meeting with with the news people like the following day lance hasn't seen his mom or his daughter his daughter graduated high school uh college and uh uh like brilliant kid um without her dad like prom all this [ __ ] all the life stuff like she's got a dude i mean just life like the government has taken away this man's life and not just his but many others you know women this is [ __ ] they're a plant and what does this plant do makes you better well again it it helps regulate your homeostasis levels yes and so like uh if you have things like think about anxiety or anything else or like you know pain stuff where your your central nervous system is kind of like freaking out a little bit uh that may be why your cb2 receptors are all over those types of areas in your body and then also maybe while your cb1 receptors are very very concentrated in your brain except not in your brain stem and so like you're not going to stop breathing like you can with alcohol or opium or opioids this is not an opinion this is a biological fact based on thousands of dead people tens of thousands of dead people and how many of them were dead from marijuana you know two people did get hit by a bale of it and so they were like moving a couple of bales and and oops but that was a farming accident that really wasn't but you know like you're like you're saying though like it's it's a stabilization of your body like kind of like how you have centrum for women and centered from old men for seniors right like there's skywalker you know there's the sky master sky master excuse me i mean this thing dude i really tell the difference of really good weed these are all top colas and uh i've been buying mids man right at the top oh yeah that's that's good i've been powering through in the gang oh look at hey uh slowly now now let's see if you can get the autofocus going put it up a little bit higher your eyes and it might block off your face okay uh there it is this is what we're fighting for everybody i feel like we're on a uso show but we're looking at pictures of weed right oh i mean just the fact that this people are serving time or this little amount right here not even not even a gram probably uh it would put you in trouble like in tennessee like you like as soon as you're in town you drive through the the state line you're ass puckers and you're going to be like all right if that one cop sees me because i'm too dark and decides to pull me over and happens to smell something i'm [ __ ] yeah but let's get back to this [ __ ] who's in charge of tennessee olgas is his name or olga's uh o-g-l-e-s it's uh i think it's norwegian for stupid but uh amending the state constitution is a years-long process the legislature must approve a resolution with the proposed language in two separate general assemblies hopefully one is not run by you know people who don't believe in science uh meaning it would need to be taken up by the legislatures in 2023 or 2024 session if it passes this section or session hopefully then this means this was just grandstanding on the part of the governor and the reason why you grandstand as a politician is because you're supposed to be solving problems and all the problems were caused by all the politicians before you and now you're going to be the only one that escapes this this uh causing of problems by politicians and fixes everything so uh what pardon you missed the uh the awesome statement here august also added that those long-standing southern values were eroded in virginia as a result of the recent legislation like like what's up these people with their values like there's a guy on the floor the other day that said i know that black lives matter don't like traditional family what the [ __ ] are you talking about we all have moms dads people we love like what the what kind is this [ __ ] values like we are not going to believe in science and we will oppress people is is that one of the values what are these when you say values it could be just a bouquet of freaking flowers man well what type of flowers are they daisies you know are they uh are they marigolds are they uh dandelions or you got something worthwhile for us you know like you know what are you what are you saying these values are because values could be racism you know that's the value is that the value they want is because like the values against the south it sounds like that they're really upset with because you know virginia actually legalized it sounds like the values they want are not believing in science and oppressing people because they can that sounds like a really un-american value i wouldn't be sad if he happened to walk outside and got throw punched but you know whatever no no no you're not allowed to do that he's an elected official you have to respect the office and that's why you vote him out of it because he's clearly not qualified damn right i mean he's preaching goddamn third grade like like who is your audience who what is the educational level for your constituents like i feel sometimes sad like please tell me i not all of uh what messed up state is this not all tennessee things like this i know they don't let's bring it home because uh governor olga said that if you ever want to have a true discussion about medical marijuana you have to truly solidify it we'll never have recreation the conversation will not even be had by a dozen or so conservative lawmakers in this chamber until we know without a doubt there's no recreational coming on its heels and the slippery slope is stopped period and so like um that is just a catastrophe of a statement and these catastrophes of statements are often made but rarely this terrible because first off it says if you ever want to have a true discussion about medical marijuana i don't know if this guy has the ability to have a true discussion about medical marijuana because it appears that he does not understand the endocannabinoid system otherwise he would not have this tact uh and then you have to truly solidify that we'll never have recreational god forbid anybody in tennessee would do anything they enjoy what is tennessee the home of like whiskey and nashville yeah just saying where did it hurt you where did this little flower of a plant like did it jump out and get the bad day one day i mean like what how did this thing come at you one day like you gotta stop a slippery slope because like giving people something that's an alternative to opioids alcohol cigarettes lots of other perhaps pharmaceutical drugs for sleep to anxiety what type of slippery slope are you trying to stop here the slippery slope away from being uh addicted to prescriptions and like you know not being able to get off of these prescriptions is that the slope you're trying to stop do you not want your people to be healthy well isn't also tennessee the place where uh like the oakway pandemic like was a peak once thought with like all the focus of the doctors hustling pills and on all the stuff like i believe big farmers got a big pool there like just like a florida big pole in um indiana because i mean that's where like eli lilly is but then where spies are located moderna pretty sure fives of modern are not in the south like you know but it's still it's like you got poor populations are easily manipulated you know that's that's that's what i'm saying people you are a commodity you know they your constituent is not looking to you as a somebody to want to be for your favor they're thinking you are an asset that i'm going to shovel this pill program for you you know this is ridiculous man there are websites to namaste said mel genitalia [ __ ] candies yes uh just want to give a shout out to jay phoenix for throwing us fiverr on this you know really appreciate that i'm not necessarily saying that people should find out where the governor of tennessee and or uh nebraska lives but uh if you would mail them a sack of gummy bears perhaps um you could do but you know it's not necessarily what you you may want to do however you have to realize it's at least sending a message yeah when you're talking to people that have so checked out from reality they believe that they may have lost the ability to enact sensible regulation to make the right decision when it comes to uh appropriate policy on this because they have made a moral judgment uh and that that really kind of relieves them of having to make a factual judgment well and i think we have to like say what like with mcconnell and uh uh you know their constituents re re reelected him right like the man helped push the hem thing through but again he's also a horrible human being like how do we manipulate the legislatures to benefit the the campus the cannabis policies right so i doesn't normal grade uh because the constituents what not there's a lot of grading that goes on you know by well normal's not necessarily an ngo they kind of are actually but these types of political organizations that are trying to rank uh legislatures because i just say you know look at your local areas and and and see what you can do you know it if you're not going to be the one to run against that person you can at least always support the person running against the one that's going to be in your favor with the you know what you're what you want yeah well let's move on to the next piece of crap story that's coming out of the south uh florida house committee approves thc limits for medical marijuana so the bill aims to prevent medical marijuana from being treated as a recreational drug but opponents argue there's no justification for the measure representative spencer roach likens what he's seen now in the state's medical marijuana industry to the practices that precedes the opioid crisis are you [ __ ] kidding me dude but hey this basically means that we now have a factual discrepancy with mr roach now first off he's one of the most ironically named senators in florida that senator roach is against the medical marijuana however he's starting to conflate the opioid crisis with cannabis now to this is where the slippery slope actually is to go down this means that you are not paying attention to the factual aspects of the substance and its effects on your body and and that is the dangerous slippery slope you see he's going to now stay opioid or opioids heroin those types of things and then disappear and go well that means marijuana that's right that's just factually wrong it's legally correct under uh the federal law legally that is the correct statement which is wrong it's shockingly wrong terribly wrong like hurting us wrong but that's i think part of the education right we have to teach these dumb asses that cannabis is not toxic non-toxic right all these other things are toxic like go through your liver and get flushed out and uh it hurts your body you know inevitably uh cannabis it clings it loves your little fatty cells and hangs out and things and you feel great with it like your body is not recognizing it as if it is alcohol cocaine heroin uh some other drug which is also recognized as a poison by your body uh for some reason your body is recognizing this cannabinoid as something to store in fat cells for regulation for later first like some reason yeah again it's a natural product like and i always it's like being a dead horse but scurvy we learned the hard way that if you don't get vitamin c you get scurvy you know and so if your body doesn't get thc you get [ __ ] up law enforcement [ __ ] up law enforcement you also get a whole cavalcade of uh treatments that the pharmaceutical industry is not all that great at treating for chronic conditions that are probably caused by endocannabinoid disruption not that we're allowed to study this disease or or even system uh and as a result who suffers you me the people everybody who benefits law enforcement pharmaceutical companies exactly there's so much misinformation that people are you know that's the thing about law enforcement right like i am not an acab i i like cops i i have nice things i want my my kids to be protected and stuff like that like they there's better [ __ ] and other [ __ ] to worry about and and legalization the prohibition hurts our society like like we are under trust in law enforcement that's what it does cannabis prohibition undermines trust in law enforcement it's it's you know the other day uh i was thinking uh i had uh smoked a little bit and uh uh i was on my way home and i i was right next to a cop right next to me at the light first i tensed up a little bit but then i realized there's no reason for this guy to even like suspect me or do anything like like that went away real quick opposed to 10 15 years ago or out of state anywhere out of this state my ass bucket is when i have a cop around me yeah but this guy this senator roach i'm sorry representative spencer roach i saw spencer and i thought it was senator representative spencer roach he says 15 years ago when we look at the opioid crisis that's what we're seeing this kind of doctor shopping drug seeking behavior we not only have a responsibility to act now but an opportunity to act before it's too late i would like to direct spencer roach to hash and it's 4 000 plus year history uh but uh other than that he says that this bill is going to restrict the thc levels of medical marijuana products to 10 percent for whole flour and 60 for other products while limiting patients to 1500 milligrams of thc every 35 days based on no freaking science whatsoever you know this dumb ass he doesn't even know why they have to doctor shop because most doctors are not putting out cannabis prescriptions because they put their their license at risk like this is another ridiculous argument about why we should save the children we can save ourselves from ourselves this is ridiculous again like you said hash right and then roach goes on to conflate these are apples oranges and this isn't even apples oranges this is more like apples staplers comparisons well you're not even close you know he's like roach says i mean we're talking about 10 million milligrams over a 70-day period that's 740 now 780 bottles of 24-count aspirin all right first off no second uh you have now said you're gonna have a 24-count bottle of aspirin who buys the bottle of aspirin with 24 aspirins in it what are you doing going out for a weekend you know it's worse aspirin and then so the only reason he said the 24 was so that he could multiply that number and say 780. and so this is which what i how i would look at him if i saw him i would be like you should know better you should no worse medical advice though i mean aspirin will [ __ ] kill you if you take a lot like i have yet i'm trying really hard on cannabis aspirin may cause some stomach bleeding but like it's the tylenol that can actually kill you and so tylenol can cause the liver failure okay at least he didn't give us that because like he could have said that's 780 bottles of 24 count tylenol maybe he didn't get permission from the tylenol people to use that uh [ __ ] but yeah whatever because you know this this this ban on on medical cannabis having 10 or more thc that's going to save the children right there because the children are only buying medical cannabis that's a good one too oh my god but no that's like they aren't can you regular can you tell the drug dealers that they're not allowed to grow more than 10 thc because that's how the bill should be written uh i mean the so the bill was passed through its first committee with a party-line vote but at least two republicans expressed serious concerns with the thc cap saying it sounded too close to lawmakers playing doctor thank god at least somebody spoke some reasonableness is that lawmakers playing doctor when it comes to a woman's body we want lawmakers playing doctor when it comes to our body and what we put into it what is a drug how i can have a drug all those types of things but i'm wondering if it's the sun that does this to these people because you know california is starting to turn into florida because uh feinstein says should marijuana legalization limit thc probably not but it's happening supposedly senator dianne feinstein yeah and senator john corn of texas who jointly chaired the senate caucus on international narcotics control released a report in which they proposed various regulations of legal cannabis protect public health and safety oh i'm glad there's a federal police power now it seems like but among the call for a national institute of health remember that one institute that like says cannabis is heroin that one to intensify its research on short and long-term impacts associated with high potency cannabis and make a recommendation jointly with the food and drug administration as to whether states should cap the potency of products that may be sold again 15 legal federal patients at one time but their stock was capped at 3.5 percent it's just that it still ignores the fact that hash has existed for thousands of years and keefe has existed for thousands of years i put some uh some keef on my my pipe earlier when it was 420 somewhere and um i'm fine again like you can't you can't get any more concentrated than that when you're taking the trichomes not nor should you nor are you trying to like sit there and get at the ever clear like i don't want necessarily cannabis distillate because that cannabis distillates not gonna have the the entourage profile that i'm going for you know it's gonna have too much of the thc and not enough of the terpene profiles or maybe some cbd or some other lesser lesser cannabinoids in there to kind of smoothen out the experience public health and safety i mean i'm tired of being protected for myself i am tired of this [ __ ] like arbitrary public health and safety i get coronavirus that's affecting the public health you know that's stuff can go from one person to another i'm going to have to pass this this chillin to somebody else and i'm not doing that much right now because coronavirus but um where is the public health and safety risk i i can see benefits like i'm i'm getting the benefits now it's one of the nice things about living in illinois no it's the the law is the public safety and health issue right like the the law the fact that uh uh we are incarcerating kids and we are going after people that that's the public self inhibit and then access access the safe access that poor kid and then there's there's more uh data that comes out and who's the people that are getting arrested for cannabis the black and brown kids so think about them think about all the dangerous deleterious impacts that the legality of this plant is putting on them when they get caught with it especially when they're young for the rest of their lives all right and they still do it and not only they still do it they have schmucks that are running states in this country that are saying that we're going to stop it that it kills kids in in the states that have re-uh formed their prohibition their their you know legalized it you know their enforcement therefore the better every single even our nation's capital that you know the the law enforcement and the relationships are always for the better i haven't heard of any like oh now the raids have increased because more people are walking around like zombies through the city or attacking dominoes you know where's the freaking horror stories right you know it's just the horror stories are like children are getting new parks and uh school built in colorado right uh i don't have that that newspaper article on me anymore but our schools in peoria illinois got six hundred thousand dollars from the taxes nice sweet you know we didn't have that before that's going to help those children oh and and there's fewer people selling cannabis on the street because uh you can go buy it uh now which is nice this is like capping the vitamins on tomatoes you know what i mean it's like you can only have so much health right yes think about that like if they said like oh my gosh you have too much uh tea no not thc you have too much vitamin c in this orange send it back pack this orange based on its vitamin c level you're too healthy we can't have that and you know and here's here's the other thing here right so we got florida we got california we got these jackasses in the the committee that are all talking about limiting and then we have uh virginia who's thinking hey we should probably speed this thing up you know what we should do we should actually have because this has been a very somber episode of cannabis legalization news and there's so many people hanging out so thanks so much and you know give us some thumbs ups and share this with people and be like you guys should check these people out because we're trying to legalize the plan but uh yeah some good news out of virginia governor northam considers speeding up legalization of marijuana in virginia you think it was social justice or do you think i could find a filter for slow motion though because if there ever is a a need for a slow motion filter it would be the legalization of virginia which does not go into effect until 2024. yeah lawmakers are working with governor ralph northern's office to consider speeding up the legalization of marijuana by years possibly by making possession legal as soon as july 1st instead of january 1st 2024 holy crap that's fast yeah 2024 they're going to speed it up and then it's going to be in 2021 i think they're trying to uh make the uh possession legal date as july 1st of this year so don't forget if you're in virginia don't don't be in the slow motion go call your elected officials at the state level both chambers because you're not in weirdo nebraska that only has the unicameral chamber chamber uh and tell them that they need to speed it up i mean they probably saw like washington state survived with the pandemic uh the second largest crop you know for the uh revenue uh you guys i think brought in like 10 100 million so far or some [ __ ] like there's a re almost a billion in sales but then like the taxes are different it was a combined uh cannabis sales for medical and also adult use but there was a lot they like they only anticipated their r3 program getting about 20 million dollars and it actually got like 31. and so it was over it was overestimate so like we we sold a lot but you know what and also if you think about it too i'm thinking okay there's obviously the one metric of the actual revenue that's brought in but what about like also the this is something that can never be figured out because no cop ever like clocked this in but the amount of time devoted to arresting people like for cannabis like for how much time has been saved and money and uh uh in all our legal states like how much uh focus now goes on to real crime you know this that's got to be a huge metric yeah but that's the thing like it's not a real crime it's not it's it's it's not a crime i mean that's the thing it's anything cannabis related is not a crime in my world like that's why the activism has always been easy for me like i understand i understand criminalizing it while you're you're operating a motor vehicle i understand that uh and that's a regulation so like if they want to make that a crime fine but uh if they want to make a crime for you to have a joint while you're sitting on the couch watching netflix no that's not a crime well and you know i can't wait to when we talk to tommy chong because one of my favorite uh examples of like large amounts of personal possessions is a story by him where when he had rated for his bong store uh you know the dea were going through all [ __ ] and found pounds of marijuana in his cupboard and they're like you got what why he's all i don't know you have a pound of sugar at your house what what you know what i'm saying like yeah i mean like that's how it used to be when uh when it was medical here like uh i could afford to have a lot all the time right i used to buy by the ounce and it would it was good and it was large because there was a fair market and all blah blah blah but and then that's what this this this budco stuff because they're from the old medical times and it reminds me i'm like oh man i forgot what good we was like like really good weed that was always in my possession uh i mean i i got i i'm still smoking better than what most people are on any other day because good mids out here are great but you guys have been like you have the industry and the stuff and you have enough growers and operators that you can have a wide assortment of products so that the wide assortment of people that are purchasing the products can find what's right for them which is fantastic and then of course you always should have that type of top shelf product that's out there where you can have like the trophy cuts and then the best uh you know the stuff that was you know hand trimmed taken care of completely through the supply chain uh and you have a great chain of custody on it so the products like good weed that's been cured right tastes way better like way better yeah and it hits like the lungs it just it's breathing oxygen to me you know like some plant you can tell like it wasn't purged right and then but the good one some plants you can't purge that well because like if you're trying to grow in water uh or aeroponics it's more difficult to flush your plants now if you're growing a soil based like i'm kind of biased towards soil based growing because i like weed that tastes good and so if you want to make weed that tastes good show me weed that tastes good that wasn't grown in soil yeah and i think you have a great point with the uh we have such a variety of growers and stuff that you can find that one grower with a great price point in the the quality that you like and accept you know that and that's the thing like i've always thought like with legalization just make it legal and now for the market you have to require testing right and you know we all know like pesticides are bad and also other [ __ ] like i would rather have an organic like you know bugs being used for uh insecticides and all whatnot but the thing is if you you just get it tested and put it out there people will buy shitty weed shitty whatever quality product because people smoke cigarettes good things they're gonna look at the price and look at the thc yeah for the most part end of list now like i'm not gonna do that like i'm gonna like preferably i'm not gonna see a list of its thc or or even it's terp profile and i'm gonna i like to buy like that's 31 flavors you know it'd be great if you could taste them as well not necessarily can but i like to buy like you know where you get to see it and maybe smell it and so you can see it in the jar and be like man what is that one right there and then they'll tell you and you'll be like oh i haven't heard of that genetic can i can i give that a smell holy crap what the heck is the terp profile on that and then that's how i will get stuff and i'll find out it was only like 17 thc but it was an amazing experience that was a point break strength it was a good strength purpley and well flavored well grown well cured you know it was that's that's what buying weed should be where you can have this experience of like um smelling it asking like what you're trying to go for like why why are you using this cannabis like what's your activity for this because like that's the thing you know you can have cannabis for the activity you just don't have regular wheat i mean that was like 20 years ago you just have regular wheat but now you have weed for a particular activity for a particular flavor for a particular experience no no totally i mean that's the great thing about canvas but like and also uh like you're saying how it just uh the the profiles um and you know with that meme that i shared where the winky face hemp is not marijuana right so like i don't know if you saw the the the the most recent chronic taste test i did with josh right right i smoked my first hemp uh delta eight one and i felt really light-headed and really good like a good yeah chill buy which you know you would expect from cannabis right because it's not about the tc it's about the cannabinoids and the terpenes and because right after that we smoked some flour and that was the most horrible flour i ever had which i was kind of sad about like i never met a plant that i didn't like and it tasted like smoking a seed and like how is the hemp better than the the marijuana technically but in the end they're all cannabis and and and you know it was a great experience you're gonna have some really well-grown hemp flour there's some good there's some excellent growers and there's some excellent cure in so there's some great stuff and then they're spinning this d8 from like a lot of the uh um stock what do they call that biomass that was extracted by the cb for the cbd and then the leaders of cbd aren't moving so they turn it into a delta eight they spray the the tasty flowers and so those tasty flowers that might have been moving for like four hundred dollars a pound are now moving substantially higher than that and then not only that now you have delta eight flour which means you don't have to worry about these vape cartridges bands people can have an entourage effect with it and delta eight is not delta nine and i mean it's not you try it uh and you'll see it's just a more chill uh kind of an experience and so that you're gonna be blending it with a cbd flower that's uh i should buy some delta eight flour actually actually uh some of my clients should mail me some delta flour yeah i mean you know it doesn't have the same aromas and everything as as as weed but they're cousins and they're exactly the same plant they say they're exactly the same plant it's just that they're just different types of of the same plant and so like you would have like a class one which would be a thc cultivar and then you'd have a class three which would be your cbd cultivar and then there's even class fours now and there's probably more classes depending on the other lesser cannabinoids that they find out but you know hey that's one of the cool things that we're going to see here next year the 2022 farm bill i wonder what they're going to define hemp as in the future i don't know it's exciting times man i think this whole year this whole administration's going to be exciting here for everything yeah yeah and we just have to keep up the fight to uh educate the people that are running uh the the states where it's i mean it just sounds like it really disconnected i mean it sounds just completely cut off from reality when i hear these types of things coming out of nebraska or tennessee or florida like they don't even know what they're talking about disconnected yeah well it's the same people yelling about regular election so so they don't know what we're talking about hey uh if you guys want to give us some viewer mail that would be awesome and at the end of the show we like to go over some viewer mail questions so drop us a comment not necessarily in the live comments because there's like four million of those but then if you drop us a regular comment on a question or you can go to our uh community page and drop us a question there i might actually be able to oh there it is you can go to cannabis industry lawyer on instagram and drop us a question there or follow mickey on facebook actually facebook.com backslash freethc for all of miggy's uh memes the the dank cannabis memes it's it's two forms of dank memes it's dank dank memes on facebook that's sticky icky that's sticky me yeah yeah so male 1 free the plant said what strains are on your mount rushmore of wheat mine are blue dream grape vape green crap basically anything high in piney thank you for the show that one's top like you know that one is tough because uh there's florida purple sometimes branded as miami punch by revolution genetics uh that one is one of my favs um and then i i do really like revolution's geneticist i like point break as well uh and then i'm a sucker for a good og kush love those ones then um that's really it i mean that's those are the things that i really gravitate toward and then whatever else i might be growing you know yeah i hope to get some growth going on i need some seeds anybody um but yeah i like the uh i got familiar with blue dream during the medical times out here in washington like that was the one plant i could smoke and be like all right this blue dream because you know a lot of people have that that bud but i don't trust flavors and whatnot but that's the one that too hit me home as well as a dutch treat i really enjoy a good touch treat yeah i think i've had a dutch treat i mean i haven't had a blue dream in a while like i i just there was so much of it going around like 10 years ago and it's yeah don't get me wrong and i like blueberry i like blueberry muffins i like purple weed uh but that berry taste uh of the blue variety is just so like old school that now they have all these new flavors and i'm not talking like cereal milk or like you know peanut butter or anything like that with the chocolates not but uh the fruitiness of the flavors and and the the flavor effects that they have on it and like the colors and all these other things but man i just got like some really cool ak-47 that was like crossed up with something and that stuff just is is like a blast from the past like a really refreshing one like a fairly skunky um loud kind of old-school varietal yeah well and then this skymaster i'm smoking right now is pretty [ __ ] awesome yup what's oh i don't know uh maybe do some homework on that one um yeah they're gonna go on the back of the thing now that's the thing like there's so many hybrids and crosses that are out there it's kind of nice to know like where they came from but then you just go to the philos galaxy and spend like an hour there well again i'm just more about the farms and the growers like when i reached out to uh washington buck i reached out to three of my favorite growers uh washington but code trailblazing and uh mad mark and uh because i'm trying to put us me in a position where you know when you do a review you don't want to be obligated to anything cannabis related right so i'm trying to just promote the good we the good stuff you know without like making that my have to be part of my deal you know what i mean i don't know that helps watch any youtube channel progression as as they get more subscribers they sell out so well that you don't even notice and eventually every video is brought to you by squarespace sponsors squarespace totally is the best easiest way to make a website hey what you're searching for use uh nordvpn don't let them know where you're at oh my gosh do you think we get a vpn server or do you think that the the cat filter is just going to be off-putting they're like well i thought maybe we should sponsor that one uh podcast about cannabis policy but then i saw that that lawyer was a cat on there um we're a family company family like cats i am not above saying butt up bum bum at the end of this [ __ ] show though i'm just saying going right now i wish was not a sponsor but only because i i i don't need a picture you're a vegan i feel you i'll take one for the team well that's gonna do it for cannabis legalization news thanks for tuning in everyone before we go who was it jay phoenix threw us five bucks thanks i think twice twice ten bucks last last month we made like 100 plus for canada's prisoners uh once in half we get it go straight to cannabis prisoners pockets in the commissary so thank you guys so much and thanks for tuning in make sure you like subscribe to keep up with all cannabis legalization news we'll see you on wednesday for tommy chomp it's going to be dope [Music] later [Music] you", "ndo8b3Aa4NE": "this florida NJ 420 here and today was the soft opening of the Liberty Health Sciences dispensary in Panama City so I've got some stuff to open up for you here today I was pretty darn excited this is the first dispensary we have in Panama City where you can buy a whole loose flower instead of you know just pre-rolls you can get free rolls at cetera but now Liberty Health we have flower before I start opening stuff up I just got to say that they are absolutely slammed down there I was there for over two hours today waiting and their label printing machine broke so it took even longer than I should have but anyway let's get some stuff open here I went ahead and took my name off over this time because you know I figure that was a good idea in this room we've got CBN capsules from Mary's medicinals CBN is really effective for sleep but I've never had it by itself in a purified form so I really wanted to try this these are five milligram capsules and there's ten of them in each jar it was 30 bucks for the jar and since it was my first time order I got $75 off 150 dollars spent and I bought five beans so this is where all my discount when it was into these five CBN jars of Siegen capsules we got some packet answer to a patient information about Mary's medicinal I guess oh and these bags by the way are a lot easier than the other dispensaries because they have this big old zipper it works really well I like this a lot I can reuse this bag the other ones are really breakable you can't really reuse them very easily so here we have normally it'd be 150 bucks I'm CG in um but it was my first time discount so I got all five for $75 now got a bunch of information here I also got an information card water discount so I'll show you that after we open this second bag of the order we got oh oh it's my favorite flower let's see what I [Music] was at my limit unfortunately all I could get today was um four of these eight but let me just tell you if I had been able to I probably will I even tried to buy an ounce cuz she's at first they thought that I had my full recommendation available still and I knew I didn't so I was like okay I want an ounce then and they once they realized that I didn't they put it down to a half ounce you know cuz that was all I had but I would've bought more for sure because this is 26.3% THC which is pretty darn nice I'm not gonna open my open them up and smell them for you on this video you have to check out my open and toke video of this stuff but I will do another review of these CBM capsules after I've used em I'm gonna probably try my first one tonight and I'll let you know how it goes let's take a look at the discounts here are the discounts for Liberty Hill Sciences so just so you know they have discontinued any discounts on flower so this will only apply to your anything else other than flower now they do have a 10% store wide discount going on for the grand opening but for that to beat your first time discount you would have to spend 750 bucks you know or something like that 7 or 51 bucks I guess to to beat the discount of the first time so and they told me that I cannot save my first time discount until next time so it was you know every in every way it was better I had to use it on the back of this they have their loyalty program I'm not sure if that's let's see how's it compared to the other ones yeah not quite as good I don't think I think true leaves is a little bit better but I'm glad to have something looks like they have a birthday bonus compassionate pricing if you're on any aid programs first-time discount is what I got first responders and veterans get 25% so the 10% storewide discount is for the soft opening I'm not sure about the grand opening I'll have to ask I'm definitely gonna try to get around there for that all they had was super a 5 I didn't even tell you it's super eighty-five hybrid flower comets they said it's a sativa dominant hybrid it's a classic strain too but that's the only strain they had today I'm hoping for their grand opening that they will have a lot bigger variety and that's what they said when I asked the lady she said that they should have a lot more variety and that they would also have giveaways like door prizes and stuff like that as well as reps on hand pretty knowledgeable reps from the company to explain you know pretty much whatever you want to know so yeah it was a pretty interesting experience you you go into the first room and there's a bunch of people waiting and basically they give you a number and I went in I was number 62 I took probably two and a half hours maybe two hours 45 minutes I'm not even sure it would have probably only been about an hour and a half to an hour and 45 minutes except their label printer broke so we were sitting there for a while spinning our wheels while they you know the state of Florida has very strict laws about labeling and you know I'm sure they don't want to go to jail because they didn't put a label on something but now I have gotten a label this thing for truely before but not like I'm gonna call the police over it right it's not that huge of a deal with me but there we go I'm going to you've got to check out the open and toke on this I'm gonna vape it in my new bag vape it's not really a new bait it's my balanced tara but i have converted it into a bag vape i've got a tutorial video up that shows you how to do that if you want to try it out yourself but i'm gonna get some pretty thick clouds off of this stuff pretty much guarantee it because 26.3% they can't fudge it too hard right it's at least 20 I would hope I mean you know the testing isn't 100% accurate but it's a good indication I think usually I thought I'd show you some of the materials they have when you go in you're presented with product menus to basically go over while you're waiting and that's a good idea once you're there you should if you don't know what you want start looking at these because it's a long way and every moment adds up right and you know every person who goes back there and doesn't know what they want it's gonna take that much longer I wanted the headband distill it syringe but they only had it in packs Foggs which is super expensive compared to the syringe so I didn't get it but that is high on my list of things I want to try I've never had a headband for so that's for their concentrates as far as I know they do not have solid concentrates they only have the oil concentrates here I'm you might need to put it up closer this is their mary medicinals menu Mary's medicinals menu and this is where the CBN capsules come from right here you can see it it's got ten five milligram CBN capsules in it I got patches mussel fries all kinds of stuff packs pods what do we have here product menu for their oral solutions oral capsules vaporizer units concentrates and these are syringes right here apparently the way it works is this is the base price if you get it without a profile added to it a terpene profile and if you want a terpene profile added to it it would be not $80 for the headband for instance so it's like a $5 up charge for the strain-specific terpenes this is just a bunch of warnings about marijuana like why do we need warnings for marijuana I don't know but yeah so tune in next time and I will vape this stuff up have a good one", "FcEsOSekSkE": "[Music] today's marijuana is not Woodstock weeds [Music] it's not even Cypress Hill weed that was in the 90s in case you were wondering decades of plant breeding for high THC content mean that some strains are more than five times stronger than in the 1970s to understand why that's important let's look at what we does to your brain this is drugs this is your brain on drugs but instead of frying pans let's use neuroscience simply put cannabis contains cannabinoids about 85 of them many users may have heard of the big one THC or Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol it's the compound that produces the high and it does that by binding to receptors in your brain and interfering with how your brains nerve cells work users feel buzzed because there are high concentrations of these receptors in the areas of the brain responsible for memory coordination movement and pleasure the result suddenly the world seems a little different reaction time is slower judgment is impaired and while some find this experience pleasurable others have reported severe effects like increased heart rate anxiety and paranoia and some studies say exposure to THC as a teen may even increase your risk of developing schizophrenia that brings us to pots lesser-known cannabinoid cannabidiol or CBD it doesn't have the same street cred as THC likely because it doesn't get you stoned some research suggests CBD helps tone down th C's extreme effects like anxiety or paranoia by minimizing its effect on certain receptors researchers are even looking into using CBD as a possible treatment for schizophrenia we tested 12 popular strains from dispensaries in Toronto and found weed that had no CBD at all that's because when you crossbreed weed to increase THC the levels of CBD can drop is it worth freaking out about now maybe THC potent strains can hit inexperienced users pretty hard in Colorado weed related hospitalizations quadrupled after the state greenlit retail pot sales that's for Canada perhaps one day soon you'll see labels like what we have on an alcohol bottle but for THC and CBD content levels let us know what you think in the comments below you", "BdRgA7K4DcE": "benefits and harms in medical marijuana can be debated but more states are legalizing pot even for recreational use a new evaluation of marijuana's risks is overdue that's the topic of this week's healthcare triage [Music] last year the National Academies of Sciences medicine and engineering released a comprehensive report on cannabis use at almost 400 pages long it reviewed both potential benefits and harms we've talked about benefits before let's focus on the harms cancer the greatest concern with tobacco smoking is cancer so it's reasonable to start there with pot smoking a 2005 systematic review in the International Journal of cancer pooled the results of six case control studies no association was found between smoking marijuana and lung cancer another 2015 systematic review pooled nine case control studies and could find no link to header neck cancers another meta-analysis of three case control studies of testicular cancer found a statistically significant link between heavier pot smoking and one type of testicular cancer but this evidence was judged to be limited because of limitations and the research all of which was from the 1990s there's no evidence or not enough to say of the link between pot use and esophageal cancer prostate cancer cervical cancer non-hodgkins lymphoma penile cancer or bladder cancer there's almost no evidence or not enough to say that pot has any effect on sperm or eggs that could increase the risk of cancer and any children of pot smokers using marijuana while pregnant does pose other risks as we'll discuss in a few minutes heart disease another major risk with cigarettes heart disease isn't clearly seen with pot smoking only two studies quantified the risk between marijuana use and heart attacks one found no relationship at all and the other found that pot smoking may be a trigger for a heart attack in the hour after smoking but this finding was based on nine patients and may not be generalizable lung function it also makes sense to think about the risk of respiratory disease in the short-term after smoking pot a 2007 systematic review found lung function actually improved but these benefits were completely overtaken by evidence that lung function may degrade with chronic use lung function however is a laboratory measure and not necessarily a clinical outcome and what we really care about is lung disease once you control for tobacco use the links between marijuana and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease appear minimal almost no evidence is available to link pot used to asthma impaired driving driving while impaired is a major cause of injury and death in the United States six systematic reviews were considered a fair or good quality by the National Academies and the most recent one pulled three of the others it contained evidence from 21 studies in 13 countries representing almost 240,000 participants for people who reported marijuana use or had THC detected through testing the odds of being involved in a motor vehicle accident increased by twenty to thirty percent to study them this is of course a relative increase and shouldn't be confused with the overall percentage of getting in a car accident which is much smaller regardless driving while impaired is a terrible idea although we have good tests to determine two people are under the influence of alcohol no such tests are currently available for marijuana making enforcement more difficult we did a whole episode on pregnancy effects babies born to women who smoke pot during pregnancy are more likely to be underweight delivered premature and admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit according to a 2016 systematic review but there were no links seen for changes in birth lengths head circumference or congenital malformations there's limited evidence for pregnancy complications for mothers and there's not enough evidence to come in on much else about babies and their outcomes memory and concentration there's moderate evidence from many studies that learning memory and attention can be impaired in the 24 hours after marijuana use there's limited evidence however that this translates into worse outcomes in academic achievement employment income or social functioning or that these effects linger after the pots worn off mental health the possible relationship between marijuana use and mental health is complicated the most recent meta-analysis found that there's a significant connection between heavy marijuana use and a diagnosis of psychosis specifically schizophrenia this mirrored the findings of previous reviews that sought to cover only high quality studies another systematic review highlighted a potentially small but statistically significant link between marijuana use in the development of bipolar disorder heavy users of pot are also more likely to say they have suicidal thoughts what makes this complicated is that it's hard to establish the arrow of causality are people who smoke pot more likely to develop mental health problems or people with mental health problems more likely to smoke pot there's a similar issue when talking about the relationship between using pot and other substances so I'm able see marijuana as a gateway drug leading to other substance user abuse but others and a lot of research see this only as a correlation in which people who are likely to use or abuse substances are more likely to use pot as well secondhand smoke has states legalize the drug for general use more cannabis users feel freed from secrecy they smoke more in public raising worries about secondhand smoke a two-year old study made news recently by arguing that one minute of exposure to pot smoke impaired how vessels responded to blood flow for at least 90 minutes a greater impairment than seen from tobacco this was a study in rats though not of humans out in the world as for the risk of a contact eye the amount of THC detectable in secondhand smoke is negligible almost everyone agrees that children should not use pot but concerns are legitimately raised about whether children might have increased exposure or access after legalization although this issue has not been studied widely it's possible that pot the THC and the metabolites from smoke could have an effect in the developing brains of children these concerns are more applicable to adolescents who use pot regularly however not the accidental ingestion reported in the news once in a while new questions almost all the harms the medical literature focuses on involves smoked cannabis we know little to nothing about edibles and other means of administration nor do we have any consistent manner of measuring the level of exposure bottom line you gotta weigh the pros and cons many of the harms we've discussed are statistically significant and yet they're of questionable significance almost all the increased risks are relative risks the absolute or overall risks are often quite low we haven't focused on the potential benefits especially medical ones here but many people use pot even rationally for benefits they perceive to be greater than the harms we've listed we unquestionably need more research and more evidence of harms may emerge but it's important to note that the harms we know about now are practically nil compared to that of many other drugs and that marijuana's effects are clearly less harmful than those associated with tobacco or alcohol abuse people who choose to use marijuana now that it's easier to do so legally will need to weigh the pros and cons for themselves

[Music]", "DdmnXKAuEXc": "[Music] hello and welcome back to the cannabis Somali I'm your host Andrew Friedman thanks for joining me for another episode of cannabis edible reviews I'm really excited to review this product today as it's the first packaged beverage on market in Canada infused with cannabis it happens to be this wonderful houndstooth soda from tweed now the information that I could find out about houndstooth was that in is a sativa dominant hybrid and it's mercy and dominant that's about all they give away for you on the internet about houndstooth and this is houndstooth and soda so what they did it is just soda soda water and then the houndstooth distillate they took the distillate and they nano emulsified it into the beverage so basically through a process of sonication you nano emulsify these particles make them very small so they so that the oil can go into the water and you can have a good emulsified beverage oh is a problem if you've ever tried making canvas elbows at home is getting everything to fuse together especially when using dis lid again because it's not the easiest thing to do to mix oil and water so how to use them soda water sativa canvas abused carbonated beverage per serving we only have two milligrams so a very small amount you'll see on the top it does have a childproof seal which is very interesting that there's this childproof seal and how much you'll have to do to actually get into that we'll go through that later and then Duty seal so a lot more than what would be on a can of beer with two milligrams very very little amount of cannabis actually in here I did read some reports of the Nano emulsification does help it work through your body and it be processed but again two milligrams very very little if you're from used to having edibles in a traditional market this is barely anything if you were to buy a 15 percent THC cannabis one gram of that cannabis will contain 150 milligrams so really very very small amount so 355 milk an and actually the most interesting thing I found when I was looking at this was the fact that the equivalency rating of this one can with two milligrams of cannabis in it is actually equivalent to 5.1 grams of Candice so you're only allowed to purchase 30 grams of cannabis so this would actually you can't even purchase a six-pack because it's five point one not just five so you can only buy five of these sodas which is the ten milligram limit to even have you know what one edible would be so if you're used to buying a tincture or a capsule from the dispensary that contain ten milligrams plus per dose this is very very minimal and I think that's again very very weird that you could that it's the equivalent of 5.1 grams of dried canvas if you've watched some of the other edible review videos I've been very confused on how that equivalency rating adds up and I think they're actually taking the weight of the product that contains the infusion and making that equivalent one interesting thing there is absolutely zero fat zero sugars there's only three calories in a can so that's pretty awesome I guess if you're on a diet is just soda water this lot one nine zero zero zero two three five four eight and it was packaged on December 20 19 December 11 2019 so this is they just got to market in Alberta I got Nirvana canvassed to set one aside show it to Nirvana cannabis in Calgary Alberta thanks so much but this was packaged you know four and a half months ago it's April 3rd today so on that it just got to market yet it's been ready waiting in a warehouse for four months so let's try and dig into a childproof can and see what we can do there I think it'll push it in and then pop it out rub Lee yep there we go and that's our can and let's crack it open next always love that sound reminiscent of the cannabis sommelier so what I thought I should do is actually taste this out of the can and out of a standard wine tasting glass just to let you know what I think of the beverage so on first impression there's a little bit of chalk cinnamon actually coming out of the can very light a rope floral aroma on the palate it has it does have a taste of canvas which is very interesting for only having two milligrams in it for it to have that bit a taste of cannabis is interesting but on the front it has like a banana banana peel a white floral characteristic that's you know relative to a dried carnation there's this chalked cinnamon on my palate and then a slight hint of cannabis fresh like a cannabis garden so it is a more complex beverage than I thought it was going to be just being houndstooth and soda I thought it was gonna be really innocent and not have much going on there's carbonated water distilled cannabis terpene blend ah there it is there it is so this has terpenes in it mmm and so that one resonating on my palate is definitely better off lean beta-carotene how have you said it tastes exactly like the smell of my true terpenes examples if you need some great terpenes to study from true terpenes is a great source but yeah I could definitely taste the added botanical terpenes and they're still sitting on my palate if you've ever cocktailed with terpenes before um a little go is a very very long way vegetable glycerin monoglyceride soy lecithin sucrose cannabis distillate cannabis terpenes calcium disowned mine EDTA potassium citrate natural flavour contains soy so they did crank it up a little bit with lawless terpenes but again pretty you know pleasantly surprised to be very honest so that's our glass there oh yeah and when you put it into this glass it's a lot of banana banana peel banana Rhine tomato leave tomato stem blackberry leaf no not blackberry leaf but blackberry stem you can even get some like almost tropical coconut suntan lotion out of it on the palate of the glass obviously just a little bit more of that banana flavor banana peel banana rime very little white flower bigger off lean it's not not enjoyable um it's actually way better than I expected it to be I thought it was gonna taste like really bland soda water and not have much going on and it's it's refreshing and enjoyable um definitely a wonderful cocktail ingredient because it does have these nice botanical flavors to it has those herbal notes that banana esque things that I would imagine with this are maybe like you know you can obviously do any kind of gin and soda that you'd like you could turn this into a vodka cranberry soda but I think this would actually be really really refreshing with either some looks are no bitter Bianco or just some Campari a nice bitter aperitif Oh an ounce and a half and there would really crank this up I don't know if 2 milligrams is gonna do anything for me for those of you that are watching the channel and that haven't watched any of my other reviews I never comment on the effect because my tolerance is very different I don't find it that it's my position to comment on effect for you but just to arm you with as much product knowledge on the quality of the product that I can't before you purchase and you can be your own judge on how two milligrams will affect you I'm so final final thoughts the smell you know if you smelt it for long enough I could see it being off-putting eventually if this was a wine it has some nice aromas but it's not a wine it's a soda do I think something like the tweeds how tooth and soda could ever replace beer not a chance but it's definitely a great cocktail mixer I'm sure Health Canada wouldn't like me saying that but I think it is a good cocktail mixer especially if you're not a good cocktail artists and you haven't figured out at a cocktail with cannabis if you'd like to learn you can check out the card here and check out that playlist um yeah not gonna replace it beer easy drinking beverage I would definitely get tired of smelling it but if I was drinking out of a can you know you could you could crush it you could keep up you could be in the same social atmosphere if you're going for that California sober life and you're not drinking it all but you're looking at cannabis as an alternative and toxicant this is a great place to start especially if you're a beginner with the two milligrams I look forward to having more potent sodas on the market as far as the rating for this goes you know it's a simple soda there's very low milligrams I should mention that it was four dollars and fifty cents um so my final thoughts hmm clear smells pretty nice flavor I like how they played the terpenes I'm gonna give the beverage 7.5 out of 10 it was quite good I like the nano multiplication I'd like more cannabis in it I'd like less of the kind of weird cannabis taste I like the finish I liked most of what was going on improvements would be for me if I could have alcohol in the camp that would be great other improvements for me would be a higher milligram dosage but the reality is this is the very first package carbonated you know single serve canvas infused beverage on market in Canada so a great place to start and I'm really happy that I got to review it like this and tell you all of my thoughts so I hope you make sure to LIKE comment share and subscribe if you've tried the houndstooth soda comment below let me know what you thought let me know if my tasting notes were on point with which you thought it tasted like and let's have a conversation thank you so much for watching again I hope you make sure to like comment share and subscribe until next week

So what I want to start off talking about is live resin and why\nlive resin is so relevant in the market and why you guys hear this this term\nbeing thrown around rather commonly. So live resin, the entire process really,\ntakes into account harvesting the plant while it's still technically \"alive\". So\nyou're harvesting the plant, you're not drying the plant, and what you're\nactually doing is taking those flowers and putting them into a vacuum type food\nsaver device and freezing them right away. So you can imagine like harvesting\nfresh blueberries or strawberries obviously you want to pick at the peak\nof ripeness, so that you have the maximum amount of terpenes, the maximum amount of smell, flavor and all the positive attributes of that plant. And you're\nactually freezing that in time by putting it into a freezer once you put\nit into the vacuum bag. Now it's very common for some people to deep freeze\nthat could be all the way down to -40C or -80C. I would say most commonly\nit's somewhere between -10C and -40C, so once we have this\nmaterial harvested and we have it frozen in vacuum bags - ultimately what we're\ngoing to do is we're going to extract it and we're going to extract it with\nhydrocarbons. The reason that we use hydrocarbons is because it's a very\ngentle process. The process of using hydrocarbons will actually take those\ncannabinoids and those terpenes out without disturbing a lot of the other\nplant-based matrices that are in there, and our result ultimately is a extract\nthat is very, very close to the native plant. So when you smell the extract of\nthe plant that we've extracted via a live resin process what will happen is\nyou'll actually smell the original orientation of that plant, it you'll have\nthose original flavors and they'll be extremely robust, extremely profound in\nthe way that you're actually smelling and almost tasting it when you consume\nthe product. Now the best analogy is if we keep that\nfreshness preserved we eliminate the oxidation, the degradation, and all the\nthings that can kind of take that \"fresh fruit\" so to speak or that \"fresh cannabis\"\nand turn it into rotten cannabis so to speak or rotten fruit. And that's\noxidation, that's degradation from the environment that could be disruption or\ndegradation from high temperature solvents. So with live resin were always\nfocused on preserving that natural state of the plant. We're focused on freezing\nthat biomass right away, and we're focused on ultimately extracting it at\nvery cold temperatures to retain our terpenes, to extract the cannabinoids in\na very gentle fashion, and ultimately to have a highly, highly desired end product\nthat's artisanal and a vast majority of consumers enjoy in terms of theirs their\nsatisfaction of consumption as well as their ability to just actually taste and\nsmell the product once it's been on the shelf for a while. So that's just an\noverview on live resin and the next thing I'd really like to talk about and\ngive you guys an overview on is shatter. So you may have seen shatter in the\nretail dispensaries and things like that and ultimately with shatter we're trying\nto get that end product from a sort of a plant-based entrapment of those\ncannabinoids and those terpenes to a glass-like finish. So it's very common at\nroom temperature for shatter you hit it and it'll shatter almost like a piece of\nglass. To get that consistency there's certain aspects of extraction, certain\nthings that you want to deal with. Shatter first and foremost is always\nmade with hydrocarbon, and the preparation of the biomass is almost\nalways under every circumstance dried very, very, very, very well almost to a\nfive percent or lower humidity. We want to avoid a lot of that water that would\nbe pulled out with the solvent, and we ultimately want to extract that product\nat a cold temperature in order to avoid a lot of the lipids and fat profiles\nthat you might create by extracting with a warmer temperature solvent. Hydrocarbon is obviously ideal for this because not only can we extract with hydrocarbon\ncold but it's hydrophobic so that the water is going to be separated very\neasily from the hydrocarbon, but in addition to that it's going to extract\nthat cannabinoid profile and it'll extract those terpenes with leaving\nbehind,  because of the cold temperature, a lot of those fats, waxes, and other\nadulterants that we don't want in our end product. So when making shatter are\nultimately extracting the dry biomass with the cold solvent we're going to\ntake that to a finishing process which is called vacuum oven purging. So once we\nhave our shatter and we want to vacuum oven purge it, what we do is we we spread\nthis out on vacuum oven trays and we go into a very low vacuum, very deep vacuum\nwith a mild temperature increase from atmospheric. So a temperature increase\ndepending on methodologies it ranges vary widely depending an operator but it\ncould be anywhere from 75 Fahrenheit to will say 105 degrees Fahrenheit would be\na common operational range, and we're always trying to get to a very deep\nvacuum we're talking about 28-29 inches of mercury - very, very deep in terms of\nbeing able to purge out those residual solvents. So not only do we have a\nsolvent free product but purging out the residual solvents and the terpenes is\nalso going to take away some of that some of that added viscosity and\nreally get that product to the point where it's like a glass-like consistency.\nAnd we commonly call those as they're coming out of the oven \"slabs\", sometimes\nthey look like Swiss cheese, sometimes they'll they'll be you know a perfect\nslab of glass, sometimes they'll flip over. And it can vary between a\ncomplete glass-like type consistency and it can also vary to you know sort of\nlike Jolly Rancher or warm Jolly Rancher type consistency - but the good part about\nthis process is to make shatter using hydrocarbon you can generally\nstill make a very good end product on biomass that's been properly dried\nproperly preserved even though it does have maybe a little bit of degradation\nit does have a little bit of oxidation of the cannabinoids and loss of the\nterpenes it's okay because you can still make a very very credible saleable\nproduct that's widely consumed in the form of shatter. And optimizing that\nprocess as a way that you can create a lot of revenue for your\nextraction company. So the next thing that I'd like to talk about is diamonds.\nTerp sauce. There's all sorts of crazy names, \"the sauce\" -  that they coined for\nthis type of extract and really what we're after on this type of extract is\nterpene preservation. So it starts off very much like a live resin\nprocess in the fact that we're harvesting these these buds or these\nflowers in a live state, we're freezing them, and we're ultimately preserving\nthose terpenes. Because terpenes are very volatile compounds in general. Too much\nheat they evaporate and they get degraded by heat, they get degraded by processes, they\nget degraded by solvent - so we want to use a very light solvent, like a light\nhydrocarbon, and in this case mostly moving towards a propane dominant blend. Propane has a much lower boiling point which means it's much more volatile in\nterms of removing it from the end product - easier to remove from the end\nproduct is another way to word that. So ultimately extracting this\nlive resin like prepared biomass with a propane dominant or a lighter\nhydrocarbon dominant blend at low temperatures and ultimately what we end\nup with is we end up with this extract that really becomes a sort of miscella of the cannabinoids but also a very amount high amount of terpene\ncontent. And as I stated before the terpenes are quite volatile and any sort\nof heat, any sort of degradation, even just being an atmosphere for too long\ncan degrade those terpenes. So imagine this kind of cannabinoid and terpenes\nsludge coming out of the machine because we've preserved them up to that point.\nImmediately usually what's done with sauce and live resin is you're taking\nthe terpenes and generally spinning them off in a classified centrifuge. The\nreason we use the classified centrifuge is because there's still a little bit of\nsolvent in there, so we just want to be cautious, but what that ultimately does\nis it spins off the terpenes and it separates a terpene layer from the\ncannabinoid layer. You separate those two now there's a variety of different\nproduction processes that go back into this. In some cases if you're if you're\ndoing crystallization you can leave a little bit of solvent in there and you\ncan ultimately recrystallize the THC-a through a supersaturation method.\nYou can ultimately take the cannabinoids off from that terpene fraction and\ndecarboxylate the cannabinoids and then add the terpenes back in - and that's how\nyou make live resin pens. So for example you know once that decarboxylated\ncannabinoid profile is there you take your original terpenes blend them back\nin and it's going to give you the viscosity in order for the pen or the\nvape cartridge to be able to uptake and atomized that extract. And make, again\nthis is an extract that is absolutely in line with the original orientation of\nthe plant, the original smells, flavors terpenes, and the uniqueness. It's very\ncool because you have such variety within these plants and to capture the\nnative essence of that plant and to reconstitute it and to several\nconsumable forms is a massive value add for an extraction business. And if you\nlook at some of the best extraction companies in the world that do this, this\nis exactly what they do and this is exactly how they do it. So on the flip\nside of what we've spoken about here which has mainly been artisanal\ntype extracts and hydrocarbon extracts. Let's talk about crude oil, let's talk\nabout distillate, let's talk about the high-value type extracts. So crude oil is\nexactly what it sounds if you think about crude oil coming out of the ground\nin like petrochemicals or something like that.\nIt's an oil that has a lot of adulterants in it. It needs a lot of\nrefinement. It needs to go through further processes in order to be\nconsumable or in a consumable form. So what we're looking for with crude oil\non an extraction is really any type of biomass but preferred dried biomass\nlow-grade biomass that can be purchased cheap and ultimately refined into\nsomething of high value. So if we've got for example you know a thousand pounds\nof biomass sitting it's been sitting for six months, we're not going to be able to\nmake really a credible shatter product out of that, we're not going to be able\nto make a credible live resin, definitely not going to be able to make any sort of\nhigh terpene extract or anything out of that. But what we can do is we can\nmaximize the extraction of the cannabinoids out of that biomass with a generally\nwarmer solvent - of course there's ways that you can do it with a cold solvent.\nAnd this can be done with hydrocarbon or ethanol. This is where ethanol becomes\nreally applicable it becomes really easy it becomes really user friendly and\ncost-conscious. And this is where you can still use hydrocarbon but not as\nefficient of a method as ethanol for bulk crude oil. So what we actually do is\nwe take our biomass we load it in and we'll saturate it with ethanol for\na given amount of time. Ultimately we take that miscella stream is what we\ncall it which is the cannabinoids and all the other stuff that comes out of\nthe plant along with the solvent and we evaporate that solvent off. Once that\nsolvents evaporated off ultimately we have our crude oil. Now this crude oil\nhas got all sorts of chlorophyll and whatever came along with the plant and\nany sort of adulterants in there. Generally it'll have a lot of fats, waxes,\nand lipids in there that generally come out of the plant in extraction. So\nthere's a variety of refinement processes. One of the most common\nprocesses to refine is to get to distillate and that's what I'd like to\nchat about next. So let's talk about guys how that distillate actually gets made.\nNow distillate is a process that's made through distillation so quite commonly\nor to break it down in really simple terms if you're putting a pot of water\non the stove and ultimately that water is boiling and turning into vapor - \nthat's a process of distillation. That water is being distilled into the\natmosphere in the form of vapors. So that's exactly what we're trying to do\nwith the cannabinoids in the crude oil. We're actually trying to take those\ncannabinoids, we're trying to vaporize them, and ultimately we're going to\nrecollect them in a more concentrated form. But before we can distill there's\nseveral other things we need to do. We need to make sure that there's no\nadulterants in that distillate or in that crude oil that are going to inhibit\nmaking the distillate. So those things can be waxes, they can be chlorophylls,\nthey can be fats, lipids, all sorts of weird stuff that can come over in a very\nrough crude extraction. The way that we refine that is we commonly\nuse winterization processes, we also commonly use fine filtration, there's\nguys that use what are called adsorbent - which could be diatomaceous earth or\nactivated carbons in order to clean up some of these undesirables from this\ncrude oil in order to make it into distillate. But ultimately once it's\npassed through a distillation process it's normally used a what's called a\nfractional distillation, or a wiped film distillation process when you're at\nscale. We're taking those cannabinoids and we're evaporating them and we're re-concentrating them. So what happens is we take this very, very poor quality\nbiomass, turn it into a really rough crude oil, but ultimately extract the\nwe'll call it \"the goodies\" - but the cannabinoids out of that crude oil and\nconcentrate them in a very refined format. That can be remixed in and\nreconstituted into several different products. This process is awesome because it can literally take any grade of biomass and turn it into a shelf-stable,\nreplicatable, scalable, repeatable product that has a consistency across the board\nfor end-users expectations. For example, you get Pepsi every time it tastes like\nPepsi every time you don't want it to taste like Coke one time or taste like\nyou know RC Cola the next time. You want consistency and a repeatable fashion for\nwhich to make your product. So last product that I want to talk about is\nisolates and isolates are made from actually in almost all cases distillate.\nSo we're taking this crude oil remember as we spoke about with distillate,\nrefining it into a distilled product. So we have this distilled product and the\npotency of that can be anywhere from say a little very low-end 75 percent on the very high-end 95 percent - but it's not 100% pure. And what\nwe're gonna do with that distillate is we're actually going to go through a\nsecondary refinement process called crystallization, isolation of\nthese individual cannabinoids. So each one of these cannabinoids has a\nmolecular structure and based upon what that molecular structure looks like we\ncan come up with ideal ways to actually crystallize and crash out of solution\nthese individual molecules. This is a very common process in chemistry. It's\nused very widely and it's ultimately how CBD isolate is made, it's ultimately how\nTHCA diamonds are made, it's a process of crystallization. So how we do that is\nwe use a selective solvent the selective solvent most often used is hydrocarbon.\nVery often it's either butane or pentane in order to make these isolates.\nAnd what happens is you actually take your distillate and you mix it into\neither the pentane or the butane if it's THCA depending on what you're trying to\ndo and you have your distillate or your fine cannabinoids back in matrices at\nthat point it's back in that now that miscella of hydrocarbon and\ncannabinoids. And what happens is over time and over a temperature ramp spike\ncurve and over a slow period of time these cannabinoids will start\nto actually crystallize. And they'll form one little crystal and it will grow upon\nitself. As we reduce the saturation of the solvent they actually fall out of\nsolution. So what will happen is you'll almost see like rock candy or crystal-like formation growing. Once those crystals are fully formed they can be\nharvested and once you optimize this process you actually have nearly 100%\npurity on any given compound. Now there can be adulterants you know that gets\nstuck on the crystals that need to be washed off but in ideal state this is\nsomething that you can refine up to say a good benchmark is 99 to 99.5 percent\nif you're a really good chemist you can get it up close to 99.7 to 99.9. This is where that last little bits very, very\nhard to get, but there is ways to do that. So if we look at you know the the world\nof cannabinoids in conclusion. There's several different ways to make extracts.\nThere's a lot of different ways to make very, very viable market products. There's\na lot of ways to drive revenue in your extraction business with these products.\nUnderstanding this knowledge base and understanding how you're going to occupy\neach one of these market niches, what access to biomass you have, what\ndiversity and methodology do you have in order to create these products and\nultimately drive diversity and revenue in your in your business. And then really\ntaking that to the next step and taking the next level of understanding of how\nto create these products. That's something that we do here all day long\nat Precision. We absolutely understand all these processes very intimately. We\nhave a very robust team of install / integrators that\noptimize these processes, so again not just selling you the pieces of equipment\nbut actually coming out training you on these processes, sitting there with the\npieces of equipment with you in order to get these processes integrated until\nyour business is up and running and on legs.\nSo in conclusion, a tremendous opportunity ,I hope you enjoyed the video, and thanks for joining us .We really look forward to seeing you again.", "enbiDHXbbjY": "what's happening it's your buddy jack bringing you an extra potent honey recipe today and i'll show you ways to utilize it to get full advantage out of everything so we're going to make some honey then we're going to take the excess and make some honey infused coconut oil and then after that we're left with like a little taffy-like substance that we're going to make some candy with this video is really in-depth i like to usually make my videos pretty quick so you can get the gist but i wanted to try this one just to break it down deep dive for you so you can learn from me as i'm learning throughout the process so come on with me this recipe is sure to get you buzzing so let's dive into the hive let's get infusing my friends we're going to be using an ounce and a half a shake one ounce of flour you could play with the ratios that you're feeling some organic unrefined coconut oil already infused for the extra kick some raw unrefined honey as well as some bee pollen there naturally occurring lecithin to act as an emulsifier and then we'll be using our liquid sunflower lecithin as well to emulsify you're going to need a cheesecloth a strainer a french press like we're going to be using today as well and i'll show you how we're going to use these later in the video the next step here is going to be the decarboxylation process we're going to break down our bud here the ounce at least that wasn't broken down cover it with some foil here and then we're going to go ahead and put it in the oven 240 degrees for 40 minutes you can play with it 220 for an hour you could do 250 for 35 now we're gonna add the honey i have the crock pot on high and i put the honey under some hot water to make it easier to scoop out we're just going to scoop out a good amount i'm not going to do the whole jar my goal here is to kind of use at least as possible to make the most potent product possible and you could also use a double broiler here might be even a little better because you're not going to get the heat directly on the honey so feel free to use that double broiler or you could use the levo too now i'm going to go ahead and add our pre-infused coconut oil it does not have to be infused the coconut oil is just another fat here to help the thc bind to so we can get that potent product and we can make sure we're sucking out all that goodness to make our edible hit hard did about a tablespoon and a half there and the cool thing about this is we know how strong it is because i actually infused this batch with the levo2 which is really convenient like i said you could use it for this recipe as well but then i checked it here with the t-check 2 potency tester that helps me know how strong my product is when i'm making it highly recommend i'll drop a link below if you want to check out the t-check too i'll also put a link for the levo as well links for other videos everything down below so 3.2 milligrams per milliliter we're looking at about 47.7 milligrams per tablespoon so yeah you can do the math we did about one and a half there we'll end up adding a little more here for about two tablespoons total maybe a little more let's go ahead and add a couple scoops of this bee pile in here the bee pollen like i said is just going to act as an emulsifier with that natural lecithin in it and it's not going to have that taste of like the sunflower even though we're still going to add it we're going to go double here to make sure that this hits right that it's available that it's just gonna be the best honey we can make let's go ahead and add a little nutmeg here we're gonna spice this up today make it like asian spice style honey i'm gonna do a little nutmeg here then we're gonna add a little cinnamon as well it's going to give it that good flavor kind of cover up the flavor of all this cannabis we're using because we're using so damn much two and a half ounces is a lot to infuse with just how much honey we are so this [ __ ] is going to be extra strong now let me show you what it's looking like this is looking tasty it makes me want to make this honey just without butt in it no i'm just kidding we're going to add the bud of course now we already added that um bee pollen let's just add about a teaspoon to a tablespoon of the liquid sunflower lecithin to cook up with the cannabis like i said this is important to have so everything blends together at the end you're going to see some stuff down later in this video i try to make full use of everything i hate any waste when it comes to infusion so i'll show you some tricks that i kind of learned or tried in this video and let me know what you think i'm just curious so we're just going to stir this up here nice and mixed together the crock pot is on low now i had it on high just to heat up quick but we're going to infuse everything on low there is one part where i turn it on warm about two and a half hours in i turn it down let it sit and um you'll see what that's looking like here in a second just added a little more bee pollen trying to get the mixture right and this video is just really in depth very thorough i do a lot of videos that are just a couple minutes but i wanted to bring you something that's more well-rounded something that can help us both learn more when we're making crazy good edibles add a little star knees in there give it that flavor next part let's go ahead and add that bud that we had decarb the two and a half ounces in our case play with it in your case maybe you could go a lot less if you just want something that's not as potent you could use a concentrate you could do whatever you're feeling here or you could just have an infused coconut oil mix it with the honey with an emulsifier and you'll be good to go but let's just go ahead and add this d carb bud here in our case the two and a half ounces like i said this is a lot so we're going to go ahead and stir it around and we're going to have to end up adding a little more coconut oil and we're going to add a little more honey just to make sure everything's looking good that you know there's a liquid layer over the bud we don't want to burn anything and that's why i was saying the double broiler could be a good method too because it's a lot harder to burn anything in a double broiler or with the levo but i love the crock pot i love the ease of it especially when i'm making such a big batch using two and a half ounces so that's about two tablespoons maybe two and a half we'll say total so that's an extra 100 milligram kick right there which will make this nice like i said it doesn't need to be infused this is just a little way to bring up that thc content a little more let's add some more honey we're gonna infuse this for about three hours total i probably could have gone two i might have gone a little long here to be straight up honest with you but that's what this is all about it's all a learning experience so let's mix it together i'm gonna come back in 30 minutes like i said the crock pot is on low i don't want anything to burn here today so 35 minutes in here you can see it's starting to melt we're getting that liquid there it's got that breaking down and we're just going to go ahead and put the top back on and let it sit i'ma pop back in a little while and uh keep giving it a stir you want to stir it you know as frequently as you like i would say you know every 20 30 an hour i ended up walking away and getting caught up in some editing for like an hour i probably should have stirred it just a little more i'm just trying to be open and honest just to help you make the best recipe possible and this is what it's looking like about two hours in i probably could have stopped it here strained it but what i decided to do at this about two hour mark was put the crock pot on warm i put the crock pot on warm for about 30 minutes just kind of let it sit then i put it back on the low to finish up so we're looking at about that three hours total for infusing and there it is the three hours in you can see it's darkened up it's all infused so i'd play with it you know you could do two hours to four hours i'd recommend i wouldn't go under two hours personally but let me know if you try if you do an hour and a half and you like it drop a comment let me know now the hard thing with honey is that it especially this unrefined honey first let's take everything out here you know the cinnamon the nutmeg etc but the thing with this honey is it's so thick once it needs to be hot to strain properly so we need to do this right away so grab your hot mitt whatever you're using and we're going to put it in the french press to just really press it out of there and get all the honey we can like i said it wants to cool down quickly so we need to make sure we're doing this at a good rate here just scoop it right in there this two and a half ounces here we're gonna press down and just press that honey out and this is like you know you could use whatever method you like you could put it in a cheesecloth and squeeze it with your hands and whatnot but like i said we gotta work here when this is hot so put some nice pressure on there and just push that honey out like i said there's a lot of flour as we know but look at that honey coming to the top strain it again get everything out of the crock pot push it down here in the french press we're just going to repeat this process and get as much honey out as possible like i said it wants to cool off pretty quick so now we're going to add just a little more bee pollen in there help the honey emulsify a little more and then we're just going to stir it up see how it is right there and if it does start cooling down a little bit you can throw it in the microwave just you know 20 seconds real quick help it be a little more liquid there and we're just going to keep stirring that up and there's our honey now you might be saying there's like a lot of other stuff there that's what i always think i'm like well i have all this butt i feel like there's so much probably honey even in there i feel like there's probably thc so now what we're gonna do after this honey here that we're gonna pour up that's just delicious by the way probably my favorite top three you know edibles infusions that i've ever made just put a little more lecithin in there make sure it's all good just a touch and we're gonna take that coconut oil and we're going to make a full batch of the coconut oil with the bud that was already in here i'll show you kind of how we're doing that here in just a second continue to stir up that honey make sure it's all mixed properly there it is our beautiful potent cannabis honey and i'll do a test later so you can see that it's potent i test it and it definitely is potent and i'll give you some good ideas that you can make with it now let's load up our bag here with the two and a half ounces of the flour that we already pushed all the honey out of but as you can see there still looks like there's liquid in there has like that molasses look we just need to heat it back up and then what we're going to do now is take this bag close it up and then we're going to infuse it with the coconut oil that we had see trying to twist it's like impossible and this is still really freaking hot and it's still hard to get the honey out so we're going to take full advantage of this by mixing it in with our coconut oil the coconut oil that we used previously that is already infused so this coconut oil should end up extra potent we're just simply going to add this bag to the crock pot and then add the rest of the coconut oil and we're going to let it infuse today for about two hours stirring every 30 minutes or so since both were already infused we could probably even do it last time we could probably do an hour and it would still be fine but i'm going to do it too just to be safe here and right after we're done infusing let's throw our nut milk or fine cheesecloth bag in the french press and press out all that green goodness right there and then we'll just go ahead and dump that jar back in the crock pot give it a stir get any of the sediment that's on the bottom and then we're going to fine strain it through our fine strainer here and after it goes through all the way here you'll see we're going to add a little bit of that liquid sunflower lecithin to help everything emulsify help that honey combine to the coconut oil and such and then we're going to pour this back into the coconut oil jar i stir it but then i'm going to give it a nice shake try to help everything mix up even better here but what we're going to find or what i found when doing this is that there's still going to be some separation i think it might be because the honey cooked too much or it's just too dense even with the emulsifiers it still wants to separate so we're going to go ahead and strain it through again here for the second time to separate that you can look even on the bottom of it right now it looks like a caramel like thicker caramelly candy substance that's left from the honey you can see the oil draining out right now which is cool but it's still mixed with the honey i'm going to grab a close-up here to show you just what i mean and it still looks like it's mixed together see how that's coming out right there that's the honey mixed with the coconut oil and i just thought this was a cool shot so i grabbed a close-up to kind of show you how the substance is looking and you might be able to see if you look in the fine strainer at the bottom there that's where like the caramel like build up is now we're going to strain it through here for the third and final time i mean you could probably do this to your heart's content but it's starting to get colder anyway when we don't want it to get too cold or it'll just be a pain like i said you can throw it in the microwave if need be but you can look with my fork how i'm moving that kind of caramel-like substance around and i'm really interested to see the potency on this see if it tastes good and see if we can make a good candy here next for this three-part recipe now if you look here at it it looks like see see how it's like caramelly right there really thick nice and i'm gonna i got some ideas here we're about to work on next before we test all three so you can see if you want to make it and we're left with a good amount of infused coconut oil looking a lot more potent but color doesn't tell all so we'll have to test this next here not a crazy amount but still pretty good amount right there start low and kind of see if i feel anything from this let's see what it does i'll come back to you all right so i'd say that amount i took was feeling about like 40 50 milligrams i'm an hour and 42 in i is usually feel most by now i have a feeling it's going to come on a little slower but it's hitting the spot it's nice and then i was asking my roommate he's like dude that shit's good he's like that honey is nice i'm like oh okay man well you tried it he's like yeah he's like uh we made a juice this is a good idea so they what they did is heat up a little water put some of that honey in there stir it up add it to the juice and then ice it and they said it hit the spot had them feeling good last night so i would say overall recipe is a success but we're still yet to try [Music] um this the uh what i did with the second recipe we're going to try this next and then i have this here the honey that kind of toffee like substance that i'm going to roll some stuff out and try to make like a candy with like a cow tail that candy is kind of my inspiration for the look and feel of that so overall honey is a success so far and uh hits the spot and hits good got me buzzing right all right now time for the candy experiment let's take out this honey caramel-like substance roll it out with the wax paper and then we're going to go ahead and just add our can of sugar that we have on the outside so it's not sticky and giving it a little extra potency let's slice it up these are looking like little sugary tootsie rolls now the question is how are they all right so they've been sitting for about a week so they flattened up but here are these little like honey candies let's give them a taste tastes like [ __ ] to be honest with you we'll see if one works i don't even want to eat another i'm honestly not going to eat these other ones unless it hits really hard but full transparency this is not legit the honey was delicious and hit hard the coconut oil hit hard this tastes really bad i usually don't care much about taste but this tastes pretty bad all right so it's about an hour or so later from that little honey candy that tasted like [ __ ] now i was talking trash on it but i am feeling it i'd say right now it feels like what i'd usually take maybe like a 20 milligrams it's not super heavy but it could still kick in a little more here but not taste good not taste good let's do a little recap though [ __ ] it so those were an experiment and still eat them but kind of failed because it tastes pretty damn bad the coconut oil was a success put this in a smoothie did like a t in between teaspoon tablespoonish hey good should have recorded that i think i said i was going to but i'm doing a video every day so i got to get more out this one's taking a while this is an in-depth video and then of course the honey come some recipes with this for you um do like a simple syrup that you can put in any drink really etc and yeah so recipe was worth it it's taken some time this video's taken a long time and i'm looking at this too this uh ghee butter double dose that i did in the brownies or double those brownies this is the butter here and now that i say that too there was something else that i wanted to mention in that video and that was that if you wanted to and what i would do next time i was just trying to do it quick once again is i would have put some water in there when i was cooking it you can do this in any butter recipe even if you're using a crock pot or whatever and it's going to help separate the chlorophyll and all that other plant material from there so you can have a more clean tasting product although the brownie still did taste really good i will say that for sure um yeah thanks for hanging out i hope you like this in-depth video um but like i said i'm trying to do something new here i've done a bunch of like shorter ones and stuff but never one quite like this that's this in depth so i hope it finds you well um and i hope you're having a good 2021 so far like i said i'm doing a video a day trying to go extra hard and uh just trying to bring you dope content if you want to make this recipe hopefully i can help you you know you can and if you make it you can help me drop a comment below let me know if you tried something maybe you did something different so you were left with something else like maybe you turned the honey into something really cool just let me know drop a comment below and uh oh winded walking up the stairs sitting down but thanks for chilling guys always good to have you here you", "235gIzWOkrM": "Interviewer: Hello, and welcome to this very\nspecial episode with Sadhguruji which we are doing on the occasion of the \nInternational Yoga Day. Sadhguruji Namaskaram. \nSadhguru: Namaskaram. Interviewer: And I want to \nask you Sadhguruji, Yoga has become a very, very \nimportant part of people's lives. In fact, a study has recently shown that about\ntwo billion people across the world have gone to practice Yoga -- that means one out of\nevery three people in the world. Is, is Yoga the latest fad or does it really\nhave the kind of empirical backing that we are now seeing through studies by, by Harvard University and other \nsuch studies that have come up? I, I want to ask you, is there a scientific reason that the world \nis adapting Yoga as a lifestyle? Sadhguru: Namaskaram and on \nthis international Yoga Day, it is very important that first of all, how did this international Yoga Day\ncome into existence? Because when this was proposed by India by\nthe Prime Minister when it was presented, one hundred and seventy two countries said,\nan emphatic \u201cYes\u201d to it. Never before in the UN, anything has gotten\nthat kind of support, because everybody was literally waiting \nfor India to do this all these years. It's now that we have done this. Having said that, why is this so important? If you look at anything that's \nhappened in human history, nothing else has lasted as\nlong as Yoga. 12,000 to 15,000-year history it \nhas and it has lasted. This has not been propagated forcefully, never\nit's happened holding a sword to your throat, somebody said do Yoga. But it has happened only because it has worked,\nonly because of its efficacy it's on. So do we have empirical data about it? \nOne hundred percent. But empirical data as you know it as it is\nbeing collected in today's scientific jargon, and the university levels is only, let's say\nthirty to forty years or fifty years old. But we have enough experiential data in this\ncountry that we know it works. One hundred percent it works. Millions and millions of people have \nbenefited from this, no doubt. So having said that, today, you know, the\ntwo things that everybody is worried about is -- one thing is a virus. Staying alive \nphysically is one big challenge right now. And the next thing is because people are in\nlower levels of activity, they are cooped up in their homes \nbecause of the lockdown, it is an established factor that when the\nnecessary physical activity is not there, there is a decreased level of BDNF or the\nbrain derived neurotropic factors, when that happens, this will bring \nanxiety, depression, Alzheimer's, decrease in emotion, I mean, emotional\nexhaustion, burnouts, all these things happen. This is an established understanding in the\nmedical science. But now with the yogic practices with the\u2026\nwith the Inner Engineering practices, we have established that University of Indiana, professors from Harvard University, Rutgers and Florida University have done a \ncomprehensive study where they're sowing\u2026 showing that the BDNF levels are three \nfold higher than a normal person or it increases three fold within \nninety days of practice. So one hundred percent people are out of their\ndepressive modes and other anxiety situations and all this. One hundred percent there out. There \nis now blood markers clearly showing this. This is not just sociological studies, these are actually very intrusive \nblood markers being studied and we are clearly seeing this\nand even genetic dispositions are changing by the yogic practice within \nninety days\u2019 period. Interviewer: Sadhguruji, I don't mean to joke\nabout this, but in recent research by a group of scientists, including professors from \nHarvard and Rutgers, they've mentioned there that there are really high number of anandamide\nreleased after yogic practices. Many people are questioning, isn't this the\nsame thing that creates intoxication? So is, is Yoga, a substitute for a Friday\nevening or a Saturday evening drink? Sadhguru: No, no, this is those people who\nare not in Yoga they're using Saturday evening as a substitute. You're putting it \nthe other way around. See, look at my eyes.\nI'm always stoned, twenty-four hours. They are getting stoned only on the weekend,\ntell me which is better (Laughs)? So one is there is what is called as endocannabinoids\nthat is produced in our body. There are cannabi\u2026 cannabis receptors, receptors\nin our brain and right through the body. We have receptors, why are they there? Because it's expecting that you produce this\n\u2013 endocannabinoids. When you produce this, everything is at ease. Your experience of life both physically and\nmentally is very pleasant. When your experience of life is pleasant, you naturally function at a higher\nlevel of efficiency and capability. Human potential is fully realized simply because\nyou are not an issue in your life. There are thousand issues to handle in our\nlives outside, but you should not be issue. If you yourself, your own \nthought and emotion is one big issue. Right now people are going about as if it's\nyour right to have a mental problem. They\u2019re saying it's our right. Oh, why are you saying it can go away? It cannot go away.Human beings \nhave to live with this. Why? Because if people think their diagnosis is\nthe nature of being human, I'm very sorry for that. The important thing is, a human being is capable\nof having mastery over his or her system much more than any other \ncreature on this planet. So, Yoga is the science which \nexplores this dimension. And tell me if you were also, you know, when\nwe talk about this, we talk about three dimensions. One is intoxication, I am putting that in\nthe front, but it's actually the last one. Intoxication, intensity of our energy and\nour experience, intensity of our senses, and stillness within ourselves, these three dimensions\nif they are on every moment of your life, you are never the issue in the world -- within\nyourself, you're never the issue. Ha, there are outside situations \nthat need to be handled, we will do to the best of our ability. You tell me Navika, you're doing whatever\nwork you're doing right now, it's demanding in these times, this work that you're doing. Tell me can you do this better when you're\nfeeling wonderful or when you're feeling stressed and depressed? Interviewer: Obviously, if \none is feeling better, one performs to an optimum \ncapacity at that time. Sadhguru: So if you're generating your own\nendocannabinoids, you will be feeling wonderful every moment of your life. Your mood is at your best level, you're joyful,\nyou're blissful. When you are like this, you will \nfunction at your best. This is something that needs to happen. Well, you said two billion people -- I'm \nterribly disappointed with that because this was my mission \nwhen at the age of twenty-five, when things exploded within me \nand I was dripping ecstasy, I thought what is the problem? At\u2026 on that day, the population \nwas 5.6 billion people. I thought in two and a half years\u2019 time,\nI will make everybody blissful. But here I am. Nearly forty \nyears after that, but two billion people, well, I \ndon't think that's a good number. Seven billion people when \nyou say I will say yes, because that is the purpose \nof International Yoga Day, that everybody should have tools of self-\ntransformation and well-being with them. The tools of self-transformation, the tools of being able to manage \nyour own well-being from within, should not be in the hands of\nan institution or a guru. It must be in the hands of every human being. That is when you will see a better world. Interviewer: You're saying that you know,\ndoing Yoga can actually make you anxiety-free, but today, mental health is a real issue. Sadhguruji, we've lost a big Bollywood star and that's come as an eye \nopener to many people in this world on what mental stress \ncan do to you. And mental stress has many dimensions -- mental stress happens because most of the Indians today are living in fear of the virus infection. There are some who are living \nin fear of losing their job. There are some people who are living in fear\nbecause their salaries have been cut. There's some people who are living in fear because they don't know the future \nseems absolutely uncertain. Financial crisis probably is more evident\nnow in virtually every other household than it ever was before. \nDo you think there is\u2026 there is any scientific proof to tell us that \nmental health can be solved by Yoga because the Bollywood star\nthat I'm talking about was somebody who did a lot of physical exercises, was a very fit\u2026\nfit human being? How does mental health relate \nto this yogic practice? Sadhguru: Well, when you say is there any\nscientific evidence, what scientific evidence means is that there are certain markers on\nthe level of our physiological level, which is usually the blood markers. There are certain genome markers, there is\nBDNF, which is an important marker, the neurotropic markers, \nall these clearly show, you can not only prevent these psychological \nailments by doing the right practices, but you can come out of it \nalso if you do it the right way. Only problem is when somebody is in a state\nof mental depression or other things, getting them to do the practice \nis a huge challenge. It is a very big challenge. Unless there are dedicated people around them\nsupporting them in every way to make them do it every day, it won't happen.\nThat's what we do here. I can show you thousands of people who have\ncome out of various mental problems by that, doing because we create a supportive atmosphere. This may not be possible in every \nhome to make it happen. So the question is of application. If we can apply will they come out of it? \nOne hundred percent it's possible. There are some pathological cases \nwhich are very hard. So there also we have seen such cases, whatever level of medication \nthey were on, we have brought down that level of \nmedication significantly. So about suicides that you're talking about. Every year 800,000 people are committing suicide\nin this world, can you believe that? It's more than all the crime, murders, \neven wars put together, that many people don't die, that many people \nare taking their own life. This means every forty seconds, one person\nis taking his own life. Only when somebody that you know dies or only\nwhen somebody who is popular or significant in a society dies, everybody sits up. But every forty seconds somebody is committing\na suicide, we need to really look at this. Why are human beings \nwant to take their own life? Simply because we have not inculcated anything\nin our education system which tells us how to handle our physiology \nand psychological structure. There are many ways to put this.\nThe simplest way to put this is just this. Most human beings have not been taught how\nto handle their own intelligence. If you had half the brain that you have, you\nwould have no mental ailments. Because you have a certain level of intelligence,\nand you\u2026 you have no training, you have no social situation, where you're being taught\nhow to use this to your\u2026 your well-being, now your own intelligence \nis turning against you. When your intelligence turns\u2026 turns against\nyou, it looks so hopeless, as if there is\nsimply no way out of it. That is what leads to people committing suicide. Some may be committing suicide because of\ntheir life situations. But a whole lot of them are committing suicide\njust because of their psychological situations, that can easily be easily be stopped. If there is a proper system, right from childhood,\neverybody is taught certain processes, where their endocannabinoids are on, that \nmeans they are blissful by nature, their experience of life is pleasant. Naturally, when this is there, why would you\nthink anybody would take their life? Why would you think anybody \nwould be depressed? I know there's a whole lot of people who,\nif you utter the word depression, they're usually pouncing on me for that, because they heard the word depression only \nprobably from the diagnosis they got for themselves. The word depression is not only clinical depression,\nif two things go wrong with your life today, you could be mildly depressed. Well, you will talk yourself out of it. Otherwise, you will talk to your friend or\nfamily and they will talk you out of it. Otherwise, you will seek \nprofessional help. If there was no way \nout of differ\u2026 depression, why would a psychologist sit with \nyou and talk to you for hours? Obviously, he knows he \ncan talk you out of it. And otherwise, chemical help. Right now when it comes to chemistry, this\nhuman mechanism is the most sophisticated chemical factory on the planet.\nThe question is only this. Are you a great manager of this chemistry\nor are you a lousy manager of this chemistry? This all there is. Yoga means you become a very \nefficient manager of your own chemical factory. Interviewer: Sadhguruji, the Harvard study\nalso shows a fifty percent reduction is perceived in stress if this chemistry itself changes. So I want to ask you, what comes first, the\nemotion of depression or the chemistry changes? You know, chemistry changes occur after depression\nhas overtaken us or do they take place before the depression emotion takes over us? And how do we control it in, in a normal situation\nwithout paying somebody who's professional in this, huge amount of money for just talking\nus out of it? Sadhguru: See, I think a whole lot of people,\nmajority of the people at one time or the other they will start getting depressed because\nof some life situation, but within a few hours they \nwill talk themselves out of it. Either, you know, some kind of inspiration\nthey will use, either their love for somebody or love for the nation or \nlove for something else, and you know, work \nthemselves out of it. Whatever matters to them in their life, they\nwill use that to come out of it. But whether the emotion comes first \nor the chemistry comes first, well, this is, this is yes and \nno both ways because for some people they have naturally \ncome with a little volatile chemistry. If I say something now (Laughs), I must be\nvery careful because people will again perceive this as something \nagainst women and things like that. Women have always a little more volatile chemistry\nsimply because their physiology has a larger responsibility of bearing a child. \nBecause of this, there are more fluctuating things \nhappening in her body than compared to \nyour man's body. So the chances of chemistry causing emotion\nis very much more possible, not that it's not possible in a man. It is very much possible in a man also but\nit is more tilted towards women, but thought causing, thought or emotion causing chemical\ndisturbances is more so in the male. If you really look at it in terms of gender,\nthis is chemistry disturbing emotion and thought is more in the woman, thought because a man\nalways thinks he's intelligent, this is a big problem (Laughs). So, he will work himself into a place where\nhis chemistry gets messed up. But a woman's chemistry is more volatile \nbecause to facilitate a childbirth\u2026 See, we are just thinking childbirth means,\noh, it just happens. It is not a small thing. It is like a whole \nnew creation happening, all right. So the, the fluidity of our chemistry, sometimes\nwhen it doesn't function well, this fluid chemistry can easily \nthrow emotional situations off. Many women, pre childbirth or post \nespecially post childbirth, they experience like they \nget depressed, they get hysterical, but naturally they will settle in \na few months or so, they don't usually go for \nmedication in this country. No\u2026 they will create a protective atmosphere\nfor that lady and she will come out of it. So this is about chemistry \ncausing emotional disturbance. But emotional stress or even the thought process\ngoing in a certain way can very easily disturb the chemistry because \nthey are not too far away. One will reflect in the other very quickly. Interviewer: Well, Sadhguruji, I completely\nunderstand what you're saying and I'm not one of those feminists \nwho will question this because I've, I've gone through childbirth and, and I think, you know, \nwhat you say is very, very real. But I, I also want to ask you that the reasons are only increasing \nin the times that we live in. There are reasons due to the kind, the kind of pressures we feel because of \nthe COVID virus situation. But there are also reasons that are extraneous\nreasons we have no control over for example, the China situation -- \nThe India-China situation. I want to ask you, Sadhguruji, this country\nhas been a country that has wished and prayed for peace from times immemorial. Yet this country has been ravaged by wars,\nagain from times immemorial. Today, when we stand at one such cusp, how do people really think about the \nuncertainty that is currently prevailing? There is anger which is directed \ntowards the country. There is, there is a whole lot of heightened\nemotion from people in the country. How do you think we have to manage this and how do you think we need to \nlook at this entire issue of China? Sadhguru: This is not only about China. First of all, let's understand this \nwhat we call a \u201cNation.\u201d Well, we like to say India is a cultural entity,\nthis, that, everything, yes it's all true on one level. But essentially \na nation is a piece of geography. So except on the oceans, except in the oceans,\nnone of our other borders are properly defined. East, West, North, \nnowhere is it properly defined. How do you make a nation like this? Is your Western border clearly defined? No, you have a LOC. \nNorthern border, you have LAC. Eastern border, you know all the trouble the\nperfo\u2026 perforated borders that you have. So after seventy-five years of independence,\nwhy have we not defined it because somebody did not \nunderstand what is a nation. We have fancy ideas; we will \npray for fee\u2026 peace. I don't know what's the other word \nyou use, pray and what? We wish and pray for peace. \nPeace will not come that way. We must do the right things \nso that the ambiguity is reduced and the reason for any kind of\nconfrontation is reduced. And then once that is done, \nrest, peace must be enforced. This is the way the world works, peace within\nmyself I can achieve in a different way. But I would say that is also enforced. I am peaceful and \njoyful because I enforce it. Otherwise, if I look at the outside situations,\nI can also get depressed. I have decided such things \ndon't happen to me, I enforce it in myself that I \nwill never be disturbed, I will never be unhappy, I will\nbe peaceful and joyful. This is an enforcement within myself. \nThe same thing is needed. As a nation we must enforce peace, whether it is at the border or \non the streets of our nation we have to enforce peace but enforcing peace\u2026 Interviewer: And you said, somebody, somebody has failed to do it over the last \nseventy-five years. Somebody means who? Sadhguru: \nEnforcing peace is extremely difficult when there is ambiguity about \nwhat is our nation, what is not our nation? Who are\u2026 putting our army out \nthere every day losing men, whether in the West or in \nthe now in the North, constantly, because there is so much ambiguity, because we did not understand \nwhat it means to be a nation that we have to secure what is a boundary, whether we lost something, gained something\nthat's not the important thing. The important thing is there should be no\nendless ambiguity about what is our nation what is not, because at any time somebody\ncan rake up a problem. Right now, we need to understand this. See our problems are in the West, now in the\nNorth, even with a small nation, which is so much a part of our culture and absolutely\nlike one nation it is, though it is a sep\u2026 politically separate nation. Even there we're having problems, simply because\nwe have not clearly defined our boundaries. This, the earlier you do it, \nthe better it is. Now after seventy-five years, \nnobody is willing to listen to you. You should have done it the moment \nyou get independence, within the first two, three\nyears, you must define your boundaries. This is very, very important. \nSomeone did not understand this. This is a serious flaw.\nBut this is a reality. Now at least we should strive to somehow define\nthe boundaries of this nation so that every day we don't have to \nkill young people on our borders. Interviewer: Someone\u2026Well, there is a political\ncontroversy or political slugfest that is on but when you say someone should have done\nit in the first three years of independence, I think the world and the country will understand\nwhat you mean by those words. Well, thank you very much Sadhguruji for joining\nme at a time when India is facing challenges, but on a day when International Yoga will\u2026 Yoga Day will tell us the importance of Yoga\nto not only control our emotions within, but also to get out of depressions and keep our\nbody and mind absolutely fit and happy. Namaskaram and thank \nyou very much for joining. Sadhguru: Various, various very \nsimple and powerful practices being offered free to the entire world.\nEverybody should make use of it. This is not about controlling emotion. This is about transforming emotion, \neither misery or joy is a choice. We must exercise this choice. \nInterviewer: Yes. And from misery you can create ecstasy as\nSadhguruji just explained to us. Well, with that, thanking Sadhguruji. \nWe'll take a short break. News follows on the other side.\nSadhguru: Namaskaram", "SbOUSxm1LkQ": "[Music] hey there everyone I want to share with you an extremely effective system for quitting a severe marijuana addiction I was smoking in counts of top-shelf bud every single week and I had been a daily wake and baker for nearly 10 years and I had tried to quit dozens of times but I kept failing then I tried this system and I found it very easy and everything just sort of fell into place for me I'm now one year sober going strong and it could not be any happier with my decision my life has completely turned around and I want to help you turn yours around as well let's get started you I know I'm about to receive a ton of flack for this video I know that marijuana can be used as a safe medicine or is a wonderful supplement and that it's one of the safest and most harmless mind-altering substances on the planet and I'm also aware that the vast majority who smoke pot will not become addicted to it so I'm not here to bash marijuana but the research does show that roughly 1 in 10 individuals who regularly toke up will become dependent on cannabis and develop an unhealthy relationship with the herb which sometimes is not so bad we all need crutches to carry us through the rough patches sometimes but if we begin to feel that the crutches are limiting us or dragging us down or we've become hopelessly dependent upon it or it's beginning to harm our relationships or our productivity or a financial well-being then it may be a good idea to consider stopping the usage maybe what was once alleviating anxiety is now causing even more of it or with once kept the depression at bay is now starting to depress you even more in my case my marijuana addiction started off slowly at first where I would just smoke on the weekends you know from time to time with my friends but I loved it so much that I gradually started to combine it with more and more activities because it just seemed to make everything that much better why why watch Netflix sober wouldn't it be better if I were stoned why go for a walk in nature sober why not smoke up before playing guitar or gaming or listening to an audiobook or eating a nice meal or going for a bike ride I began to fall into a cycle of waking and baking where I felt trapped like I was in a prison what once was a ton of fun and made everything better had now become my baseline without it I was absolutely miserable and with it things were no longer that much better anyways I basically didn't even get high anymore I just needed it to feel normal before I had my first sip of coffee in the morning I was so stoned that I would get borderline panic attacks if I had to leave the house or interact with anyone the first hour of waking up was awesome and then the rest of the day went by in a cloud of smoke and lazy anxiety every hour I would smoke more and more to try and recapture that first hour of glory but the burnout followed by the lift up just progressively made me more and more tired and groggy what I once felt was liberating my mind was now trapping it in bondage now for starters anything can become psychologically addictive and that includes pot would anyone really care to argue that gambling or porn can't become serious addictions second THC indirectly boosts dopaminergic transmission in the brain and anything that increases dopamine transmission can become physically addictive as well and so therefore marijuana can become physically addictive as well as mentally addictive not too many people know about that I have first-hand experience with this and just because it may have not become addictive to you doesn't mean that we can't become addictive to others I quit change smoking cigarettes after many years so I do have some experience in dealing with addiction both physical and mental and because I had underlying mental illnesses which I was using the marijuana to cope with including anxiety depression and post-traumatic stress I actually found it much harder to quit pot than cigarettes I'm talking orders of magnitude more difficult when I quit cigarettes I was angry and irritable for several days but when I quit pot I felt like I was in a never-ending dark tunnel and that the meaning of life had somehow been drained from my very existence it was horrible furthermore for those of you saying that you will not experience any withdrawal symptoms from quit but again that may be true for you and it may be true for most users that they won't experience any withdrawal symptoms when they stop and it may even be true that even if there are withdrawal symptoms at least they're not life-threatening like opiates or alcohol but again I need to stress I could not eat or sleep properly for nearly a week the first dozen or so times when I quit my clothes would drench and sweat every few hours I experienced the most insane mood changes and nightmares that I didn't even experienced when quitting nicotine so what are those if they're not physical withdrawal symptoms now here's how to quit easily everyone's marijuana addiction will differ slightly this is because you are actually not only addicted to the THC you're not addicted to the HAI itself that's a component of the addiction but you are actually addicted to everything surrounding the hi you're addicted to the rituals and the relationships surrounding the addiction now I used to roll fat bullets I used to love walking to the weed store and scoping out and sniffing all the new product and asking questions about it from the overly knowledgeable cheery red eyed staff I was addicted to grinding a nice juicy fat nug and taking a deep heartfelt width right into the core of my stomach and then rolling the perfect cone blunt and sucking on the tobacco edges to get it to stick together and then twisting and rolling up and inserting the tip calling up my bro's or grabbing my girl and going out into nature to spend 15 quality minutes of peace and good conversation while the blunt is passed around and enjoyed a month or so after I quit smoking pot and the THC was completely out of my system I didn't even miss the high so much anymore so much as I missed the taste the feel and the process of smoking a nice blunt summer beautiful with awesome people I apologize sincerely if I just triggered your cravings there but I needed to paint a picture for you of how the addiction works did you notice that none of that description was about the actual effects of marijuana none of that description contained any anything about the HAI itself you see it's not only the weed it's the grinding the rolling delighting the toking the friends all the little rituals involved it all comes together to form your addiction so I found it very helpful to keep this in mind and to break down the addiction into its component parts and to begin to address them one by one you know like taking a daunting task and making it more manageable personally I broke my marijuana addiction down into three parts one the THC and the high itself - the social component and three the ritual component of rolling and smoking I took a break from the social component while I tackled the THC component I decided to make things easier for myself by maintaining the ritual of rolling and smoking while I was detoxing my body from the THC I'll explain how to do this in just a moment but first let me take a quick look at the social component if you're able to go camping for 3 to 5 days or take some sort of vacation away from it all that can often be enough of a break from the social component to get over that first hurdle of marijuana addiction though if the only reason you hang out with your friends is to smoke pot and it's the only activity that you guys ever do together then you may have a much harder time with this component and there might be some tough choices for you to make it might be a good to consider limiting the time that you spend around them depending on how how serious you want to take quitting you know how serious you want to take sobriety also if it's up your alley then the ultimate form of social seclusion to help you quit smoking pot is by undertaking a 10-day silent meditation retreat but they are extremely challenging and they're not for everyone and not everyone can afford to take the ten days off the work to do one but if it is up your alley if it is something that you're interested in then I would really recommend checking out my video on the psychology of ten day silent the pasta meditation retreats no quitting weed will be ten times easier in the early days if you simply switch over to smoking CBD weed instead and this is weed that has either zero THC or negligible amounts of THC in it it must be far less than 1% don't cheat yourself here this is because you will still be able to maintain the ritual and habit of smelling it and grinding it and rolling it and smoking it and the CBD will also help to ease the physical withdrawals from the THC so your mood flashes are gonna be reduced you're gonna have an easier time eating and sleeping it's also just going to kill you out a little bit it's gonna reduce your anxiety it's it's gonna make the whole process go a lot smoother trust me on this one now the CBD weed therefore helps us on two fronts one it maintains the ritualistic component of the addiction therefore making the quitting process more manageable by shrinking it while at the same time directly alleviating the THC withdrawals now eventually you can either quit smoking the CBD weed or you can move over to CBD capsules if you like so you know personally I still use the CBD capsules after almost a year of quitting Mead and I nothing but positive benefits from it so it's something that I highly recommend now to further alleviate the symptoms of the withdrawal and missing the THC high and to help transform my mindset and my mental frame I used psilocybin micro dosing the first few days I actually used a higher dose 100 milligrams in the morning and in the afternoon the micro dosing seems to have this powerful ability to help support any major change that you want to make in your life if you're looking to start exercising more or being more disciplined or eating healthier for whatever reason the micro dosing seems to be great at easing transitions and supporting positive self development and growth something else that will be absolutely key for those treacherous first few days take a look at my video on micro dosing the psilocybin standard stack because towards the end of that video I go into detail on a healing ritual that I still do every single week which has extremely potent stress relief and anti-inflammatory properties this is gonna make a world of difference and it will help you tremendously during those first few days I highly recommend following that ritual for the first three days at least it will really help you fall asleep as well trust me finally it's important to fill the void of lead with something healthy and productive I recommend daily nature walks or walks of any kind getting it to yoga and meditation which will help you alter your consciousness and give you a natural high without needing to smoke up you can try taking up a new hobby as well have you always wanted to learn how to play the guitar or speak a new language or something like that then go for it start off lightly set small goals like practicing the new language on duolingo for 15 minutes a day or practicing the guitar for 20 minutes a day or you could get into some sort of sport or jogging or martial arts or taking up yoga classes anything and finally don't be too hard on yourself if you stumble a few times while trying to quit I stumbled you know dozens of times in in the early days before I stumbled upon this system here it happens to the best of us you simply need to redefine yourself as someone who does not smoke pot and build up the determination and the resolve and vow to keep fighting the good fight and nothing will stop you from your inevitable success good luck take care I'll see you on the other side [Music]", "COxEoW_rsLw": "well hi everybody great to be with you today as an accent my name's Samantha Miller I'm the president chief scientists of pure analytics and chief science officer of Humboldt brand products really excited to share with you today everything that I can about major and minor cannabinoids and how they work in your body along with some great things about current research on PTSD cancer neuropathy and more so let's get started you know cannabinoids are substances that are produced both in plants and in the human body and they're responsible for some but not all of the effects that you experience from cannabis and in fact some of the other effects may be due to things like terpenoids and flavonoids phyto cannabinoids are one type of cannabinoid so you'll hear the terms phyto cannabinoid and endocannabinoid phyto cannabinoids are the ones that are produced by plants the cannabis plant is the only plant that's known to produce really significant amounts of this viscous resin and when you look at close-up shot of the surface of a cannabis plant you can actually physically see the phyto cannabinoids accumulating in the resin glands so the resin glands are those little structures on the plant have a little stalk with a ball on the end and that's where the phyto cannabinoids actually accumulate so the THC and CBD are right there in those resin glands endocannabinoids are a very similar class of substances but what's really interesting about them is that they're made naturally in the human body you know back in the 80s when I was a little kid we used to see these commercials this is your brain and this is your brain on drugs and you'd see the two eggs in a frying pan it was really interesting to me to learn was that we actually didn't even know that there were things called endocannabinoids or something called an endocannabinoid system in our bodies that's a natural architecture for interacting with cannabinoids and that's actually the reason that humans have such strong interactions with cannabinoids is because we have this natural architecture in our bodies to interact with them the endocannabinoid system is a network of receptors in our body receptors we can think of receptors as little docking sites right in your brain and all over your body these little docking sites that cannabinoids connect with and cause all of the different things that you experience from them let's talk a little bit about THC and CBD and CBN those three together are often referred to as the major cannabinoids the reason is is because they're often the most prevalent although current analysis is showing that cbc maybe should be called a major cannabinoid these days as well because it's present in almost every sample and at a decent level sometimes higher than CBD the relative amounts of THC and CBD are of a lot of interest to people right now you hear people talk about ratios one to one and two to one and 15 to one and twenty to one and it matters it matters how much THC relative to CBD there is because those are specific for specific ailments so a 20 to one CBD to THC cannabis flower or tincture for example may be good for addressing one thing like seizure control where a one to one or a two to one CBD to THC substance or tincture might be the best thing safe for pain relief so the ratio is specific to the application so that's why we care about ratio and that's why we talk about it a question I get asked a lot is is there anything you can do during the growing stages of the plant to change it from a THC plant to a CBD plant and unfortunately the answer is no you know I've been asked is there a nutrient can I water starve it can I change the light can I do anything to it to change that THC plant to a CBD plant and unfortunately the answer is no whether a plant is THC dominant or CBD dominant is actually determined by genetics so if it's a 15 percent THC planner is a 15 percent CBD plant the fact that that's the dominant cannabinoid isn't something that you can change but what you can change is the total accumulation of the plant so that can be affected by growing conditions you know if a plant doesn't have the right growing conditions nutrients soil and water it won't produce as much cannabinoid and the final potency percentage won't be as high so that is something that you can affect now there's three main types of cannabinoid ratio that you can consider there's cannabis that's very high THC there's cannabis it's very high CBD and right in the middle there is cannabis where you have equal amounts of THC and CBD and again which bucket cannabis ends up in high CBD high THC or equal amounts of the two is determined by genetics of the plant THC is probably the cannabinoid that we're all the most familiar with it's the one that's been talked about the most it's the one that for a long time people attributed most of the effects of cannabis to this one molecule to THC we know more than that now which we'll talk about throughout this presentation today but the reason that people talk a lot about THC is it has some pretty big effects you know THC is the main psychoactive or intoxicating component in cannabis you know when we talk about that it's to indicate that there's a shift right and the way you feel in your emotional state when you consume THC now THC is referred to in a few different ways out there you'll see THC you'll see Delta 9 THC Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol so those are all the same thing THC is generally the most abundant cannabinoid in cannabis but that's been changing as more people have focused on developing more CBD strains and we'll talk about CBD a lot as well today one of the fascinating things about THC is that it actually exists in different forms in the plant so you actually have THC acid as its dominant form in the growing plant and THC is the form that you find after it's been heated so when you put something in your pipe and smoke it you're actually doing some chemistry converting THC teach the acid to THC now there's a lot of confusion amongst patients about THC acid and THC you know a lot more is known about THC THC acid is just coming into our purview as something that we're interested in and we want to know about the researchers who are the original people who pioneered cannabinoid research when you ask them at the conferences you say ruff Raphael Michelin like why aren't you studying THC acid he was like oh there's nothing to it there's nothing there it doesn't have strong effects in the body near Raphael's around it's because of people who went out there is evangelists and as early adopters and tried this and have built bodies of anecdotal evidence to say there's something interesting going on here with these acidic cannabinoids so THC acid is the form it's in like I said before it's been heated that means in the growing plant or in dried material let's say on the shelf in a jar and dispensary that's the form that most of it is in the conversion of THC acid to THC is called decarboxylation that's a big word I like the word activation more and I think it's a little bit more intuitive so you'll hear me use the term activation and decarboxylation interchangeably at room temperature decarboxylation can actually also occur over time so as your cannabis sits in that jar you can actually have some of that conversion as well so it's not entirely stable smoking or vaporizing activates or D carboxylates THC acid and turns it into THC making it available for those experiences that you're most accustomed to for reliable decarboxylation of THC acid to THC you know a lot of people are interested in that because they're making their own medicine at home if you want to do that my best advice is to heat your raw cannabis you know don't put it into butter first but just the raw cannabis itself on a baking sheet in the oven so if you pre-heat your oven to 212 degrees Fahrenheit and you bake it and keep it in a thin layer to make sure that the heat can actually penetrate all the material he did for 90 minutes and you'll have great THC acid to THC conversion so so why do we care so I've talked about this thing exists we have it how do you convert one to the other so but why do you care about it well the reason you care about THC acid and THC and the difference between them is because the effects are totally different and in many cases the therapeutic application is totally different depending on the patient and their needs and what's right for you it really depends on your desired effects and the relief that you need THC acid has been exciting to people lately because there's a lot of new people coming to cannabis and they want to try it for the first time they've got one hesitation though that's the intoxication component to it maybe they're not comfortable letting go not having control in that moment so THC acid preparations tinctures especially you can find THC acid in are a great way for people to try cannabis for the first time without a whole lot of danger of fear of intoxication there's a lot of interesting findings from these bodies of patient anecdotal evidence that we've been putting together to show that THC acid has some pretty substantial anti-inflammatory properties and may have some anti [ __ ] properties as well more work needs to be done on that but there's some clear indications that there's more to learn there you know when I talk about THC acid patients are really you know interested and concerned how can I get access to that like what kind of products can I find THC acid in well the the most direct way is through juicing so you can actually juice raw cannabis both the leaves and the flowers if you're juicing flowers you do need to add a little bit of water into your blender as well or school turn out quite right wheatgrass juice blenders juicers are actually the best ones to use because of the way that they process the material some juicers can actually activate the THC acid and converts it to THC during the process of juicing because of the amount of heat that's used so you want to use a juicer that doesn't have a lot of heat if you're concerned about preserving your cannabinoid acids glycerin tinctures that are made without any heat or alcohol tinctures made without any heat are another place that you can find acidic cannabinoids water extracted hash will often have a small amount of activation but you can keep the majority of it in the acid form as well and you can capsulize that so you can take it as an oral ingestible as a capsule so those are some strategies in ways that you can access acidic cannabinoids and try them if you're interested one of the other things that's been interesting as i've have worked with several patients concerning the use of THC acid and THC is there's a distinct time-phased effect that's different for THC acid what we've learned is that if you're interested in pursuing THC acid therapy you have to try it for a while to make sure you're actually experiencing the benefit for many patients is actually up to three to four weeks after daily use that they truly start to experience the benefit I have a lot of patients who approached me and they say Samantha you know I'm trying to choose is it THC acid therapy or is it th which one is it that I want you know aren't we funny as humans that way right we want to be an a/b thing but really the answer is it's probably both you know I myself I have fibromyalgia so I deal with chronic pain and there's days where I have really acute days they're really bad days acidic cannabinoid therapy on a daily basis is something that can lower the overall symptom level of someone who has a condition like mine chronic pain condition but on those acute days I probably need some THC and so they can really complement one another so the acidic cannabinoid therapy to bring down that total level of symptoms that you're feeling and the activated cannabinoids to really help you deal with that in the moment situation because THC as you know you feel very immediately and can give you that immediate relief if you need it to help promote your quality of life and keep you functional for that day when you are pursuing THC acid therapy especially if you're doing it to avoid intoxication you really do need to make sure you understand that there is going to be a small amount in that activated form THC present so you may still feel a little bit of psycho activity but it certainly should be a lot less than if the whole thing was activated again most of our evidence around THC acid therapy has to do with patient anecdotal evidence that's been gathered by various clinicians even dispensaries who are doing their own research there's a certain dispensaries have gone on a mission to gather data and figure out what's really happening with some of these unique substances some of the things that we've observed are reduction in inflammation and muscle convulsions in spasticity but the one that fascinates me the most is changes in cognitive development in children who are taking acidic cannabinoid therapies we see some really amazing shifts in their behavior both from THC acid and CBD acid we see changes and emotional intelligence in speech and cognition I'm fascinated to see what the further research on THC acid reveals and we should be really fascinating people often wonder what's normal for THC should it take care of my pain should it take care of my nausea like what is it really supposed to do for me there's been a lot of research that's been done there's certainly more to do but we have some really clear ground that you can stand on and say THC is great for these things it's great for mild to moderate pain relief and it's become because of that has become a great option for people to wean themselves off of opioid therapy say from post-surgical pain for some people they can deal with post-surgical pain using cannabis for many people that's a challenge and they often need the opioids for a few days but cannabis can be an incredible tool for getting yourself off of that addictive medication as quickly as possible so you don't experience those side effects control of nausea is a very significant finding around THC people with cancer and AIDS and who are taking a lot of different pharmaceutical regimens to help get them through their condition off an experience a lot of nausea and also the need for appetite stimulation as we all know THC does a great job at appetite stimulation sometimes when you don't want it to THC can also be a great solution for insomnia for many people helping people go to sleep and then stain is sleep a little bit longer the one thing that we should always consider especially for new users to cannabis who are trying THC for the first time is that for some people it's not always totally a great experience so if you suffer from anxiety or you find yourself on the bipolar spectrum or with schizophrenia or with conditions like that THC may exacerbate your condition so if you fall into that spectrum you really want to make sure that you work closely with your doctor if you're just thinking about exploring THC dominant cannabis and your therapy regimen and make sure that it's the right choice for you and then it's done in a controlled manner because everybody needs to be successful and their therapeutic regimen that one might need a little bit more guidance and some THC levels for flowers are really interesting you know in owning the lab for the last seven years it's been fascinating to actually watch that potency average rise in addition to the the potency average of flowers rising you see all these other kind of new products coming out but a lot of people wonder like what's normal for flowers what's average what's high what's low so in Northern California where my laboratory does testing we see the average range of THC dominant flowers to be about sixteen and a half percent once you get over about eighteen to twenty percent that's near in the strong range and over 21 percent you have a lot fewer strings that qualify and if another dividing line is 25% you do have some strains that perform over 25 percent THC but it's a lot fewer than below so it's good to understand what average ranges are and also that there is actually a value associated with those ranges and so if your economics of cannabis use matter to you then it might be good to understand what things fall into your price range and how you can best use those in your therapy regimen there is a whole class of patience right now who's really interested in the mild to moderate range of THC potency especially older people I know as I get older my response to THC definitely changes we often have a lower tolerance level for it as we get older so those lower THC products say 10% THC and below are becoming more attractive to those new people who are coming to cannabis for the first time so just because it's low potency doesn't mean it's bad it just means it's right for a different person than something that's high THC so we've had this explosion of concentrates especially in California I mean in every legal market I'm sure but I'm here in California so that's where I see it the most I remember the first time I saw a BHO wax I remember the first time I saw a shatter and as a chemist I was fascinated by it and I asked them about it and they wouldn't tell me anything it's top secret in others videos all over YouTube the times I think all of this stuff so it's certainly no secret anymore and as the secret has gotten out the proliferation of it's been amazing and what's really fascinating is it's really changed the potency thresholds that people are accustomed to and that they expect in the marketplace so interesting to know that Keefe you know so that's a cannabis that's been run and over a dry sieve say and the resin glands collected generally doesn't get over about 30 or 40 percent THC and more often it's actually a little bit below that with hash so traditional hash like you used to see coming se out of Afghanistan and Pakistan in places like that which you actually don't see much of anymore generally ranges between about 10 to 60% with average being at about 48 bubble hash which is water extracted hash still popular all it's waning in its popularity as other extracts come into the market co2 extracts and BHO extracts and all these different things that people are doing but water extracted hash you know averages at about 50% and really tops out around 65 or so you do have a few rare ones that go higher than that but the average is a real solid 50 percent wax or BHO or shatter co2 extracts you know those are chemical extracts so bubble hash hash and Keith are all made by what we call a mechanical process right where you physically remove resin glands and gather them and press them together whereas these new concentrates are totally different so they come from a process of chemical extraction so the extraction of cannabis with butane with co2 with propane some with nitrogen there's a variety of things that you can use but that chemical extraction as you might expect as much more efficient so you get much higher concentrates um ranging upwards of 90 plus percent definitely something to be careful with if you're a new user but can be a great source of relief and very concentrated dose of cannabinoids if needed for the right patient let's move on to talking about CBD a lot of talk about CBD people are really excited about CBD you know when I first started speaking to patient audiences seven years ago I would ask people who's heard of CBD in here and I get a couple hands half timidly raised when I asked that question to an audience today everybody raises their hand until they know what CBD is which is a really cool thing to happen in five or seven years so why do we care about CBD and what's the buzz you know what is it all about well it's different from THC in many ways in both the way that it makes you feel and a therapeutic applications so CBD has been called non psychoactive or non intoxicating the way I like to say it is you'll still be able to operate heavy equipment afterwards probably so CBD is a great option for people who again who are seeking cannabinoid therapy are a little concerned about the feelings of intoxication they might experience from THC and would really prefer to take baby steps in to cannabis they feel safer so CBD has become one of those things that people can try in a safe way in a safe place in addition there's a greater level of permissions right they've been created around CBD both legally and culturally in our society and that entry point of that kind of environment of permissions that's being created for CBD is really exciting because it's really been the impetus for changing the conversation around cannabinoid therapy focusing on the medicinal therapeutic and less on the psychoactivity and intoxication components that have historically been our kind of cultural association with cannabis CBD is interesting in that it's usually found at low levels so sub 1% less than 1% but in some cannabis it's the dominant cannabinoid although that does occur more rarely than with THC there's a lot of efforts underway to create more CBD strains their seed collectives there's independent growers there's companies who are making products now and they want the only specific cannabinoids to be present especially CBD so there's a lot of work around developing more CBD strains and creating more access to CBD for patient population so interestingly CBD like THC also has an acid form CBD acid or CBD a fascinating of course that both of course are non intoxicating as CBD is not intoxicating if THC is present though it's good to understand that you may still feel some feelings of intoxication so CBD does really lower the overall feelings of intoxication that you're going to feel from THC because of the way that they interact but you still may feel a little bit so if you do feel some intoxication don't be surprised it's because of the THC present the therapeutic uses of CBD and CBD acid are different a lot less is known about CBD acid fewer people have used it but it has been the one that has shown some pretty incredible shifts in children who are using it again as with THC acid the time to feel the effects are different so with CBD acid therapy you may need to be using CBD acid tincture or juicing three to four weeks before you actually feel that overall reduction of your symptom level one of the best stories that I heard about Beadie acid therapy was out in the village of Mendocino in Northern California and I was visiting a little collective out there called the Leonard Moore cooperative we've done a lot of work to try and promote CBD and there was a patient of theirs that had ALS and it was a fairly far advanced case of it and she was about to go into Hospice and the family was really upset about that they really wanted her at home you know everybody does better at home and so you know there in that moment of desperation and they were gonna try anything and they got some juice to cannabis from Leonard more cooperative and that juiced cannabis being given to her on a daily basis is what kept her off of a feeding tube and kept her out of hospice and so she was able to have really an incredibly higher quality of life through CBD acid therapy and there's there's so many stories like that we don't have enough time to tell but it can be a very powerful alternative to the drugs that people are using or the care regimens that we start to pursue as as people go into end-of-life so like with THC acid there is a recipe for conversion if you need to convert CBD acid to CBD say for a product or a tincture that you're making to help with your own therapeutic regimen and there's some specific conditions so again heating raw cannabis in your oven so not in oil or anything else is the best way to do it you want to spread it out on a baking sheet pre-heat your oven to 295 so it's a higher temperature than with THC and heat it for ninety minutes and you'll get great CBD acid to CBD conversion if you don't go to that 295 degree temperature your conversion probably won't occur or I'll occur in a partial way so really important that you hit that temperature and because it's important you hit the temperature I recommend that people buy an additional temperature gauge for their oven so you can often buy them right in the grocery store and the little gadget aisle you can hang it right in your oven and make sure that you're actually at the right temperature because I'll tell you our oven thermostats are terrible for the most part I have learned so when people are looking for CBD and they're looking for it the flower form they're often kind of restricted to asking about specific strain names some strains that you can look for that are likely to be CBD dominant are things like tsunami Harlequin canna tonic Harless sue can ASSU stinky pink diesel and of course Charlotte's Web that we heard about a lot from Sanjay Gupta interestingly stinky pink diesel was the first I know it's a funny name was the first high bead high CBD strain that was isolated and identified here in California through lab testing that happened at Harbor side it was a strain that came out of very very small growing community in Mendocino County called Koval oh and I remember doing a seminar out in Koval Oh about six years ago now in the public library there and as a very small place about six people came and the woman who actually had created that strain and submitted it for testing and was it was actually there so it was a pleasure to meet her she stills got those genetics and is holding on to him tight you know that's one of the things that's been interesting about CBD is because it's been so limited in supply and there have been so few people who have held the genetics there was a tendency for a long time to hold on to them and and not share them with people what's really exciting is that we've had some producers and breeders and creators like Lawrence Ringo who made all of their genetics available in seed form to whoever wanted to buy them so that's been a really exciting change in CBD is it's now very publicly available for people who say want to grow it themselves or work with it themselves the therapeutic uses of CBD are different from THC complimentary but different so it definitely deals with pain just like THC does but it attacks pain from a different side than THC it definitely reduces inflammation as THC does but it specifically deals with pain due to spasticity and there are a lot of chronic pain conditions that originate from muscle spasticity fibromyalgia multiple sclerosis I mean epilepsy it's origin is spasticity and that's why you've seen CBD become a go-to therapeutic alternative for many people who suffer from these spasticity related conditions CBDs also been shown in some more modern research to be very effective for eliminating chemotherapy induced neuropathy and also neuropathy in general even diabetic neuropathy so that work was done in a very formal setting and was actually very clear so CBD has a lot of different uses especially for people suffering from chronic pain one of its other major applications is as an anti-anxiety substance so CBD for many people who suffer from anxiety really seems to provide them incredible relief now I never recommend that somebody go off of their anxiety medication without consulting their doctor but for many patients they've been able to either find it as a compliment or a substitution for a more traditional pharmaceutical regimen that they were previously on CBD has also been shown in some research to perhaps have some anti-tumor activity for particular types of tumors a little bit later in the presentation we'll talk a little bit more about that research for people who are using CBD and THC together they have some interesting interplay with one another that's good to understand because they become tools in your toolkit as a patient and a user with a therapeutic regimen that you're trying really to have be successful so CBD actually prolongs the effects of THC and the way that it does that is actually inhibits the enzyme that breaks down THC in our liver so when CBD connects with that enzyme it changes its shape and so THC doesn't fit in it very well anymore and can't be broken down and so it recirculates and we experience it for a longer period of time CBD also reduces the feelings of intoxication from THC so when I tell people that CBD is gonna make their THC last longer they're alright I'm gonna get high for longer well it's a little bit different than that you'll probably be less high but your therapeutic benefits will last for longer so it's a point at which we have to kind of separate those two ideas the expected CBD levels for flowers are a little bit different than for THC especially when we're looking at CBD flowers that have a one-to-one or a balanced ratio because think about it you couldn't have 20% THC and 20% CBD in the plant right no one to another they 40% cannabinoid and they just don't accumulate at that level no lab has shown that result yet so the only time that you really see CBD go above 20% or even in that range are in those 20 to 1 CBD to THC flowers oftentimes and say a one-to-one CBD flower you'll see something like 5% CBD and 5% THC or maybe 7% and 7% so the levels are a lot lower than you see in those THC flowers that we've really optimized for potency over so many different years how high the CBD level is again depends on ratio so if you're dealing with a twenty to one you can actually see CBD levels up as high as twenty but with balanced or with lower ratios you're going to see them more in the single-digit range so that doesn't mean that it's poor quality and I know we have this idea that cannabis at a certain percentage means that it's low quality so you kinda have to throw that out the door when it comes to CBD it's just an entirely different thing to consider let's talk about cbn a little bit you know it's gotten kind of a bad rap and you know there's a reason why it's a byproduct of THC degradation so when THC degrades it becomes CBN that usually happens in the presence of UV light and oxygen and I used to say to the growers that I would talk to you so don't put it in the turkey bag and throw it in the corner of your room and little light run across it and back and forth all day because that UV in addition the oxygen the bag is going to cause CBN conversion a lot of dispensaries and people in the kind of open market of cannabis view CBN is a negative indicator of either processing or age on cannabis that's true but it has to be taken with a grain of salt it really only applies to indoor grown cannabis outdoor grown cannabis is going to naturally have a small amount of CBN present due to the UV that's impinging on it from the Sun and the weathering that's happening as it grows in the outdoor environment during the entire grow season so not uncommon to find say 0.5% CBN in an outdoor grown flower that's been perfectly grown and perfectly processed and is very fresh so CBN is not always an indicator of negativity either in the growth conditions or in processing so good to understand that it also has some interesting therapeutic benefits one of the ones that's interesting to me especially is around cardiovascular effects it actually decreases heart rate without decreasing blood flow so can bring your heart rate down some animal model research has also said that CBN induces feelings of grogginess I actually did some consumer testing along the way in developing the humble products to look at CBN and I found very clearly that CBN is a very dose dependent substance and that at low doses can be effective as a sleep aid but as you go into moderate and high doses actually seems to be contraindicated for sleep and can be alerting to many people so there's a very interesting finding and in fact found throughout our work that LOC cbn dose and a dose of THC accompanied with Mersin are virtually equivalent so let's talk a little bit about some of the minor cannabinoids THC and CBD and CBN we hear about those a lot there's other ones that have started to percolate up you know we hear about them here and there but we don't know a lot about them part of its because not a lot of research has been done so there's more work to do but there's some interesting things to look at CBC is one of my favorite I think it has a lot of promise you know CBD has been shown to be a very powerful anti anxiety substance in the preliminary research that's been done CBC has been shown to have 10 times the anti-anxiety effects of CBD Wow interestingly CBC is present and elevated amounts in juvenile plants and then as the plant grows older and matures and flowers you have lower CBC levels there have been some plants that have been isolated that are CBC rich plants and they are actually mutant plants that can't produce THC and CBD very well and so because they can't produce THC and CBD very well the CBC is allowed to accumulate the reason why is that they all share the same starting material so this little pile of something called CBG acid inside the plant and the THC enzyme the CBD enzyme and the CBC enzyme all grab on to that CBG acid as their starting material to convert to become the cannabinoids that they eventually are THC CBD and CBC so when the THC enzyme and the CBD enzyme aren't grabbing any of that b:g acid it's just left there for the CBC in Xiamen it goes to town and starts to accumulate uns that's the only time you really see it at appreciable levels in a mature plant so there hasn't been very many of those identified so that's kind of that's the search right for the ambitious grower out there is that CBC mutant CBC's also been shown to have anti-inflammatory and pain relieving effects as well cannabidiol or CBD is an interesting one as well it's non psychoactive or non intoxicating as a CBC by the way again anti-inflammatory and pain relieving effects seems to be a theme right you hear from almost every cannabinoid THC CBD CBC now CBG we're hearing that pain relieving an anti-inflammatory effects so if you're dealing with pain cannabis is a great solution or a great thing to drive for people you know we often hear about cannabis and glaucoma and I don't know we've all probably heard Peter Tosh this song where he talks about it too right I always associated that especially with the way people express it and talked about it what it had to do with THC but if you look at the research you'll see that what was actually shown to be reducing intraocular pressure in glaucoma patients in the research that's been performed with CBG in many of the cases that have been identified so it's also an interesting molecule to look at therapeutic li CBG acid as I said is the precursor to both THC and CBD in the growing plant but you always have a small amount of CBG that's left over and sometimes it's not a small amount it can actually help growers look at an indicator of whether or not they allowed their plant to mature longer so a mature plant that was harvested in an optimal time probably have 1% or less of CBG maybe up to one and a half percent but you can see plants with as much as five or six percent CBG present in them basically what you're looking at there if it's not a genetic mutant is a plant that was just harvested a little bit too early that balance and that varying balance between the different cannabinoids as well as the other substances of the plant at different points of maturity and harvests are some of the things that shape preferences that people have say for early mid to late harvest products THC v also has a lot of buzz about it tetrahydrocannabinol it's a mouthful there's been limited research on it it's a very rare cannabinoid in my laboratory we've isolated three different cultivars of THC cannabis over 5% by weight so those are very interesting all in one small community in Mendocino so they've been kind of collecting genetics it's sifting through to them to see if they can find th DV and a few of them have the animal model research assist some interesting things about THC v relative to THC and that is is that the presence of THC v is thought to bring on the feelings of THC stronger and quicker so it quicker hi that's more intense but also has a shorter duration I said call it the quickie right if you can actually find the THC v cannabis there's also been research people say hey Samantha where do I get some of that diet weed and I say diet weed well what's the diet weed the diet weed it turns out is th T V cannabis so there's been some animal model research that suggested that it actually prevents the munchies which if you struggle with your weight and you smoke cannabis may be a significant issue for you not being proven out in humans yet so as soon as we get more THC th T V cannabis for everybody to try we'll have to run that one to ground and see if it really is the diet weed but there's a lot of people excited about the prospect of that right now there's also a related compound on the CBD side called CBD V Orkin a bit of Eron CBD v and THC v are both what we call propyl cannabinoids they have a three carbon ring on them that what makes them a little bit different CBD v is also a non intoxicating cannabinoid and it's thought to perhaps be one of the differentiators in CBD dominant cannabis that has greater or lesser efficacy for epilepsy treatment so interestingly in in groups of epilepsy patients who have been trying lots of different CBD strains we find that they don't all work the same some work better than others they maybe have the same CBD to THC ratio so you can tell it's not about that it's not just about the CBD and THC well one of the other things it's present can be CBD v and some preliminary animal model research has shown that CBD v has significant anti spasticity properties so it may be that the anti spasticity properties of CB DV when coupled with CB d really create the best solution for a lot of people when treating epilepsy and spasticity but more to learn on that as well there's a lot of exciting research happening right now and it's an exciting time in that our government here in the u.s. even is allowing more research up to this time a lot of it has had to happen in more international places in Spain and Italy and Israel and Canada who have had a Amsterdam who've had a greater level of permissions than we have there's been a few pioneers here in the u.s. dr. Sean McAllister is one of them he's out of California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco and Sean is a true pioneer you can you two of him and watch him all day if you'd like to what Sean did was he induced tumors into animals into rats so you can actually buy cancer many people don't know that but you can buy cancer and you can give it to things as in a clinical setting so these rats were given cancer and they were allowed to grow tumors in this case breast tumors were the specific case study that I saw from from Sean so he showed a picture of this ugly tumor on this poor rats chest and then he made CBD THC injections into that tumor and after 30 days of the injections at the right ratio of CBD to THC that tumor completely disappeared and the next thing that Sean shows is a picture of a rat with nothing but beautiful pink skin on its belly and if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes I probably wouldn't believe it because it's such an amazing transformation so Sean's work is really exciting he's really diving down into whether the specific cannabinoid ratios that are needed to treat a specific type of cancer Sean was a rebel he got his first research grant under the auspices of actually demonstrating that cannabis wasn't good for you and and bless Sean for that because that was how he got the funding to make these findings now the NIH is willing to fund his research at face value as a benefit for finding cures for cancer so that's an exciting shift as well there's been a lot of research on PTSD we have a lot of people in our society these days suffering from it from all of the wars that we've had recently addition to just the stress and pain of this fast-paced culture that we're all living in right now so there's been a lot of looking at how can cannabis help these people recover and come back to normalcy and enjoy a greater quality of life well we've shown that THC when it stimulates the cb1 receptor can interrupt memories and we all know that cannabis affects our memory wearing work and if personally in anecdotally but it can on a on a more clinical level so when your memories are disrupted that way when you have PTSD it can actually let you have that break where you can get control and get control of your thoughts and control that looping and that focusing on that negative experience you had which is the root of that PTSD so again through animal model research and showing that stimulation of the cb1 receptor eliminates these long term negative memories there's a real prospect of hope for people who are suffering from PTSD using cannabinoid therapy instead of other pharmaceutical alternatives there was some great research at Temple University on chemotherapy induced neuropathy as well neuropathy is the degeneration of the nervous system and there's a lot of pain associated with it the study found that when CBD was administered before the chemotherapy that could actually completely prevent the onset of chemotherapy induced neuropathy so for those people that was you know an amazing amazing shift they in a 2010 FDA clinical trial they actually concluded that inhaled cannabis significantly reduced neuropathy as compared to placebo in human studies so fascinating to see the FDA and 2010 was actually doing this research which is not well known so some great things on cancer PTSD and neuropathy and one that's really been in the press a lot lately has been treatment of epilepsy that's happening through the activated CBD being administered to patients often in tincture form or orally ingestible and it's causing incredible shifts and changes in people who suffer from frequent seizures I had a story from a fellow who called me and he went to tell me about his four-year-old daughter and you could hear the sounds of him making dinner in the background all of San sounds the family I liked him from kind of the first few words he said to me was hearing and he said you know my daughter has 800 seizures a day and basically that means she's in an intractable seizures all of the time I'm really desperate to find something to help her they've got her on all of these drugs or causing all these side-effects and she has no quality of life and no interaction with the family it was a very sad story and he didn't live anywhere near me in my state so I was able to help him with was information about CBD and strain names that he could look for to try and find something to help her he called me back about a month later he said Samantha I want to tell you about what's happening I said you know she was at eight hundred seizures a day and we've had her on a CBD tincture now for a month or so and she's down to one seizure a week and later on that young lady was down to one a month it gives you chills when you think about I mean can you imagine eight hundred seizures a day was no that's one every you know every if you figure out how many minutes there on the day and that's pretty much a constant seizure so the fact that CBD can bring this kinds of relief to people is something that's opening doors and opening minds about cannabis as a therapeutic alternative sir so many of these complicated drugs that are currently being used to treat these very serious conditions so it's I'm excited to be a part of and share with you this current research and maybe help open your mind and your landscape of permissions for trying cannabis and for supporting it in the use of your families", "IaLTiJgOxdU": "hi I'm her people Josh I'm an endocrinologist and Toronto Canada today I'm going to talk about recreational cannabis use and how that may impact diabetes so we know that recreational cannabis use is a growing issue in Canada cannabis or marijuana as it's popularly called was legalized this was last year just about a year ago now and other countries maybe in some provinces in the United States there is recreational cannabis that is available but also available illegally and being used as we know in most of the parts of the world so cannabis use and diabetes is a topic that is not often discussed or known there is actually a dearth of evidence as well as literature and for us health care providers there's always this kind of knowledge gap as to how this may impact those people who have either type 1 or type 2 diabetes and how should we counsel them so diabetes Canada we came up with our position statement this is the first position statement that has been made in this specific issue that is cannabis use recreational cannabis use in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes and here is a link for that as well so first of all before I say what the position statement said I would caveat that by saying there is limitation of data high-grade evidence does not exist when it comes to cannabis use and and how it may impact either trisomy control or self-care behaviors among people with diabetes however most of the data that exists is observational cohort studies and as lower grade than what we would like and with that caveat what we what the diabetes Canada statement States is I think important and should be taken into consideration when we are discussing this with our patients so the first point is that glycemic control in people with diabetes was found to be somewhat worse in addition to self-care behaviors which my might tie in to the glycemic control self-care behaviors as to glucose testing following instructions taking their medications those kinds of behaviors may get impacted among those who use recreational cannabis on a regular basis as such and that may impact our glycemic control there is also low grade evidence that this might then impact some of the complications that come from that glycemic control or that or that worse glycemic control that might happen as well so there are some evidence linking complications to those to marijuana use in people with diabetes as well the other thing and maybe this is the last part and maybe the most important among people with type 1 diabetes there's also evidence that suggests that there is an increased risk of diabetes ketoacidosis and those people who use marijuana cannabis recreationally as well so that last last piece of course DKA or diabetic ketoacidosis is one of the one of the complications one of the dire complications of diabetes that we worry about and that has been found to be increase as well so the practical point what should be the take home for a healthcare provider from all of this I would say first of all discuss this with your patient either with type 1 or type 2 diabetes just similarly to when we talk about do use alcohol ask them in non-judgmental fashion to use cannabis or marijuana and then discuss within the limitations of the of the literature that there might be potential harm to using cannabis in terms of glycemic control self-care behaviors and potentially some complications including decay in type 1 diabetes final word I would say is individualize that counseling that you provide of course you know your patient and we need to approach each individual patient in a certain way and so make sure that we individualize that education piece to the benefit of the patient who's sitting next to you as well so I hope this was a useful information I'll be back with another sugar beet video or commentary in the near future you", "EBLmGBlEnMY": "[Applause] [Music] what's the first image that pops into your head when someone mentions the word cannabis for a lot of people it could be this or maybe this and for those of you that are better at planning ahead maybe even this basically we're all thinking joints bongs and getting stoned but modern cannabis has become a lot more complex than that nowadays when we talk about cannabis we're no longer just talking about a plant we've broken that plant down into extracts compounds and building blocks with tremendous therapeutic potential as a result cannabis is starting to look a lot less like this and a lot more like this and that's actually great news for all of us because the new version of cannabis is a lot more exciting than the old one in fact cannabis has emerged into a modern-day superfood and if we can reset our image of this plant cannabis might actually become more important to your daily routine than coffee so let me tell you how cannabis became a regular part of my daily routine when I was in my early 20s I had a moment of what you could call youthful indiscretion that set my life down a very challenging path I applied for a job on Wall Street to make matters more complicated they hired me it was fast paced and high-stress and in certain situations that stress could become pretty overwhelming so I tried everything I could to manage my anxiety including prescription medications but those came with their own side effects on my mood and my energy levels so I searched for a different solution and it took years before I actually found one I stumbled upon a little-known can extract called CBD it toned down my stress levels but still allowed me to feel clear-headed and focused and suddenly I was back in control of my daily routine I felt confident and composed and relaxed and I just sort of felt like myself now before you all get the wrong impression let me clarify that CBD does not get you high that effect comes from a completely different chemical called THC and CBD does none of that you could take all the CBD in the world watch the entire Beatles Yellow Submarine movie and you're still not going to feel high and trust me on that one see CBD doesn't impair you instead it seems to have the opposite effect which sounds a little bit like magic until we dig into the science we all have a built-in system in our bodies that keeps our internal functions in balance despite imbalance in our external environment it's called the endocannabinoid system and it regulates things like stress mood and appetite think of it like the conductor of an orchestra when one piece starts acting out of rhythm for example an overactive stress response the endocannabinoid system can step in and smooth it out CBD happens to be one of the chemicals that supports the function of this system helping that conductor to maintain rhythm throughout the body in the brain and brain imaging studies have actually proven this through these studies we know that CBD can help to modulate activity in key brain regions involved in our stress response like the amygdala in other words CBD helps your brain to function in a more balanced state when stress level spike ok so why am I telling you about biological systems in brain activity well for one I paid a lot for a degree in neuroscience and I'd kind of like to get my money's worth the other reason is that this little-known cannabis chemical it's about to change the way we all think about our daily health it's made such a big impact on my daily routine that I now dedicate myself professionally to creating healthy CBD options for people that want to give it a shot and it's not just for people with extreme anxiety or panic attacks either CBT has this gentle calming effect on mood and stress levels similar to a meditation think of it like the volume knob on a stereo CBT doesn't shut the noise off entirely it just turns that dial down a little bit so you can hear the music and because of that it's being used to help people perform better in a wide range of daily stressful scenarios from interviews to networking people that used to have a drink to calm the nerves are now trying CBD instead it is even effective for public speaking [Laughter] [Applause] multiple studies have actually been done on the effects of CVD on public speaking and have found a significant reduction in stress and discomfort compared to a control group and the potential benefits of CVD you go way beyond stress management to because of the broad function of that endocannabinoid system CPD itself can have a wide range of benefits professional athletes are now ditching prescription pills and painkillers in place of CBD and insomnia acts are turning to CBD is a potential natural remedy for more restful sleep but before you go and toss out any prescription pills I should note this does not mean that CBD is going to cure your anxiety your insomnia or your arthritis there's no one-size-fits-all solution these things and for many people prescriptions will just be the best option but the implications for CVA are pretty fascinating particularly when you consider that we may have stumbled upon a natural remedy to common ailments that affect millions of people every single day better yet you don't have to ingest a handful of pills and supplements to get those results CBD is commonly infused into foods and beverages in a way that's healthy and convenient you can get everything from CBD waters and juices to CBD olive oil and hummus but before we all go run out of here and share a giant bowl of CBD hummus it's important to consider the risk factors is CBD actually safe and what happens if we take a lot of it these are all very good questions unfortunately we do have some answers reports currently indicate that daily dosages of CBD up to 1500 milligrams are well tolerated by the body which means they're safe and to put that number in perspective here's a graph that shows common CBD dosages and food products today versus what those reports deemed to be safe and you can see it's not even close you'd have to spend thousands of dollars every single day on CBD infused food even come close to those numbers the World Health Organization has also weighed in on this stating that CVD has a good safety profile and that no public health problems have been associated with CVD use even the FDA which sets the gold standard for safe food policy in our country seems to agree with all this just last year the FDA noted little indication that CBD has abuse potential or presents a significant risk to the public health even more remarkable CBD doesn't seem to be addicting either the FDA's data also found no evidence that CBD causes physical or psychic dependence so let's recap CBD comes from plants doesn't impair you safe for adults consumed and could help millions of people it's a pretty amazing discovery right I think we should all pop open a bottle of CBD champagne to celebrate well actually not so fast because we currently sit at a pivotal moment in the history of cannabis regulation one that will determine if when and how we're even allowed to purchase cannabinoids like CBD C as a country we don't like to change our canvass laws very often we've really only done it once before when we effectively made it illegal back in 1937 and since then cannabis has been vilified for its recreational use the idea that weed equals scary is so deeply rooted in our culture that it even affects the way we think about versions of this plant that have absolutely nothing to do with its recreational use like hemp so now after an 80 year failed experiment we're finally about to revisit the cannabis question and the decisions we make today will set the course of this industry for generations to come now this is obviously a ton of responsibility and it's very important that we get it right this time part of getting it right means doing more research setting the right market marketing standards right safety guidelines because as much as we know today there is still more work to be done and a lot of products on the Shelf today just don't hold up the right quality standards but we can't continue to put it off to kick the can down the road because the longer we delay our regulatory decisions the longer we deny access to a natural solution to common ailments that should be very treatable we need to move forward based on real science one step at a time now I'm talking you about CBD today because it happens to be a pretty great first step it's healthy its natural and we have a growing database of research to support its efficacy so how do we move forward on CBD regulation well first we all need to determine what it is there are a lot of people out there who will tell us that CBD should only be a prescription medication those people are called pharmaceutical companies and there and they're well aware that this industry is projected to be worth 22 billion dollars in a few short years but maybe we're a little skeptical of those motivations because if we removed the veil of cannabis stigma CP is nothing more than a natural plant ingredient with therapeutic potential it's really more like a superfood and fortunately we already have a pretty good blueprint for that thanks to America's all-time favorite functional food caffeine now I know it might seem strange for me to stand up here and to compare something from cannabis to an everyday item like caffeine but bear with me are they really all that different they both come from plants they're safe for adults to consume and we use them to improve our mood and our energy levels interestingly enough caffeine was once vilified too back in 1909 the United States government filed a federal lawsuit against coca-cola for marketing a product that contained caffeine which they deemed to be unsafe nowadays caffeine can be found in all sorts of products from food and beverages to cosmetics and even medication we ensure that caffeine products are safe and labeled properly and then we let people decide if they want it when they want it and how they want it and since I'm sure everyone here has had some form of caffeine today it's safe to say we're all pretty comfortable with that system we need to take the same step forward with cannabis because cannabinoids like CBD should be no more threatening than a cup of coffee and if we do it the right way this time we have an opportunity now to give millions of people access to something that could improve their work lives their social lives and their overall happiness but we need to take a step back first in order to move forward and toss aside those outdated stigmas because this plant is a lot more than just weed cannabis should be viewed as therapeutic so let's hit the reset button on our image of cannabis starting with a fresh look at CBD and if we can change our perspective on one aspect of this plan maybe we can take another look at the rest of it - thank you [Music] you", "ArO6G30cO2I": "[Music] welcome to the doctor Gundry podcast on this program we never shy away from controversial topics and today is no exception my guest Jenny sanssouci and I will be discussing the healing properties of cannabis CBD and medicinal mushrooms jenny is a health coach wellness blogger and the author of the new book the rebels apothecary a practical guide to the healing magic of cannabis CBD and mushrooms now she became an expert on these ancient remedies after her father was diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer as it turns out something that was once considered taboo was key in helping her dad so she's here today to tell you how you can use these plants and fungi safely Jenny welcome to the program thanks so much for having me well this is gonna be fun so can you start by telling our listeners about why and how you got interested in mushrooms and cannabis sure yeah well in 2017 Thanksgiving 2017 my dad was diagnosed with stage four pancreatic cancer as you said and that moment was a real before-and-after moment in my life if anyone you know has been diagnosed with cancer and knows someone diagnosed with cancer you know that hearing that information just completely changes your life in one instant so as soon as he got diagnosed I knew that I wanted to help in whatever way I could whether that was with nutrition or supplements or you know cooking for him or finding remedies that could work for him plant-based remedies anything that I could you know could get my hands on I wanted to I wanted to try to find for him and I had been working in the wellness world for many years and I had some connections with functional medicine doctors and people in the wellness arena and so I had this arsenal of people to reach out to and ask you know what are the things that I should look into when it comes to helping someone with not only treating the cancer but really helping with the chemotherapy side-effects in the immune system because I knew that I didn't know much about chemo or cancer at the time but I did know that that chemo can really affect the immune system and people can not tolerate it sometimes because their immune system is so weakened so I just thought you know what can I do to help my dad and I just went full force into the research and cannabis and medicinal mushrooms were the two things I kept hearing about over and over again and once I started to dive into the research there it was really really promising so that's that's the route we decided to go on so just so that everybody understands your dad was getting chemotherapy and so you're not going to come on and say you my dad never got chemotherapy all he did was have a joint and chew on a mushroom you know in fact in fact my dad was definitely sure that he wanted to go the traditional chemotherapy route for treating his cancer and I was not about to try to you know get him to do otherwise I'm not a doctor so I was not gonna I wasn't gonna go there but I knew that I could support him with some home remedies and we you know we talked to his oncologist and we got his oncologist on board with all the different things we were trying and he said you know I don't know if this is gonna help but it probably won't hurt so go ahead and we'll just keep monitoring his progress so he has the you know the chemotherapy regimen at the hospital and then we've had our our home regimen that we've been doing on the side you know that's actually great to hear because I work with a lot of cancer patients as well and so many of their their oncologists tell them no you know you may not do alternative therapies during this chemotherapy you know how dare you don't even come near this stuff it will hurt your chances so tell me actually tell us about that process how'd you how'd you find an oncologist that lets you do this number one yeah that's a really good point because I hear that from so many people that their oncologist said no absolutely not don't try cannabis you know medicinal marijuana CBD mushrooms and they say maybe it will hurt or they just don't have enough information about it to be able to say it's okay and luckily for us we we were paired with an oncologist who was open-minded to it he definitely did not recommend that we do it and he said you know this may not do anything but I'm not gonna tell you know so he didn't we were really lucky in that sense because a lot of oncologist don't do that so what I always tell people to do is when they speak to their oncologist about potentially using home remedies and their oncologist says no maybe you'll agree with this I always say what's the exact reason why they're saying no is there something specific to your condition maybe there is maybe there is a drug interaction maybe there is something very specific to you and you shouldn't use these home remedies or you know if not like maybe ask me on college if you on college us if you could try it for one cycle you know until your next scan and see if everything is still okay you know if there's not a specific reason to you maybe maybe they'd be willing to just let you see how it goes for one cycle so what made you tell us about the your research that said you know we need to look into cannabis and CBD and medicinal mushrooms what brought that to the forefront well one of the things that happened really early on when my dad first got diagnosed is he watched a documentary about medical marijuana and it was and he had just recorded it because he thought it looked interesting he wasn't even interested in it for himself he just wanted to watch it and it was all about cancer patients that were using medical cannabis and having really good results you know not only with their cancer but with their with their side effects of their chemo and so he his ears perked up at that immediately and at the same time CBD was just starting to emerge and one of my friends said hey just look into CBD and cancer and see what you find and I started researching that and I found so many stories of people who were using medical cannabis and CBD who have cancer and were experiencing relief and then I started to look into studies I went to a medical cannabis conference I started to get in touch with medical cannabis doctors and ask them what their experience had been and I just went straight down the rabbit hole and I I was you know I was really impressed by what I found in medical cannabis and then with the mushrooms I had already known that medicinal mushrooms could be helpful for the immune system that was something that was already in my consciousness but I didn't know a lot about them and when I started to go down the route the route of researching mushrooms I found so much information there is about medicinal mushrooms being used in cancer hospitals and other parts of the world and people using it to help their immune systems know is really really interesting okay so explain to people as if they don't know the difference may hopefully most people know so what's the difference between cannabis CBD and medicinal mushrooms and our medicinal mushrooms different than magic mushrooms yeah so cannabis CBD is part of the cannabis plant it's a compound within the cannabis plant and it's a compound that doesn't get you high so THC is the compound that most people are familiar with inside the cannabis plant that does get you high so they're two different molecules that are both within the same plant the mushrooms the medicinal mushrooms all the ones that my dad is taking and most of the ones that I write about in the book are completely non psychedelic so there's you know when people think about mushrooms they usually think of grocery-store mushrooms like button mushrooms portabellos Khomeini's or magic mushrooms that are going to take you on it on a trip there's another class of mushrooms that's considered medicinal mushrooms which is their edible and you know you can consume them and they have medicinal properties but they're not psychedelic gotcha and you want for the listeners you want to name some of those medicinal mushrooms yeah yeah some of the the ones that that I cover in the book and that my dad has been taking everyday chaga mushroom reishi turkey tail is a big one that's one of the first ones that we got him started on shitake is a wonderful actually a really great one for right now - because it's shitake has been shown to be antiviral so that's a really interesting one to look at lion's mane and cordyceps and maitake I believe those are those are all the all the ones and then I do I do cover magic mushrooms a little bit in the book too because there's some really interesting things going on in the search with with psilocybin which is a compound inside magic mushrooms but that's not the main thing that that we've been focusing on but it's definitely an interesting one to pay attention to all right so you keep bringing up the immune system with mushrooms in terms of medical marijuana and CBD where where's the benefit that with this in in cancer patients sure yeah with the immune system with the cannabis what we had found with our research into cannabis is that THC and CBD both have properties that have been shown to kill tumors and and slow tumor growth and they can help with the immune system there's not enough research there yet because they can't do clinical trials on cannabis because of the legality so this is a lot of preliminary research and anecdotal stories so that's with cannabis with the mushrooms all of the mushrooms that I just mentioned aside from magic mushrooms but all the medicinal mushrooms that I mentioned have been shown to have immune system modulating properties so they don't necessarily stimulate the immune system or you know dampen the immune system they balance the immune system so they're they're considered adaptogens so they can just help keep your immune system in balance and all of them are really powerful for you know keeping that immune system strong yeah we I have a patient who oh I think he's now 10 years out from stage 4 pancreatic cancer and he we treated him basically with a raw food diet and a lot of mushroom extracts particularly coleus turkey tail and he's like I say knock on wood he's cancer-free now for 10 years and it's amazing now so I'm a huge supporter you know using plant-based therapy in cancer so and I'm you know again I've seen it with my own eyes and and and written about it in my books so can any of these I know that when you have chemotherapy it's not exactly the most wonderful trip so and a lot of patients complain of pain of GI upset of sleep of energy loss anxiety what's the deal with these compounds with that yeah well the cannabis my dad the cannabis that my dad has been taking in a lot of other cancer patients also take this it's a very highly concentrated cannabis oil that comes in a little plastic syringe and you eat these small droplets of this cannabis oil tiny tiny droplets the size of a grain of rice and that can give you around 50 milligrams of THC and 50 milligrams of CBD if you have a one to one ratio product in one drop so that's a very high dose for people that don't know about 10 milligrams of THC is considered a recreational dose that someone may you know use to get high so 50 milligrams is a really really high amount so you have to really start slowly with that kind of medical cannabis product but what my dad has found with that it is really really taken away his nausea completely he's barely ever had nausea and it's two and a half years in now he's hardly had any nausea his appetite came back as soon as he started taking this cannabis oil which a lot of cancer patients I'm sure you know they completely lose their appetite they lose so much weight and that really contributes to them feeling sicker and sicker as time goes on because they're not able to nourish themselves so that was amazing right off the bat he started to be able to eat full meals again and feel really well and then he sleeps great because he takes a higher dose at night he doesn't like to take a higher dose during the day because he still wants to get things done and not feel too you know impaired by the THC but at night he's okay taking a little bit more and he has slept well the entire time so I think that has been the main that's helped ease his side effects from chemotherapy and then I believe that the mushrooms are what's keeping his immune system strong so he hasn't been weakened by the chemo got you so your book is trying to remove the the drug stigma of cannabis and mushrooms why is that important to you well yeah you know when III quit drinking and quit using all drugs back in 2007 so it's been for me I swore off cannabis and mushrooms back then and alcohol and you know I used cannabis and mushrooms in college recreationally and I never thought of them as medicine I never would have even had a reason to think of it as medicine and so for me that part is really important because my perception of all of this has completely changed throughout my research and I've done so much research now into you know the prohibition of cannabis and you know the legalization of psychedelic mushrooms and it is just it has always been focused around patients and I mean of course there's people that that want to use it recreationally but there has been so much focus throughout the years on you know getting these plants to patients who really who really need to find relief and I didn't realize that before so it's really important to me to try to help to shift that perception to see how these can be medicinal for people and that it's not just about getting high or or going on a mushroom trip it's it's so much more than that so you mentioned that the dose is is enough to get you high what if what if you don't want this effect how do you avoid it yeah so if you're using these in the in the book I do talk about a lot of different wellness wellness topics and not just cancer so for cancer patients specifically if you do want to take the THC and use that medicinally and not feel the high you're just gonna want to work up really really slowly a tiny tiny tiny amounts of THC for most people two milligrams of THC is the the threshold if you go above two milligrams you kind of start to feel those those intoxicating effects if you start a little bit lower and move up you know every few days a couple more milligrams and just monitor how you're feeling that can be a really helpful way if you don't want to feel it at all I would take a high CBD product with little to no THC in it and that will you know give you the medicinal effects of the CBD without without having the THC but they do work better together so if you have a little bit of each in there they boost each other up so if you can tolerate a little bit of THC for the medicinal effects that's great but you don't have to you know and if you're not using it for for your cancer journey and you're using it more for wellness then you can absolutely just take a high CBD product with very small trace amounts of THC okay so let's get away from cancer for a minute and let's talk about wellness so give us your take it's the thoughts or the book on why these may promote wellness how do they pronoun promote wellness and let's go from there sure well one of the things that I found right off the bat through my research for my dad was all these different ways that it might be able to help me to which is you know a totally different realm of why I use them versus why my dad using them but for CBD in particular some of the the main things people use it for our pain sleep and anxiety those are probably the top three and I personally found help with sleep right away and the interesting thing with sleep anxiety and pain is that a lot of times when people can't sleep it's because of anxiety or pain either they they have some painful part of their body and they can't sleep because of that or racing thoughts having having those anxious feelings during the night not being able to sleep so using the CBD can take away the thing that is keeping you from sleeping and help you sleep deeper which is what I experience because I can have anxiety when I'm trying to fall asleep and before I started on CBD I would frequently you know take a long time to fall asleep and then wake up a lot during the night with racing thoughts and when I started the CBD I was really - just sleep better so that was that was awesome and as far as the pain goes there was another kind of before-and-after moment that my dad experienced with CBD which was before he got on the medical marijuana train he was just taking CBD that's all we had access to at the time and what he noticed right off the bat was that his joint pain went away just from taking the CBD he was taking CBD capsules and he said I don't even need to take advil anymore he used to have all this joint pain walking up and down the stairs he's been an athlete his whole life so he says all these aches and pains and he was like I'm I'm impressed by that and he's not one of those people that just gets on the bandwagon quickly you know so he that was really impressive so the pain sleep and anxiety are three things that CBD can be amazing for so let's I have a lot of patients who have tried CBD primarily for sleep and for pain and I would say that just as a general rule 50% of them seem to respond and 50% of them don't and of the people who respond what's been fascinating to me is half the people particularly with pain respond to the topical CBD but don't to the oral and the other half they respond to the oral but not to the topical so help me understand this what's going on sure well yeah a base level of why people respond to it differently is because we all have an endocannabinoid system as I'm sure you know in our body that responds and reacts with the cannabis directly so and everyone has their own dr. Ethan Russo who's a cannabis researcher he he calls it the endocannabinoid tone that we all have this baseline tone kind of like everybody has a different digestive system you know your gut flora is going to be different than mine you have a different endocannabinoid system than me so you may have different levels of natural cannabinoids which we make in our body in your system than I do so the cannabis will well and CBD in particular will kind of raise those love raise the levels of the natural cannabinoids that we have in our system so if someone has a lower amount versus a higher amount they're gonna respond differently which is why dosing can be really tricky and is really really personal with CBD dosing and method of delivery like you said some people will respond to a topical some to a tincture it's all gonna really be based on the person's individual endocannabinoid system so let's talk about dosing and how do you know what you're getting obviously marijuana and CBD are legal here in California and we've we've got these shops almost on every street corner now and how how do you figure out okay well is this stuff legit this stuff came from hemp this actually came from the marijuana plant some people argue no no you got to have marijuana base CBDs hemp CBDs no good come on help us sort this out yeah well you're you're lucky to be in California because I really think California especially at the license dispensaries have have have it figured out in a really wonderful way I wish that all dispensaries could be like the ones that I've visited in California and that's because they have a very wide array of ratios of product ratios out in California with different levels of CBD to THC that you can pick from and choose your your ratio because like I said if the more THC in a product the more you're gonna feel those intoxicating effects and so you know you can have a ratio of eight to one CBD to THC or twenty to one and you can try all these different ratios to see what works for you so I think that's wonderful but to answer your question the most important thing right now when you're looking for a product especially a CBD product that's not from a dispensary because those are unregulated you want to make sure you find you had they have a third-party lab test so that's to show that the amount of CBD that they say is in the product is actually on the lab test so if it says 25 milligrams per serving you want to say see that on the lab as well and you want to make sure that it's negative for heavy metals pesticides residual solvents that could have come through the processing because CBD like I said is totally unregulated right now it's really important to get those lab tests if you do get it from a licensed dispensary they have stricter regulations with the kind of products they're able to sell so you're probably better off that way but even if you're getting it from a dispensary you may want to ask and see the lab test to make sure what what you're getting is really what it says on the label so if I'm on my road trip and I stop at the gas station and they've got CBD oil at the checkout counter which I've seen that's probably not the one I want to buy for sure yeah you really want to do your research and make sure the company is is doing like I said those third-party lab tests meaning someone else is doing the lab tests it's not affiliated with the company so they can't you know make it up and it's and you want to make sure that they're using safe practices and then just answer your question about the hemp versus marijuana right now it's all legal terms so hemp hemp face CBD versus marijuana based CBD is basically just about the amount of THC and other cannabinoids which are other compounds within the cannabis plant that are in the product so if it's hemp hemp face CBD it's basically just very very minimal THC it was going to be in that plant that was grown for that CBD and if it's marijuana based CBD it basically just means that in that plant there was a higher level of THC and this is all you know these numbers are are just kind of you know the numbers that they're using to differentiate these plants but it's all the same comes from the same plant at the end of the day now bring us up to date the DEA once classified this substance as really nasty stuff where do we stand where do we stand with the DEA and where do we stand with the FDA with these substances well right now cannabis is still a schedule 1 drug federally so I hope that that will change I don't know for sure when it will I mean people predict that that will change within the next couple of years CBD in as of 2018 became legal federally which is why you see the CBD boom everywhere so CBD from hemp which just means point three percent THC or less is federally illegal anything more you have to get from a licensed dispensary which will be different in every state some states have Medical dispensaries only which you're gonna need a medical card in order to access those products and so you have to go to a doctor get approved for a medical marijuana card and then you can go to a dispensary some states have recreational or adult use dispensaries which is usually twenty-one plus and right now it just varies from state to state so things are changing everyday my hope is that it will become federally legal soon all right I'm going to throw you a something out of left field what do you know about black urine disease so I have a very good friend and I won't mention his name who ran a company that was really big into CBD and kind of put their whole careers into that and was working very hard with the FDA to get FDA approval for CBD and you probably know that the FAA does not approve so yeah yeah and interestingly enough and I did not know this because he said I'm sure you've heard a black urine disease and he said no I I haven't he says well it turns out that too much CBD can actually affect the same receptors in the liver that tylenol hits acetaminophen and can actually poison the liver and it was discovered because some very heavy CBD users notice their urine was turning dark like they hepatitis and it got the name black urine disease and he tells me and I'm not I haven't talked to the FDA about this that the FDA is worried that big-time CVD use and I don't know the dose may potentially damage the liver and that's why they put the brakes on this but but look it up it's fascinating yeah you know I have seen some things talking about CBD damaging the liver because of studies that they did in my surahs' and from what I could gather from these studies the amount of CBD they had to give these rats was was huge like thousands and thousands and thousands of milligrams of CBD like what it would what it would equal with a human it seemed very very I got huge stretch to me but I will look that up and see see what the what they're saying about black hair and disease that sounds pretty scary and you probably couldn't afford to take that much right so let's get back to that is there is there evidence is there at least anecdotal reports about the amount of CBD that you have to use to be effective you mentioned that everybody's endo cab enoyed systems different so what what what should people look for why do they try what do you recommend yeah as far as dosing I mean I've heard from doctors that practice with with cannabis medicine that some patients do well on five milligrams of CBD and some people do well on 500 milligrams of CBD depending on their condition so it's really really different but what I can say is a starting point for CBD you want to start really low and take it by itself and monitor how you feel you know every 15 minutes like do you feel anything different do you feel you're more relaxed do you feel any relief of pain do you feel any relief of anxiety or whatever it is that you're trying to find relief from and pay really close attention and only take more if you feel no nothing if you feel nothing take a little bit more you could start with like five milligrams even something really small and see if you feel anything if not you know around fifteen to twenty five milligrams is a standard dose for people for many people a standard kind of wellness dose and then if you're having a high amount of pain or anxiety you may need to take you may need to take a little bit more and just kind of move up until you find the relief that you're looking for or switch products if it's if it's not working for you or methods of delivery there like you said before you know topicals work really well for some people for people for pain for anxiety a lot of people like to take the tincture under the tongue because that works usually within 15 minutes or so and you can really measure your dose drop by drop so I would suggest starting with it with a sublingual tincture because that that's how you can really really get a measured dose and say okay I took it's this exact amount where some of the other methods you can't always know exactly how much you're taking okay so we talked about anxiety pain sleep and you use the buzzword the wellness dose of CBD so again help me experimentally anecdotally where does CBD fit in a wellness regimen sure well like I said before we all have this endocannabinoids system in our body that CBD works directly with and we have our own molecules inside our body that work with this same system that CBD can help to regulate those those molecules and they affect things like you know pain sleep the immune system anxiety depression mood they have they have so many things that this endocannabinoids system affects it really keeps you in homeostasis or keeps you in balance so taking CBD as a daily tonic is kind of you know tonify z-- your endocannabinoids system and can keep things in balance many people just find that taking it you know a day as a daily thing whether it's at night or during the day depending how you respond can just make you overall you know feel more balanced got you okay interesting dr. McCullen and I have talked about CBD for sleep when we've been on each other's podcast and we back years ago now did 20 milligrams of CBD sublingual before bed and tracked our sleep with an aura ring which I'm holding up on camera and quite frankly neither of us found any effect on our sleep and as I recall I won't put words in his mouth he even tried it with THC and also found no effect for him or me so we both kind of stopped doing it but you're right maybe our endo cab annoyed system is so phenomenally balanced and I hope it is that maybe we would not see that effect so that yeah or the other part is that sometimes taking certain amounts of CBD or THC can be more wake promoting for some people and especially taking a little bit too much THC can kind of make you have those racing thoughts or can cause anxiety for some people so that yeah I know this it is so so personal and some people will say I take CBD it makes me more focused and awake and some people say they take it and it makes them fall asleep so it's yeah it's an experimental journey alright so I'm sure everybody wants to know because you're a rebel apothecary in' should we be regulating these substances what's the best approach to regulating them if they should be regulated yeah I mean I really think that some of the licensed dispensaries in California are doing a really good job with with the way that they are providing their products I think that cannabis products with THC should be most likely just allowed in licensed dispensaries but I do think it should be federally legal I do think that people that wants access to cannabis medicine should be able to have access to it I don't think it should just be you know sold at gas stations and have these low quality products on the market I think that there should be should be staying third party lab testing for all cannabis products and all CBD products I do think they should be regulated in a way where they have to you know contain exactly what they say on the label so yeah I do I do think it should be legal federally and just as long as as long as the regulations are in place to keep people safe so we're not going to pull up to the gas station and get a six-pack of beer and a brownie to go I would say make your own brownies at home which there are some recipes AHA I knew I could get a plug in for you there you know with the magic mushrooms and legality and regulation they're the predictions that are happening for those are that they'll be legal within therapeutic settings because they are researching them for depression and even you know comparing them to SSRI depression drugs and seeing you know how they affect people so I think that those mushrooms which are currently illegal as well will will be available for use in therapy and I don't think those should just be you know available a gas station either those should be you know closely monitored yeah Mike Michael Pollan ism has made uh I think a very strong point that there is good increasing evidence that there is some bona fide medical use for these I think particularly in depression and yeah we need and you you know you argue for this that we need to look at this as another federally regulated license use of these products for specific reasons all right yeah absolutely and I think you're right and maybe you talk about that the use of these products kind of in your own home is probably at least in our state of understanding not a great idea this should be taken with a practice professional in a setting in a controlled setting what say you I say if we're talking about psychedelic mushrooms I would definitely recommend that people don't just try it alone whether it's with a trained therapist or someone who has a lot of experience guiding people through these types of sessions I definitely think that having having guidances is the way to go yeah I had a personal experience in college where I one of my members in my singing group dropped acid and decided to we were on the third floor of our dorm and he threw up open the windows and decided he was going to fly and luckily I grabbed him by his belt and pulled him back in this is a true story so I firmly believe from personal experience that this should be done in a guided setting yes yes if you take a little bit too much of a psychedelic compound you mean it can take you to places that you aren't ready to go by yourself so definitely right in 30 including the ground from a third-story window yeah all right well Jenny this has been great thanks so much for joining me and where do they find out about you your book your work first of all thank you so much for having me this has been just such a great conversation and I'm glad you have so much personal experience with the topic too that makes it really enjoyable to talk about so thank you my book is called the rebels apothecary so you can buy that anywhere where books are sold except right now we can't go into bookstores so online you can find that my blog is healthy crush calm and you can find me also on Instagram Jenny sanssouci healthy crush dot-com I'm sure there's a story what's the crush well the healthy cards I've actually been writing there since 2008 so I've been blogging about wellness and personal development topics for quite a long time and the healthy crush just kind of popped into my mind the tagline is a love affair with living well okay the way the way I've always felt about you know finding out about new wellness topics and getting excited about them and very very good very good okay it's time for our audience question Sandra Liliana on Facebook asks is keto diet safe for people with heart conditions believe it or not I do use my version of the ketogenic diet for my patients with heart disease who have also for instance diabetes as a co-founding factor and as a cause of their heart disease the key and my ketogenic diet is you got to eat about 80 percent of your calories from fat but that fat shouldn't be ribeye steaks it should be fats from avocados and for you people who are watching I have avocado socks on today and they should be from olive oil and the more olive oil macadamia nuts you eat macadamia nut oil sesame oil the better and the key of a ketogenic diet is to really severely limit your carbohydrates to really leaves and vegetables that are going to carry olive oil and avocados into your mouth that's totally different than a paleo or carnivore keto diet where the vast majority of the foods you're gonna eat our heavy cheese's heavy meats heavy fats you know three bottles of cream every day that's not what I use for my heart disease patients so you got to be careful in the term keto diet there's a good way to do keto and there's a bad way to do keto particularly for heart disease so that's a great question Sandra and thank you very much all right Jenny thank you again and good luck with the book and best wishes to your father how's he doing by the way he's doing fantastic I've actually been quarantined up here with him for the last six weeks and he has felt so good the whole time we keep saying we forget that he has cancer he's been off of chemo now for the past three months I'm just cuz he's been doing so well that his oncologist said why don't we give you a break and his blood markers are in the normal range his tumors have all been stable so we're happy hey very good very good all right keep up the good work great thank you so much thanks for having me take care and now it's time for the review of the week following my most

ever wondered if they're compatible with the medication that you take regularly or occasionally I have the answer for you before we start I will give you a little rundown about drug interactions there are two type of interactions that you need to understand in this video the first one is what I call the attacker victim interaction in this interaction you have one drug that I call the attacker that changes the amount of another drug circulating in your body I call it the victim truck when the amount of the victim jug is reduced its effect is also reduced in your body if it's increased its effect on your body is increased to the second type of interaction is what I call the effect battle in this situation there's no change in the amount of drugs circulating in your body the change is rather on the effect that the drug has on your body two drugs that create opposite effect can lessen each other's effect on the body let me give you an example if you take a sleeping pill to sleep better and you decide to take at the same time something stimulating like coffee you will most likely feel less drowsiness from the sleeping pill not because it's amana has been reduced in your body because of the stimulating effect of caffeine on the other hand if you take two drugs that produce the same effect like a sleeping pill and alcohol that comment effect which is drowsiness will be amplified if you want to understand the mechanisms behind the changes in drug amount in your system visit my blog whoo that was a lot of information what were we talking about again oh yes let's talk specifically about the interaction between cannabis and medications currently there are a few studies available that I've looked at how cannabis interacts with specific types of medication that most people take however keep in mind that THC is the main component in cannabis that gives you that high it has several effects on your body and can therefore impact the efficacy of certain medication and increase the risk of side-effects of others in other words there are a lot of possible effect battle interactions let's take a look at some of them here are some examples of possible effects of THC on your body first it can act on your brain it can cause drowsiness it can decrease your attention concentration and memory these effects can be more severe when combined with opioids alcohol benzodiazepines and other sleeping pills and considering that it affects your attention and concentration it can contribute to existing ADHD symptoms therefore it can interfere with the efficacy of your ADHD medication THC use can make you more anxious and cause you to have psychosis that can ultimately worsen certain conditions you might already have such as anxiety schizophrenia and bipolar disorder therefore it can interfere with the efficacy of mental health medications your heart can also be impacted by THC with a high dose of THC it increases your risk of heart palpitations and when it is smoked it increases the risk of stroke and the risk of heart attack all of these risks are even higher for people with heart disease therefore it can interfere with the efficacy of their heart and high blood pressure medications concerning your lungs when TG is smoked or vaporized it can worsen your asthma symptoms therefore it can interfere with the efficacy of your nailers and other asthma medications some studies suggest that TG can decrease fertility for women and men therefore avoid if you're on a fertility treatment or trying to conceive - something's up when it comes to all types of interaction involving cannabis and your medications there are some elements to consider in order to determine if the interaction is serious first the strength of your cannabis product how do you consume it do you smoke it you vaporize it do you eat it and lastly you your age and your medical history can influence how cannabis will affect your body and your medications all that being said you have one important job and that is to notify your doctor or your pharmacist if you use cannabis whether it's recreationally automatically in order for them to assess and monitor the risk of all possible interactions between cannabis and your medications hope you enjoyed this video if you did don't forget to give it a big thumbs up subscribe and hit that notification button for more details

don't miss out alright so let's get into the whole discussion round break into the CVD world in the cannabis industry its recently legalized in Canada and as a result you've got a lot of startup companies that have tons of money being poured in and they are actively hiring right now it's a crazy world there's lots of money involved and it's really really hot so which leads me to my very first thought and that is essentially the CBD world the cannabis industry is pretty much the Wild Wild West still yes it's legalized there are going to be regulations and there are regulations right now there's just so much going on we don't know which companies are going to succeed like I said there's tons of money being poured into a lot of these companies people are just investing or dare I say gambling into this industry into these companies so quickly so fast expecting huge returns immediately it's not going to be as fruitful as people think it's going to be I still think that with the cost of production of manufacturing over compliance is really gonna eat into the profits and I think a lot of people may underestimate the scale of requirements when you want to do it the right way and as a result you're gonna get a lot of companies that can't do it they're gonna get shut down maybe the licenses are gonna be postponed there's just so many variables right now and as a result there's gonna be a lot of companies that aren't going to succeed and you may be laid off within the next six months to the next year whereas a small number of companies may do very very well still TBD we'll find out but to me overall thought is that it is kind of like the Wild West at the moment the other thing that you'd you have to keep in mind is that it's only legal in Canada it's not legal in the United States of America so if you're gonna do some traveling especially within North America or to other countries there gonna be some problems at customs or at the border when you are entering other countries are gonna ask you what you do and as a result you may not be allowed into a country and while yes cannabis is legal in certain states of the US it's not legal across the country so you definitely want to be prepared and guys remember in the States this is the criminal act having marijuana on you and this is a very very sensitive subject if there is some sort of issue it's not just a fine you couldn't go to prison you're crossing the border from Canada into the US there's just a lot of sensitivity around it there's a lot of misunderstanding a lot of complexities as a result so you've been warned so having said all this and maybe I haven't convinced you to stay out of that industry which is totally fine how are you going to break into the cannabis industry well let's talk a little about that now shall we it's quite likely that these companies and executives have underestimated the level of compliance needed to get their licenses up and as a result they're gonna be doing massive hiring for that expertise and that could be a great opportunity for you so the first thing I'd recommend that you do is that you let recruiters know that you are very interested in this industry reach out to as many recruiters as poss well definitely give them the heads up update your resume cover letter and let them know that you're on tap should there be an opportunity so that's the first thing you want to do the second thing you want to do is to definitely emphasize your transferable skills as well as the eagerness to learn you really want to hone in on this message on your cover letter on your resume during your interviews because the reality is that the cannabis industry is relatively new there's going to be a very very small number of people that have the experience that these companies are looking for so you're gonna have to focus in on your transferable skills and also emphasize your eagerness to learn new things and to do it well and to do it quickly so the third thing you want to do is emphasize the ability to adapt adaptability is absolutely key again because the regulations are new the requirements are new there's gonna be a very very small number of people that really know what they're doing and chances are the people that know what they're doing don't want to know the true impact although they know how auditors are going to measure them against those requirements they really don't know and I think this is kind of part of that same point it's Wild West you have to be able to change course as soon as an auditor is telling you to do something different so you have to make the effort and emphasize your ability to adapt come up with really really good examples multiple examples that you can use a cover letter on your interview and don't forget to practice at the phone interview level guys recruiters are crazy right now they are out there looking for the best people and unfortunately they are also trying to do it as quickly as possible they may not be going after the best candidate they're going after the most available candidate if that makes sense one recruiters do reach out to you it's gonna be a phone call so you have to be able to speak to your transferable skills your ability to adapt to your eagerness to learn over phone so that could be another thing to watch out for so the fourth thing you want to keep in mind is that if you want to crack into the industry fast you want to get as close to your current experience as possible let's say you're coming from the food world so now you want to migrate to a company that is making CBD foods right foods that you CBD the reason for that is that your transferable skills are going to be easier to speak to you could definitely apply a lot of the food safety Hassim type principles and programs to that CBG world because they are also making CBD foods or edibles simply for supplements if you come from the supplement world maybe the OTC world you can move into a company that's maybe planning on making CBD pills or capsules or tablets or something of that nature again because you can translate and transfer a lot of the programs and practices over from the supplement world over to this CBD supplement world number five and this is my last tip and again it goes back to the current state of the situation how hot recruitment and job opportunities are right now and that is to keep your CV your resume and your cover letter up-to-date and current as much as possible so that at a moment's notice you can flip that over to a recruiter soon as that person has an opportunity available no one gets your cover letter and CV to them right away you can then pique their interest and book that phone interview as soon as possible again these guys are running a mile a minute they need to fill these roles as soon as possible because the demand is there the companies want to get moving they wanna get their license fast so it's important for you to keep your CV and cover letter up-to-date so there you go guys I hope you found this video helpful now of course if you need help with regards to your CV cover letter and interview skills I do have a career prep course I'll have a link in the description down below a link to the card above guys this is a one-on-one session I critique your interview skills I could take your resume as well as your cover letter we go right into it it's uncomfortable but it's a one-on-one session you get real industry feedback now I know you will find very very helpful when you want to land that six-figure role in the cannabis world guys this is real really good value I reckon take advantage of it there are limited spots so definitely booked today I'm gonna leave it there it's been a long day thank you so much for watching

prevent that sara amento and her family are running out of time she has stage four cancer the chemotherapy isn't working and the doctors say there's nothing more they can do left with no options everybody speaks about cannabis oil there's a certain stigma especially being a mother of doing cannabis oil you know everyone looks at it like you're getting high and it's not it's a medical it's it's a natural option that the government's ignoring and I knew I want to live I have to live cannabis has been used as a medicine for centuries it's legal in half US states a British drugs company is trialing a new cancer drug and Britain's leading cancer research group is interested cannabinoids are certainly very interesting molecules and there's a lot of research there's hundreds of papers being published looking at their chemical properties against cancer cells turning that into effective treatments is a long road and certainly it's not going to be the one cure for cancer because nothing is this is how you're able to gauge what level of activities going on in your body Stephanie LaRue says she has evidence cannabis has worked which is backed up by her doctor a cannabis works no chemo I only did cannabis and the tumors are gone and the scans I have is evidence and proof of that kind of like what more do you need a lot more according to one of the world's leading cancer doctors this is chemotherapy so these are natural products you know the man who helped cure Lance Armstrong's cancer needs data and real scientific evidence until somebody proves it whether it be the manufacturers who put together a clinical trial whether it be doctors who get government funding to do it or patients who say here my records and let's put it in a medical journal and be transparent with what I had what I was treated with him what my out was then until that it's snake-oil again I'm not trying to impede progress or say it's bad but at the same time I don't want people to get false hope so what is the evidence well there are hundreds of lab reports that have been published a study on mice which showed that it worked a human trial that saw eight out of nine patients respond to treatment even though they all did die in the time you might expect dozens of charities and organizations are starting to think there's something in it making the oil is still an underground industry the cannabis is legal the flammable solvents he's using aren't we then pour the liquid into the pen so this is the finished product yeah this is the finished product and do you think this is a cure for cancer in many instances it is and it can be it depends on the person's particular condition or their state how advanced the cancer is but we've seen thousands and thousands of people get better from using this oil and it's what Sarah amento is trying squeeze out at very little and now and then I just I believe it's the best option I've seen it work for others and it is her only hope but it is also unproven medicine Alice leave their BBC News Los Angeles", "LCasL-iLUOQ": "i like that we have some questions here from our viewers whoever you want to start here is it true that in general covet 19 death rates have actually gone down okay so it depends what window of time you look at and where at the overall curve you are looking right now according to the department of hhs we're actually seeing those numbers go up but if you compare it to let's say february march april yes we have made incredible progress the learning curve for the critical care of patients with severe and critical cova 19 has been very rapid on the part of intensivists critical care specialists all of the nurse anesthetists etc so we are learning how to treat these patients better but right now our death rate is climbing all right and our final question i've heard rumors cannabis may help treat covid19 complications is there any truth to that so i am a big believer in the therapeutic modality of cannabis i think we're just at its infancy right now in terms of studying it and understanding its benefits as well as its risks the short answer is based on existing data there's potential help but there's also potential harm overall cannabis users can be at increased risk of covid but there is a drug that actually was approved by the fda to go into phase one clinical trials by the end of this year it's a synthetic cannabinoid and it is being targeted to be studied in patients with that so-called cytokine storm to reduce the inflammation so not yet ready for prime time but i do believe there may be some future in this but it is an area of intense research all right doug thank you so much and thank you all for your questions you can keep submitting those to dr jen on instagram at dr

Some of them are --\nI would like to see them out of the business\ncompletely, because -- What do you mean,\nthey're \"horrible people\"? Well, they're not nice. They're criminals.\n[ Laughs ] You know,\nthey actually are criminals. [ Twisting cap ] After this,\nwe would take this and we literally have the most\ndangerous part of the process, which is where we have\nto actually decarboxinate it. You're putting a flammable\nsubstance next to heat source. Yeah -- never smart. You know, I --\nI mean, like, honestly -- Like, I'm pretty nervous\ndoing this inside. Um, stick your mask on,\nplease. -Because...\n-Um... What -- What can go wrong\nif this goes -- Um, you could burn down\na whole building. You could kill yourself.\nIt's extremely dangerous. All right, I'm actually\nvery nervous about this. [ Laughs ] \u266a\u266a I'll just take off my mask. Yeah, that's done.\nThat's just, uh, oil. Ooh, you can really\nsmell it, though. We don't charge. It's not about charging,\nyou know? How much\ndo you give away? Every week, about 20,000. 20,000 pounds? -Yeah.\n-Wow. But for someone, that could be, like,\n5 to 10 days of relief. And this is why we're -- we're\nactually fighting our government for the right\nfor medical access, because it shouldn't be\npeople like me, sitting in a dank,\nlittle house, risking my life\nand my -- my freedom. to produce\nhigh-potency cannabis oil, I wanted to know who was using\nthis back-alley medicine. So I'm joining John\nas he consults with a new patient,\nPaul Webster Hughes -- a single father of two\nand stroke survivor. Hello.\nGood evening, John. I'm Paul.\nIt's a pleasure to meet you. Hello, Paul.\nVery nice to meet you. Can you step aboard?\nI'm -- I'm good. Thank you. \u266a\u266a I've just given cannabis\nin the privacy of my own home. Thank you very much. And, uh,\nthat's a 1:1 strain, which is 15% CBD\nand 15% THC. There's no\nrecommended dosage, because there isn't\nany medical data on how we're to do this.\nOkay. But, really,\nwhat I'd say of anyone is try a very, very, very\nsmall amount. Just take -- even just, like,\na pinhead to start with until you just\nget used to it. No need to worry about money,\n'cause that's what we do. We give out\nfree cannabis oil.\nWell, thank you very much. Because Paul lacks\nregular, safe access to medical marijuana, he uses a combination of medical oil and street weed to treat the symptoms\nof his stroke at his home in North Yorkshire. [ Birds chirping ] Andavolu: So, Paul, if you could\nsort of take me through -- What happened to you? 2005 --\nI'm living in Thailand, and I went out\nto my wife's village. Went swimming\nin the morning, and later that morning,\nI just fell, and I've got videos --\nbizarre, coincidental. Paul: Now, while you're\nplaying around on there... [ Woman gasps ] -It's okay.\n-There's no blood. [ Child crying ]\nOkay... And I was paralyzed\non the left side of my body. [ Slurring ]\nDo you need any... [ Woman speaking indistinctly,\nchild crying ] Woman: Hey. [ Crying continues ] Paul:\nAnd for the next six months,\nI was carried to the toilet. I had about 10% of my left body,\nat that point. I've had a headache\nfor 11 years.\nWow. Can you imagine having\na headache for 4,100 days? -Straight?\n-Straight -- absolutely. I never get a break. Imagine big, rolling\nboulders or marbles crashing\noff each other. It's like a tightening\nof a skull cap on my head. Did doctors sort of\nprescribe you anything to sort of help?\nOh, sure. Yeah, I-I've been on\npretty much all the medications that they're allowed\nto give me. I was on 14 pills a day\nat one point. So, on these pills, physically,\nit closed me down, and a couple of them depress you\nenough to kill you. This last Christmas,\nI decided no -- no more. And, uh, that's when\nI started, uh, smoking, because it dulled\nthe pain. \u266a\u266a It allows me to do the things\nthat I must do. It gives me potential. The pain's still there,\nbut it's in a bubble. But it's like\nthere's an extra layer between me and my pain. My kids\ndon't see me smoke. I only smoke\nin my room. I don't smoke anywhere else\nin the house. I'm a single dad.\nMy kids come first. Hello, you. -What'd you doin'?\n-Hi. There's word\nfor your brother you'll learn\nwhen you're older -- seven girlfriends,\nI mean... He's a player! Okay, that's one way\nof putting it. Yeah, sure. All right,\nhere's the view -- pizza. Can you bang it on?\nYou can do that, can't you, huh?\nMm-hmm. All right, homework --\nWhat about French?\nI got my history. What was your history like? 64%. 64%. -Yeah.\n-Well done, you. -Pizza's ready!\n-Okay. Thank you, sir. Please.\nYou're very welcome. Oh, thank you very much. Meat Feast or pepperoni? I think it's Meat Feast,\none of your favorites. -Meat Feast.\n-Looks like it's Meat Feast. Do you guys sort of,\nlike, realize that, like, the marijuana\nthat your dad's smoking is still, like,\ntechnically illegal? Yeah, we do. How does that make you feel?\nLike, what... Uh... Kind of scared that\nhe's gonna get caught. Paul: If I thought there\nwould be a situation where our life\nwould be threatened, I wouldn't smoke.\nMm-hmm. That's just\nblack and white. They're more important to me\nthan, uh -- than anything. [ Speaks indistinctly ] Ooh.\nHey, you okay? Yes, yes. Is it sort of scary\nto think that he has to do something that's illegal to,\nlike, feel better? If it's helping him,\nI allow it. But if he's doing it\nfor no reason, really, I would feel\nkind of upset. Right. But it doesn't seem like\nhe's doing it for no reason. It seems like\nit helps him a lot, right?\nMm-hmm. Well, she hates smoking --\nI think that's the main thing. And she's got a pretty good\nsense of values. And to her, whatever\nshe sees in the world, says pot's bad. And she thinks\nin black and white. And now we give her\nthis conundrum that daddy needs it. It kind of throws a bit\nof a wobbly at her, you know? Mm-hmm. So she's trying very hard\nto reconcile that. We had a bit of a cry together\nand a cuddle upstairs, and, uh, she'll be okay. I mean, it's hard, right?\nAnd it's -- It's lousy. I have to live a lie,\nand no parent, especially when you've got\nabsolute love for your kids, wants to do that. \u266a\u266a I've come\nto Limehouse Marina in London to see John on the final leg\nof his journey. Today he's gonna take\nhis tiny, little canal boat into the mighty River Thames\nto let his cannabis banner fly and to drum up support\nfor marijuana reform right in front of Parliament. What we've got here are\nsome CBD-rich cannabis seeds. They're very low in THCs. I'm gonna pop them\nin the balloon. Okay. [ Helium hissing ] We are gonna tie some notes\nto them from patients -- medicinal-cannabis patients\nacross the UK, and we're gonna send those\nup into the sky and hope they reach\ncommunities across Albion. Amazing. [ Hissing continues ] So, what do you reckon the day's\ngonna be like for you? Uh, I am...\nI mean,\nyou're taking a small boat into big old body of water. It's gonna be a big old\nbody of water out there, be nice and choppy. How is it different from the small canals\nthat you go in? Uh, it's tidal,\nso it's pretty dangerous. Do you think the boat's\ngonna handle it? The boat is gonna handle it,\nmy friend. We do not like pessimism...\nOkay. Right on. ...anywhere near my boat.\n[ Laughs ] \u266a\u266a [ Boat motor humming ] All right, John!\nSee you, man! Goodbye, Krishna.\nGood luck. Namaste. Whoo-whoo!\nWhoo-whoo! [ Laughs ] That's the little barge\nthat could. \u266a\u266a [ Crowd cheering ] It's to legalize\ncannabis in London. [ Cheering continues ] -Hey, how's it going?\n-Nice to meet you, man. Good to meet you.\nHey, man. I'm Krishna. You guys excited? \u266a\u266a [ Siren wailing ] Hey, Paul. -Krishna, how are you?\n-How's it going, man? Aw, it's good to see you. -What a great event.\n-I know. How are you feeling --\nYou excited? I'm very enthused\nand excited about it. It's not just talk. These are real people\ncoming out and demonstrating\nthe reality they believe in. And that's got to make a\ndifference, Krishna, in the end. And what's it like being sort of\nbeing amongst this group of, like,\nother like-minded people? -Brothers. Family.\n-You think so? -Yeah.\n-Amazing. They're just be so open\nand honest about it. I asked them, did they feel\nat all self-conscious? Hell no.\n[ Laughs ] You know, this is what\nthey believe and what they do. Yeah, people are just, like,\nsmoking weed next to the Thames, next to Parliament. The English are\nvery law-abiding. But I think now that we're starting to see\na movement that's gonna\ngive us a change. And this is the mother\nof Parliaments. If it can't start here... -This is where it starts.\n-This is where it starts. \u266a\u266a Andavolu:\nAll right, it looks like he's just about to go\nunder Westminster Bridge, and he's just gonna pop out right in front of the Houses\nof Parliament and Big Ben. I saw him for just this little\nbit right on the other side, and he looked really tiny. Like, the boat was small. And -- Oh, look! You can\njust see him right there. He's coming in. \u266a\u266a [ Cheers and applause ] He's releasing the balloons. [ Laughs ] Amazing. Man: Go on, John!\nKeep going! Get those seeds!\nYou tell Cameron! [ Cheering continues ] Hey, John!\nHey, John! He gave the wave!\n[ Laughs ] He waved at us. And he looks so small\ncompared to that building. \u266a\u266a [ Cheers and applause ] \u266a\u266a As an American,\ncoming to the UK and seeing how medical-marijuana\npatients are faring -- In one way, it's a little\ndispiriting to see that they have to improvise and sort of do\nthis underground stuff to get what they think is\nmedicine that's gonna help them. But another way -- I'm seeing\nsomething sort of special. The people I met here\nare kind of filling in the gaps. Guys like John,\nlike Paul, like Hidrow, who are making real sacrifices\nin order to help people -- Robin Hoods of sorts -- they're forming these kind of\nad hoc underground communities, taking weed\nfrom the black market, making it into oil\nand medicine, and then giving it\nto the needy. That's kind of\na beautiful thing. That sort of, like,\nmodel of compassion is something I think\nthat the world can learn from. What I've seen in the U.S. is that legal weed\ncan equal money. But here in the UK, it seems like illegal weed\nequals compassion. And what's cool\nis that compassion is free. \u266a\u266a", "8ZqVx1M3daQ": "So everyone knows THC, tetrahydrocannabinol. It was first discovered in 1964 in Raphael\nMechoulam's lab in Israel. And it was about the same time the Beetles\nwere first being exposed to cannabis themselves and it was the 60s and so voila. This is the chemical that's causing all the\neffects of marijuana is what people thought. Before that time people had not been able,\nscientists had not been able to find this one abundant compound. They couldn't isolate it. They couldn't dictate the chemical structure\nof it. They found other compounds called cannabinoids\nin cannabis. But THC was the big find and a 32-year-old\nscientist discovered it and, you know, made his, launched an illustrious career. But it turns out that THC is not the only\ngame in town in marijuana or in cannabis, and is not the only extremely useful compound\nin cannabis. And for that you have to look at CBD. CBD stands for cannabidiol, CBD. It's basically a structural isomer of THC. What that means to say is THC and CBD have\nthe same chemical composition but the atoms are just arranged just a little bit differently. In fact, there's a ring that opens and closes. If that ring is closed it's THC, if that ring\nis open it's CBD. And you can actually in a flask convert between\none and the other with just a little bit of acid. And, you know, any organic chemist out there\nwill know what I'm talking about. So that CBD compound we've actually known\nabout for longer than THC but it's only in the last few decades that we've begun to appreciate\nhow useful it is both in helping to modulate the effects of THC and as a unique compound\nitself. It has antiseizure properties. It has pain relieving properties. It has anticancer properties. It blunts the worst effects of THC itself\nwhen it's coadministered. So people talk about dissociative effect with\nTHC. People talk about a anxiogenic effect. When you put CBD in there it actually helps\nto mitigate those effects. And that's been shown in studies where they\ngo out in the field and they test what types of marijuana people have and the ones that\nhave CBD in them people report improved, less of those negative symptoms I've described. And that's also been seen in animal studies\nand on and on. Some groups have even called for just adding\nCBD into cancer chemotherapy regimens and these are cancer research groups. CBD has been also hailed as a treatment to\nprevent diabetic neuropathy which is the leading cause of blindness in the United States. It protects nerves. And this is all from a little compound, set\nof compounds that this cannabis plant naturally produces. Some strains have higher amounts of THC and\nlow amounts of CBD. Some strains have low amounts THC and high\namounts of CBD and some are in between somewhere. And that's all part of the genetic diversity\nand chemical diversity of cannabis.", "Ztdpu7AwInU": "welcome to cooking with marijuana it's Matt your host and today's recipe is marijuana mac and cheese the marijuana mac and cheese they were making today is designed to be a side dish and a larger holiday meal it's designed so that you can cook it in three to four hours and so it's not going to take up your entire day and allow you time to still cook a larger meal it's also designed to use ground marijuana so that pretty much anyone would be able to make this dish it's also designed to be potent enough so that you could eat one portion of the mac and cheese and still enjoy a larger holiday meal it's not the easiest dish we've made so be sure to follow the directions closely so let's get started here's what you're going to need four to eight grams of dried marijuana flours the better quality the better one stick or half a cup of unsalted butter a half a pound about two cups of elbow macaroni 1/4 cup of 31 grams of all-purpose flour three cups of whole milk 1/2 a cup of yellow onions chopped fine 1 large egg 8 ounces of sharp cheddar cheese shredded and divided salt pepper and cayenne pepper to taste about a teaspoon of each and panko bread crumbs about one cup or 250 milliliters in the first step we will process the marijuana by grinding it and then decarboxylated it first pre-heat your oven to 250 degrees make sure that your oven is accurate then weigh out the amount of marijuana that you're going to use in your recipe we're using about 6 grams of high-grade medical marijuana you can vary the amount depending on how potent you want your recipe and how potent your marijuana is to begin with grind it into a coarse meal avoid grinding it into a powder once your marijuana is ground we're going to place it inside of a small oven safe dish if you have one with a sealing lid that's great otherwise seal it tight with aluminum foil now you will place the sealed ground marijuana container into the oven that's preheated at 250 degrees we're going to leave that undisturbed for 15 minutes what we're doing now is we're beginning the activation process to convert the PHC into a form that will give us the head fire ahead hi effects when we eat it so we're only gonna go 15 minutes at the temperature of 250 degrees they will we will remove that and let it cool off for a few minutes before you remove the lid and you'll see that your marijuana has become a nice toasted light brown to greenish color and has a really wonderful marijuana aroma now we will infuse the THC from the deep carboxylated marijuana and to our clarified butter the first step will be to cut your butter into cubes so that we can melt it evenly and slowly we're gonna place that in a pan over medium to very medium-low heat and let that melt very slowly I've sped up the process and the camera also you can prepare a sieve I'm using cheesecloth over a clear container so I can demonstrate the color of the butter when it's done but you can use whatever you wish to see about with cheesecloth now the butter is still melting and you'll see as it melts the milk fat is gathering at the top that's the thick white stuff that's clamoring at the top we're gonna spoon that out the best we can with our spoon and then once we've removed what we can on our spoon we can pour it through the cheesecloth sieve to remove what we can of the milk pen you can be more careful if you want and it's we're gonna make macaroni and cheese so we're just trying to move as much as the milk pan as we can to help the infusion process so now we were clarified our butter we want to put it into our double boiler with enough water in it to let it boil for a good half-hour and we're going to add our ground decarboxylated marijuana right into that butter just mix it in with a spoon use metal if you can and just gonna leave that boiling make sure you don't run out of water we don't not want the butter to boil but keep that [ __ ] bottom water boiling and put a lid on it and we're gonna set a timer for 30 minutes now what we're doing now is we're melting the THC into our button and we're also finishing the decarboxylation process which you can notice the little tiny little bubbles that are floating up is part of that process now after 30 minutes you will notice that your butter has turned a dark pretty green color and it's kind of hard to see with the plant material still in it but once you pour that through your cheesecloth seed you'll see that the butter at the bottom has darkened quite substantially into a green color to make sure that we have got all the butter out we're going to squeeze out as much as we can of the butter I use a slotted spoon and another spoon press between it and then once it's cooled off I use my fingers to get the remaining out and you'll notice that the butter is a nice green color it's clear because it's clarified and it's a nice pure oil ready for our recipe now our last step is to assemble and bake our macaroni and cheese start out by separating three tablespoons of our kena butter and set that aside for our topping now the remaining cannabutter we're going to put on low heat and a medium saucepan very low heat here we're also going to sift in a quarter cup of flour sift and mix that in and we're gonna let that go for about five minutes at a really low heat just to blend that flour and the butter all together and then now we're going to add in our three cups of milk and we're also going to add in our 1/2 a cup of chopped onions and we're going to mix that together keep it on really low heat we're just gonna get it warm enough to melt the butter and the milk together you'll also want to cook your pasta al dente and drain it have it standing by now we're gonna temper in our egg by first breaking the yolk and then adding about a cup of the warm extra hand very slowly whisking it in and then whisking that mixture back into the hot mixture this is tempering it in to keep the egg from cooking as we mix it now we're adding in our 1 teaspoon each of Mike pepper cayenne pepper and salt you can season it to your own taste now we're adding in 3 force of our shredded cheddar cheese we're going to leave about 1/4 of it too with our topping so we're gonna add that in there and then let it melt a little bit mix that in until it's thoroughly incorporated now we're going to add in our pasta and mix that in keeping this all on low temperature all along this is not going to boil or simmer this is just just mixing it and now we're gonna completely for our mix the mixture into our baking dish you can use a big casserole dish but I'm using this Dutch oven for presentation and now we're mixing our topping we're taking our panko bread crumbs ratting the 3 tablespoons of melted cannabutter that we had separated out mix those in with the bread crumbs first get those incorporated then mix in the remaining cheddar cheese this is gonna make our topping that we're gonna put right on top of our macaroni recipe it's gonna soak up some of the moisture but that's fine it's gonna make a nice solid crust okay spread that evenly and get ready to put that in the oven the oven has been preheated to 350 degrees and we want to put that uncovered inside for about 30 minutes or until the top is nice and golden brown [Music] no I said this is a side dish but you could easily add in some bacon or some ham or some chopped Turkey and make a nice main course if you wish I hope you enjoy this marijuana mac and cheese [Music] [Music] so I hope you enjoyed this recipe for marijuana mac and cheese if you did please leave a thumbs up please also leave a comment and suggest the recipe that you'd like to see me cook with marijuana and share this with your friends please also subscribe to roughhouse studios if you'd like to see more cannabis culture videos I'm gonna enjoy some marijuana mac and cheese now hope you have a great

sleep every Wednesday this month we are investigating the 99 CBD questions you've been asking we'll be digging into the latest research and conducting our own surveys to bring you the answers that clear up your CBD confusion today we dive into one of the biggest claims that I keep hearing about can CBD help your pain investigative journalist mark Ebner Comfort was here with the results the marijuana has been prescribed for pain to the cancer lots of things actually and now CBD which is a compound of cannabis is being touted for pain as well so walk us through these claims because they're all over the place yeah there are a lot of claims that CVD is very effective in treating all kinds of pain from muscle soreness to joint pain to inflammation to all kinds of chronic pain some even take it a step further and say this can help you recover from injury faster and see meeting is described as having certain compounds that will interrupt those pain signals walk through some of these CBD products and there's a lot of opportunities here to help but these CBD products are interestingly diverse we've got ones that you ingest that start with those what's the glory so there are a wide variety of CBD products that you would take orally from tea to candy to good old-fashioned pills but there's also a wide variety of doses so it goes from as low as five milligrams to as high as thirty milligrams and this is a big gray area it's not like acetaminophen where you know exactly how much to take if you have a headache but this you are just guessing and sometimes that with the tinctures I mean they have a drop-off and your demand dramatically changing the dose there's one drop but what does that mean the whole dropper a big drop a little drop it's very confusing all right over here we've got the ones that you apply topical products yeah topical products big segment of the industry and that ranges from creams to bombs to cooling sticks they even have bath bombs that you can throw in the tub and soak in but just like with the oral products there's really a lot of variety in the doses so like the doses the prices are all over the place we have found some projects as low as $8 we found some as much as 150 bucks how can the same products range in that much of but if footballs cost 850 bucks in some cases it is very very expensive here's the thing CBD is not subject to federal regulations remember this is a supplement not a drug so the companies can really charge anything they want that can be marketing it can be hype now in some cases the price does reflect higher quality a company that's using much stricter production standards but not always well this thing's confusing me the most of them of course people want to get the lower priced item because it's more affordable yeah and they're actually often wasting their money so you wanted to test some of the products out so we had this brainstorming we decided we'll just use Mara to test it out well I have a third-party do it we got the kitty pigment right here so what kinds of aches and pains are we gonna cheat on you yeah I was happy to do it because I do have things that bother me so I have lower back pain that's been recurring for years it's from an old sports injury and my knee now has also started bothering me so with my back it's generally after I've been laying or sleeping for too long it's very tense and sometimes after certain workouts join the club I've got both of those BOCES he thought he probably does as well so where I decided to try CBD products for 3 days to see if they would help her with her pain here's her video diary I wanted to find out which CBD products would best help me with my lower back pain I decided to try three products over the course of three days a balm capsules and mouth drops day is day one and I did wake up with some soreness on my lower back which is actually pretty typical I've been laying all night and it just tends to get sore my knee is not bothering me yet that tends to get worse as the day goes on but I'm gonna get started and we'll see how cuz so it's been about an hour and I will say I was super skeptical I didn't expect it to do anything but my back really just feel better it feels really loose it just doesn't have that like tightness and that pain that it had when I woke up it's day two and today I'm trying the capsules I actually do have quite a bit of back pain today because of a workout I did yesterday so it says take one to two capsules twice a day so it's been a few hours since I took the capsules and I'm really glad that it is a weekend because I am definitely feeling a little bit loopy a little bit lightheaded just it feels like I've just had a glass of wine or two classes so I'm getting ready to go to sleep and I'm definitely still feeling a little bit out of it but I just realized I haven't thought about my pain all night state three and today I am trying the drops so these are water soluble and I'm gonna put into my shape this morning as I'm getting ready to mix this I'm realizing the dosing is a little bit of an issue the bottle says use three drops but that's not very scientific the other thing is does not smell good to see how it tastes it tastes like my normal shape so that's a good thing so it's been a few hours since I had my shake and I don't feel anything up next what Maura things worked and what didn't we're gonna explore the latest science about CBD and pain relief [Music] be sure you subscribe to my channel so you don't miss anything and remember to check back often

on the public side and on the private side having said that I think that we've been stating all along that we think that we've hit the bottom I think that the regulatory agencies of the larger states California particularly message that more effective regulatory efforts along with reduced taxation on the companies that are doing this the right way will lead to a tamping down on the black market but until that happens the black markets going to thrive and you will have situations where the companies that are that are public right now are being judged on pathways to profitability and not just license aggregation like they were you know year year and a half ago we haven't and we have found in California for example the regulations have been so stringent or confusing that many small companies trying to to you know get involved in the recreational pot market have found it very difficult to comply with some of these regulations and that in part is the reason that the black market is still flourished there are we over doing the the regulatory framework when we're trying to allow an industry to grow at the same time now you're absolutely spot-on I mean but but the but the what states like California to realize that reduced taxation is the main problem here if we can get lower tax rates on the companies that are again are doing this legally in the right way then you will have a lot more companies be successful and you'll have a tamping down at the black market but until then the black market has no reason to go away they're just going to continue to do this until they get caught by the same token though are we being too impatient expecting these stocks to provide a return when let's face it this is going to take a while to get various governments state governments provincial governments to accept legalized recreational marijuana you know it's not likely we're gonna hear anything on the federal level for quite some time so it'll happen eventually I guess but we just have to be patient with it right I think you're right and it's both on the public key and the private side you have to realize that without institutional investors in the in the pub in the in the public game you've got a lot of retail investors that don't have that patience and so I think that as and more institutional players are starting to realize that this is an undeniable industry it's not going away and it's just taking a longer time to convert the illicit market into legalized one but as that happens this industry is going to thrive on the legal side and we do need more regulation at the federal level the the house passing the safe banking act was it was a big step in the right direction but you know we have some some wood to chop left on some other pieces of legislation that are coming down the pike very quickly I think one of the biggest hurdles the industry faces is the banking industry itself in this legal limbo they find themselves and where banks don't want to do business with them because it's still illegal federally how do will they get around that can they get around that and where do you see that going we've got 47 companies in our portfolio across three different funds and site and co-investments every single one of them have a banking relationship it just it just isn't easy it will get easier but I got to tell you this is we are as excited as we've ever been about investing in the industry as our our limited partners and we think 2020 is going to be a fantastic year to take advantage of the opportunities that have been like I said earlier brought back down to a more realistic level well we will see you", "ucw8dRNNCv4": "MAINTAIN A STRONG BOND EVEN\nTHROUGH THE TURBULENT YEARS.

Blunt Bongs That's not...that's not weed. Whatever name you give it, cannabis is the most commonly used \u201cillicit\u201d drug in the United States. And it has a pretty prevalent place in our\nsociety, popping up in our media and on the news. Marijuana has long been considered a gateway drug gateway drug gateway drug Marijuana is a dangerous gateway drug. leading to the use of other, more addictive,\nand more dangerous substances. But what does marijuana actually do to to\nthe human brain? ...and body? And is it as dangerous as D.A.R.E. always\nled us to believe? This is drugs. This is your brain on drugs. Any questions? Well, marijuana has been legalized in several\nstates. And it\u2019s legal for medical use in several\nothers. So it\u2019s becoming more mainstream. In fact, it\u2019s legal right here in California. So we went to a local cannabis dispensary\nto talk to some experts in the field. So my name is Shelby. I am the assistant marketing director here\nat Torrey Holistics. Here at Torrey Holistics, we really try to\ndo a lot of education because that's ultimately where we are going to break down the stigma\nwhere people are going to realize the medicinal benefits of cannabis. Torrey Holistics opened as a medical dispensary\nin 2015. We were the first in the state to get our\nrecreational retail license, but we still serve medical and recreational alike. Marijuana use in the U.S. has a pretty interesting\nhistory. Early white colonists brought cannabis to\nNorth America to cultivate as hemp, which was used for making rope, clothing, and paper\nproducts. During the 1800s, it became popular as a medicinal\ntreatment, and \u201chashish houses\u201d flourished. Until 1906 when the Food and Drug Act required\nlabels on anything containing cannabis. Then, as Mexican immigrants began arriving\nin the U.S. following the Mexican Civil War, they brought recreational marijuana with them. Racist anti-immigration sentiment rapidly\nled to fear of the \u201cMarijuana Menace\u201d. In the 1930\u2019s, a string of very dubious\nstudies linked marijuana use to violence and crime. And states began to outlaw the narcotic. When Harry Anslinger, the Chief of the Federal\nBureau of Narcotics was appointed, they were going through a budget cut because of the\nGreat Depression. So to keep his title and keep funding for\nthe department, they actually kind of created this whole scare around cannabis. He started referring to it as \"marijuana\"\nbecause he knew that everybody was already consuming cannabis. It was in tinctures, you could buy at a local\npharmacy. And so the senators who were voting on this\nprohibition bill didn't realize that marijuana was the same thing as cannabis. So they effectively voted to ban the very\nsubstance that they were using for their own medical needs. Following the release of the famous film \u201cReefer\nMadness\u201d in 1936, the federal government passed the Marijuana Tax Act, effectively\noutlawing cannabis except in specific medical and industrial cases. For decades, despite new and better research\nindicating that marijuana isn\u2019t associated with violent crime and debauchery, marijuana\nuse was increasingly restricted. And the punishments for its possession and\nuse became more and more harsh. Anslinger first pushed it as, like, you know,\nlike you're going to be very lustful and you're going to do crazy things, it's a gateway drug. And then he actually changed his rhetoric\nlater in the century to be, like, cannabis as a lazy stoner drug. Like, you don't get anything done, you're\nnot contributing to society at all. This eventually led to all kinds of government\npolicies, like mandatory minimum sentences, a three-strikes policy, and President George\nBush\u2019s War on Drugs. These have had lasting and damaging effects\non many U.S. citizens and the public\u2019s perception of marijuana. You can learn more about the history of these\nlaws and their effects on our country\u2019s citizens by checking out the links in the\ndescription below. But then in 1996, that started to change. Medical marijuana was legalized in the state\nof California. And now, almost twenty years later, cannabis\nhas a pretty prevalent place in our society. Public perceptions and acceptance of cannabis\nhas definitely improved in the last several years. Especially in light of the opioid epidemic,\npeople are much more receptive to a lot of the research and findings coming out. So it might seem kind of weird that we actually\ndon\u2019t know very much about the risks or benefits of marijuana. See, even though it\u2019s becoming legal in\nmore and more states for recreational and medical use, cannabis is still outlawed by\nthe federal government, so it\u2019s heavily regulated and restricted. That means that it\u2019s difficult for scientists\nand doctors to get marijuana to actually use in their research. And without that research, it can be hard\nto say much about the possible dangers or benefits of using the drug. So what do we know? When you smoke a joint and get that high feeling,\nwhat\u2019s happening in your brain? Even that\u2019s not so simple. Cannabis has two major chemical components. Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, and cannabidiol, or CBD. Plus smaller amounts of a whole bunch of other\ncannabinoid compounds. These molecules act on what\u2019s called the\nendocannabinoid system in the brain by binding to cannabinoid 1 and 2 receptors. These receptors were actually named after\ncannabis, because they were identified by scientists trying to understand how the drug\nworks. Both kinds of receptors are found throughout\nthe body, but CB1 receptors are the most common in the brain, found at the end terminals of\nneurons. The brain produces endocannabinoid compounds,\nwhich bind to and activate CB1 receptors. Cannabinoid receptors are g-protein-coupled\nreceptors, so when they\u2019re activated, it kicks off a cascade inside the cell that has\nsome effect downstream. In this case, that means modulating the signaling\nat the synapse. The molecular biology of this is actually\nreally really complicated, but in general, activating CB1 receptors has an inhibitory\neffect on the release of a variety of neurotransmitters including dopamine, GABA, glutamate, noradrenaline,\nserotonin, and acetylcholine. Our best understanding of the endocannabinoid\nsystem is that it plays an important role in regulating other systems in the brain and\nthroughout the body. In the brain, endocannabinoid signaling plays\na role in memory, cognition, pain perception, and motor movements. THC is considered a psychoactive compound,\nmeaning that it affects perception, cognition, or behavior. It binds to CB1 receptors, activating the\nendocannabinoid system, and inducing the feelings of relaxation and euphoria that are commonly\nassociated with cannabis use. As well as impairments in spatial and verbal\nmemory. Your license, where is your license? My license. It's on the bumper man, right back there,\nman. No, I mean your driver's license. Oh. Oh yeah, yeah, I've got my driver's license,\nman. Users of marijuana often report enhanced introspection,\nand sometimes feelings of anxiety or paranoia. Cannabis use can also lead to \u201cthe munchies\u201d. Feeling like you\u2019re hungry. Thought to be a result of the way THC is processed\nby the liver. CBD, on the other hand, is not a psychoactive\ncompound. It has the exact same chemical formula as\nTHC, but with a slightly different chemical structure. This means that it binds to the endocannabinoid\nsystem differently, and doesn\u2019t induce those psychoactive effects. But it\u2019s being explored for treating a variety\nof conditions, and is believed to be anti-inflammatory, like ibuprofen. Most notably, it\u2019s used to help prevent\nseizures in very severe types of epilepsy. And it\u2019s being explored for use in treating\nmigraines and anxiety. Speaking anecdotally, I have friends who swear\nby CBD for treating their migraines. So CBD has become more popular in research. And it's showing that it's a very powerful\nanylgesic, very powerful anti-inflammatory agent, and you don't need to experience any\npsychoactivity with it. So now you can consume cannabis without that\npsychoactivity that some people are kind of put off by. You can have the medicinal benefits alone. One thing I always like to say everywhere\nis that if you ever find yourself too high, say you took an edible that you're just feeling\noverwhelmed with, have some CBD on-hand. CBD will bring you down from that high. The products that are available for medical\nand recreational use contain different varieties of cannabis that have different effects. Some have higher levels of THC or CBD, and\ndifferent \u201cstrains\u201d are reported to have different psychoactive effects. Like how people say that indica is \u201crelaxing\u201d\nwhile sativa is \u201cstimulating\u201d. The difference between different strains like\nindica and sativa involves something called the \"entourage effect\", which we use very affectionately in this industry. It has to do with the over 113 different cannabinoids\nand terpenes in the cannabis plant. They play on each other in very unique ways. If you think about how many different sorts\nof combinations those cannabinoids have, all of these different regulatory compounds are working with each other to create a specific effect. How long the sensation lasts depends mostly\non how the cannabis is consumed. If it\u2019s smoked, it usually takes under three\nhours for the sensations to fade. But oral or edible doses can last much longer,\nwith some of the effects lasting up to 24 hours. The research on the therapeutic benefits of\ncannabis use are so far pretty optimistic. Though the studies are still plagued by small\ngroup sizes and restrictions on marijuana use. The long-term effects and risks of cannabis\nuse also depend on how it\u2019s used. Some risks are obvious. Like if you smoke cannabis, you\u2019re at an\nincreased risk of problems like chronic cough, bronchitis, a weakened immune system, and\nlung cancer. Unlike a number of other drugs, like alcohol\nor opioids, cannabis is not physically addictive. That means that if you stop smoking weed cold\nturkey, you might feel irritable, anxious, and have trouble sleeping, but it won\u2019t\nmake you sick. Or...kill you. It\u2019s also thought to be pretty much impossible\nto fatally overdose on cannabis. Last year, the National Institute on Alcohol\nAbuse and Alcoholism stated that 90,000 people died from alcohol-related causes. Whereas, with cannabis, there's never been\na reported incident of an overdose. So yes, it's much safer in that sense. Consuming an very large amount can lead to\nextremely unpleasant consequences, like psychotic episodes, but it won\u2019t directly cause death. But, that doesn\u2019t mean that using marijuana\ndoesn\u2019t come with other kinds of risks. Or that using marijuana can\u2019t have negative\neffects on other aspects of your life, like any kind of drug or addiction. Using marijuana during pregnancy is believed\nto carry risks like a low birth weight and possibly other developmental problems. Though it\u2019s difficult to say if these\neffects are definitely a result of marijuana use or other external factors. If a person starts using marijuana as a teenager,\nbefore their brain has finished growing and developing, it can have long-term effects\non cognition and memory. Researchers have done small studies using\nMRI scans to look at brain structure in adults in their 20\u2019s with people who are diagnosed\nwith a cannabis use disorder... basically meaning that they use a lot of weed,\nand it has negative effects on their lives... and people who don\u2019t use cannabis at all,\nand found that teenagers who smoked pot daily had abnormally-shaped hippocampi and did worse\non long-term memory tasks compared to non-users. Some research has found that heavy cannabis\nuse starting during adolescence can have long-term effects on dopamine signaling in the brain. Dopamine is a chemical that plays important\nroles in reward and motivation as well as movement control. Scientists think that this is likely due to\nheavy marijuana use interrupting normal brain development, resulting in problems with the\nwiring and leading to problems down the line. And in general, people who use a lot of weed\nhave issues with verbal memory and cognitive tasks. Pretty much all of this research has been\ndone in people who use a lot of cannabis. Like, every single day, for extended periods\nof time. So far, we don\u2019t know much about the possible\nrisks of just occasional usage, like in social settings or on the odd weekend. Our view of cannabis use at Torrey Holistics\nis that moderation is key. With anything. You drink too much coffee, you're going to\nget a stomach ache. If you use too much cannabis, you could have\nmemory impairment. But it all comes down to just consuming responsibly. In places where marijuana is legal, it\u2019s\ngenerally pretty easy to access. There are storefront dispensaries where you\ncan talk to \"bud tenders\" and shop for your favorite varieties. Or online sites that allow you to order products\nfor delivery to your front door. But even where it\u2019s legal, there are some\nrestrictions. It\u2019s highly taxed, for one thing, and you\nmust be over 21 to purchase it recreationally, or over 18 to get a medical marijuana card. Cannabis in California, at least, is more\nregulated than the food we're eating. If it's grown on a farm, maybe a mile down\nthe street from another farm that uses pesticides, the labs will pick up on that and it won't\nbe able to be sold. So the cannabis you're consuming, as long\nas it's from a legal, licensed dispensary, is very very safe. And while some surveys indicate that more\nthan half of all Americans have tried cannabis at some point in their lives, around 163 million people, only 4 million people would classify as having\na cannabis use disorder, a rate of about 3%. In contrast, about 5-6% of Americans who try\nalcohol during their lifetime will become addicted. This could be because it\u2019s just generally\nmuch easier to access alcohol than it is to get weed. And we might see those numbers changing if\nmarijuana continues to become more mainstream in the U.S. And remember how marijuana is considered a\n\u201cgateway drug\u201d? While it\u2019s true that marijuana users are\nmore likely to abuse alcohol and nicotine than non-users, the majority of people who\nuse marijuana will never go on to use \u201charder\u201d substances, like opiods. And even when marijuana users do use harder\ndrugs, it\u2019s at the same rate as people who use other already-legal drugs, like alcohol\nand nicotine. So it\u2019s not an effect of cannabis, so much\nas it\u2019s an effect of any drug that affects the reward systems of the brain. There's a misconception that cannabis is a\ngateway drug. And they're finding now that it's actually\nan exit drug. It can be very helpful, actually, in people\nstruggling with addictions. I see the cannabis industry fulfilling the\nneed for alternative forms of pain management. With the opioid epidemic, I think that a lot\nof people are seeking alternative forms of relief. And they're finding that with cannabis. Ultimately, we know that cannabis is a very\ncomplicated plant with complex chemical components. And we don\u2019t fully understand its effects\non the human brain or the long-term risks or benefits of its use. Scientists are hard at working on studying\nthis topic, trying to better understand the chemistry and neuroscience of cannabis as\nit continues to be legalized in more states and becomes more popular nationwide. I'm so excited about the research coming out. Like I was saying, there's so much to be done. Over 113 different cannabinoids that we've\nonly just touched on. So I think that the findings are just going\nto continue to show the medicinal qualities of cannabis. Because it\u2019s still federally outlawed, there\nare a lot of complicating factors in its use and study. Like it might be legal to use cannabis in\nyour state, but you could still lose your job if your employer has a zero-tolerance\npolicy. One issue that I think about a lot is the\nfact that we don\u2019t really have the marijuana equivalent of a breathalyzer to quickly determine if someone is currently under the influence of cannabis or not. That means that unless a police officer actually\nsees a person using weed, it\u2019s really difficult to know if someone is committing a DUI. Because a person might test positive for cannabis\neven many hours and days after its use. At any rate, it seems likely that marijuana\nis at least as \u201cokay\u201d as any other currently legal substance available to the public. That whole \u201creefer madness\u201d thing was\njust propaganda. We must work untiringly so that our children\nare obliged to learn the truth. Because it is only through knowledge that\nwe can safely protect them. So if you live in a place where marijuana\nhas been legalized, enjoy responsibly. Do you have strong feelings about marijuana\nlegalization or its use? What concerns do you have as it becomes more\nprevalent in our society? Or what benefits do you think it might offer? Let us know in the comments below! Thanks for watching this episode of Neuro\nTransmissions and a huge thank you to Shelby and Dr. Beth at Torrey Holistics for their\nhelp with this video. Until our next transmission, I\u2019m Alie Astrocyte. Over and out.", "EUFU196kib4": "Marijuana, when used for therapeutic use,\ncan be prepared and ingested in several different ways. The most common way that most people know\nabout is smoking. Rolling that into a cigarette-looking item,\nand inhaling. I think that's how most of us have seen cannabis\nused in movies or recreationally. Another mode of ingestion, that has very similar\neffects on the body as smoking, is vaporization. And patients report liking this method, because\nit actually takes out the smoke and inhaling cannabis. And there are several large machines on the\nmarket or even handheld vaporizers, that allow patients to use a very similar amount that\nthey would use in smoking. But put it in a device that actually heats\nup the plant matter so that just all of the molecules vaporize instead of actually burning\nthe plant matter and inhaling. And, of course, cannabis does not cause cancer\nbut smoke can create problems with your throat and some people just don't like the smoke. So vaporization is another way to inhale cannabis\nwithout the smoke. But for medical cannabis patients who need\nlonger relief and need a longer lasting relief, they find that actually eating cannabis, or\nturning it into what is called a tincture, or even a topical rub produces better effects. Now, all of these different types of ingestion\nor modes of use have different effects. If you're using, if you're smoking medical\ncannabis, either through what people call a joint, or through a pipe, or bong, you're\ngoing to feel the effects right away. And a lot of people like this because it lets\nthem know their titration rate. Right? They know if I take one puff and I feel like\nthis, then I don't need anymore. But for edibles, it can actually take up to\n45 minutes for people to feel the effect at all. And that's actually why we find, you know,\nyou hear people OD'ing, figuratively, on edibles. It's really that they've just taken too much. And I think you'll hear from some of the other\nvideos that it's actually impossible to overdose on cannabis. But it can have some unfavorable side effects\nif you eat too much. A tincture preparation is actually a preparation\nusing a liquid to pull the compounds out of the plant. And you've probably seen a tincture in your\nhealth foods store for St. John's wort or echinacea. It's simply a process of putting alcohol with\nthe plant matter and the alcohol extracts out the compounds from the plant and then\nyou're able to ingest this through a dropper or through a spray under your tongue. And other people make, actually make topical\noils. Which, for people who don't like the side\neffects of dry mouth or sleepiness, people prefer just to put it right on the wounded\narea. And this can be done by preparing something\nwith cocoa cocoa butter or other items. And there are actually several recipes for\neach of these preparations on our website, americansforsafeaccess.org.", "WIJzk_M5L0c": "okay hey how you doing man - Chung great to meet you shoot it works

be taken with a grain of salt it really only applies to indoor grown cannabis outdoor grown cannabis is going to naturally have a small amount of CBN present due to the UV that's impinging on it from the Sun and the weathering that's happening as it grows in the outdoor environment during the entire grow season so not uncommon to find say 0.5% CBN in an outdoor grown flower that's been perfectly grown and perfectly processed and is very fresh so CBN is not always an indicator of negativity either in the growth conditions or in processing so good to understand that it also has some interesting therapeutic benefits one of the ones that's interesting to me especially is around cardiovascular effects it actually decreases heart rate without decreasing blood flow so can bring your heart rate down some animal model research has also said that CBN induces feelings of grogginess I actually did some consumer testing along the way in developing the humble products to look at CBN and I found very clearly that CBN is a very dose dependent substance and that at low doses can be effective as a sleep aid but as you go into moderate and high doses actually seems to be contraindicated for sleep and can be alerting to many people so there's a very interesting finding and in fact found through our work that LOC cbn dose and a dose of THC accompanying with mersin are virtually equivalent",

what it is what it does and giving you the facts to know your body first up let's get a dose of vocabulary the wide world of marijuana can be confusing and understanding basic terminology can help you to navigate the facts marijuana is often referred to as cannabis as it's part of the cannabis family of plants that also includes hemp the marijuana plant can take over a hundred different chemicals called cannabinoids cannabinoids are active chemicals that can alter the mind and body in a variety of ways some of which have proven beneficial to cannabinoids from the plant that are being studied and used for their medicinal value our THC and CBD THC contains the mind-altering properties associated with feeling high while CBD offers health benefits without causing a high medical marijuana is not currently considered a cure but it is used for therapeutic benefits of symptom relief THC can reduce nausea increased appetite decrease pain and inflammation and help with muscle control problems CBD has benefits including pain reduction controlling epileptic seizures and it may even be used to treat mental illness and addiction the therapeutic benefits of medical marijuana can help those suffering with multiple sclerosis cancer HIV AIDS glaucoma and Crohn's disease just to name a few while the FDA has not approved marijuana as medicine the study of its cannabinoids has led to two fda-approved medications that use cannabinoid chemicals and a pill let's dig deeper into how marijuana interacts with the body and tips on access with our expert dr. Caroline heartridge dr. heartridge how exactly do THC and CBD interact with the body the CBD and THC interact within the endocannabinoid system and this is the largest neurotransmitter system within the body and it helps regulate or modulate our homeostasis everything from temperature to appetite to reproduction to sleep weight cycles those two chemicals in particular work in a lock and key mechanism where receptors are the lock and CBD and THC or the differ keys once the CBD and the THC interact with that receptor they can stimulate bone health they can decrease blood pressure and they can modulate your perception of pain and even your memory of an unfavorable event what are the different ways to take medical cannabis in its whole flower form or whole plant form and people typically know that is weed or marijuana and in that form you can smoke it in a joint or a bong you can vape it or you can eat it in states where the flower is not legal and it's just concentrate the flower has been broken down into CBD and THC and then put back together and just concentrate forms and in those states you can have it in a vape form in a pill and a tincture or a spray what's your advice for somebody wanting to use medical cannabis so I would start with your state laws and you can check those out online Department of Health is very transparent and what's available state to state and then I would go to your primary care provider whichever doctor you see most regularly because these products will interact with your regular pharmaceuticals and it might even decrease the amount of dose you need so I would start there have an open and honest conversation with your provider let them know that you're interested and you want to know about the risk to benefit ratio of the medical cannabis product versus some of the ones you might already be on that is some very important and helpful advice thank you so much for joining us today dr.

cupcake queen of Seattle wow what an honor that's great yeah I have a company called cupcake Royale and we actually work with a lot of local producers we like the idea that we can support local agriculture local economy and create a better Seattle I mean I'm sure you big all kinds of different things what is it about cupcakes that's so special I think there's a nostalgic thing about cupcakes and it's kind of a food around celebration I've heard you also make a line of edibles is that right yeah I have a company called the good ship company so we make chocolate products and cookie products and other confections that we're getting ready to launch wow that's amazing and do you use all like the local ingredients right that's it absolutely and that's why we're here today because we're gonna make some cannabis cupcakes we're gonna use the cupcake RL recipe to make a chocolate buttercream but instead of the usual chocolate reuse we're gonna use good chip chocolate so first stop we need to get some butter and I want you to meet my friend Natalie who has this lovely farm that we're okay great so let's go check it out you know hi baby how are you doing are you doing very well I'm Natalie nice to meet you natalie has a dairy farm and we're going to pick up some cream and we're going to take that cream and turn it into butter and then we're going to infuse that butter with cannabis for our cupcakes and these are your milk factories right here huh exactly so I'm LT eat it this morning and I got her mouth and I have it in the farm stand for you if you like to taste something else that edith made i have some cream on one here this is the savory this has olive oil and salt and freshly ground pepper on it and this is just the fromage blanc with a little drizzle of local Vashon honey actually Natalie I have something to share with you as well some of Washington's finest but I don't know if you'd want to give this a go okay I can do it go yeah we can try okay great and it is from Washington it's called laughing Buddha and it really just one of my favorites on the market in Washington from a flower perspective all right I've never hot box before I'm standing before pretty great I gotta say let's let's get into that cheese okay so let's start off save that's your savory Wow really really creamy texture of it it's just amazing Wow so you guys are all about doing stuff from scratch yeah is that part of food culture here in the Pacific Northwest yes it's almost like a religion yeah I mean you can really taste the difference I'm going honey mmm Wow mmm holy crap okay here's your milk great what do we owe you for that that's okay you can have it oh really yes my gift to you in that case here's my gift to you it's this really fine bud you seem like you enjoyed that Jay I have to say I did excellent so enjoy the rest of that bunch and we're gonna go put this to good use I've got my jar of fresh milk that I picked up from Cornerstone farm and I've headed over to Vashon velvet where one of Jodi's friends an amazing cannabis farm where she grows some really banging buds we're gonna pick our buds and I'm gonna go put this thing down cuz my hands are freezing right now [Music] before we do anything everybody needs a name tag state regulations excellent want to be in full compliance how did you guys get into the cannabis business when the state announced the rules for getting a license to grow cannabis they said there was a 30-day window and they might never have another window open so I thought chance of a lifetime we went for it and never looked back enjoyed every minute of it Bravo that is fantastic awesome and are you a cannabis enthusiast yourself I never know and then if it's a Saturday night I'll try some of the Laughing Buddha yeah so I wanted to show you the strain that I think would make some really great cupcakes this is our platinum blueberry this is a really space-age looking grow right here go ahead and stick your fingers in and take a sniff wow there are so many different flavors going on there I mean beyond just that tart blueberry aroma there's so much else going on like a maple syrup or yeah I can't get enough of that smell and as you can see we use exclusively LED lights which use about a third of the energy of regular standard HID lights so we're trying to reduce our carbon footprint as much as possible so Patrick how far along are these guys right here these are about two to three weeks from harvest at this point oh that good karma is paying off because I mean you've got these incredible looking buds so Jody do you think this is gonna go well in your cupcakes I like the sweetness I'm excited to see what it tastes like when these guys said they make stuff from scratch they were serious I mean every single ingredient comes from the source I met the cow that we got our cream from and I met the cannabis plant that we're gonna get our buds from and now I'm hanging out with the chickens we're gonna get our eggs from and then we'll be ready to make cupcakes [Music] we have all the ingredients right here to make cupcakes and it starts right here and we're going to skim the cream off the top how do we turn that into butter we have to churn it and this is a butter turner it's crazy steam punk jar that looks pretty arduous for one person but here check it out I have an idea if you just hold the jar and I'll go like this Wow don't hit this a little bit how long does it actually take it's gonna take about 30 to 45 minutes yeah that looks like butter all right and what we're gonna do is we're gonna put this butter into this bowl and we're gonna press it against the side to kind of squeeze out more of that buttermilk all right I think we are ready to melt this up and to infuse it with our canvas okay Jody how much weed do we have decarboxylate in here this is one gram of platinum blueberry from Vashon velvet threw it in the oven at 290 degrees for an hour and that allows it to decarboxylate which means it releases the THC what we're going to do with that we're gonna put this in this 1/2 cup of delicious butter we've been working so hard on and infuse it for 30 minutes from super low heat we're starting to smell good already so you're ready to strain it we got some cheesecloth in a strainer here with the bowl underneath it we're just gonna pour this straight through the cheesecloth there's all our spent weed flowers okay so what goes into a cupcake batter we're gonna put in the dry ingredients I have two cups of flour here then we have 1 and 3/4 cup of organic cane sugar so one teaspoon of baking powder and result is this gonna give you a little mix to combine them just a little make them next step we're going to add our cannabis butter yeah we put a lot of butter we get last wrap alright that looks good I like how it's breaking up we're going to take some of our wet ingredients and mix them together we're gonna start with four egg whites so we're gonna add to that a half a cup of warm water we're gonna add a half cup of sour cream we are doing in this recipe one teaspoon of vanilla paste and this is Madagascar per bone vanilla so we're just gonna whisk this together and now we're gonna incorporate this is going better let that mix a little and now we have a nice smooth delicious looking manner that is looking super creamy these are ready to go into the oven huh this is this is exciting as soon as we open that door back up we'll have cupcakes let's put them in the oven 325 we're gonna start with eight minutes and then we're gonna rotate it after eight minutes and do six more minutes or 14 minutes oh yeah those are perfect it's like beautiful awesome alright so while those are cooling let's open some good chip chocolate and get ready to make our buttercream this is our deep dark chocolate bar the Washington state serving size is 10 milligrams Wow tasty there's no plain tea flavor and I can barely taste it yeah you really gonna talk about it - yeah yeah I like it alright so what we're gonna do is we're gonna melt eight-pitch of chocolate bar so this is gonna be 80 milligrams of THC spread across 12 cupcakes that's about seven milligrams of cupcake we did the math on the cannabis cupcake batter and that is scene or so a milligrams per cupcake so you add that plus the seven and rectory all right great pretty potent cupcake we're gonna start with putting 2/3 cup of our delicious hand turn fresh butter so we have two and a quarter cup powdered sugar we're gonna add a pinch of salt blend it all up slowly so you don't get the cup cloud we're gonna put three tablespoons of fresh milk going back to the Madagascar I'm going to put one teaspoon vanilla and we're gonna add the cannabis infused good chip chocolate yeah that was amazing we're gonna let that mix in we're so close to having cupcakes so I'm a big fan of a hand swirl instead of piping on although you can do the other and grab a little dollop and then you do a very magical thing to kind of Pat it and then you give it a little loop right I swirl on that one Cheers thank you so this is the best cupcake in Washington State huh let's see what you think mm that's a good cupcake oh my god experts you know what they do they go like this they break the bottom up and you put it on top super easy get out of town I wish I knew that point but into this thing this thing is double infused we infused the butter that went into the cupcake batter and we melted a bunch of your delicious medicated chocolates and put it right into the frosting boom boom this is a strong guy this cupcake right here is a representation of the adventure we had I had the fortune of seeing where all the ingredients are a lot of the ingredients that went into this came from really I mean it all just came together in the best cupcake I've ever had excellent truly thank you so much thanks for coming out to Vashon Island today barring out the beat thought about defeat mmm that is one good cupcake", "rMMHqxyvVAU": "so what's up everybody welcome back to chef Judy's TV on today's episode of in the kitchen we're gonna be cooking cannabis infused cooking oil so what I have right here I have about 34 grams of shake I have about two cups of cooking oil and have about two cups of butter this video is sponsored this video sponsored by blessings on blessings dispensary in LA there are just 2157 west century Boulevard on the corner of Van Essen century so if you guys are ever in LA go ahead and check them out I'll leave all their informations in the description box down below but yeah they actually provided me with the shake for you guys that don't know what shake is shake is basically the leaves that fall out put a flower and settle at the bottom of the container this is some really high-grade shake it came from a high-grade plant if you guys get if you guys that's not as very much like you're just filling up my whole house my neighbors won't be big on big beech over here some but yeah so blessing a blessing dispensary supplied me with the shake shout out to my homie swag City over there he didn't want to subscribe me with the shake thank you guys for sponsoring this video but without further ado we gonna jump into it alright so the first thing we want to do is we want to decarboxylate the weeds basically we want to activate that Tec so the way we do that is we throw it in the oven a 250 degree oven for about 25 minutes and it activates that THC that way we can put it into oil and do a further second step to activate the marijuana into the oil so I'm gonna go ahead and throw this in the oven and I'll see you on about 25 minutes alright peace so it's been about 25 minutes we just got the weed out of the oven as you can see I got separated to two piles 17 grams each like I said if you guys can see that color it got a little bit darker so now all that has to do is add the week to the jars and put the jars in a double boiler not really a double boiler I'm gonna do is put the jar and in a pot in the water that's slightly boiling like a like a mouth simmer you want the water to be about maybe 200 degrees and you want to put that in the water for about an hour and a half - two hours all right so now we're just going to transfer the weed to the jar I like to use the napkins cause as you can see it transfers very easy yeah I can see downtown let's begin for a same thing with your butter sack just to the butter so once again that's 17 grams of shake and about 2 cups of oil 2 cups of fat if you want to use the flour you can use a flower but cut that use about maybe a 8 3.5 grams of flour because the flour has more THC to the shanks so we're gonna have to go ahead and throw this into our boiler that got fitted over here slightly balding and we're gonna leave that in there for about an hour and a half to two hours we go come back and start pretty ugly I'll see y'all when it's finished all right peace alright everybody so a bit about an hour and a half we can go ahead and take these off now this one was my butter so we're going to do the butter first we got our storage containers right here this was restored in we got our strainer we also use coffee filters excreted and also this would be a double strain on there right oh so we don't do that like that big I like that hopefully I won't make a mess I'm kind of rushing because I got a I got a flank that I'm leaving for in an hour so kind of rushing but we still gonna do this the right way alright so this been in the pot boiling for about an hour and a half now we're just gonna strain it out and store it and that's all there is to it and that's how you make the butter and the oil alright so go ahead goodies over here at that point we make a mess kind of hot really I really wanted to use cheesecloth but I don't useful it's gonna take forever I'm just using the gate to squeeze not everything all - next one medicated [Music] [Music] sorry about the TV in the background I forgot to take that TV off okay it's not good like I said I'm Russian so I'm gonna do a better video I'm doing better videos to show y'all how it's really done but coming with a rush but like I said I'm leaving in an hour to go to Atlanta once again a shout-out to my sponsors blessings on blessings dispensary on the corner of venice and century in los angeles if you guys are in the area please check them out tell them chef doing since you get some good herbs all right [Music] got all that that's real strongly medicated so here we have our butter and here we have our olive oil

going to propel the industry forward over the next twelve twenty four forty eight months a lot of great things happening in the white labeling space of cannabis right now so in today's presentation we're going to talk about capital requirements what's the difference between white label and private label what to look for at a white label partner what products should you start with and many other considerations and helpful valuable pieces of information so if you have any questions please get in contact with us at green growth CPAs com or give us a call at eight hundred 676 sided with today's presentation hey everyone my name is Jim breeze from Green Grove CPAs and thank you one more time for joining us for today's webinar we're gonna discuss white labeling which I believe is the future of cannabis at least the next wave of cannabis it's getting a lot more attention a lot more people are trying to get into the business and this is one of the ways where you can really make a name for yourself without having to spend too much cash so again my name is Jim breeze and the chief marketing officer here at green growth CPAs so just a little bit about us green go CPAs is a cannabis only firm we have no other clients and no other industries we focus solely on the compliance and Finance sides of the cannabis industry we prepared over 1200 annual tax returns for cannabis operators in all different verticals from the dispensaries distribution cultivation manufacturing delivery testing every different part of the supply chain in cannabis we help operators in every aspect of that we also have over 400 cannabis business clients again in all the different types of verticals and operating in twelve different states in the United States as well as international clients as well that are trying to break into the US market outside of just doing tax returns we've done audit related projects 15 of those in the past year and a half so where we help people with their mergers and acquisitions due diligence the valuation of the companies and audits keeping them compliant in their audits and their taxes and their books we have a deep and thorough understanding of tax compliance and insurance related requirements for the cannabis industry but again we're bigger than just tax we're not just accountants or a full-service firm that can help pretty much in any aspect of the cannabis industry and if we can't do it we can connect you with a partner who could surely help you out and make sure that you become a successful cannabis entrepreneur before we hop in I need to let you know that the information contained in this webinar presentation is meant for guidance purposes only and not as professional legal or tax advice and further it does not give any personalized legal tax investment or any business advice in general so with that out of the way let's hop right into today's agenda so a few things we're gonna cover today I want to first talk about what's the difference between white labeling and private labeling and then I want to talk about why I believe that white labeling is the next wave of the cannabis industry will address some red tape around the industry specifically in the state of California will discuss some pros and cons of white labeling as well as which products can be white labeled and what product you should start with then we'll discuss the capital needs and how much money you need to get started as well as any final considerations to wrap this up and let you get a little bit more color in context of the white labeling industry and what you're actually signing up for once you start to work with a white label er so first white label versus private label so while white label and private labeling are very similar there are some subtle differences to distinguish the two so with white labeling a generic product is created by a manufacturer for multiple resellers so for example a white label manufacturer would sell a vaporizer pen to ten different partners and each partner is now responsible to rebrand that product as their own and they are able to do that with a white label business each retailer each business partner is selling the same vaporizer pen with no modifications at all the vapes are simply rebranded and marketed as the retailer's own product and this is the fastest way to get to market but your product will be the same as every other business or every other retailer out there so without much differentiation in your product or not anything's to really set it apart you'll need to work really hard to differentiate your brand now with private labeling which is primarily what we're going to be talking about and discussing about these terms can sometimes be used interchangeably it depends on the capabilities of your vendor but we'll get to that in a moment here but with private labeling the product is created exclusively for sale by a single reseller by a single person a single brand and let's just keep going along with that vapor example so the private label partner would then have the option to modify the actual product right so if you are a brand or a business and you want to get into this private labeling with private labeling you have the ability to modify it to fit your selling requirements for your brand a lot more levers to pull right the modified vaporizer that we're talking about here is exclusive to your particular business and it comes complete with you know your logo and your name and your brand identity and white labeling has the ability to do that as well but sometimes in private labeling and most times in private labeling you can go a little bit deeper with the packaging or where the raw ingredients come from or what material is used for the outside shell or whatever it's going to be maybe you want to use shea butter instead of argan oil or whatever that's going to be because you have a specific thing that you want to use and again sometimes these terms are used interchangeably and it really really depends on the vendor that you're working with and their capabilities of how custom that they can be and for the sake of this presentation I'm just going to use the word white labeling but again you can get as custom as your vendor allows so in cannabis you can get a totally off-the-shelf kind of product with little input and white labeling you just send them over a PNG of your logo and bam now you've got a vaporizer product but if you want to take it to that next level you can also go to a private label or someone who's on maybe a more sophisticated white label ER and you can provide the raw materials the packaging the inserts and any other things that help you make it more your own or your brand so next I want to jump into what I believe white labeling is the next wave of the cannabis industry so two things I want to address upfront getting started in the cannabis industry is typically very costly due to the licensing capital expenditures how much working capital you need and so many more things that add on top of that it's like a 7-layer cake there's just so much going on that you need to pay for and that's because it's a highly regulated industry this is no different than opening up a pharmacy or starting a liquor brand there's a lot of red tape that you need to address you need to have obtained of professionals help you address so it's gonna cost a lot of money and the second thing I want to address up front is that cannabis is kind of clicky it's all about the relationships right it's a beginning it's a new industry that's emerging out of its Darkness period is there's a lot of relationships and a lot of friendships in there where some of these bigger brands have been friends and been home you know seven eight fifteen years and they really want to keep this knowledge intimate to themselves so knowing this I want to make two main points of why I think white labeling is the next wave that can usher in the next we'll call it class or next set of entrepreneurs and business owners so the two main points I want to bring up is that white labeling helps you to reduce your initial startup costs by allowing you to rapid test your ideas before jumping all the way into the deep end of the pool so instead of having to come up with a million dollars and permits and all the other things that come along with building your own manufacturing facility you can reduce your risk by getting a proof of concept to show some investors that you have a solid idea or product market fit before you go and get fully funded and bring manufacturing in-house or before expanding your products to a whole new line a whole new part of that cannabis industry not to address that relationship part and how clicky things can be you know white labeling allows you to leverage built-in distribution in retail relationships so the power of manufacturing is in a few hands right there's a lot of little mini manufacturers but those that can do large white labeling runs for you it's in the hands of a few people and they have all the economies of scale and over the next 12 to 24 months that's gonna become more impactful because if they're not already there they will get there at some point and they're typically vertically integrated and have relationships with distributors if they aren't one themselves and those distributors have relationships with dispensaries and delivery services you know your hardest task of getting into a dispensary or getting the ability to get into a delivery service and building those relationships throughout the supply chain is typically already done just by engaging with the white label manufacturer now I'm not gonna say that this is the end-all be-all and you're gonna be all set some people are just great at manufacturing and they are terrible at building these relationships just because they have a manufacturing background maybe they came from a different industry we're able to set up a facility fast but just don't have those relationships and so we'll talk about some of the due diligence things and considerations later in this presentation here so that you can understand really what you're getting into and who you're working with and what they can provide you right there's gonna be a just general manufacturer or white label er but one who's really smart connected intertwined into the industry who can really help your brand take off and get some of those eyeballs on your because it's very noisy nowadays in the cannabis industry there's a lot of new brands it's really cool to be a cannabis entrepreneur but it's really tough to break through all that noise so now let's address some red tape about white labeling so you have CBD or THC now CBD is not Schedule one so it's a little more relaxed you can probably find more white label errs to help you out you can even do drop shipping with some of these white label ears where they'll keep some product on hand at their warehouse you can set up a Shopify that sends over an API call to their packing facility or their warehouse and it ships out without you even having to touch or see the product nice again typically with CBD now with THC in California specifically there's a little more you know red tape and some hoops you have to jump through all right the state has acknowledged that white labeling is going to be inevitable not everybody has a million dollars to start a business initially white labeling wasn't even allowed but now it actually is so essentially what you need to do is create an intellectual property licensing agreement with your white label vendor so for example say you and your friend or you and your team or you on your own you build up a brand you want to start a brand you want to sell you know creams or topicals infused with THC for pain relief maybe you want to go after runners and because you're a runner and you know that hey if we build a brand that's geared towards runners we can actually move this product because we have names stay in this local area of runners right so what you do is you're going to develop a logo packaging design if it's a really good one get a design patent for your packaging if it's again very unique or cool and you put that intellectual property into an LLC so that the LLC owns that intellectual property and next what you need to do is find a white label producer or operator who wants to sell your product so you got to get them excited about your brand and don't be afraid to share your ideas they're just ideas and execution is where the real value is that you have to sell this idea to the white label er because a lot of people want to get into white labeling as well some of the manufacturers that we were working with and trying to vet for a program we're starting up here they are so backlogged in the amount of people that want to work with them that they can't service everyone so they're only servicing the biggest most sophisticated brands that want to get into the industry or people that have really good and unique eye Diaz in brands so again be able to share your ideas and sell your ideas to your white label manufacturer and get them excited about it so once you find that person you're gonna be working with if they produce that product then you as the IP holder get a royalty payment from the white label producer okay so there's a few ways in which that could happen it could be on the per unit basis it could be based on total revenue it could have minimum payments every month which incentivizes the white label er to push your product out to those distribution networks there's a lot of different variables in these agreements but essentially you're gonna be getting money on the brand that you created and truly products are gonna get so good and so easy to manufacture that brand is all that you're gonna really have left to lean on right t-shirts are t-shirts some people pay $80 for a white t-shirt some people pay the six dollars for a Hanes t-shirt it's all about the brand and where you fit in and who your target market is right even in food most of the major sauces and salad dressings and other food products are made just by a few co-packers like venture of foods but brand is what moves those units so again the same thing is happening in cannabis just make sure that you're building a brand that people you have affinity for that resonates with them that addresses who they are as individuals as well as a collective group so you can really pull people into that story that you're creating with your brand now lastly once that IKEA agreement is made the state then requires a producer or the white label er to notify the BCC which is a beer of cannabis control that there's a new financial interest holder in the license now it's not that they're a new owner or an equity holder in the license it's simply that you need to let the state know that the brand is benefiting from the sale of cannabis products under that license so that's a state can see hey is this person the new person they're adding on a bad actor or not and lastly you know this is just a high level 30,000 foot look at everything here but do your due diligence in your specific city county and state right I said this is just for the state of California again just some general guidelines on it so our suggestion is to work with a lawyer to make sure you know how to structure these deals properly to protect you and the producer as well as keeping yourself compliant in many of these white laborers have in-house counsel to help you negotiate these deals or maybe they have a boilerplate deal there's not much wiggle room for negotiation but usually compliance is built into the system so let's just jump into some pros and cons of white labeling now it's not all roses it's not all great there's not all these benefits and no drawbacks so let's just peel back the layers of the onion and really just give you a good healthy dose of reality so the pros of being in the white labeling sector of the cannabis industry is that multi-state operators can open into new markets quickly and increase their distribution drastically so if you have a formula and a product that works over in Oklahoma and you want to come over to California you can't bring THC across state lines so to open up in California you need to find a white label manufacturer who will work on your formula will work on your product and bring you into that market so it's how you can take a proof of concept from one state to another state open up fast and leverage all that brand power you have in another state and say hey look we're moving 1700 units a week in this other state can you please help us you know open up in Southern California and then in Northern California or wherever you're trying to go to you could end up opening up an Illinois or in Nevada it all depends on how fast you want to expand but white labeling allows you to do that quicker in white labeling is usually the fastest implementation of getting into the industry and relatively cheaper than an all in-house manufacturing type of business again you don't need a million dollars to start I had done this a little bit earlier but compliance is typically built into the model of white labeling no white label manufacturer is going to purposely skirt the law just to make 50,000 bucks right they're going to keep themselves protected which will then keep you protected another pro about this is that it reduces what you have to focus on so when you go to white label manufacturing you get to focus solely on brand invisibility depending on how much you know distribution is built into your model but when you focus on that again the future is all about the brand and great operations so if you have great operations that comes from the synergy between you and your white labeling partner and their capabilities paired with your capabilities so if you want to focus on just building a brand building visibility for your brand find a white label manufacturer that has the ability to distribute your products to the most end consumers or to the most retailers another positive thing about white labeling is you typically know your costs up front so you can price your products accordingly right if you know what your costs are you can bake in your margins and know how much you need to move to break-even or to make a profit and then also if you want to open up and become a big Big Shot that has lots of offerings having multiple white label vendors allows you to offer a wide variety of products for which you wouldn't really have the in-house capabilities to do it would take a lot of machines to be able to open up a topicals manufacturing and then vaporizers and then bottled flower and all these other things that come along with the ability to white label if you wanted to do that on your own you need a really large facility as well as a lot of money and a lot of equipment and a lot of human capital and human intelligence and lastly I think I hit on this and just hit it again it's the fastest go to market strategy if you want to get into the market this is the fastest way to do it all right so let's discuss some drawbacks of white labeling again it's not all positive there are some limitations to this so when you start to work with a group of people or a team of people or a few different parties things can be lost in translation and there can be misunderstandings in what you want for your products so when you pass on your vision or your product idea is to say another agency and then they pass it on to a project manager at a white label company who then passes it on to a project team with inside that white labeling company you know this stream of information can get distorted at some point an important part of your vision or the functionality of the product that you want or an ingredient it may get lost along the way and that same thing happens and it repeats at a feedback loop right so because it's not just gonna happen in one iteration you know a few things can fall off at every step and then you know the wheels fall off so if you don't keep close eye on your white labeler in that relationship that you have so the chance that your projects agenda will be changed or miscommunicated is a probable risk when you get into white labeling so double-check everything get samples before you give final approval for that scale-up manufacturing you know really really develop a human relationship and good communication with your white label learn as we discuss in the beginning between the difference between white label and private label there is potentially a limited ability to customize your end products so maybe you want to offer some type of minut feature some updated creative packaging idea this may not be possible depending on the white label manufacturer or the flow of the products you know you could have someone manufacture it in bulk like the main pieces and then you do all the final assemblies so you can make sure that there's a handwritten note in each one or I'm not sure whatever you want to do but again this bleeds a little bit more into that private labeling which will then probably increase your cost so just be thoughtful about what is really an important no negotiation this customization needs to be built into the product and if not we're not gonna go with this white label err or this private label or so just keep that in mind as you go throughout the process and spec out your products of what you really want to have and building on that limited customization is that duplicate products will be in the market you know if you go with a set straight white labeling send a PNG of your logo they print you out the packaging the product and all this stuff and it's very much the same as the next company a and Company B you're gonna have to work really really hard to differentiate your product since many companies are gonna have the same functionality the same you know feel to their products using this a lot in the vaporizer industry with the batteries all looking pretty much the same or a lot of the cartridges look the same so just be very cognizant of what's important to you what are you trying to actually accomplish are you trying to accomplish a proof of concept for a brand name are you trying to accomplish moving 10,000 units are you trying to accomplish just getting something started you're really truing up your end goal with the person who's gonna help you get there and see if they have the capabilities to get you to where you want to be at all right so now as we discuss the pros the cons and what this really is and how to do it you know which products can actually be white labeled again we touch on this before you can do CBD and THC variants or a blend of the two you can do topicals buttocks ads and creams and balms you can do oils right tinctures and things like that sprays cosmetics you can do soaps vaporizers the vaporizer cartridges and the batteries you can do bottled flower right someone could grow great cannabis and they just slap your name on it like you grew it for yourself you can do capsules like pills you can do dog treats edibles anything if you can put oil into it you can probably make that into a product there's so many different ideas but it wasn't even thought you know maybe five years ago to do CBD dog treats and now it's one of the more popular products you probably could figure out some gum ideas or beverages there's so many different ideas but look into what your local laws allow you to do right some states don't allow you to infuse THC with alcohol products or that your edibles can't look like animals or you know you so there's a lot of different little nuances and red tape that you have to work with and work around so again work with a lawyer or someone experienced in the industry that can help you get the product that you want and stay compliant so with all those different product ideas what products should you start with well there are many factors and it's really up to you but let's review some considerations when you walk through this thought process of what product you want to start with so first and foremost I always think about what's your risk tolerance do you want to go with a proven product you know you see vaporizer cartridges moving so you go with that cuz it's more of a sure bet compared to something that's you know groundbreaking you know haven't even thought about it you've never ever seen it and you want to go and spend a lot of money in R&D and build this unique product or do you want to do something in between a hybrid or something kind of bring this one plus this one makes a new kind of product you know really up to you what your risk tolerance is because risk tolerance includes the amount of time in the amount of capital you need to put into this so think about how much risk do you want to put into this business then you really need to consider who is your intended target audience so questions around that are like you know what problem do they have and what do they desire right so if you're working with maybe the female target audience and there's all these vaporizer pens but they look real masculine you know maybe you start one that's got more gentle pastel colors it's smaller in size and that addresses maybe the inconspicuous can fit into a purse or can fit into you know women have pants with really shallow pockets and they wanted to fit in those shallow pockets right you have to ask yourself can this product provide a solution to the problem that my intended target audience has there's a lot of different target audiences you can hit I talked about earlier for the runners maybe you are gonna be you know addressing pain relief for runners does this topical product that you're going to create actually work and relieve the pain in their shin splints or in their ankles or in their feet you know I'm not sure what runner problems are but I can just only assume it there's probably something wrong with their legs does your product address that intended problem they have another thing kind of get tying in to the risk tolerances how much capital do you actually have because some products are more capital-intensive than others right if you're gonna be doing something groundbreaking you know more costs are gonna be there but if you're gonna go with something more proven you know not as much cost it can be a little bit faster go to mark him so do you want to do you know something really big and get a huge initial order so you can reduce your unit cost and then increase your margins later down the road because you have the ability to you know get into more dispensaries you know lots of considerations around capital there they need to think about how are you going to be marketing the product and what influence do you have with that target audience so maybe you have no pull at all in any specific industry so maybe you're gonna start using influencers or maybe you do have some kind of pull in an industry or in a target demographic and you're gonna use your personal network or you're gonna go real big and buy billboards in downtown Los Angeles or in Hollywood and get a lot of people to know about your product at a very expensive cost because with cannabis specifically THC you cannot buy paid advertising on the main networks like the googles of the world Facebook Instagram Twitter you just can't do that yet they're not risking the ability to buy those ads so but for CBD you can do that so just be cognizant of where you're actually remarketing at maybe you do event marketing in dispensaries or you go to Facebook groups for people that are in your target demographic you know you could do hand-to-hand combat by getting a kiosk at the mall during the holiday season and sell CBD products right it's gonna be a very very popular product this year I can already tell and feel that CBD is gonna be one of those default Christmas gifts for maybe people that you have no idea what to buy but you know they may have a quote unquote physical ailment or something that these CBD companies are saying that hey if you get this product it's gonna fix this issue or you know help you out with this problem that you have I can really see this becoming one of those successful kiosks at the mall during q4 this year another consideration for deciding which product to start with is what kind of distribution do you currently have do you have built in relationships or you building new bridges right if you're coming in real cold to this industry you know think about maybe having a more differentiated product is an easy your cell into the dispensary because they already have access to vaporizer cartridges and you know bombs and pills and all these other things that are common products by going and getting something more unique you may have an easier sell getting into there or maybe you own a dispenser yourself and you already see what's moving and again you just want to recapture some of that margin if you see that vapor cartridges are moving fast and you know it's easy to sell or upsell one of those vaporizer cartridges or you do a deal on it and you know you're paying $10 wholesale for it and you're selling it for 45 bucks well why not just go to a white label manufacturer and get it for six dollars and then sell it for 30 bucks it's a little bit of a deal because maybe you're in a budget shop and people don't want to pay that forty dollars it's all up to you there's so many different ideas but just think about what kind of distribution do you have and how do you actually get into where you want to be to create more distribution or leverage what you already have and lastly I come to touch on this a little bit earlier but like what expertise do you have you know what is your expertise in maybe you're a dog trainer so you should start selling dog treats because people already trust you in that space if you're a dog walker maybe you should get into selling dog treats because people already trust you around dogs they think that you're a quote unquote expert maybe not as a dog walker but as a dog trainer but if you've built a relationship with twenty or thirty different clients that you walk their dogs maybe you can sell them a bag of treats every two weeks and that adds an extra ten or fifteen dollars in your pocket per client and then you have so thirty clients at fifteen dollars that's $450 a month there you go and then you can start to recruit other dog walkers to get into your business right that's how you can find an opportunity you don't have to become the biggest baddest cannabis company you just had to find product market fit and leverage your built in trust now the big question we always get is hey how much capital do we need to get started in this business so with the generic starting your own company in cannabis it can be quite high but with the white labeling it can be a little bit different but there's a wide range depending on how big you want to go from the beginning right you could start small with a proof-of-concept and then scale up or if you know what you want to do and you jump in full force you're gonna need a little bit more money right and it's all up to you but there's a spectrum of you know how much capital you want to have so I can't give you a steadfast number but I will give you some considerations on how to think about this okay so typically I see a minimum of at least fifty to seventy-five thousand dollars and maybe even closer to the hundred thousand dollar mark and yes you can do it on a shoestring budget but that's if you do things perfect right and if you don't you could be sitting on a thousand vaporizer cartridges with no buyers you have to think about the total cost of doing business not just going to the white label manufacturer don't just try to go in and get done fast you need to have good amount of capital to get started in this industry but again if it's lower maybe you are again that dispensary you already have built in everything else I'm gonna discuss in the next you know a few bullet points here so you know you only need fifteen thousand dollars to do your first product run because you want a thousand cartridges at fifteen bucks apiece for one gram cartridges and you're ready to roll because you got the built-in distribution you've got the built-in marketing you have a captured customer client base so I'm talking more about brand new never been in the industry you're gonna need at least fifty to a hundred thousand dollars but more on that top end especially if you don't have experience the biggest factors truly in my mind depend on the minimum order demands from your manufacturer and your ability to distribute your product out again I've brought up dispensaries can be a little bit on that cheaper side but if you're brand new you're going to need a good amount of money to move into this industry and again it also depends on how well you can actually execute do you have any business experience right just general business experience but how about cannabis business experience in marketing experience do you know how to create a brand how to drum up some excitement for this brand how to move units of a product so what's your go-to-market strategy you're gonna start slow or do you have the ability to move very very fast right so when we talk about this big number seventy five hundred thousand dollars fifty thousand dollars you again consider the full cost of doing business so product samples design of the packaging right if you don't do design yourself paying someone to design your logo the packaging design testing out the products you're gonna go work with four seven ten different vendors you need to buy samples test out those products over you know whatever time it takes for you to create some certainty in your mind so it's gonna cost money and that could cost you know one two thousand dollars it's just totally up to you and how deep you want to do your research then you need to look at your initial product run what the scope of that how much product you actually need to produce for the minimum order quantity storage cause so if you're gonna work with the pure white labeler that does drop shipping for your CBD maybe they charge you every month to store your product but if you're gonna bring it in-house you're gonna have to find some way to store that you can't store it at your house you can't run a THC company out of your house you need to find a licensed facility to store that ad then you need to think about a marketing budget how much are you gonna be paying for any of your marketing tactics website development if you're gonna be building a website and not doing it yourself operating capital taxes sgna there's all these expenses that come to starting a business so really be thoughtful about when you approach this industry and just the specific aspect of white labeling it's not just getting the product it's all the other costs that you have to incur to actually get this product in the end consumers hands or even just to the retailer so that the retailer can bring it to the end consumer we've covered a lot here I just want to go over some last few considerations that you need to put these thoughts into your mind and really think about all right we're really going to be doing this and if we are let's be really thoughtful about this so when you take a white labeling partner you think about how close are they to you geographically you know do you have the ability to go in for an inspection of their facilities or if you want to keep a real tight handle on you know the manufacturing practices and this also allows you to do faster product review and testing you know but if you're a multi-state operator maybe you need to put some boots on the ground in California for the first four to six months while you get your foothold in the LA area or in the San Diego area or in the Sacramento area now the next thing to consider is what's their reputation are there other products out there that they've created that they've helped take to market that they've helped manufacture ask them these questions say hey what other brands do you manufacture for what other brands have you helped explode their awareness get to know your white label or don't be scared to ask these questions then looking into your white label err are they vertically integrated with distribution in most cases they are and in most cases I would say try to work with the least amount of partners because for a few reasons I think three main aspects of this it helps you roll fees into one transaction right it caps your cost you know what you're going to be out the door pricing secondly it helps you reduce your tax burden since most if not all movements are under the same license at the same which means less taxable events and then this also saves time in negotiating and coordinating if there's only two people to work with instead of seven you reduce all that back and forth with emails and phone calls and as we talked about earlier that lost in translation the least amount of people that have the ability to drop a ball the better next consider do they have contacts that want to take your products on this is that distribution part I keep hitting on this because it's really really important right any white label er can produce a great product right like I said in five years everyone's been making great products and any white label can distribute products cuz you just need a license to do that but can they actually get you shelf space right shelf space is the name of the game when you see certain cereals in the grocery store or at eye level versus other brands that are at the floor or way at the top there's a reason they pay for that and it's also prevalent in cannabis it's called slotting fees right in cannabis specifically in California you can see fees anywhere from a thousand dollars up to five thousand dollars per month to get shelf space in some dispensaries now ethically this is frowned upon and some people say hey that's not true market telling you what to do but it still happens look they run the dispensaries they are the first layer closest to the customer they're gonna do whatever they have to to make extra money and it just happens so you know sometimes you can't even get into businesses unless you know someone at the dispensary right there are some dispensaries that are you know sitting outside LAX and all the international clients come there because it's so close they're sitting at the LAX hotels and they do five six eight million dollars in business and it's really hard to get into that dispensary and you can only get in there if you know somebody so my thoughts around this or my guidance would be you need to think about creating a poll strategy getting customers to ask for your products compared to pushing your products onto the retailer's because if seven eight ten twelve people every week for the past month have asked for ABC product and we don't have it it's gonna force that purchasing agent at the retailer to say alright I need to go look at you know whatever this ABC product is we've had 50 people ask us in the past month and I don't want to lose business to the dispensary down the street so that's a pull strategy versus a push strategy on to the retailers and I would say really truly never ever fully rely on your white label partner to do the sales part even if they offer it at a higher sales point they are really good at manufacturing and probably not the best at sales they can probably open the door for you let's say hey Mike I want you to meet Michelle Michelle meet Mike and then you guys take it from there you really need to be a sales person of your product be that ambassador enlists other brand ambassadors to talk about your product and bring your product to awareness within those retailers a few other considerations around one really really important the thing that we think about the most is structuring a deal to understand your exposure so some inexperienced brands will not fix the production fee which can really really get out of hand depending on the experience of the white labeler so for example packaging and you have a manufacturer that does everything from A to Z product and packages it and puts it all together well what if they don't store your packaging properly and it gets damaged there could be a clause in your contract they got to pay for it but it's still a headache that you have to deal with but aside from it getting damaged say you actually dig into the numbers you want to look at what we call production variances so when ideal product we'll say is one package one label one product right but some things do go wrong it will happen so who assumes the responsibility when things go to two packages one label in one product who's paying for that additional package so we suggest you be able to cap these variances or at least be able to moderate it with each production run so getting a report back from the manufacturer we made 500 products cleaned up using 527 pieces of packaging 500 products and 570 labels this can give you some insights to hey maybe our packaging is not as efficient as we thought we should maybe think about retooling our packaging or maybe our label you know should be done in a roll instead of individual labels a lot of things to consider when you start to get these production variances back from your manufacturer so to build on that structuring or deal properly and the product variances is understand the white label our inventory management so you can get reports you know you need to know about your business you need to know the numbers behind your business so do they have a dashboard or a portal that tells you how many packaging units are on hand many labels are on him how many production runs have been done and when is the next one scheduled one of the inventory quantities on hand and what we're seeing is because the industry is very new there's not a lot of sophisticated technology being implemented there's a lot of sophisticated technology but it's not always being implemented and you'll see that many of these white label manufacturers will have to do a hard count by hand and it's not the ability to look into a portal so depending on how granular and how flexible you want to get with your inventory management you know you just take these things into consideration in the last part about structuring is raw materials so when you structure this deal is gonna be say a clause and it says you know raw materials need to come from white label manufacturer but whatever that's gonna be so when you look into that just understand where can these raw materials come from is it the manufacturer only can you work with an outside vendor if it is an outside vendor does it need to be pre vetted by the white label manufacturer is there an additional cost to using an outside vendor you know I would really try to work in there the option to keep it open that you want to work within outside vendor for your oils or for anything any part of the production just at least keep that option open open for negotiation don't close that door because you don't know in 18 months a new oil manufacturer or refiner may come up that is just you know the best product and then you hear it all over the streets a if you're not buying oil from this company you're really missing out you're making a subpar product so that was my thoughts are on structuring a deal properly and some other considerations about white label partners so we covered a lot of ground here a lot of information but I just want to give you a few key takeaways so white labeling is a relatively cheap and fast method to go to market improve your hypothesis you can find a proof of concept get some product market fit and then leverage those results to either go get funding and scale up your operation or if it doesn't work cut bait and just move on no worries a lot less money has been lost I would suggest that you work with a reputable and experienced team who can help keep you compliant throughout the entire process whether that's lawyers tax professionals like green grouse CPAs to make sure you're not going to be exposing yourself to too many taxes experienced manufacturing teams who can create a great product with a little variance and not opening you up to a lot of exposure of risk the next part of roundness is building a brand is gonna be paramount when working in the white label part of the cannabis industry and creating white label cannabis products again if you go with a strict white label and you don't have any customization brand is all that you have but if you work in private label and you go a little more custom you have a few more product differentiators to lean into but really brand is what this is gonna all boil down to you see it in all types of other industries there's lots of different ketchups and I would say 80% of them are made by one big manufacturer it's just the de brand Heinz versus hunts versus you know this new organic something or other that's where it's gonna be at all about the brand and lastly structure your deal to reduce your exposure to unnecessary costs and limited future product update so make sure you're addressing what the production variances are going to be and trying to cap that as well as giving yourself the space to have new vendors come in or new suppliers of raw materials come in to help you make a better product 18 36 48 months down the road so thank you for taking the time to watch and listen to the

YEAH YEAH, I'M CARAMEL STUFF AND SELLING OUT FAST. YOU SEE, I'M ALMOST SOLD OUT. OH, YEAH, PEOPLE HAVE. I DON'T KNOW THEY ARE COMING BY 234 WHAT IT'S CALLED DELTA EIGHT. IT COMES IN GUMMIES, VE APES AND FLOWER OR BUD? YEAH, YOU CAN'T SMOKE. OH, YEAH, THAT TZE GOOD STUFF THERE. THE STORE CLERKS WILL TELL YOU IT'S GOT A LITTLE MORE KICK THAN CBD, BUT NOT QUITE. THE PUNCH IS POT AND HOW HIGH DOES IT GO? LET'S HAVE THE STRENGTH OF LIKE REGULAR TOC, I WOULD SAY. AND THE CLERKS WILL TELL YOU SOMETHING ELSE. IT'S ALL PERFECTLY LEGAL. IS THAT LEGAL REPEL. YOU SURE WON'T FIND MUCH INFORMATION THE LABELS SO WE TOOK A COUPLE OF SAMPLES TO A LAB FOR TESTING. WE'LL TELL YOU THE RESULTS IN A MOMENT, BUT FIRST A LITTLE CANNABIS. WANNA WANT YOUR PROFESSOR U OF M BOTANIST GEORGE WEBBER. IT DOES TIE TOGETHER ALL THESE DIFFERENT FAMILY PLAN. COMMON ANCESTOR. WE'VE LENDS LAB RECENTLY MAPPED THE CANNABIS GENOME AND DISCOVERED MARIJUANA AND ITS COUNTRY COUSIN HAVE ACTUALLY SHARE ABOUT 90% OF THE SAME DNA. THEY ALSO SHARE MOST THE SAME CHEMICALS 144 SO CALLED CANAVAN OI, DS LIKE CBD FOR WHAT AILS YOU AND T H C TO GET HIGH. ITS SCIENTIFIC NAME IS ACTUALLY DELTA NINE T. H C. AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE COME TO FIND OUT THERE'S A NEARLY IDENTICAL MOLECULE FOUND HIM MUCH, MUCH SMALLER QUANTITIES CALLED DELTA EIGHT. IT HAS SOME OF THE SAME INTOXICATING EFFECTS IS DELTA NINE. IT'S JUST LESS POTENT, EARNING THE NICKNAME WE'D SLIGHT. AND THEY HIT THE SAME RECEPTORS IN THE BRAIN. CORRECT. RIGHT? YES, THEY BIND TO THE SAME ENDO CANNABINOID RECEPTORS THAT OCCUR IN OUR CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM. IT SORT OF LOOKS LIKE A DUCK QUACKS LIKE A DUCK AND ACTS LIKE A DUCK IN TERMS OF BEING VERY MUCH LIKE MARIJUANA. YEAH. THE DARK. MAYBE A DUCK. THAT'S ONLY HALF BAKED. PROBLEM IS CANNABIS DOESN'T PRODUCE VERY MUCH DELTA EIGHT. NATURALLY SO WHILE IT CAN BE EXTRACTED FROM LEGAL HAMP, IT'S MORE COMMONLY SYNTHESIZED FROM CBD. YOU'RE A CHEMICAL PROCESS KNOWN AS ISOMERIZATION. IN MANY CASES, DELTA 8 MAY ACTUALLY BE SPRAYED ONTO THE HEM FLOWER. L SPIKED. WE'VE BASICALLY AS A BOTANIST, WE BLEND IS DOWNRIGHT OFFENDED BY THE BAIT AND SWITCH. YOU KNOW IT'S EXPLOITING THE INDUSTRIAL HEMP LEGISLATION. IT'S LIKE, LOOK, IF YOU'RE GONNA GROW DRUGS AND SELL DRUGS, LET'S CALL THEM DRUGS. THE FARM BILL THAT LEGALIZED HAVE DOESN'T MENTION DELTA EIGHT, BUT IT MAKES HIM PRODUCTS LEGAL AS LONG AS THEY CONTAIN LESS THAN 80.3% OF DELTA. NINE T. H C. THEN, LAST AUGUST, THE DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION SAID THE FARM BILL DOESN'T COVER SYNTHETICALLY DERIVED TETRAHYDROCANNABINOL. LT'S THEY DON'T COME DIRECTLY FROM THE HEMP PLANT ITSELF. IN THAT CASE, DELTA IT WOULD FALL UNDER THE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES ACT, JUST LIKE DELTA NINE T. H C. IN OTHER WORDS, DELTA EIGHT IS LEGAL IF EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM HEMP. BUT MAYBE NOT, IF SYNTHESIZED FROM CBD. EVEN IF THAT CBD WAS ORIGINALLY EXTRACTED FROM HEALTH. CONFUSED. YOU'RE NOT ALONE. I THINK CONGRESS IS GOING TO NEED TO ASK. CONGRESS IS GONNA HAVE TO DECIDE ONCE AND FOR ALL HOW TO REGULATE THESE PLANT CANNABIS CITY EVEN IN ALL OF ITS FORMS AND VARIETIES. BODY, WIBERG'S EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE MINNESOTA BOARD OF PHARMACY, THE PICTURE IS JUSTICE CONFUSING, HE SAYS. UNDER STATE LAW, WHICH ALLOWS THE SALE OF NON INTOXICATING CANNABINOIDS FROM HEMP. PROBABLY IS. DELTA EIGHT IS INTOXICATING. ANOTHER STATE LAW MAKES IT ILLEGAL TO SELL A MISBRANDED DRUG NOT APPROVED BY THE FDA. AND CLEARLY, PEOPLE ARE MAKING MEDICAL CLAIMS ABOUT DELTA EIGHT. OH, WHAT KIND OF PAIN RELIEVER? REALLY IN GENERAL. WHAT ANXIETY. ALL OF THAT INFORMATION, ANXIETY, ALL OF HELP WITH ALL. THERE'S NO ADVERTISING NOTHING ON THE LABEL. IT'S HARDER FOR REGULATORS TO PROVE INTENT. I THINK IT SPEAKS ALSO TO JUST THE STATE THAT WE'RE IN WITH COVERT 19 WAS SEEN ABSOLUTE SKYROCKETING OF MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES, AND I THINK MANY OF US. ARE DESPERATE TO GET ADVICE OR SOME RELIEF ANYWHERE THAT WE CAN AND DR STEVEN DAHMER'S OF MEDICAL DIRECTOR FOR GREEN GOODS, ONE OF TWO LICENSE PRODUCERS OF MEDICAL CANNABIS IN MINNESOTA. HE WORRIES DELTA EIGHT COULD SET THE ENTIRE CANNABIS INDUSTRY BACK. IT'S FIRED. BEWARE THAT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE GETTING, AND WE DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE MIGHT BE INCLUDED IN THAT. WHICH BRINGS US BACK THE SAMPLES. WE TOOK TOW LEGEND TECHNICAL SERVICES IN SAINT PAUL, WHICH DOES TESTING FOR THE HEMP INDUSTRY AND IS ONE OF THE FEW LABS WE FOUND THAT COULD TEST FOR BOTH DELTA EIGHT AND DELTA 90 HC. FLOWER OR BUD IS NEARLY 2% DELTA, EIGHT MORE THAN THE PLANT WOULD MAKE NATURALLY MEANING IT COULD BE SPIKED. ACCORDING TO OUR EXPERTS, IT'S 14% CBD. THAT'S QUITE A BIT. AND TWICE THE LEGAL LIMIT FOR DELTA NINE TOTAL T. H C AT 90.75. BUT LIKELY NOT ENOUGH TO BE INTOXICATING. GUMMIES ON THE OTHER HAND, OR 0.6% DELTA EIGHT AND JUST MINUSCULE AMOUNTS OF T, H C AND CBD. KEEP IN MIND. YOU WOULDN'T KNOW ANY OF THIS. LOOKING AT THE LABELS. HOUSE IT'LL BE REGULATED AND THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME SORT OF NATIONAL STANDARDS BECAUSE STANDARDS AND REGULATIONS AS UNCLE IS THAT SOUNDS. IS HOW WE KEEP CONSUMERS SAFE IN AMERICA. FOR THOSE OF US WHO. PUT OUR TRUST IN EVIDENCE. AND EVIDENCE BASED SOLUTIONS. THIS IS A NIGHTMARE. WE BLEND WANTS US TO WAKE UP AND REALIZE IT'S NOT TWO PLANTS, MARIJUANA AND HAMP. GENETICALLY IT'S JUST CANNABIS IN ALL ITS VARIETIES, AND IF WE'RE SERIOUS ABOUT ITS PERILS AND PROMISES, MAYBE IT'S TIME OUR LAWS WERE TOO THE FOX NINE", "27dIDqrHsFE": "[Music] hey everybody dr john here with uh extract lab i'm going to be talking today about what is delta eight delta eight is a form of thc that really is a little bit different from a delta nine thc delta nine thc everybody knows that's the thc that makes you guys has some psychoactive effects it's also the main psychoactive ingredient within the marijuana plant and what delta eight is is it's a form or an isomer of that delta nine thc the reason it's been talked about a lot is because a lot of people are using hemp and derivatives of him to create a delta eight thc and they're doing this with some organic synthesis jiu-jitsu really in the laboratory and they're taking cbd and converting it over to delta 8 on thc the reason they're doing that is because the delta atfc of course has some of the same psychoactive effects that delta 9 phc has albeit they can be quite attenuated from delta a lot of people would say it has like a mellow effect so they're using hemp derived materials um they're hooking it up and they're processing it to the point where it now is converting into a delta eight thc molecule that then they can formulate into vapors or gummies or whatever that is that they're looking to formulate for so that's really what delta eight thc is when you look at it just look at it just look at it it's actually an oil and it looks a lot like a cbd oil or it looks a lot like a thc oil you've seen some nice golden pictures of some of that oils as they're flowing out the oil itself is a little bit more biscuit so it's very very thick hard before you need to really heat it up in order to pour it if you want to make products associated with a delta eight a couple different things you need to be thinking about the first thing is you gotta make sure that there's no delta not in your product because the law says that you have to have less than 0.3 delta 9 thc if you have a delta h thc and you have too much delta 9 in it you're not going to be able to use that product for your vapor or you need to dilute it down so that it doesn't have too much delta line in it that really is delta eight how you can use it the oils they look beautiful for them and you can formulate them into different products like that so really guys that's what delta 8 is all about please subscribe to our channel on youtube like us on instagram we have all kinds of calculators for you guys to use on our website we have guides i don't know a lot of people don't know this but we have guide after guide after guide for you guys we have extraction guides we have distillation guides we have a hemp curing guide go

the leaves and buds of the cannabis plant and when it's introduced into the human body it has psychoactive or mind-altering effects THC is structurally similar to the naturally occurring brain chemical Ananda by an and amide is what's called an endogenous cannabinoid and it acts as a neurotransmitter sending chemical messages between nerve cells throughout the nervous system and because THC mimics the structure of an and amide it's able to travel through the body and alter these brain communications affecting regions of the brain that are linked to pleasure memory thought sensory

25 milligrams per pill or capsule I haven't opened up to see exactly how they look but to my knowledge every edible had to be a hundred milligrams broken into 10 milligram increments after the new

strong words coming from governor pete ricketts a longtime vocal advocate against cannabis he'd want to back up in his opposition including former husker head coach tom osborne one key argument made is that the fda has not approved it and it's still a schedule one drug there will be examples of various types of illness that people will make claims but the fda has not made that claim and i think that should carry some weight osborne reflected on his own player's pot use when he coached the huskers saying he was forced to dismiss some who couldn't kick the drug others like former senator john

For a second I thought this was gonna be a very medical question and then it just took a turn. (dance music) This is one of my favorite segments I do, but before we start reading and responding to your comments, I want to ask you a couple of questions. I've seen a few comments\nof people requesting me to start selling merch. I wanna do that if\nthat's what you're into. I can come up with some\npretty funny mug slogans, t-shirt slogans, I can give you a shirt\nthat almost looks like the scrubs with my logo on it, donate some of the proceedings\nto Limitless Tomorrow or some of the other\nfoundations I work with. And the second thing\nthat I've seen is people asking if I have a PO box so they can send questions and letters. I've already had some\nletters sent to my hospital, I just posted on Instagram, it's a really cute drawing\nby an 11 year old girl that was just adorable. So if you want one of those\nor you want two of those, or you like none of those, leave it down below in the comments, and I hope you enjoy\nthis week's responding to comments video. Let's get started, pew woop! Whenever I eat apples or potato products, I sweat a little bit\nand my nipples get hard. Why is that? I love your channel. Officer moose, awesome username. Your nipples get hard from\neating apples or potato products? There's a condition known\nas oral allergy syndrome which is not exactly\nwhat you're describing but basically what it\nis is your mouth tingles and it feels like you're\nhaving a little bit of allergic reaction when you eat foods with certain triggering proteins. Again that can happen\nwith apples, bananas, but it has nothing to do with\nyour nipples getting hard. Officer moose, I don't know if\nyou're turned on by potatoes. As they say, whatever floats your boat, I'm not here to judge. Would you be willing to do\na video on the word quiet in the ER. I have heard there is a secret rule, never say for example quiet day so far. Chaos King, you're absolutely right. You never wanna say that\nit's been a quiet day, you never wanna say\nit's been a quiet call. For some reason, every time you say that it's been quiet, and you're grateful for it, you suddenly get a lot of admissions, emergency situations, rapid responses, code blues, and you start running around like a chicken with its head (mumbles). Now I'm not a superstitious guy, I've said the word quiet, and I've brushed people off who told me I shouldn't have said it, but I see why it exists. Mirthe Van der Heide. Hi I'm 13 years old and\nrecently I saw a video of how you can grow a few inches per week by doing stretches, is this possible? What you should focus on to grow the tallest possible is eating a healthy balanced diet, making sure you get enough protein, make sure you're eating\nyour veggies and fruits, I know that sounds like\nyour grandma talking, but it's true you need those minerals, you need that ability to grow. You need to get enough sleep, because when you sleep\nwell you actually get a lot of growth hormone release, and when I say a lot I\nmean the right amounts so you're not hurting the amount of growth hormone you're getting, and then on top of that you wanna make sure you're exercising. When you exercise it boosts your hormones, it boosts your growth hormone, it makes you process food differently, it makes your muscles grow, and all of those things will contribute to your physical appearance, including your height. Two girls were born to the same mother, on the same day, at the same time, in the same month and year, and yet they're not twins. How can this be? Okay give me a second Teresa. Two girls, born to the same mother, the eggs of a mother were\nartificially inseminated via in vitro fertilization, and they were born by a surrogate, so they were coming from the same mother, even though they were\nborn in different women, as different surrogates. That's my medical answer to that question. Is that the answer you think? Is it normal to talk, or in my case talk and sing in your sleep? This is pretty cool Meg\nI wonder if you're a good singer in your sleep. Actually talking in your\nsleep has a medical term, I'm gonna butcher how to pronounce it, somniloquy I think is the\nright way to pronounce it. It is a normal behavior, it's usually a short lived occurrence. I wouldn't worry about it\nunless causing a disruptance, a disturbance, to your sleep cycle. If you occasionally chatter in your sleep, it's not a big deal. Actually what you should do is record it, and play it back the next day. I've actually heard of some\npatients say some pretty R-rated or X-rated stuff in their dreams, so be careful you might\nbe spilling some secrets to your partner. Robert Mills, I know medical stuff, like stethoscope, tongue depresser, and suppository. What do you know about it? I hope everyone knows what\na tongue depresser is. People hate those, and I get it 'cause\nwhen people put anything into my mouth, when people put any kind of\nmedical device into my mouth, when people put a dental\nmold into my mouth it triggers my gag reflex and I have a huge panic attack I've said that before. Yes Robert you know a\nlot of medical words. Doc I'm a disabled vet. Thank you for your service, Thank you for your sacrifice. I've been gaining weight since I retired. What kind of cardio stuff doesn't require full use of the legs? Oh Marion this is such a good question. Immediately my head goes to swimming. Whenever I think of low\nimpact exercise that is really good for losing weight\nI think of swimming. I assume you can swim\nwithout the use of your legs. I think that there might be\nsome flotation aid devices that you can use to help you swim and allow your heart rate to go up. I know you mentioned cardio to lose weight and while high intensity\ninterval training is great and you can do that\nlike I said by swimming or playing some sports, do some weight training. I know weight training isn't\nalways related to weight loss but actually if you put on\nmuscle on your upper body 'cause you can use your arms, you can burn more calories\nthroughout the day which will lead to more\nsustained weight loss. So people that just do cardio all day long have trouble losing\nweight when they plateau. Michelle Squidy, hey Doc how's Roxy? Haven't seen her in a\nwhile hope she's good. Michelle Roxy's amazing\nI actually just had her stay at my place for the last three weeks because my dad went on vacation to Spain, super jealous 'cause I didn't get to go. Having Roxy there in my apartment is crazy because they're just on top of each other the whole time they love playing. I try to share some stuff on Instagram. If you're not following me\non Instagram you should be. It's doctor spelled out dot Mike. So definitely follow me\non there I put updates on me Roxy and Bear all the time. Is one sleeping position\nhealthier than others? Me the general rule that\nI give to my patients is you should sleep in whatever position you feel most comfortable. Now if you experience pain\nin this specific position, you should change. If you experience acid\nreflex or post nasal drip, there are ways to change\nyour sleeping position. So if you ever feel like you're\nnot getting restful sleep or you wake up feeling sore, that's a good conversation\nto have with your doctor. Mr. Jason Hammer, hey\nDoctor Mike can you tell us what you think about weed? Ah marijuana. Marijuana marijuana marijuana, hot topic in the press right now. It's getting legalized\nit seems like everywhere, in New Jersey where I\npractice you're able to prescribe it for a certain\nnumber of medical conditions. In New York they're\nthinking about legalizing it for recreational use. Is it as bad as something like alcohol? Probably not, but do we\nhave firm research on that? No not yet. Not talking about marijuana\nfor medical usages. I think marijuana for\nmedical usages should've been researched decades ago, and the fact that we haven't\nis truly disappointing to me. Now I'm talking about recreational use. Now here's the difference. When you drink alcohol, because it affects so\nmany parts of your body, gives you hangovers, makes you throw up, it functions itself as a deterrent, so it limits how much you can drink and how often you can drink. When you smoke marijuana\nor you eat an edible, you can really do that\nfor a long period of time, and you can do it multiple days in a row, and it doesn't have much\nof a deterrent other than probably I would say smell, because a lot of people are turned off by the smell of marijuana, or at least many people that I know are. So the fact that you\ndon't have this deterrent that alcohol has can\nreally make you consume a lot more marijuana than you can alcohol. Also a lot of people self\nmedicate with marijuana. They have some social anxieties and instead of facing their goals, instead of achieving and\nbecoming better people, that they can become\nhappier with themselves, they blunt that anxiety by\nsmoking or ingesting marijuana. So do I think marijuana is\nthis horrible evil thing that people have once said it once was and I thought it was when I was younger in fifth grade doing DARE and all those other drug programs? It probably isn't if it's destigmatized and legalized it probably\nwon't be the gateway drug that we once thought it would be. I think it's on its way to get legalized, but that doesn't mean that it's safe, it doesn't mean that I\nrecommend people do it, I do think it has serious\nmedical harms that do exist, that we don't yet even know about 'cause it hasn't been studied properly. My thoughts on marijuana, should probably be legalized. Before we start labeling something as evil or amazing we should get\nour research behind that. So that's why I'm never going to tell you marijuana is amazing or marijuana is awful because I just don't have the\nresearch to show otherwise. The big danger with marijuana\nis young people using it and it can change the\nchemistry of your brain and change the development of it so that's obviously a danger. But we can regulate that, we can control it. There are some pros, there's also some cons. It's about balancing that and getting your science in order before making a decision. I'm still looking at the science, I'm not an expert, I'm looking to improve, so if you have some articles\nyou want me to take a look at drop them down below in the comments and I'll gladly read them to improve my knowledge on the subject.

(dance music)", "GxvBQZF1rE4": "cbd oil and hemp oil have both experienced a rise in popularity over the past few years but they are different products that offer distinct benefits both compounds are derived from different varieties of cannabis plants cbd oil is extracted from leaves flowers and stems of the cannabis sativa plant while hemp oil is made from the leaves flowers and stems of the hemp plant both oils are associated with cannabis but what's the real difference between them cbd is short for cannabidiol which happens to be an active ingredient in cannabis plants while some cbd oils do have low levels of tetrahydrocannabinol thc it is not enough to experience the euphoric feeling associated with other thc infused products on the market cbd is sold over the counter as a remedy for pain relief and neurological disorders some studies claim that it helps improve moods and can even lower blood pressure and improve blood circulation cbd oil interacts with the body's endocannabinoid system cannabidiol works with the body's own endocannabinoid system which is a complex cell signaling system experts don't completely understand how cbd interacts with this system but they seem to think that it helps to treat certain ailments as well as regulate sleep mood memory nausea and appetite hemp oil might contain low levels of cbd but not enough to have the same benefits as cbd oil however there are many brands of cbd hemp oil on the market it is worth noting that hemp oil and hemp seed oil are sometimes advertised as the same thing but they have differences hemp seed oil differs from hemp oil in that it is manufactured from the seeds of the hemp plant because of that process hemp seed oil does not contain much cbd or thc as a result hemp oil is used in beauty products for its moisturizing capabilities because it is loaded with healthy fats it is also used for cooking or taken as a supplement don't forget to subscribe our channel", "OT9rsf0GDDU": "In your opinion as a doctor, who works in this field. What is the best method of delivery for the majority of your patients? So just like with regular medications, we have different forms and modalities of administration. So we have Albuterol, which is an inhaler, which is quick-acting. We have steroids which are pills, which are long-acting. We also have steroid inhalers, which are short acting. So it's the same idea with cannabis. So in terms of inhaled, if you're gonna use a flower to inhale and preferably vape the flower. Which is non oil-based, that's for a quick method of delivery. So if you have acute pain, for cancer and chemo patients, you wanna address nausea and vomiting quickly. And that will address quickly. In terms of oils and sublingual tinctures, that takes about 45 minutes to an hour, to start being effective and lasts about four hours. In edibles, it can take up to two hours to take effect. So oftentimes people feel like it didn't work and so they take more and that's where we get into accidental overdoses that are non-lethal. People took a bite of a brownie or bite of chocolate. \"Didn't work so I'm gonna take more.\" That's the most common issue that we see. And that lasts anywhere from six hours to up to 48 hours, depending on how big a dose you took. So it's really what do you wanna get across? Or what do you wanna treat? I think that's really important information because when you do walk into a legal dispensary. As of now even in the legal states, I believe the bud tenders, in those dispensaries, aren't required to have a medical background or any sort of pharmaceutical background. So it's really kind of roulette in that respect to, as to what kind of advice you're going to get. That's absolutely right. So we need to start pushing both California and every state as they legalize, we need to start encouraging and demanding, that they require bud tender required education. Because those are our current interface right now with patients and consumers. And they are not required to have a high school education, they're not required to have a college education, they're not required to have any education right now. So, yes, I would encourage every single person here, to write to their Bureau of Cannabis Control, and tell them that, you know, \"We do need these types of bud tender level education.\" \"We do need this education in pharmacy schools.\" \"We do need this education in medical schools.\" And to close this out because we are out of time. I think there's a tendency in the country, the minute we legalize something, we assume that all methods of delivery are safe. Look, alcohol is legal in this country, but alcohol could be incredibly unsafe. Cannabis, we now know has so many potential benefits when used in the right population as a medicine. But it also can be either abused or as we've seen with this THC vaping crisis. It can, if taken inappropriately from the wrong source, it can kill you. And I think these are all topics to consider. I really appreciate the work that all three of you are doing to educate. Because it's all about education. So if you're gonna use, know why you're using it, know the best method of delivery and ask questions to the right people. And if you're not certain, this is where I actually applaud you Doctor Yafai, There are doctors out there now, who specialize in how to use cannabis appropriately and safely. Inquire, go talk to someone like a Doctor Yafai, who can give you unbiased advice so that you can do it safely and appropriately for your condition.", "t6FWHNNFzww": "well we're talking about adults who used marijuana and what impact the drug has on their mental health and intelligence experts have been unable to make many definitive statements health authorities can only really say marijuana might do harmful things to the brain but that more research is needed ma vu I Americans according to a recent poll ranked sugar as more harmful than marijuana are they wrong maybe so a new report titled long-term effects of marijuana use on the brain is offering fresh evidence that a chronic users brain undergoes significant structural changes for those who've used marijuana regularly over six to eight years what kinds of changes using MRI scans researchers compared the brains of 48 3-point marijuana users who took the drug on average 11 times per week to those of 62 non users the yellow area on this MRI scan shows the average amount that the grey matter density was diminished in the bilateral orbital frontal cortex of the marijuana users this is the part of the brain that's involved in decision making at the same time the MRI shows the marijuana users have greater activity than the control group in another section of the plane called the forceps miner this is the white matter that connects the brains frontal lobes that means according to researchers the pot smokers have more connections to facilitate communication between these lobes and the more efficient communication makes it more responsive to the environment why would marijuana users have higher connectivity and isn't that a good thing not necessarily the report suggests this part of the brain may be compensating for gray matter losses however the study finds that over years of regular use those increased connections wither away meaning the brain may be losing its ability to compensate for lost gray matter then what happens eluding marijuana scientists not involved in this particular study says these longtime users could be at increased risk to be driven by immediate rewards and not looking for more long-term gratification and may be more vulnerable to mood and anxiety problems the authors of the study admit they found no correlation between an individual's IQ and reduced gray matter in the orbital frontal cortex they don't know whether heavy pot users had less grey matter to begin with making them more prone to using the drug and if so whether marijuana made those structural deficiencies worse yet again the public is told more studies are needed so at this point setting aside the emerging consensus among researchers that pot is harmful to the developing brains of adolescents in places where it's legal do leading scientists think there should be a warning label on marijuana some do here's what crystal is Dahl of the University of wisconsin-milwaukee would have it say high THC marijuana can cause subtle cognitive deficits brain structure abnormalities mood and sleep problems daily use is not recommended not recommended at least until the science becomes more conclusive that's the short answer", "XkkGcLccmcI": "I think not allowing medical marijuana is one of the biggest hypocrisy we have in this country a good dinner for breakfast have a small lunch and have your happy hour dinner when the Sun Goes Down you're done number-one thing to fix asleep without question biggest underappreciated problem we have in America dr. Ives thank you so much for taking the time to speak to us on NBC six calm a lot of people are going into the new year with wanting to lose weight the new year new me fad what are some of the top health tips that you have for people looking to start that you're often on the right button number one thing to fix is sleep without question biggest underappreciated problem we have in America and we don't sleep you lead the your to issues like high blood pressure would that be connected it is because your body's feeling continuous stress increased risk of cancer we believe but in addition you'll gain weight so this weight loss is number one thing people want this time of year I can tell you it started off by age deepening a couple things first off you can't eat while you're sleeping that good that's good but when you don't sleep you crave stuff in particular food and not only any food carbohydrates so people don't sleep well will go out to have a doughnut in the morning just to get going and then late in the afternoon when you're tired you have to eat carbs again to get your brain stimulated to be able to work it so by taking an approach that allows you to sleep better during the evening and take naps treating day if you can't see them at night and you're at least able to live your life without putting on extra weight which which is a good benefit number two thing I focus on is the kind of food you eat a lot of people don't recognize that not all calories are created equal is Today Show highlighting a study that demonstrated that any question that people who have a diet that's 20% carbohydrate versus a more traditional American diet of 40 to 60 percent carbohydrate 10 you lose weight and that's because they actually have effectively less calories coming into their body they metabolize it differently and the last tip I'll leave you with is when you eat matters let's flip the whole thing upside down it doesn't make any sense for us to ignore the reality that our intestines go to Steve when the Sun Goes Down our answer just couldn't go hunting at night so what was the point of your intestines working at night yeah but we do the opposite we eat our biggest meal in the evening before you know when you're already should be going to bed and that food section you stomach all that long and messes with your sleep so it says I said and it is spiral you don't wanna be part of a good dinner for breakfast have a small lunch and have your happy hour dinner when the Sun Goes Down you're done no carbohydrates up to 3:00 p.m. and if you do that you effectively becoming katatak as the evening comes along which is a fantastic place too because that way your body will burn fat and won't put fat on you it's not a little bit about going into ketosis that's one of the fad diets that that's going on right now a lot of people are going vegan as well what's your opinion on these fad diets is that's something that people should be doing or is it you know so people just rely on diet and exercise well dine exercise is obviously the first and pal-m foundation of any program but it's hard to do that because the diets you eat can be hard for your body you can't customize without knowing more about your body so that's efforts to hack the system by finding programs that are easier for your body to stay on sensible so I actually think vegan guys make a lot of sense good for the environment as well now we know people who are vegans generally tend to have less weight on them the food is less calorie dense more nutrient rich so you won't eat as much true brains not looking for calories and looking for nutrients so you're giving yourself healthy nutritious food it's good that's why eating nuts never makes you fat does that have so many nutrients cuz they're baby trees that your brain says I had enough stop but if you'd seen there were calories potato chips you'll keep going so that those are symphonies and I think people are starting to wake up to but ketosis is a phenomenal concept that we ought to take advantage of when you allow your body to have periods of fasting so that the hormone sort of stabilized but in addition your body no longer can rely on simple carbohydrates to burn to us to burn through your fat stores your body your hunger levels go down because our ancestors when we didn't have food couldn't just whine about it we had to go out and find more food so we turn off our desire to eat that's also wild low carbohydrate diets are so impactful the catch is you're miserable sometimes not eating carbohydrates because they hit your brain like crack cocaine most people feel that way that's normal so how do you do both you have enough carbs that you're not miserable and you're not getting upset everybody angry or slang Gris is I just heard from a friend Larry your GM because he says you know people do don't eat carbs when sleeping and they'll get angry so enough carbs 10 15 20 percent for you who live your life comfortably but not more than that and limit those carbs just a few hours a day so most of the day body's not being intoxicated by them we also touched on high blood pressure you know there's been a big recall on high blood pressure meds recently because the car cost cancer obviously the goal is to for people not to be on those meds what are some tips that you can give people to lower their blood pressure without medication high blood pressure is number one cause of death in America number one ager we have a test called the real age test that's on shared care which people just sir check sugar is a free app that Oprah and I and good friends crafted it's a good way of you assessing how old your body thinks you are when you take the real age test you'll learn that you're not actually 50 years old like a birth certificate says you're actually 44 or you're 57 so you can adjust what you're doing accordingly the number one driver of aging is high blood pressure and I recognize now after many years I'm a heart specialist that part of the reason for that is when your body feels unsettled one of the ways they tells you that is by jacking up its pressure so psychological stress is involved genetic issues play a role illnesses of your organs will contribute and not sleeping as we talked to us earlier a major fat risk factor so if you're unable to deal with those with the weight gain that can lead to high blood pressure is a problem for you and you and you can't do a dental lying problem you gotta then you have take the meds but most of the time you can deal with the underlying problems so we know that people lose just 10 percent of their body weight rheumatica drops their blood pressure why not lose the weight instead of taking a pill that might make you gain weight so these are the kinds of insights that when you are understanding of them will motivate you catalyze you in new direction and one thing for sure don't ignore your blood pressure because it's the it's the classic case of a young healthy stud walk it around with the armed lashed in in a fixed position because they had a stroking and weren't aware of the risk of the high pressure that hurts me so much and hurts people that that suffer of course for the rest of their lives you can preemptively address this and addressing and by doing that changed your destiny forever let's talk about a big hot-button issue here in Florida medical marijuana you know there's a lot of people who are against it there are a lot of people who are for it what is your opinion on it and how can it benefit people I think not allowing medical marijuana is one of the biggest hypocrisy we have in this country doctors I think in general or an agreement that there's a solution to a problem childhood seizures we should allow it why would I want the government to tell me what medication I can use if or at least not allow me to study it freely and medical marijuana has been hindered because it's been considered a class 1 drug Schedule one drug which means it's has no potential value and is addictive and in fact the matters there's even a patent on marijuana hold by the US government by the way arguing that there are potential benefits this is a substance that's being used for known history there's probably going to be some benefits but it's not I think a good tool to use recreationally personal bias and I wouldn't let my family or zama that me and I've never smoked pot so I'm smoking if I speak about something just as a doctor but I do not want someone getting between me and my patient when I've got a dissolution of might work and when we have enough evidence that for medical marijuana that I think we ought to be more liberal in our desired researches and certainly when spend states are allowing it to be used it ought to be part of the national law last question for you we've talked a lot about sleep these devices that we're all hooked up to thee tend to create unhealthy sleeping patterns because we're on them right up until it's time to go to bed what are some healthy sleeping preparation techniques that people can use cell phones here to stay and if I told you turned your cell phone off and you never use it again it wouldn't have much of an impact anyway so they may have focus on certain stuff that we know matters don't keep it next to your head if it's right there you'll see with the lights and come on to alert you et cetera turn off the alerts which I do anyway at night you know you can allow your family to get through you without having to turn the phone completely on so anytime someone pings you from another part of the country you don't wait you're not awakened so the phones impact on you starts to diminish I actually like using the phone to measure my sleep is an app called sleep score which you can turn on it's used as a baby it's the audio part does XOR system like a second porpoise measuring you so I actually measured my sleep to make sure it's not bothering me and I'm getting the best seat by can at night but the best hacks for sleep have to do a sleep hygiene join the lights in the room down at least 20 minutes before bedtime so your brain no longer secretes the hormones that keep you up in fact you start making more melatonin which is actually made in your brain make sure you're in comfortable clothing or no clothing at all which is even better the room has to be cold if there's a fight between you and your loved one about what temperature the room is whoever wants it colder they win there's just no question about that you're gonna be able to see your breath that in those cold environments allow you to hibernate better when you sleep and do not forget the impact of I could settle little noise from your pet from your kid from your spouse that matters and if you can't get around that use a sound machine because they do work alright dr. oz thank you so much for the time I appreciate y'all blessed you", "0Nc-FxO4XcE": "[Music] welcome to true buds TV for cannabis infused coconut oil to point out so we're making an extra potent today about four to five ounces of organic

left I bet it works most of the time oh did you guys see much oh yeah like we could really easy I wanna yeah please pretty angry that thank you my home state the number one frustration that I have is

Wow Melissa joins me now and it's interesting because this is all about cannabis the product I'm hearing more about than ever is CBD I mean at what point does CBD just become one part of this industry as it gets more and more legalized well at this point even the estimates hi projections for the CBD market vs. whole plants by 2025 are much smaller at 16 billion dollars by 2025 versus 67 billion the whole plant so still marijuana the plant itself whether it's used for recreational use or for medicinal use is seen as a bigger opportunity CBD right now because you're seeing it everywhere you're seeing a proliferating creams etc absolutely on the drug store shelves it's it's easily accessible to the consumer but there are questions about CBD as well I mean about the medical a fit effect you can see they claim it can do it everybody exactly and and is there the research to support that we don't have firm research yet and that's why it can't be put into the food supply for instance right or it's not supposed to be anyway post yes it's not legal if if you consume CBD and so for cannabis so a lot of these companies are Canadian I mean what is the pathway to investment if that's if they think this is the big long so the Canadian companies because it was federally legal they had access to their exchanges they had access to our exchanges for instance that's why you hear about companies like tilray that went public at the Nasdaq with sky-high market caps of you know when they first went public twenty billion dollars bigger than American Airlines for the US companies because it's not federally legal they can't list so they list on smaller OTC exchanges exchanges in Canada and not being federally legal or at least not having the infrastructure so they can tap traditional banking they can do things like write off business expenses that's really Han handcuffed them to some degree but at this point multi-state operators are publicly traded they are invested and some investors like Danny Moses say that's that's where the gold is gonna be made so there they you it because there's that potential of when the spigot turns on yeah this big it will really turn you you", "O6W6YUS3DrU": "[Music] we're in order to make infuse coconut oil you're gonna need so you're gonna need my finally killing on your culinary secrets much the first step to making infused coconut oil is actually decarboxylated your cannabis decarboxylate means turning your THC into active Delta 9 Delta my name is the part of the cannabinoids that makes you high put it on a tray where it's nice and even and spread out and we're gonna stick it in the oven at 215 degrees about 15 minutes no longer than 20 minutes so while that's decarboxylated I'm gonna get the coconut oil out of the jar coconut oil is the medium chain fatty acid you like medium chain fatty acids because they're high in omega threes too easy for the body to digest and the effect when you're high is that it's a much quicker onset and there's much less of a groggy tweedle so the only piece of equipment that you'll actually really need that and you probably have in your kitchen is a slow cooker or a crock-pot but basically the slowly did you cook the oil but more THC is gonna come out of it typically what I do is I put it on warm and don't even put it on low because low will cause it to boil and you don't want any of that nice THC to boil so and I'm gonna pull out our decarboxylated cannabis and so once that pan cools off I'm gonna jump the coconut oil into our nifty crop you can use coconut oil for many different uses you could use it as a moisturizer you could use it as a body scrub you could use it as just a straight topical if you've got pain so the next step in the process is just to get the cannabis into the crock-pot and your eating cannabis and absorbing it through the GI tract you basically feel it about ten times more than you would if you were just taking a hit and smoking it not only does it take about 45 minutes to onset but it takes about four to six to eight hours to wear off we're gonna leave this on for a solid seven hours now once every half an hour we have come in we're gonna stir it and you could leave this on for up to seven days to get the highest potency possible once it's been simmering for about seven hours you want to have a large bucket that you can make sure you're gonna strain into and we're going to put our mesh strainer on top of it and you'll need a cheesecloth or in this case we used a fine fabric that's a slightly different than cheesecloth but works just as well if not better you can just shake it out and then we are also going to employ a to make sure we get so the final step in our process is to package it up into something that you can use it in writer I like to use glass jars that are non plastic non BPA and that way we could run jar underneath hot water if we need to get it softened as I mentioned there are so many uses for cannabis infused coconut oil there are too many to count one of my favorite ways to use it is to give it as a gift to friends what better way to enjoy your Saturday than a cannabis infused dinner party Oh smooch that's how you make cannabis infused coconut oil you", "shBGvwyA7iM": "[Music] hey guys what's up and welcome back to another coffee talk podcast episode for today's podcast i wanted to talk about cannabis and i know that that is a very controversial topic i live in canada it is legalized here in canada anyone that's listening or tuning in today that maybe has a closed mind about it either if it's if you know that cannabis isn't your thing and you're not interested in learning more about it then this is definitely not the episode for you that said if you're coming here and you're skeptical but you're willing to have an open mind then i definitely please ask you to just like just activate that open mind a little bit just really listen to the whole episode today before you pass any sense of judgment or come to any sort of conclusion i've done a great deal of research for today's video i'm gonna share my own experiences my own perspectives and opinions from the good to the bad and i'm gonna share a lot of just general objective factual knowledge about cannabis so just yeah keep that mind flourished and open keep that flower keep all those petals open let's absorb the information and then come to conclusions so anyways that's my spiel um i'm gonna jump in though because i do have a lot that i wanna talk to you guys about today and this is why i love cosmic brews because we can talk about things that maybe aren't so politically correct if you will or we talk about things that are a bit more supernatural and spiritual and things like that so i'm definitely not that weed is supernatural it is somewhat spiritual but yeah i just really enjoy being able to talk about these kind of taboo topics with you guys here's how we're gonna crunch down today's chat just to give you guys a quick little overview first we're going to start with what exactly is cannabis i'm going to explain the effects of cannabis the difference between thd and cbd and all of that then we're going to go into why cannabis has such a bad name and such a bad stigma the racist history of the bad stigma and the villainization of marijuana and then we're going to finish off with just the stereotypes including where i kind of feel and how my experience and opinion fits into those stereotypes and basically a final overview on on how i basically implement cannabis into my life and my thoughts on the matter so first things first what exactly is cannabis now cannabis is different than what they call marijuana because cannabis is all of the plants that basically create cannabinoids whereas marijuana is specifically the flower that comes from cannabis plants like you you might hear the term weed kush marijuana cannabis all inter like just interplaced and used at different variations but it's really kind of most people i think generalize all of those things to mean the exact same thing which is pretty much weed or marijuana now there are actually three different types of cannabinoid plants or species of cannabinoid plants but the two main i guess popular ones that you hear about are usually the sativa plant and the indica plant and these are known to have two very different effects on human beings sativa being more energizing and indica being more calming that said most of the grown cannabis is actually a hybrid of the two so it doesn't really give you one effect or the other in fact they all tend to give you all the different strains tend to give you different effects the reason for that is trichomes now trichomes are basically like the crystals or the fuzzy part on weed or cannabis plants and within those trichromes or the crystals you're gonna find four different components amongst a lot of other ones but the four main ones are thc cbd terpenes and flavonoids and those four different things are going to make up the i there's like an actual term for it i can't think of it right now but it's basically like it creates an effect it creates like a rippling effect of the type of experience that you're going to get or the type of reaction you might have to the different types of cannabis plants so out of those four ingredients thc and cbd are known to me known to be cannabinoids and flavonoids and terpenes are known to be non-cannabinoids which means they don't have any sort of effect on you they kind of more so create either the aroma the smell the color of the plant et cetera et cetera including even the taste which is why when you start getting into different weed strands you'll notice that a lot of them have basically been labeled under things like blueberry or chocolate or whatever because different plants can give a different flavor and a different color and a different scent and then when you get into the actual cannabinoids which are thc and cbd i think this is where people sometimes get very confused because cbd is actually non-psychoactive so you can actually smoke cannabis you can vaporize it you can have cbd oil you can have extractions from cannabis plants that don't have any psychoactive i'm getting too ahead of myself that do not have any psychoactive effects cbd is an amazing amazing thing a lot of people use cbd for epilepsy it actually helps stop seizures they use them for migraines a lot of people use it for anxiety and insomnia which is what i tend to use cbd for but that said it also has like a calming just general effect on the body um and it's anti-inflammatory so there's a really like a lot of really good effects that can come from using things like cbd now moving into the thc thc is where you get that psychoactive reaction to weed so this is where i think people either decide whether it's a good drug or it's a bad drug because anybody that basically kind of shies away or stays away or disagrees with psychoactive drugs is not going to agree with the in take of thc different concentrations of thc will create different types of sedations euphoria paranoia creativity it can cause energy it can cause like definitely different effects based on the different concentrations of thc now that said thc can also be known to cause impairments in cognitive and verbal function so that is i feel like that also kind of plays into that stereotype about weed where you kind of see stoners as people that are really slow and kind of slurring their words together which can definitely be an effective smoking weed but it's definitely not the only effect or the most prominent effects all the time i know many a stoners that can smoke and they don't speak slowly or slur their words or kind of like slow down or have any problems with cognitive function so i feel like that's definitely subjective to the user now the common effect that needs to be done or used to actually activate all four of those ingredients is heat so that's why you'll notice that any kind of use or ingesting of cbd weed thc any of the sort it usually comes in the form of smoking it of burning it of baking it vaporizing it it all has to do with heat it's taking the non-active ingredients and by heat it's activating them so it causes the effect on your body so that's just like an overview of what cannabis is and how it's used and i guess just like a different breakdown if you've ever just been curious about the drug itself that's my umbrella knowledge very very simplified version so i think it's really important that if i was going to do a video all about cannabis and my opinion on it my use of it and all of that that i i definitely dove into the stigma behind marijuana so back in the 1800s in the united states there was actually no federal laws against using or ingesting any kind of cannabis in fact the fiber from the plant was used to make things like rope to make things like paper to make things like clothing and at the time it was used as like a main component or a main ingredient to actually manufacture those things so in the early 1900s there was a spike or an increase of the amount of mexican immigrants that actually moved into the united states and with them they brought the word marijuana and the recreational use of marijuana the word marijuana was used and was also villainized villainide why can't i get that word done today done today i'm not making any sense vilified why the word was vilified because along with the increase of immigrants came a lot of political unrest so then in 1937 we see harry anslinger einslinger i don't really know how to say his last name and it doesn't really matter he pretty much began what is known to be the war on drugs he created this marijuana tax act that created a ton of fear monitoring around the use of marijuana now this man was incredibly racist and he definitely had an agenda he took a bunch of non-scientific backed facts about marijuana and then basically found a way to tie it to both the mexican communities and the black communities labeling it as violent labeling it as a gateway drug and labeling it as just basically either what you would use if like for instance a lot of the uh propaganda around marijuana back in the day was basically like if you smoked it it would make you super just like aroused it would cause people to act absolutely insane and psychotic and crazy all the way to it would cause people to commit violent crimes which is just clearly clearly not the case the other kind of like sadistic thing that he did and intentionally did as well was that he made sure to use the word marijuana which again remember it's the spanish word for cannabis and weed which is further creating that tie yeah this man was just not he was he was kind of a piece of uh a piece of something and this trickled into the effect of racism creating a lot of extreme influence on how people basically perceived or saw weed don't tell me the facts i've already made my mind up kind of mentality that it's just horrible needs to be stayed away from and a lot of this fear monitoring and a lot of this racism influenced not only the public's perception on marijuana but also even the media and how it portrayed marijuana use in a lot of the famous movies or things that you would see back in the day so it was definitely the topic of marijuana and weed and the context in which it was being shared or promoted around was definitely being controlled and the narrative written was definitely not an honest and true one it was coming from a very very evil place a very evil man that started this but it was it was not just him it takes more than just one man to do that one year after that marijuana tax act it became three times more likely for a black person to be arrested for any kind of charge or any kind of possession of marijuana and it became almost nine times more likely for anyone that was mexican to also be getting those charges which then moves us into the 1960s and the 1970s this is basically the hippie era they were against mainstream culture and powerful institutions and were basically all about peace and not war and being able to be conscious and to wake yourself up to the truth and to break a lot of these stigmas and the fear monitoring that was basically surrounding things like marijuana but also other psychedelic drugs and again created political unrest they weren't happy with that so because of that political unrest in 1970 under president nixon there was a controlled substances act that was basically created that classified marijuana as a category one drug if you want some further context as to what that means that puts marijuana as more dangerous and more addictive than cocaine and meth now since 1970 other things have changed for instance in the states there have been quite a few different states that have actually legalized if not the medical use of marijuana even gone as far as legalizing recreational recreational use and like i said i live here in canada where it has also been legalized for recreational use if you clicked on today's video feeling some type of way about weed and it's tied to more of a personal experience than fair i think that it's super important to highlight the stigma around weed because a lot of this negative stigma literally has come from years and history of fear monitoring and racism so just taking a little break from today's episode i wanted to talk to you guys about better help if you were to just

so for all of my fellow wine lovers out there this one is totally for you usual wines is a really cool brand that i want you to check out each bottle is a 6.3 ounce and a heavy pour or about a glass and a half of wine so if you live alone and you like to have a glass of wine with dinner let's say after accomplishing a great goal or just in general if you want to bring wine with you somewhere and it's just you drinking it but you don't want to have to pour out the bottle because you aren't able to finish it then this is definitely gonna be all up your alley because of the single serve format of the usual wines and their bottle design usual is always fresh with no more flat bubbly or stale roses plus usual wines are made from world-class abas and they're made with minimal intervention zero sugar and zero additives the one are also lower carb like i said have zero grams of sugar and usual has a red blend a rose a and a sparkling white wine called brute they also have a limited production brute rose just for the summer and that one was my favorite so a little fun fact is if you're drinking wine in the u.s did you know that in the u.s there are over 60 additives allowed by law to be used in wine making usual wines doesn't use any chemicals or sugar additives to enhance the flavors or the stability of their wine they're truly like a clean wine brand now obviously grapes contain sugar but to clarify all usual wines are produced using natural sustainable grapes harvested every single fall these grapes are picked at optimal ripeness to ensure all sugar will be fermented completely until the wines are dry with no residual sugar so all that's left over afterwards is just delicious and clean wine now like i said the root rose was my favorite i'm looking forward to trying the white wine though especially and the red one now that we're dipping into the cooler chillier months but if you guys want to give it a try then just go check out their website at www.usualwinds.com and you can use my discount code caitlyn k-a-l-y-n for eight dollars off your first order and try your first glass on us now that we've discussed you know the importance of what exactly is weed now we understand how it works and how it affects our bodies and what gives it different tastes flavors and colors we've discussed how it's basically been painted as this terrible gateway drug when that is actually definitely not the case it doesn't cause i mean everything in moderation just like with drinking or with caffeine even you don't want to go into excessive modes of ingesting or using and yes it can definitely have some negative outcomes too like i said it can cause paranoia it can cause anxiety it can even cause psychotic breaks again if you're smoking too much weed or ingesting too much thc but that said just to put this into perspective around 90 000 people i think it's in the united states but it was like around 90 000 people in the united states die every year in relation to over consumption of alcohol but zero like literally there have been no documented deaths from over ingestion of weed or marijuana a lot of the propaganda around wheat and marijuana is that if you smoke weed or you smoke marijuana you're going to become lazy you're not going to be a contributing citizen to the public or your community or your family or to your significant other that you'll just basically want to slow motion eat in your bed and roll around in the crumbs because your body feels different and stare at your hands and your palms and you know just drift away on a cloud which i mean honestly that sounds iconic to me for like a sunday afternoon but i do want to talk about the different stereotypes and how a lot of them actually aren't true for instance oh this is where i get uncomfortable because i need to like input my own personal experience but you are talking to somebody who has been incredibly productive and incredibly motivated by the use of cannabis find rest when my insomnia is really really bad and find groundedness and contentment through the use of cbd as well as even going as far as spiritual advancements and making i guess more and all i mean by that like spiritual advancements is really just getting to know more of myself more of me on the inside more of the energy that takes up this body that fills this brain that allows me to experience my senses to think to emote and all of that and that introspection has also been enhanced through the use of things like thc so there's definitely more people around you than you might actually think that use marijuana especially if you live in places that it's legalized where the reason why you wouldn't think it is because they don't fit the class stereotype that we all think of when we think of potheads or stoners i don't know if i'd go as far as calling myself like a pothead or a stoner but i've definitely gone through phases where i was phases where i would smoke literally every single day also taken large breaks in the past in different years like 2017 and things like that where i was very like i just didn't want to have it for a little while like i felt like i needed to take a break but that was again just like with drinking and caffeine it's like you have to be able to know your limit so you do need that self actualization because at the same time even though this drug isn't actually physically addictive it can definitely become habitually addictive and so that's i guess where i'm coming from as i explained to you guys my personal experience with marijuana because i have felt both the pros and cons both what it's like to have or use or consume weed in a way that is actually balanced in my life versus an unbalanced or a like what's a good way to put it um a dependency issue so for the longest time i used to feel really shameful about the fact that if i showed up to a house party or if i was in a group setting or it was like time to go to the bars or things like that that most of the time i would have actually preferred to you know smoke and then go then drink and go because there's a lot of and that's just my own personal experience due to my own conditioning around things like alcohol i used to have a big problem with alcohol for a while where there was even more shame and guilt that i can't that i would basically experience when i would try and drink really didn't enjoy being drunk and i really didn't enjoy feeling the feeling of being drunk but i did enjoy the feeling of being high and i think i enjoyed it because i tend to be introspective just in my day to day nature so anytime i would smoke especially when i would get good high quality strains like sativas and things like that like i turn into just this happy bubbly person which i actually enjoyed more than when i would become a drunk person and that was again just my own personal experience and i i guess like i always struggled for a while and i still kind of do with the idea that it wasn't okay for me to say that in a group setting like if everybody was drinking i couldn't like partake in the celebrations the festivities the activities and openly admit like oh i'm okay i don't need a drink i'm actually just gonna take a couple puffs of my vaporizer but now that it's been legalized it's definitely been easier because i think that again we're seeing more people come to terms with the fact that this drug is not that harmful now i should put a disclaimer in here when i say that this drug is not that harmful we unfortunately due to a lot of these laws and a lot of these stigmas and things scientists haven't been able to actually gain the proper access needed at least in the past in order to actually test and do different types of research in order to see the types of effects that come from marijuana but in the tests that have already been done it's looking like the only real effects are in cognitive function and memory and perhaps like verbal missing verbalization which i feel like you know what that happens to me but normally it's just my anxiety that said if you're under the age of 21 your brain is still growing and developing so it actually is harmful and can be detrimental to smoke a large amount and a consistent amount of weed before the age of 21 because it doesn't give i'm remembering this very vaguely from the research that i've done but i'm pretty sure it affected how the hippocampus of the brain grew in the teenagers which i think just literally means that your brain isn't going to grow properly if you are abusing weed or marijuana before the age of 21 but i think after the age of 21 you know you're a mature adult your brain is fully grown you have the capability and the like honestly it's up to you then to decide where you stand with it decide how you feel about it and then go on and live your life and not really i guess if you're making mature decisions and you can find a way to healthily balance it it's literally no different than if we were to be sitting here talking about a drink or sitting here talking about coffee or any other kind of drug not to mention i feel like there's also the stigma around marijuana where it's like people people don't believe that it should be legalized because when people get their hands on it it's literally just so that they can continue to get their hands on it but we don't really put that same stigma stigmatization or that same i guess pressure around pharmaceutical drugs which are more highly addictive and detrimental as well as like i said things like caffeine or drinking whereas drinking and even caffeine it can cause greater effects on the physical body drinking especially than weed really actually

story times about this perhaps on my main channel if you guys want that let me know if you guys want to hear about like more funny or specific stories or things like that now that we've broken the ice here um but here's my i guess short brief history with marijuana or cannabis so the first time i smoked weed i was in high school i believe i was in grade 10 if not it would have been late grade 9 or summer going into grade 10. and at first i i think in grade nine i was pretty against it where i just kind of really didn't even care about it like i knew people around me did it and that high school parties did it but i just wasn't really about it grade 10 i don't know what happened actually i do know what happened but realistically all that really matters is that i started acting out a little bit and a good friend of mine at the time she was one of my best friends i still find her to be a very kind warming soul but was also going through some hard teenage times and we just kind of like bonded over the fact that we were like yo weed really helps which is not a healthy thing to do because like i said i was under the age of 21. uh we didn't smoke all of the time but we would definitely on the weekends and stuff and after grade 10 i kind of went into a complete pendulum swing of kind of going through just like this rebellious acting out phase like i said to grade 11 where i was just in a completely different mindset and i decided to completely like i remember i wasn't trying to drink at parties i would always dd everybody i didn't smoke weed i remember i made my high school boyfriend feel really bad any time he smoked weed and i shamed him which is terrible to think about but i did back in the day because i just basically flipped into the other mode basically around 2013 i started dating um another another longer relationship of mine and he was five years older than me we met at work and he was somebody who smoked and smoked more regularly and at this time i would have been going on 20 so again too young under the age of 21 guys don't do as i do i'm just telling you the truth of my story um so i started smoking when we started dating but again it wasn't like it was a regular thing it was just kind of like a recreational use every other weekend or so he had a cottage when we'd go to his cottage and things like that and then around the age of 21 we started living together and then i we kind of like got into a routine where it was i want to say like friday saturday sunday type of thing but throughout the week when we'd both be working and he was going to school and working as well we wouldn't smoke and at the time i just i couldn't do it in front of other people i remember for the longest time i don't think i have a lighter hair for my candle but for the longest time i used to be really afraid of lighters and fire and like i wouldn't be able to like hit a lighter and so i was just like a complete noob back in the day and i was basically just i felt very safe around the people that i would smoke around which was pretty much just my boyfriend at the time and our two friends that we were really close with they were a couple and all four of us would hang out and they were also older than me and i just kind of felt like we did it in such a wholesome way like we would like hang out at their house and just like you know just have like crackers and hummus and watch crime shows or things like that so you're gonna want to skip forward to about 2016. now at this point i'm single and i've moved into my first apartment by myself i had moved out of my apartment with maggie to which actually maggie and i i skipped over that 2015. we would also sometimes dabble um and at the time again it was coming from a very wholesome place like it would be like end of the day we would dabble we would smoke a little bit listen to taylor swift make our dinner like dance around our kitchen and it was just like again just like wholesome best friend smoking vibes and nobody knew and then moving forward the year after that this is where things started to get into the out of balance experience that i had with marijuana so i moved into my first apartment by myself mentally i was really struggling mental health-wise 2016. like it's weird because you can go back and watch my videos and you would have no idea especially because i've been re-watching some of the youtuber videos in order to create youtuber this year and when i go back to 2016 it's so funny for me to watch just even my demeanor on camera because i'm so peppy and i'm so i'm just like hi guys i'm like i talking like a really high-pitched voice part of it was just that i was trying to you know get comfortable with myself on camera but i think also another part of it was because there was actually just like so much mental anguish i was hiding at the time it's not a big deal honestly that sounds kind of heavy but it really just is the truth i was mentally struggling a lot with depression and anxiety but extreme depression and i had gone to a few a few therapists from high school on but at the time i wasn't seeing a therapist so it really wasn't going well things with my family were really not going well which was the root of a lot of the problems and come fall pretty much the first year i ever ever actually did youtober was when i started to use weed every single day and we're just gonna break all the rules right now i'm just gonna say the words that i've been beating around because i know that these words come with such harsh context and whatever but f the stigma i'm just gonna break it down guys like i was smoking like bongs like every single day starting in the morning and just would like work all day and like i hibernated i didn't leave my house like it started to become this really unhealthy habit and it's crazy because like i said when you break down those stereotypes guys i was not smoking sitting on my couch and watching tv all day to me it was like this easy kept secret because my life seemed like it was still fully functioning although i was in a lot of pain and at that time it no longer became something i used to engage with the world or every now and then recreationally it became a substance that i started to rely and depend on in order to basically turn off all the pain i was feeling and focus in on the work i wanted to do and it became a very unhealthy habit so 2017 we're going through like a life history lesson right now but 2017 i moved to toronto and that gave me that new fresh environment to really start fresh and again it moved back into a more recreational use i started dating a different boyfriend um that i met here in toronto and yeah he also smoked very recreationally and again it just became back into balance and life was back on track on the weekends every now and then we would smoke and i would also have some weed at home to smoke as well but again it would be like the odd night or so if i ever wanted to relax or be creative but again it wasn't a daily use and then skip forward to 2018 and again we have the same type of mental anguish i'm going through some very hard deep soul work um and it wasn't up until actually towards the end of it would have been around this time 2018 so about two years ago that i sought out my now therapist who has pretty much helped me work through all of this that has led me to me being able to sit here and openly be honest and authentic and talk to you guys about it because i do think that there is a lot of very unfair stigma around this plant around this drug that isn't there for things like alcohol that if i was sitting here talking about wine no one would really question meanwhile i think that it's way less harmful and has actually also helped me like i don't want to just paint it in a bad light so yes i'm aware of the fact that you can actually have addictive behaviors or addictive personalities with weed but it's not physically addictive and so i understand both sides there's pros and cons but just like there are pros and cons to drinking just like there are pros and cons to even ingesting caffeine pharmaceutical drugs so on and so forth so where is weed in my life now okay i recently uploaded a night routine where i decided because i do my night routine's vlog style so it doesn't mean that that's my routine every single night i literally just show you that routine of that night and i figured you know what i'm just gonna i'm gonna include a little clip of this and when i did you guys actually shocked me so many of you wrote in to me just basically being like oh my god thank you like i don't feel crazy anymore like i hide i'm a closet stoner um or even the people that were like i don't really agree but i'm open to hearing more because i asked if you guys wanted me to do this right now like sit down and talk about it and i was just overwhelmed with the positive reaction because i was really uncertain of how people were were going to react but at that point i had basically decided when i decided to put it in the video i decided that i was going to own who i am and i wasn't going to let anybody change my mind because like i said i've done my research i've had my experiences i know where i sit with it i feel good about how i like i guess where weed it sits in my life but i was so elated when i actually saw how people reacted because it was a pleasant surprise to see how many people were open-minded to at least hearing about it and breaking their own internalized i guess like imagery or meaning of what weed actually is end of 2018 i moved into this apartment the house that i'm in right now with larissa larissa and i you guys probably know what i'm talking about but if you don't she is my best friend as well as we work together in a lot of different ways behind the scenes and uh she is actually who helped inspire me to open up more about being a weed smoker especially a woman who's a weed smoker online because there is nobody out there talking about it there's nobody sharing this unbiased information because i mean up until me talking about my personal experience i was trying to be as unbiased as possible because nobody's really doing that nobody's really talking about it and i think that that makes sense because there's still a lot of fear around if you get labeled or tied to a certain image or stereotype that people will you know cancel you or hate you or whatever the internet likes to do nowadays but when we started living together i was able to actually learn a lot more about weed larissa is i i feel like she is just like she just knows and now she also works for a weed company in canada so she knows even more now like if i have any weed questions or anything like that i usually go to her and vice versa we enjoyed like it was again it was very much like a part two or a very reflective image of when i lived with maggie where weed wasn't something that was necessarily problematic but me and my best friend lived together and we would have the odd night i would say probably a little bit more than usual but that we would just smoke and dance around the kitchen and just hang out together and like get creative and talk about our dreams and our goals and and honestly work on our dreams and goals so it was very much like a productive slash consumption use but again it was more recreational it wasn't as much on the day-to-day and then you skip forward to now it's 20 20. i live alone again so larissa moved out about a year ago now kind of used it as like a okay i can start whatever type of habits i want only ever smoking joints and vapes and yeah and like the odd edible but i really don't mess with edibles because i don't like how hard they hit and how long they take and that is too much lack of control for me so i tend to i like to smoke mainly out of my vaporizer but i also do smoke uh joints as well i don't think i could handle bongs anymore if i'm being honest with you because it's been so long learning how to embrace my truth and not just believe what the vast majority of people believe because when you actually look at the facts of marijuana it's kind of hard to deny that if we're gonna feel okay about alcohol then we kind of have to feel okay about weed too or unless we're literally just ignoring the facts now that said i should make one last disclaimer before i go and that's the fact that i know that i talked very openly about weed today including my own experience and consumption and uses of marijuana and weed but i don't want to glamorize it either there are definitely people that just do not mix well with weed it's not for everybody at all and there have also been times where i have smoked too much and i've been in the wrong setting or i've been around the wrong people and it's activated my anxiety or activated my social anxiety or triggered a panic attack um i definitely want to put that out there because i don't want to just make it seem like wheat is cool and like you should smoke weed and get creative in things or like go on a spiritual journey because that's definitely a fun thing that you can do if you are over the age of 21 if you are in a place where read is legalized and that's an experience you want to introduce yourself to that said though i definitely don't want to make it seem like it's something that is like i don't i basically am just i don't want to encourage any kind any type of dependency on it and any type of glamorization or romanticization of the drug it is still a drug everything in moderation you wouldn't over drink caffeine because it would give you a heart attack you wouldn't over drink alcohol because you would literally get alcohol poisoning just like you don't want to over smoke or over intake thc or weed of any sort on a basis that is not balanced so there you guys have it i'm glad we've cracked the ice guys now i feel like i've gotten all of the facts and broken down all of the misconceptions about weed so now when we talk about it you know we can talk about all of the funny story times or just the different sides of weed if you guys have any questions if you have any further story times any further information you want me to talk about experiences you want me to talk about including the good and the bad definitely let me know and like i said i'm curious now that we've gotten through the entire chat what your guys's opinions are so definitely leave those down below i definitely know too that there can be people that have again either had bad experiences or know people that have had bad experiences so i definitely think that you know your opinion no matter what your opinion is it doesn't have to be good you're welcome to be as open-minded and as honest as possible but let's just try and keep the conversations um like buildable let's let's allow people to speak their mind without any sense of harsh judgments or criticisms so that we can make the conversations proactive you know and aside from that i love you guys all the way to proxima b and back and i will talk to all of you guys in the next coffee talk see you guys later", "-dHxOA0moCk": "YOURSELF YOURSELF LESSON YOURSELF LESSON AT YOURSELF LESSON AT THE YOURSELF LESSON AT THE HERB YOURSELF LESSON AT THE HERB\nSHOP.

It's your player partner\n2 Chainz checking in and this is \"The Most\nExpensivest: High Roller,\" and first I got my guy,\nthe comedian extrordinaire -- Hannibal Buress. Hannibal: What's up? \u266a\u266a And last but not least. The man that put\nthe 'G' in geek. We're talking about Tommy Chong,\nladies and gentlemen. \u266a\u266a Please, please, please. And we have\none common denominator. We enjoy\nthe fruits of our labor. -Yes. -If I must say so myself. We're going to\nhave a dish that is infused\nwith expensive marijuana, and hopefully\nwe don't pass out doing it. This is Zairilla Bacon. \u266a\u266a So tell us what's going on. What you got here? Right here we've got\nthat Z Juice, which is medicated Kool-Aid. -Okay. I've got the watermelon and this\nis my new flavor, peach mango. Each bottle is 100 milligrams. I make my own THC lean syrup. 100 milligrams, how would that\nhave you after you drink it? Well, everybody's\ntolerance is different. If you have a low tolerance, maybe about\na quarter of the bottle. A quarter of it? If you've got\na high tolerance, like myself, I just chug it.. -Yeah. -Yes, sir. Let me see you\nchug out off. -What? -You won't chug this. I wish I had my phone. -She didn't hesitate. -You ain't got your phone? -She didn't hesitate. She's going to chug\nthat mother fucker and it's got\n100 milligrams in it? Keep out of reach of children. That's some deep shit. She's going to be\ndifferent later. Oh, man. She's not even going\nto take a break. She's just -- All right. -I stay highly medicated. -Okay. Yeah. Highly medicated. This is\nthe mac and cheese. It's going to run you\nabout $500. You charge. Your shit high, shorty. Just a little \"turch\" of that. Not too much. Just a little \"turch.\" A \"turch.\" -Just a little \"turch.\" -Yeah. That's enough, that's enough. -Right on. This is my Zairilla's medicated\nchicken wings made with my Zeewee's\nfrom scratch BBQ sauce. In Chicago,\nwe call it Mouth Sauce. -Mouth sauce? Yeah. -That's right. So, we're going to eat this\nand get high? You want to try\nsome of this shit right here? Tommy, wake up. You want to try\nsome of this shit? [ Laughter ] -Already. Already. -Come back to earth. Come back here, man. -See that shit he's doing? -He's eating wings with --0 That's what you do\non a first date when you're trying\nto get some. Medicated wings,\nI'm very careful with. Oh, you've had\nthis before? I know what happens when you --\nwell you'll find out. Hannibal: This is going\nto get interesting. -So is the stuff in the sauce? -Yes, sir. -Also in my batter. -You hittin' it from both ways? -Yes, sir. -These are crispy. That's how\nit's supposed to be. -I like it. -What's that? -What's that there? -This is the asparagus. -The whole thing is? -It's reefer, too. -Every piece. -I use it in my\ninfused olive oil. Oh, it's in\nthe olive oil. You can't even taste\nthe reefer in it. That's the tricky part. -That's the best part about it. I love that, too,\nbut I think that's low down. I do. That's some low-down shit. You're making me\nwant to eat, man. It's a trick. This shit's tricky. You feeling anything? Well, you'll know\nwhen I'm feeling something because I'll panic\nabout the cameras, and run to my car\nand leave. [ Laughter ] When I run away from everybody\nscreaming it's like, \"Oh, yeah, I think\nthe asparagus got to him.\" Zairilla: That's usually\nabout $75 a pound. Really? So how much does\nthe Kool-Aid cost? -20 bucks. -20 bucks? -20 bucks for one thing. -For this thing right here? Yes, sir. She just drunk a $20\nright in your face. -After 20? -[ Laughs ] Yeah. You're looking at\nthis big platter of wings is normally about $1,500. -These wings about $1500? -$1500? -Yes, sir. -That's about 70 wings. So that's about, what, $7\nand some change? Wait, am I bad at math? -You're horrible. -Wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Oh, that's about $20 a wing. $20 and some change,\na wing. -A wing. -Holy shit. I just ate\na little $40. Those are\nexpensive wings, I see why Viceland\ndidn't pay me to come here. [ Laughter ] I think that shit's\nstarting to kick in. This is\n$20 and some change! Tell me what you think\nabout the food. I ate\n$60 worth of wings. Tommy, I'm talking to you. Tommy. -It was only three of them. Shit's good,\nain't it, Tommy? I love the greens. These, whatever these are. Asparagus makes\nyour pee stink. Is that true,\nor is that just just a myth and we went with it? It has an acidic base about it\nand when it mixes with a certain chemical\ninside your body, it lets off a certain scent\nas you urinate. \u266a\u266a What you got\nright there? Zairilla: So we got right here\nmedicated crab legs. Come on with it. Now these crabs normally\na pound go for $275 a pound. -For real? -Yes, sir. When these crabs were alive,\nthey didn't even know this would be\ntheir future. These crabs didn't know\nthey would get shot up with weed and get... -Full of weed, man. ...eaten on Viceland. I don't know how\nto open crab legs. I should've watched\nmore Rick Ross videos and I would know exactly what\nthe fuck I'm doing right now. We got some --\nNow we've got some -- Is that crawfish? No, baby, we got\nsome lobster tails. Oh, lobster, see, man,\nI don't know my seafoods. This mother fucker\nsaid crawfish. I thought it was just a big\nass crawfish with a God damn -- That's lobster, man! And one lobster right here\nis about $525. -This? -Man, hell no, shorty. For real. -$525. -This right here is $600? $525, you rounding. That was a big round up. -$500? -Very nice. Very tasty. $500 for a lobster tail. A small ass lobster tail,\nbut it got the dope in it. How much is in that? That one has\nabout 25 milligrams. Shorty,\nthis shit good, shorty. I feel myself\nbecoming different. -Can you feel it? -Yeah. Oh, yeah. Absolutely. I ain't going to lie, I think\nI'm feeling a little something. Do you feel pressure to wear\nmultiple chains all the time? Shut your high ass up. 2 Chainz. I think chicken and waffles\nis overrated, over-hyped\ncombination of food. So is your heart rate\ngoing up, as well or is it just\nyou're talking crazy? The chicken is Alvin. The waffle is the Chipmunks. How long have you\nbeen smoking, Tommy? Over 50 years. Have you ever been eating\nchicken and then like, \"Yo, I wish I had\nsome waffles with this shit.\" You back on this waffles. What's going on? I never left. I'm a real player when\nit comes to eating delicacies. I remember back\nwhen my chicken wings was between 30 cents\nand 50 cents. Now they're 20 bucks. -You know lamb chops. Since '71. When the Northridge\nearthquake hit. -And I'm eating, getting big. -Sea bass, halibut. And then\nthe earthquake hit. What's your favorite\n2 Chainz song? 2 Chainz. I was in a urinal,\nI took a piss, some of my pee splashed up\nhit me on my lip. Ruined\nmy mother fucking day. [ Laughs ] Gave you pee breath. All right, look. [ Applauding ] Thank you. Oh, wow. Thank you, guys. [ Cheers and applause ] Thank you. -Can I get a doggy bag? -Absolutely Yeah, we're about to\nget some take-home boxes. It's about that bacon. -Right on. -Bacon, bitch. -[ Laughs ] Thank you. Is it good marijuana? What up, what up. It's your player partner\n2 Chainz checking in and this is \"The Most\nExpensivest: High Roller. My boy, Adam, and my boy, John,\nwe're about to get into some real weed lingo\nand some real prices, y'all. Adam: All right, Chainz, we have\na few very special things for you to try, here. -All right, what you got man? I'm ready. Let's give this honey badger\na whirl. I want to show you\nhow this works. [ Roars ] John: It's got a ceramic tip\nas well as a bubbler. Its like a warm straw. It's essentially\na portable dab ring. Pretty cool. I think we should start\nwith the NBX King Louis, we've been waiting\nfor that. Now, what John is doing\nis he's actually mixing the King Louis\nconcentrate, it's sauce. All right, we're going to wait\nuntil that heats up and then you're going to hit\nthat nozzle. So what do I smoke,\nthe end right here? Yes, sir. As soon as\nI start touching, you're going to\nbreathe in, okay? There you go. \u266a\u266a [ Coughs lightly ] [ Coughing ] Pretty good,\nright there. \u266a\u266a Beautiful flavor profile. Nice and tasty. I'm gonna hit --\nI'm gonna hit it -- I'm --\nI'm gonna hit it -- Yeah. one more time. \u266a\u266a We've got to get it now,\nI like this. Welcome to the club,\nmate. All right. For real, how much\ndoes this stuff cost, man? So the honey badger itself\nis about $250 retail. The sauce itself roughly\nbetween $50 to $60. What makes it special\nis the high terpenes. They've probably got four\nor five different terpenes, like limonene,\nbeta-caryophyllene, myrcene. They're testing around\n13-15 milligrams per, as well as\nyour cannabinoids, so the cannabinoids,\nthe THC is testing probably around\nbetween 75-85%, so you're getting some really\namazing pure stuff there. Cool, so how much does\nsomething like this cost? [ Record scratches ] It's $250 retail. Should we try the buggy? This device here\nis our showpiece, though. Our friends over at Ziggy\nhave been kind enough to provide us this rig\nto be able to play with. Took 14 glassblowers\nseveral hundred hours of work. It's a $150,000 piece. They want\n$150,000 for that? -Yeah. -That's right. You think they would buy it\nand use it or just buy it and keep it\nas an art piece? Typically we wouldn't allow\nsomebody to smoke from this, but, obviously,\nthis is a special occasion. Let's load that up\nwith the King Louis and let's give him\nwhat he wants. Yes, sir.

So what made you come up\nwith that type of idea?

in the room and it's a pretty big elephant in many countries the smoking of cannabis is illegal but the state of play seems to be changing and in time the laws may well change however here we are talking about today beyond legality there is also the question of being fit and capable for work there are a good number of companies who require staff to take random drug tests what we wanted to do here is to simply inform you how long thc can linger in your system and how for some it can pass through more quickly than others we should also point out that thc can remain in your body for up to 30 days after you have ingested cannabis especially if eaten as opposed to smoked beyond this and this is where forensic science comes in your hair will contain traces of cannabis that will remain for at least 90 days if there is a possibility that a drug test will include hair follicles our advice is to keep away from cannabis for a long time thus unexpectedly shaving your head prior to a very critical and rigorous interview might just give the game away first thing to note is that because thc is a lipid soluble overweight individuals will retain thc in their system for longer than their thinner companions worse still if you smoke cannabis don't go for heavy exercise just prior to any urine test as when fat is broken down thc is released into your system and will come out in your urine however before you think that going for a run might also get you stoned on that thc the levels are detectable but minuscule and have no psychotropic effect tests for thc are actually for the metabolite thc cooh or tetrahydrocannabinol carboxylic acid though that's a bit of a mouthful you should also be aware that thc can build up in your system over time so regular users are more likely to retain thc in their system for longer than newbies who have a relatively pristine metabolism light use would be up to three times a week medium use would be up to five times a week and heavy use would be seven times a week and chronic heavy use would be frequently every day for a urine test and as a rule of thumb light users should see traces of thc disappear after three days but heavy users will need up to 30 days plus if you have to undergo a saliva test then allow 3 days if you are a light user 7 days for a medium user and 15 days for a heavy user but again up to 30 days or even more if you are a chronic heavy user for a blood test the rule is up to two days for it to remain in the bloodstream but thc has been found in blood tests 25 days after smoking cannabis so unfortunately there is no definitive answer we'd love to hear your thoughts on the matter and of course if you enjoyed this video do like and subscribe so you too can become a cannabis expert", "dbwjb94BBHo": "[Music] today I'm going to be talking to you about taking medicines sublingually this is done by putting a cannabis extract usually a tension under your tongue or rubbing it on your gums and letting it absorb there for a few minutes taking your medicine this way allows the extract to go straight into your bloodstream without passing through your stomach or your digestive tract now this is useful because it offers high bioavailability it has a longer effect at inhalation and is a really clean way to take medicine this intake method has a wide range of uses and it's a wonderful way to start your relationship with cannabis it's predictable and hasn't even killed onset and this can be really useful for a more subtle effect for instance when taken for general lifestyle enhancement here are some key things to keep in mind with sublingual intake products use sublingually come in the form of tinctures infusions or concentrates this method allows for extremely accurate doses tinctures are often measured by the drop and concentrates by weight and if you're using a concentrate we recommend that you use a high-quality digital scale as well because this will really help you with your accuracy it's really important to use clean safe medicine and be aware that not all cannabis extracts are created equally the concentration levels and the extract processes can vary quite a bit and as always we recommend lab tested as best as you can easily see what you're getting now the onset time with sublingual in takers generally between ten and thirty minutes and depending on your goals we suggest starting with a minimal dose and if more is wanted or needed you can easily increase in a really short period of time now if taking a THC dominant cannabis oil there is likely to be some cycle activity you may like to go back and revisit the introduction to cannabis intake methods video in which we shared some typical effects of psycho activity tinctures are typically dissolved in either olive oil coconut oil or alcohol we like the oil versions because cannabis interacts really well with fats and they also tend to be a little bit more pleasant to take as well in terms of taste today we have some examples of tinctures infused oils and concentrates to show you and they're going to demonstrate how to measure your dose and take each of them sublingually so let's get acquainted with products that can be used for sublingual use now remember sublingual use is when you put a product under your tongue or on your gums and inner cheek so that it can be absorbed into your body now today I'm going to show you concentrates as well as liquids or tinctures that can be used for something we'll use before I get into those specifically I want to make a point really with sublingual use and with any of these products you know the form of the product whether it's a concentrate that hasn't been dead looted into any other substance or a tincture for example that has been diluted into something like alcohol olive oil or coconut oil but remember no matter the form of the product you don't necessarily know by looking at it how concentrated it is you can dose it but without knowing the concentration of cannabis within that specific product you won't know exactly how many milligrams you're taking so it's a little bit of what we're gonna get into today now concentrates obviously from their name are one of the most potent purest form of cannabis usually this is a pure form of cannabis that has been extracted from the plant either from bud from shake or any other forms of the plant itself now given that how highly concentrated the medicine is you really want to be careful with it and be able to measure it one way to do that is through the syringe where it has actual measurements but the other tool you want to use is a digital scale so that you know exactly how concentrated the medicine is inside as well as the exact weight that you're getting when you take when you actually put it in your body and those two combinations of pieces of information really tell you what dose you're taking and that way you can track what dose measure its effects and then dose effectively going forward now a great way to do this for concentrates is to use a piece of a rice paper now rice paper paper because it's edible and it dissolves in your mouth and that way you can actually get to concentrate on the scale put it onto the rice paper weigh it know what you're taking and then simply put it into your mouth under your tongue and let it dissolve there that way it's not messy rice paper is also great if you want to just measure your medicine once maybe put it in the fridge or the freezer and then take it later you can have those doses for yourself ready for at a later date so that you don't have to create as much of a mess these products can be a little bit hard to deal with they're a little bit of molasses II as you can see from the color of this all right so constantly it's very effective usually they're used for much more severe conditions when you're trying to get much higher dose of medicine into your body let's move on to liquids or sometimes called tinctures now these can be infused into a number of liquids as I mentioned that you're usually alcohol or oils which can be usually coconut oil or olive oil what happens with this process is the medicine is extracted through various methods there's co2 there's butane there's other alcohol extracts and then that concentrate is then infused back into an oil or they leave a little bit of the alcohol and put it back into alcohol that way diluting the medicine a little bit to be able to take and be taken in liquid form when taking it's pretty intuitive it's nice because you can dose the medicine very effectively with the dropper now ideally your dropper has some type of measuring mechanism on it so you know exactly the milliliters that you're taking and can dose that again you really want to know how concentrated you dis medicine is it could have for example one corner oil and a lot of medicine that's a very concentrated tincture it could have you know 95% oil and 5% medicine those are very different products very different medicines depending on the dose okay so pay attention to that know from your labels and from your medicine providers how concentrated that medicine is now when taking medicine simply put it on your tongue as mentioned let it absorb there and that's how you can take a sublingual tincture all in all sublingual medicine is a great way to take medicine get it into your body effectively with high bioavailability remember the points that we touched on it's really important to know how concentrated your medicine is and it's important to measure it effectively to be able to track", "mPfFk3qu8Qo": "Tripp keber is making a big bet on the legalization of marijuana his company produces cannabis infused edibles but I have PhD food scientists I have

something new coming out almost every day it seems like today i'm going to be discussing something that is almost brand new to the cannabis market i don't even think there is any products that currently have this that are available yet you guys want to know what it is stick around and i'm going to be going into it right now [Music] [Music] me [Music] what's going on everybody my name is inya welcome or welcome back every week i go beyond the bud talking about all things cannabis this week i'm talking about delta 10 thc yes i am talking about another thc compound if you've watched any of my other videos and i've discussed what delta eight th she is delta 90 she and now i'm going to talk to you guys about what delta 10 th she is it's so new that i literally just found out about this and as soon as i heard about it i was like i have to make a video and i gotta tell you guys so for the first and most obvious question what is delta 10 thc delta 10 is one of hundreds of compounds found within hemp and cannabis think about delta 10 dhg it only appears in such trace amounts cannot be extracted naturally though it is a artificial cannabinoid because it's found in such small amounts even some labs have even had trouble identifying it they've misidentified it as cbdc or cbl i believe it is important to note that because this is such a new cannabinoid or compound to the industry there is still so much research that needs to be done on it delta 10 thc likely interacts with our endocannabinoid system much like delta 9 thc and delta 10 thc according to david from private label hemp lab delta 10 can absolutely get you high delta 10 has a lot lower psychotropic potency it's kind of more like delta eight in that sense but it's going to be different than delta eight david from private label hemp lab describes it as delta 8 thc being more of an indica type of high where delta 10 thc is more of actually a sativa type of high which i found that really interesting because i did not know that previously the effects that delta 10 thc may offer this could be different for everybody there is no products yet out there really for me to try so i don't know this is just going based off some articles that i read but once i get my hands on some products i definitely will come back and do a full review on that but the effects that delta 10 thc may offer increased euphoria and focus without having the negative side effects like paranoia and anxiety another important fact to mention when you are going to be looking for any type of cannabis products whether that be hemp cbd also 8 delta 9 delta 10 always look for a coa or certificate of analysis just to make sure that everything has been tested because these things are so new it is really important to know what's going into your body delta refers to the double bond so delta nine thc is gonna fall on the ninth carbon delta eight is gonna fall on the eighth carbon and delta ten is gonna fall on the tenth carbon chain what does the future of delta 10 thc look like i mean if you have been following along with delta 8 thc then you know that it's completely blown up within really a matter of months i feel like the thing with cbd cbd blew up and it's just been on the rise i think the same thing is going to happen with delta 10 it is such a new thing and i think that it's going to be more available it's going to be legal so more people are going to have access to it it does get you high it does have some benefits so i do think it's gonna grow super super quickly it's i mean i predict it's just gonna take off like crazy once products get released there are a few brands and companies that are currently in the process of producing delta 10 products and they should be available in the upcoming weeks so i'm super excited to hopefully get my hands on some products to come back and do a review for you guys products that you can expect to hit the market are going to be very similar to delta 8 and delta 19 thc products you will probably be able to find edibles vapes being disposable or just a regular vape pictures and syringes shatters concentrates and then you may even be able to find some type of flower but the flower is going to be sprayed with delta 28 shape that's something that's really interesting because this is so new and this is an artificial cannabinoid it's just an interesting door that we're opening i guess so we are the guinea pigs of this new cannabis world and lastly who is delta 10 thc gonna be made for like i said because i'm trying it i don't know exactly what the effects are what to expect but i do believe it's going to be really beneficial for people that live in states where you can't legally buy delta 9 thc maybe cbd isn't enough this is going to be something that's really beneficial because it's going to be able to take the edge off when cbd can't they are technically legal and making it in compliance with federal regulations another thc compound how crazy you guys super exciting though hope you guys enjoyed this video ask me all the questions let me know when if you guys have tried delta 10 products once i get my hands on some i'm gonna come back and make a video so stay tuned for that make sure to subscribe give this video a thumbs up if you enjoyed and turn on the little bell if you guys don't

THE LEGISLATIVE SESSION ENDS ON SATURDAY AT NOON. MEANWHILE -- AFTER A FEW CHANGES IN THE SENATE...", "WGS5bSNAqcQ": "- My name's Leah Campbell, and I'm a 36 year old\nwriter and single mom. I microdose marijuana to\ntreat pain and anxiety, and I have no problem admitting\nthat makes me a better mom. I do want to preface this by saying that I'm not a medical doctor. I'm not in a position\nto advise anyone else on how medicinal marijuana may help them or make their lives better. I can only talk about\nmy personal experiences. I have stage four endometriosis, which is a chronic pain condition. It started about 10 years ago. I've had five major abdominal surgeries. Pain has been kind of a constant in my life for the last decade. As a single mom to a six\nyear old, that's hard, especially when my period\nhits and I'm stuck in bed. - Hello.\n(laughing) - What's your name? - Josie. - Josie, who are you? Are you my daughter? - Mm-hm, mm-hm, mm-hm. - Are you my best bud? I was not the person anyone\nwould have ever expected to be advocating for\nmedicinal marijuana use. I grew up in a family of police officers. My father was a narcotics officer for many, many years of my childhood. My whole life I've heard\nthat drugs are bad. I was 25 years old before I\ntried it for the first time and honestly, I hated it. Smoking marijuana made\nme wanna sit in a corner and not talk to anyone, which isn't a great thing for an introvert who already kind of is drawn that way. And I was pretty sure marijuana\nwould never be for me. So when a friend suggested\nI try microdosing, I was pretty against it, but I happened to be\nvisiting her in Seattle for another friend's wedding\nwhen my period started. And it kind of seemed like my period was about to ruin what should\nhave been a really fun time with people I cared about. So we went to a pot shop, and we discussed all the options and I bought a couple of mints that came in really low doses, and I followed the instructions\nof the employee there, to basically do no more than about two milligrams\nevery one to two hours. For most people getting high\non a medicinal marijuana edible would take five to 10 milligrams. So I was taking much smaller doses. I found that it really did\ntake the edge off the pain, especially the cumulative effect. So it didn't necessarily\nkick in right away after the first pill, but as I continued going\nthroughout the day, I was able to be more and more functional without really being high. And that was the key point to me, was that something was\ntaking the pain away without taking me out of commission. When I got home to Alaska,\nI started experimenting with marijuana more and more, and I kinda found that my ideal dose is about 1.5 milligrams,\nagain, every one to two hours depending on how bad my pain is. But another benefit came out as well, and that was that I started to realize the anxiety I've dealt with my entire life was leveling off on the days\nthat I was microdosing as well. And that was huge. You know, as much as pain\ncan knock me out of my life, anxiety can as well. If I'm having a high stress day or I'm just not in the right head space, I have a hard time working. I have a hard time being\nthe friend I wanna be, the mom I wanna be. What is that? - My tooth fell out.\n- Yeah. - [Leah] Can I see your mouth? Did it hurt very bad or\njust a little bit bad? - Just a little. - [Leah] You pretty brave? - Yeah. - So for me a bad pain day\noften means being stuck in bed, which is hard as a single\nmom to a six year old who wants to be going\nout and doing things. It's not really fair to her either. She can sit in bed with me\nall day and watch movies, but why should she have to? I do a lot of things to manage my pain. Marijuana is really just one tool in a great big bucket of tools I have. But in terms of pain\nmanagement in the moment, microdosing helps me, not\nmore than anything else, because honestly, prescription\npain killers I've been given knock out the pain better, but marijuana helps to\ntake the edge off the pain while still allowing me to be functional, whereas the prescription\npain killers I've been given knock me out too and, as a mom, that's not an acceptable solution. So these are some of the products I use. These are really small mints, and the thing I like about these is they come in the small doses I prefer. It's like 1.6 milligrams a mint, which is usually my preferred dosage. So this is my favorite product. I also buy chocolate bars. These chocolate bars come in 5\nmilligram dosages per square. The thing I like about this is I can get even smaller doses if I want, just because I can take a small bite and I could break one of these squares up into five or six pieces if I wanted. All of these are kept in my freezer, in a special box that my kiddo\nknows is mommy's medicine. We've talked about it\nand discussed the fact that these look like candy,\nbut that they're not. Hey Josie. Oh, did you just wake up? Thank you for joining\nus, little sleepy head. (laughing) Can I ask you a question? What are these things? - Mommy medicine. - And are you ever supposed\nto touch any of this? No, how come? - Because.\n- Cause it's not for kids? Love you.\n(lips smacking) I think at the end of the day, we're all kind of just trying to survive and that may be especially\ntrue for those of us with chronic pain conditions or mental health struggles. We just wanna be the best\nversions of ourselves. For me, microdosing helps me to be the best version of myself. After years of trying\njust about every solution and every option available, it's one of the best that I've found, and like I said before, it's just one tool in my toolbox, but yeah,\nit makes me a better mom because it helps me to get\nout of bed in the morning when I'm having a bad pain day, and it helps me to clear my head when my anxiety is spinning me out. It gives my child the version\nof me that she deserves, a mom who is functional and happy and able to get through the day. I think a lot of people take for granted that not everybody has that\nwithout the additional help. Whether I were taking a\nprescription medication or this medication that I'm\nable to buy at the store, shouldn't matter. It's something that helps. It's something that gives me\nthe version of me I wanna be. It allows me to have relief and it gives my daughter\nthe mom she deserves.

show that marijuana can increase the natural levels of melatonin in our body not to mention that this combination of marijuana is soothing sedative effects and melatonin is ability to regulates the sleep cycle can work well together so when taken together the effectivity of both marijuana and melatonin to induce sleep is boosted when problem encountered by marijuana users is a lack of dreams to dat CHCs effect that reduces REM asleep the stage where we dream the most and increases deep and REM sleep but dreaming and REM sleep is essential for the body for these help and exercising the brain refreshing memories and keeping the immune system healthy taking melatonin alongside marijuana produces more vivid dreams which can counter the said problem caused by THC taking them together and makes them more effective but is it safe generally THC and melatonin together is safe unless you consume too much research suggests that THC can regulate melatonin levels in the body and two possible ways by their stimulating or inhibiting it THC tends to increase the amount of melatonin in the body drastically when the body's melatonin level is just average however it's the opposite when the body's base melatonin level is already high with that being said the effects of THC with melatonin effectiveness may vary depending on the situation this is why when using marijuana and melatonin together the cannabis indica is more advisable because as a lower THC so what about CBD oil can you take that with melatonin yes you can there are even supplements that have both CBD oil and melatonin as an ingredient these two can work together to help you sleep better CBD or kena boyle is a non psychoactive can avoid known for its ability to promote relaxation and to reduce anxiety while melatonin is a natural chemical that regulates the sleep and wake cycles so can melatonin get you high no it's very unlikely to get you high melatonin is a hormone that's naturally produced by the pineal gland to manage the body's circadian rhythm what it mainly does is signals the body when to sleep and when to wake up it is also discovered to be an antioxidant and as to have an anti-inflammatory effect but it has never been proven to make you high next let's cover the benefits and drawbacks of melatonin and weed first the melatonin pros melatonin has a lower risk of developing side effects it's not how about forming and it's safe for both long-term and short-term use it's also available over-the-counter in most parts of the world and in different preparations the cons of melatonin are that it's not as effective for sleep marijuana pros include a higher effectivity in general but its effects may vary depending on the manufacturer and the strain it's available in different preparations as well marijuana cons include that it's not safe for long-term use it's illegal in most places as a higher chance of developing side effects and it's habit-forming and has a higher risk of developing drug dependency at the end of the day it depends on your preference and your condition marijuana with a high THC when or high CBD might be your best choice if you're looking for an effective set it - if you're having trouble sleeping due to pain stress or anxiety you would want a marijuana product with a high CBD level however if you're looking for a supplement to help regulate your sleeping pattern you'll want to take melatonin instead in conclusion yes you sure can take weed a melatonin together as long as you can have a full night of sleep so what about alcohol can you take melatonin with beer wine and other alcoholic beverages we actually just made a video about that which I'll put at the end of the description so you can check it out we also have a video

boy chronic i don't know how much of this you guys are going to be able to see in my face i'm going to try to angle it just right um it's your boy chronic we're back with another how-to so this time we are doing dry ice hash so as you can see i have dry ice in here um i've got my trim this is just just all the excess trim that was uh from hera so this is jack herrera trim we're going to be using one of the this is the 220 micron bag i have a set of bubble bags that i use and basically what i do is i go ahead and make sure all of this is in here and it doesn't slide out i make sure that i've got it all in this container sitting on this dry ice make sure it's uh really getting cold and then from here i go ahead and i give this a nice tie and now there are easier setups this is just my setup this is what works for me um you know this is just how i do it it's easiest for me you guys will see here in a second now another important thing i'm going to bring you guys over here hopefully you guys see this is this collection tray you definitely want a collection tray of some sort that's like a stainless steel or medical grade stainless steel or something uh you can collect with and uh the last thing you'll need is hey would you be able to grab me one of my business cards can you have a second okay last thing you'll need is a card to collect with i use a business card uh they're clean it's easy so let's uh start the process so basically i'm gonna scoot over towards you guys bring you guys a little bit closer and angle this down hopefully that stays there basically you just uh flip this over as you can see i mean all of that already and you wow and you basically just shake it up you just give it some tumbles thank you sweetheart business card keep it close to the tray uh basically guys you're gonna do this dry ice hash sifting for about 30 to 45 seconds maybe a minute until the color starts to change once the color starts to change that's when you're going to go ahead and collect you know do your first collection move it off and then do your second collection um basically as uh wow there's so much here as there as a it collects and breaks down with this dry ice more plant matter is going to come out so it's going to be more uncured so i usually do about 30 seconds um to 45 seconds minute tops for my first run because this is all trim and i know a lot of this is actually pretty quality i'm gonna go ahead and just do a minute so we're going to keep shaking just for a little bit longer i'm going to do my first collection and show you guys what we got so i generally also go based on the color tone so i am not only watching uh or counting in my head just like you know how i i am at i'm watching the color of the hash that's actually coming out so we're gonna go ahead and stop so i generally set this off to the side just like that take our collection card and we start collecting and we just have mounds and mounds and bounds of hash so this is uh the way to collect dry dry ice hatch guys so you're gonna watch me a few more times basically uh do this and i'm gonna do the rest with uh the rest of hera and i'll come back after i uh you know you guys will see the time lapse and everything of that but this is basically the general concept um 30 to 45 second intervals one minute max you really want to watch your color color is everything your nice golden tones are where you want to be sitting for your first run your your mid golden tones with a little green is where you want to be sitting your second run more green towards your third and fourth runs fairly green on your fifth and sixth run uh the seventh run i usually just don't even do i put the the material uh to use by doing edibles or putting it in my magic butter machine so that's how i make use of the last little bit of material that has trichomes on it so there's that so that is what we just collected um we're going to go ahead and do a second run don't do that guys do not do that barely got any out so we're going to scoot this over generally i don't like mixing these so i do actually press these separately these are my different press runs they all taste different they all have different quality for sure i press at about 190 degrees to 200 degrees for about 100 seconds and uh right now i'm using 90 micron i usually do 35 micron for hash but i have to use what i have to use uh so yeah that's what i'm using you guys will see that in the next video this one's just going to be uh the dry ice hash extraction so we're going to go for round two and it's looking mighty golden and nice still so that's a good sign lots and lots and lots and lots of heat so guys another key thing um you want to freeze your product before you actually use it this trim has been sitting in the freezer since i actually trimmed her um it was dried and cured everything was dried in here not cured sorry everything was dry so it was all dry product proper humidity um i didn't trap any moisture any unwanted anything unwanted but i definitely uh i definitely froze on my product the next bit of run we're going to be using is actually sitting in the freezer now i always suggest freezing it um you know the colder the bud the easier the trichomes are going to fall off you don't want to make it too too cold um you know you don't want to keep in the freezer for prolonged periods of time you can damage the trichomes you know a lot of people think crypto freezing is actually like really good to store your butt there's actually studies that show it it reduces the potency over time so you know there's generally if i'm gonna process um right away you know within that first three to five days i will go ahead and put my stuff straight to the freezer from um you know trimming however if i'm not going to process i go ahead and cure my bud or cure whatever i want to cure and um once it's you know cured i'm ready the day before i'll throw it in the freezer you know that way it has 24 hours to sit so we're gonna go ahead and stop this is gonna be our second collection i'm gonna kind of scoot it away from this edge here so i can set this down man just loads and loads and loads of thc guys just insane set that down right there you know what i actually have a tool for this let me grab it i don't even know why i'm not using it alrighty so now that i got my actual scraper that uh is designated for this because i'm a dingus i forgot i had it um oh my god look how easy that is the card was i was struggling with the card all right guys so there's our second run looking nice and uh pretty still gold still fairly golden brown golden still fairly tan like a sandy color with a little bit of green that's what i want so we're gonna go for our third one here in a second and i'll show you guys what it looks like and then i'm gonna get to doing uh more more dry sift hash here's the third one we're gonna same thing 30 to 45 seconds maybe a minute max looks like at this point it actually is coming to a halt on how much is in there so yep this will be the last run that i do for the trim and i'm going to trim with the used rest all righty she's getting pretty green so it's a good sign that more material is coming out than actual trichomes so we're going to go ahead and call that the last run for the trim and i'll go get actual hair bugs next which you guys will see some time lapse footage of so what the hell little fuzzies came falling down alrighty so then from here i take this out there's going to be dry ice in here and i'm going to want to as quick as possible get this stuff out guys don't touch dry ice with your bare hands it's bad it can hurt you but uh basically i take all the dry ice out because it's not done it's definitely still good all right guys we're back all right so i got my little collections and i need a sharpie alrighty so here's what i do here's third run of anything so all my third ones are going to go into this one this is how i stay organized keep myself clean and not contaminate my product it's important guys if you're going to do your own stuff at home damn it shut some of these lids don't shut whatever that's good enough um okay we're gonna be pressing today i don't give a [ __ ] about these lids so there's three there's two [Music] uh all right then let's take our product so we take the excess stuff that we did we're going to be using for the edibles go ahead and dump it all perfect so here it was seeded out so i'm just going through here and picking out any uh last seeds i see and we'll find they're healthy because you know here s ones are always awesome alrighty let me show you the last little bit of this before i go uh ocd picking through here with seeds which i'll be doing before i uh probably sift it before i put it in the stuff that's amazing so i'll show you how to prep this if when it's not already prepped and then that'll be the video guys so uh with product you definitely want to take it all off the stem so make sure that you take all the stems out um break your product up that works as well as just like you know chunking it off it is going to get broken up but i prefer to not have stem in my uh dry sift just makes it easier that again guys over top shake shake shake and you know what's up i want to say thanks for tuning in uh be sure to like comment and subscribe uh check out

be going over the math on how to actually figure out how much thc how much thc or cbd is in your oil how potent it is um a lot of questions i know in the last video i posted honest let me be real with you guys really quickly i posted that video thinking maybe if i got lucky like 15 people would see it so it wasn't my best work just gonna put out there it was my best work a lot of you guys have not seen the video i got a lot of comments on it a lot of questions all the concerns mostly great comments so thank you guys for keeping it positive i appreciate that let me preface this by saying i'm not an expert i don't know all the answers i'm just a girl making cannabis oil in our kitchen just like a lot of you guys i do know a little bit of math on how to figure that out i know in the last video i said i was going to give you the math and i kind of tried to in the comments but you know it's easier to just see it done so that's what we're going to do today we're going to visually walk through this when i have my levo machine now levo corrected me that's how you pronounce it levo my level machine is sitting here i made a new batch of oil so we're going to be doing the math on this particular batch what i have in here essentially is a cup of coconut oil i infused five grams of cannabis into this oil it's very concentrated very dark in color i don't know the exact percentage of the flour i was using so i'm gonna just ballpark it in like the 15 range just because that's pretty average for cannabis so let's say it's 15 it's always good to also overshoot it a little bit especially if you're dealing with thc just so you don't really overdo that and then obviously you can trial and error the amount of milligrams on your own personal body to see where you're at before we continue to go make sure you subscribe to my channel thank you for liking this video and watching well thank you for liking it if you like it please like it thanks for watching and keep watching if you want to know how to decode and figure out how much thc or cbd you're actually consuming when you make your own oil let's freaking go y'all okay everybody so what i have here is my piece of paper a pen and then my phone over here is my calculator and let's just freaking go into this thing oh and hello let's just like take a moment and just look at the beauty look at her oh look at her so to start things out i'm gonna write down the amount of oil that i used so up here i'm gonna write one cup um of oil the amount of cannabis that i use which was five grams grams of cannabis canna and those are the two numbers i'm going to start with if you'd like to convert your grams to milligrams one gram equals a thousand milligrams you can write that on the side one gram equals one thousand milligrams that's just for further conversion um and if you want to find out like per tablespoon you can also convert that i don't know off the top of my head so i'm just going to keep going so from here i have my one cup of oil and my five grams of cannabis oh and i know that this is 15 let's say it's thc for the fun of it 15 thc if you're using a hemp flour you do the 15 or 20 or whatever percent of that in cbd is those are the numbers you need to start with those three numbers right there you have three numbers your amount of oil you're infusing the amount of cannabis that you're using in the percent of whether it's thc or cbd they're using into that oil to do that i multiply my five grams of cannabis times my .15 so because if you convert you move the percentage over two decimals and that converts it to the percent or to the decimal rather and that would equal because i can't do math five times point one five equals point seven five so zero point 0.75 grams of this whole 5 grams is actually my thc that's present in my cannabis so from here in my whole cup one cup of oil i'm now once i'm done infusing going to have 0.75 grams of thc so .75 grams of thc into my oil i want to convert this grams into milligrams so in order to do that i just cross multiply so i have my one gram at top per 1000 milligrams i cross multiply you get rid of the grams and so per one cup of oil i actually have and then i multiply these 0.75 times 1 000 i have 750 milligrams of thc so in this entire little guy right here because it's a full cup there is 750 milligrams of thc in here okay so if i want to know let's see i'm using this for baking per tablespoon let's say now i would just convert this into tablespoons so let me look up really quickly what how many tablespoons are a cup cup two tablespoon so there's one cup so let's write it up here in our conversions one cup equals 16 tablespoons so that's another conversion you should know one cup of oil equals 16 tablespoons i can again cross multiply cups to cups and then there's 750 milligrams of thc per i mean this was a long way around just like honestly just switching out the numbers but just so you guys are more visual with it 750 per 16 tablespoons and then i want to find out how much per one tablespoon one tablespoon at the top and we don't know this answer we don't know this answer that's what we're trying to figure out and then you have 750 milligrams per 16 tablespoons pretty much you want to make sure these are always on opposite opposite sides of the line so that when you cross multiply you can actually just um cross it out and that what's that's how you get your numbers i don't know i took math a long time ago this is just what makes the most sense to me hopefully i'm explaining it in a way that makes sense to y'all uh unfortunately i don't know if i am 750 oop 750 why can't i do this pretty much all you need to do is take 750 and divide it by 16 and that'll give you how much thc per one tablespoon so we're trying to figure out this number right here so 750 oh my god divided by 16. so there's actually 46 milligrams of thc in a tablespoon you can also further convert this and you know figure out if you're using a cup in like let's say your entire cup in a recipe and it makes eight slices then you can really go in deep and figure out how much cbd thc whatever is in your slice but other than that that's really the math um screenshot this i hope it makes sense to you guys i mean i made a video about it so again it's just a lot of cross multiplying a little bit of conversions with this up here and then really it's just this percent of whatever you're find trying to find th c cbd whatever it may be and making sure you just take that into account in your total amount of cannabis cool y'all and that's it i hope that that was really helpful if it wasn't if i confused you more i sincerely apologize i am not a mathematician i took math a long time ago i'm just trying to use what i learned in essentially middle school and applying it here but hopefully that explains things a little bit more if you like this video again please make sure to give it a thumbs up a like um if you didn't like this video whatever not sorry about it it is what it is you know i'm just trying to hear live life and make my freaking cannabis oily people so if you would like me to make something with this cannabis oil let me know in the comments below what you think i should make with it i tend to like to bake healthier things like paleo cakes and dairy free items and gluten free items that's kind of the stuff that i personally eat if you don't eat that stuff that's no big deal i literally do not care but also just let me know in the comments what you want me to make with this stuff because i'm planning on making oh actually i know exactly my sister's birthday is coming up if you're watching this in the very very very future it's already happened but maybe i'm gonna make her a birthday cake with it hope you guys enjoyed also levo thank you so much for providing me with this item if you guys haven't got yours all ready i'm obsessed with it i love using it it does make your place smell a little bit like cannabis but honestly in my opinion not as bad as like doing it in the stove top or in your own oven and it's freaking easy cleanup i just love how easy it is you can download an app you can control all the temperatures from your phone it's literally the best so if you're going to make the investment i highly suggest doing so if you want to buy one for yourself i'm going to link them down below so you can go purchase one i do not have a discount code just yet levo if you see this if you are watching i would love a discount code to give to my people

for a number of years now but today they are launching their new AeroPro it's a new vaporizer that actually connects with these specific pods right here to be able to give their users more specific precise information test results on the CBD content the THC etc in the strains that they're smoking not only does it give you more transparency in the information but it also lets you personalize how you take hits so right here you can see that you actually get to personalize how hot you want to smoke a given strain and also you get to choose how many doses you want to take for every inhale not only does it give you full transparency on the test results on the strains that you're smoking but it also lets you personalize how you smoke it straight so that app actually stores your preferences for each strain so maybe one you want to burn hotter and one you want to just sip on over time right and basically by storing that information and sort of adapting over time to how you smoke you gain sort of a more personalized experience to you're smoking houses right and the arrow Pro actually provides haptic feedback so when you inhale you get a certain amount a certain dosage and if you inhale hard or soft it actually still tries to give you a sort of adapt it tries to give you about the same amount and it actually vibrates it gives me kind of haptic feedback when you finish the dose so it's kind of a cool contraption here it adds it a lot of transparency a lot of smarts it's really cool to see this shift over time where they're adding so many smart and so much transparency to this

Almost immediately, I\nhad really bad cramps, where it feels like someone is punching you in the uterus. - Like a lot of girls,\nbefore I ever had sex, or thought about having\nsex, I was on birth control for my period cramps. - I just take Motrin, 10, 12 pills. That's what it takes to relieve the pain. - The things we have in our\nmedicine cabinets are dangerous, and we don't think of them as drugs, but they're drugs. I'm really excited to see what... - How does it work from the inside. That's what I imagine, of\nlike, it's in and then whoosh! - The thing about Foria that's so cool is that this, you know,\nprevents the need for higher-level narcotic prescription drugs, which then leads to higher\nincidence of addiction. This is not a weed tampon, it is a cannabis-based product in the form of a suppository that dissolves with the heat of your body. This isn't a quick fix, but it works. - It is not what I expected. Probably super gentle to put in, right? It's cocoa butter. What could go wrong? - Just tried to put my suppository in. It broke. So I put half of it in, and then I just put a tampon in with it, to like stick it all the way up. - Suppository is in, TMI. - As a fibromialgia\npatient, I feel like nothing relaxes my muscles like THC and CBD, so I'm excited. - Talking to my patients,\ntheir biggest concern is how am I gonna work? How am I gonna, you know,\ntake care of my kids? And that's what's so cool about the Foria is that you do not get high. - It's been a couple hours. I don't feel stoned. I don't feel numb. - It's been almost five\nhours since I did it. I'm juts feeling relaxed\nand tired, but not high. - I'm debating if I should\nput the other half in. I don't know how to get the other half in. - I don't even feel that\ndull, throbbing pain, like when you take\nsomething and it takes that top level pain away, but that bottom level pain still remains. I don't feel that at all. - You know, it kind of\nfeels like I took an Advil. - We did it. - We did it, wow. - Well, maybe some of us did it. - I do have a confession to make. I didn't put the other half in there. I ate it. Woo, you guys, don't do it. They're not for eating. They're really, really, really strong. - So, I followed the rules. I had no issues. I was clear-headed, and I\nthink if you're a mother, and you're worried about maybe trying it, but you do suffer from cramps, I think go for it. - I think that this is an awesome product. I think that we should be able to study the effects of THC on all\ndifferent parts of our body. So the fact that someone\nhas been innovative and is using it for women's health, I think is super cool. - I'm always down to try new\nthings to help with pain. I'm really excited that\nsomebody thought about this, and cared enough to invent it, to try to help women\nhave less menstrual pain. - Half of it up the hoo-ha is definitely not gonna F you up. So start small. (laughing)", "dQ-W7pG8EG0": "these treats is your edibles company it's available in Medical dispensaries throughout Colorado right now one thing that I found particularly interesting when we were talking before today is that every edible you make is meant to be digested sublingually and I know there's a lot of different theories about digesting edibles sublingually or you know different baked goods that are you know simply swallowed but I want to know why this particularly this particular method of ingestion is important to you and why you've made all of your products so they can be ingested sublingually um while I was in college I started playing around if edibles that's how I started cooking so around the time that I got diagnosed with glaucoma and I started out with rice krispies treats and stuff like that a lot of different stuff with cannabutter and I did eventually grow into making lollipops and the lollipops I make are actually with an ethanol alcohol extraction and it's very clean so you can't you can't really taste a concentrate and they taste so good that you can really suck on them and it'll get into your mouth and you can feel it faster in fact I tell patients you know if you really need a hard medication right now just suck on this the next 20 minutes when you feel the medication is hit you enough you can put it away and use that for another dosage if it's a lollipop right so that's kind of where I started with sublingual thing was the lollipops from there I did start making marijuana infused honey which I infused with only buds so it's very clean very tasty we do use Colorado local honey so that by itself is just ingested very easily since it's it's pretty digested it gets in your system easily it's very easy for your system to take in so that helps with the marijuana affecting the patient faster and so I get the impression that's where you're going with this sublingual conversation right that it does hit a user a patient faster than something maybe they're chewing and digesting through the stomach it definitely we know for sure or is it do we just know that anecdote I don't know it for sure I know it based on my own experiences and with edibles when I was having high pressure in my eye I could feel it obviously and I needed something to try to take that edge off as soon as possible I think a lot of patients do you know you're having a backache right now you don't want to Chomp something down in your stomach that you know eventually in a half an hour your seventh can break down the contents - I know with a lot of the edible stuff going on they're saying that you should wait up to an hour or two before taking any more you know patients are just trying to get that relief as soon as possible so it was important to me to try to create products that they could take and feel that relief even faster it's an interesting conversation because of course you know after legalization comes normalization and now we're in this realm of commercialization and and and with that comes all types of new products whether we're talking about honey sticks or I know there are a couple of products on the market right now in the edibles market that are fast-acting you know they come in the little energy shot sighs you know 5-hour energy sighs a container and and they claim that it's a faster hitting edible than you know a brownie in the traditional pot cookie or whatever it might be so and I'm sure patients experiment with it and kind of see what works best for them ultimately but that's just trying to give them a great product that's potent that they can medicate with it'll get them that relief as soon as possible it's always been my goal because as a patient that was always my goal with marijuana in general", "4N2nhPj4aok": "[Music] here's how to use forea and power before you start take a few deep breaths to wake up your lungs micro dosing is much more effective when you're relaxed and prepared for a new state of mind using foria and power is easy there's no button just inhale start with a short puff about one second long there's no need to inhale fast or strong just a smooth easy breath exhale and enjoy the flavor you should see some vapor a three-second inhale is about four milligrams of CBD one milligram of THC it's a very gentle micro dose the longer you inhale the hotter the vapor and the stronger the dose so if you cough or anything just take a shorter puff if this is your first time wait a minute or two to see how you feel before you take another tip [Music] you", "Wom274mH27Q": "hi guys welcome to and dhoka my name is Demi and today we're gonna be talking about the cannabinoids cbn so there's a lot of chat about cannabinoids in general obviously THC is the most famous one then you have CBD and now there's acid precursors that are coming into the mix but what about cbn what do we know so far about cbn well essentially you're not going to find cbn in a raw natural plant essentially cbn comes from degradation of THC the process starts when th sees exposed oxygenation and UV light exposure essentially you're not going to find any cbn in young cannabis plants that are yet to have flowers some people tend to think that cbn is a degraded or a less potent form of THC however it's not like that at all cbn is now being looked at for its own medicinal benefits and what it can provide us medically so how does cbn compared to CBD CBD is found in cannabis and hemp plants and is thought to be the most prevalent cannabinoid cbn however is more common to be found in cannabis plants sort of subtle aging a little bit CBN is psychoactive so in the terms of CBD or is also psychoactive however it's not psychotropic like THC the main reason why cbn is considered psychoactive is because of its mild sedative effects and current research into cbn is showing promising therapeutic potential as we discussed before CBN has powerful sedative qualities considered the most powerful of all cannabinoids a cannabis testing facility has reported that 2.5 to 5 milligrams of cbn is essentially equivalent to a mild pharmaceutical sedative such as 5 to 10 milligrams of diazepam those studies this cannabinoid are limited the ones that do exist do show a variety of different applications one such study showed CBN to be a powerful appetite stimulant whereas CBD by comparison is more of a regulator of appetites and therefore has a potential to be used in comparing things like obesity other benefits that are being discovered as research into cbn expands a positive effects on things such as pain insomnia inflammation and seizures in addition it seems that cbn also encourages the growth of bone cells many of these benefits can be attributed to both cbn and CBD the CBD in general is more research and does at the moment have a a variety of applications all potential applications but the fact is that mostly duck extracts will have very very low levels of CBN and obviously our high levels of CBD because we want to ensure that you get as wide a variety of cannabinoids as possible as research progresses into this amazing plant we don't doubt that there's going to be more and more discoveries when it comes to CB n CVC cbgc BGA we have over 100 cannabinoids there's going to be so much amazing information that's going to start coming out soon so stay tuned and as soon as we have more information on a new interesting cannabinoid you'll be the first to know we'll see you for the next video bye", "eTb7xVO_FE0": "what's going on it's Little Miss cannabis and this is my part two video on how to use the pure distillate in the syringe form so earlier I told you how to warm it up to loosen up the consistency so it was easier to use so when it's in that state the best thing to do is if you want to eat it on a cookie just put a little rice grain piece on there and directly eat it that way and if that's not enough you can always up the dose and make your little amount on there bigger another great way to use it when it's heated up in the syringe is you can directly put it into say like a cup of hot tea or warm coffee and that's a great way to use it as well so another way you can use it at is you can vaporize it so if you have a vaporizer that looks like this this is a barbed coil vaporizer you see right in there there's a coil in there and that's what you're going to want to put the actual you know little des of medicine right in there and that coil is going to burn it pretty hot and you're going to be able to be braise it in that way now the best way to use the distillate is a way called dabbing and that's something that they are not allowed to talk to you about at the dispensaries so that's why I'm gonna do this video and show you exactly how to dab it so there's different devices you can use to dab this right here is called a dab straw so what you need to do is use a little torch and heat up the end of it you're gonna want to get it nice and hot it's going to turn a little bit once it does and you can see mine is a little bit you're gonna want to bring that parchment paper out of the freezer put it right on there and go ahead and take an inhale now this is gonna go way down in so you can tell it is definitely a deep hit for sure but this is gonna affect you really really well so another way to dab excuse me is to use add a brick so this is gonna be probably the most beneficial way to use it so what the daybreak looks like is this right here you heat this piece up right here until that gets red you put this piece on and then what you're going to do is have your little piece of distill it on here put it down in hit it that way and then feel it go away down in and then the party begins I have a good one see y'all later", "YKPkT3ImM_4": "i'm told this could very well be the worst cbd infused mooncake and i'm going to eat it [Music] they're not only beautiful they're absolutely delicious got my coffee mooncakes cookies juice everything here at hong kong's first and only cbd themed cafe and shop i think the benefits of cannabinoids are really for everyone um it's a plant that mother nature gave us we've had it for thousands of years and yet it's been inaccessible to a lot of the world for decades now and especially those in asia pacific haven't had access to the benefits cannabinoids and cbd in particular can bring so i have it every now and then just for like a bit of a calming effect it's good after like a stressful week and the dog likes it i used to suffer from insomnia and i started taking cbd and it just helped me relax and eat some of my anxiety that i had at the time from the cannabis flower and from the cannabis plant we have two main compounds which are most famous cbd and thc thc is what traditionally people would be looking for in cannabis whereas cbd is the more therapeutic side of cannabis around asia laws vary greatly in some countries like hong kong cbd is only legal if it contains zero percent trace of thc in other asian countries it's only available for medical use and in others it's completely banned there are places in asia where cbd is and remains heavily prohibited such as singapore and we would highly recommend that nobody even considers bringing a cbd product whether free of thc or not to singapore because the penalties can be quite severe what do you think oh you give me a pug for older pets who might have inflammation or sore joints might be struggling a little bit with physical ailments cbd can help with anti-inflammation and with reducing pain and the other big benefit is for pets of all ages is anti-anxiety i think we are the first in asia to be taking a more sophisticated approach and helping destigmatize it through restarting the conversation in a new manner you", "RLlkrP77mls": "[MUSIC]", "2RMNuglsUAc": "[Music] it's a weekday afternoon in Los Angeles the epicenter of cannabis in the United States this busy dispensary is open for business but if everything looks normal it isn't this is in fact an unlicensed illegal dispensary part of the booming black market in California and around the country it's what the cannabis industry says could be the biggest threat to sky-high expected revenues Aysen Point California early projections of more than 1 billion dollars in annual cannabis tax receipts in 2018 are far from the three hundred forty five million dollars collected that's in large part because the illegal market can easily undercut the costs of running licensed dispensaries it's not hard to see how a team of CNBC producers equipped with hidden cameras visited ten illegal dispensaries throughout LA most aren't hard to find and they're open day and night some have signs others do not but they all have one thing in common they are brazenly breaking the law operating with no license selling potentially untested products and allowing customers to openly consume in this illegal dispensary down the street from the University of Southern California customers are dabbing smoking a highly potent cannabis concentrate and if you want free weed this store and others are happy to give it away as a sign say all you need to do is write a positive review on weed maps an online site that lists both legal and illegal dispensaries around the country [Applause] [Music] despite a daily limit on the amount of cannabis stores can sell to a customer you can buy as much as you want at many of the illegal dispensaries we can get as much as the black market has a huge problem in some states it's 70 to 80 percent of sales and it's a big threat and so a lot of states are thinking about how do we alleviate it the two things is price and convenience attorney Patricia here is the founder of cannabis law digest taking a lot of the profits away from operators and therefore from the tax revenue from a party in Toronto to Miami and New York City the tone is decidedly upbeat at cannabis conferences that optimism faces this reality an estimated 70 billion dollars in illegal marijuana sales nationally 7 times the legal market and know where our legal operators feeling the impact more than in California the country's largest legal cannabis market where voters passed Proposition 64 in 2016 businesses had to be in compliance with a license by January but as we found that clearly didn't happen we found illegal store after store selling cannabis at deeply discounted prices the parking lot is almost full as our producers enter this dispensary that openly advertises on the side of the building thank you we can go in this regular customer says he's a student at nearby USC at another location CNBC producers walk inside our asked for their IDs then our buzzed in a clerk offers a first-timer deal on a popular product called gelato there are more customers dabbing something our producers were told as common in illegal dispensaries elsewhere there are more perks at the illegal stores and easy to see why they are thriving with all the discounts offered we do not buy anything from the dispensaries this store is open past the state-mandated closing time of 10:00 p.m. another convenience for black market sales we showed a compilation of our video to Los Angeles City Attorney Mike Feuer any surprises to you no I know that there are lawful dispensaries operating in the city it might be that some of the locations you just showed me are under investigation right now how big of a problem is this it's a very significant problem and from a public health and safety standpoint it's especially crucial that buyers of cannabis only go to the licensed shops and yet we see a number of illegal dispensaries opening up because the profit motive is so significant an illegal store can rake in ten to twenty thousand dollars a day authorities say so far 151 illegal dispensaries have been shut down with more criminal prosecutions pending is this different or worse than going after the guy in the corner selling weed before legalization oh no it's it's qualitatively different the amounts of money at stake are much more significant for example turning off utilities is a routine tactic as seen in this video shot by a witness during a recent raid at this illegal store in East LA the location was permanently closed but just over half the stores reopen within a week according to police on weed maps we found listings for 229 illegal dispensaries the Los Angeles Police Department puts that number even higher at 259 but no one knows exactly how many are in business there are just 186 licensed dispensaries in LA weed maps was hit with a cease and desist letter from the state of California last year for aiding and abetting in violations of state cannabis laws because it allows unlicensed businesses to advertise weed maps told CNBC it provides patients and consumers with valuable information about all things cannabis and businesses can post their own listings the company says targeting online platforms won't solve the unlicensed dispensary problem in California the danger in these illegal stores is potentially unregulated products like these sold to unsuspecting customers illegal dispensaries are required to sell regulated products which are tested the City Attorney's Office has attacked the problem with a recent civil complaint seeking millions in damages from one illegal dispensary and we've alleged in our complaint that the product contained a toxin something that is used as a pesticide on golf courses this is exactly why legal store owners like Cameron Wald executive vice president of project cannabis is outraged at how bold the black market has become we're facing especially in California and in LA specifically an illicit market that is extremely strong we're outnumbered three to one illicit operator to legal operator so you know we have outrageous price compression that we have to see at our stores how much easier do you think it is to operate as an illegal dispensary compared to what you go through it's a lot easier they have no compliance standards they had no permitting process they had no documentation no no legal process that they had to go through so they're breaking the law potentially threatening the health of consumers and they're threatening your business correct and they're doing this in plain sight in plain sight an illegal dispensary Walt says can charge close to forty percent less than project cannabis which has four locations in LA and must pay cannabis excise and sales taxes well thank you none of the illegal dispensaries we visited responded to our request for comment which isn't a surprise to david welch an LA based attorney who represents the cannabis industry California is the largest market in the world just based on population and consumption rates they are unable to actually realize the profits that people anticipate they're going to make because you have such a large illegal market statewide California's Bureau of cannabis control has issued more than 3900 cease and desist letters to illegal dispensaries and delivery services compare that to a total of 939 legal retailers what you find are dispensaries are not being enforced against even when they're enforced against they simply go and they open up the next day because the penalties are so low it doesn't dissuade them from violating the law and as we found in all the dispensaries in which our cameras captured illegal activity it appears the boom in the black market in cannabis isn't going away anytime soon", "OTlmzy4Qyng": "if the first thing that you think about when you think about cannabis is the hungry hippie or the lazy stoner hanging out on the couch and watching Netflix and eating Cheetos this is the video for you in this video I'm going to talk to you about the research behind cannabis for weight loss and give you some tips and tricks to get you started on your way hello my name is Andrea McHargue I am a cannabis wellness coach and educator at reveal cannabis comm and I'm really passionate about teaching you how you can use cannabis to live your healthiest happiest life I have a couple of services on my website including private coaching small group classes and soon to be a couple of courses so if you'd like to stay tuned head on over to the website drop in your email address and you will never miss out before we start into the content of this video I want to drop in two disclaimers the first one is that I had weight loss surgery about a year ago so yeah I've lost a whole bunch of weight and I'm feeling fantastic and I'm killing it but I did not lose all the weight just by using cannabis so I don't want anybody to see you before and after photo of me and think that I'm trying to tell the world that pot will help you have that kind of transformation instead it's part of a weight loss strategy so I want I wanted to just put that out there in the atmosphere before we got started and the second is that I am NOT a doctor so do not take what I say in this video as medical advice please alright let's start with the research I hear all the time that there's not much research on cannabis and that's just not the truth there's loads and loads and loads of research on cannabis just not a lot of it is happening in America right now because of the legal ban on cannabis there but we do know that when they compare daily cannabis users to non cannabis users even though those daily cannabis users are consuming about three to six hundred more calories per day it doesn't seem to have adverse health health effects in fact daily cannabis users have smaller waistline even by about 25% smaller waste lines for men of course it's not as dramatic for women it never is so they have smaller waist lines they have lower BMI ranges and they have lower fasting glucose levels so yep they're eating more but no it's not making them fatter and daily cannabis users are less likely to suffer from metabolic syndromes so this is a group of syndromes including having lots of fat around your middle and high blood pressure that contribute to heart disease and diabetes and a bunch of conditions that you don't want and daily cannabis users or regular cannabis users are about 50% less likely to have these metabolic syndromes we also know that appetite fat burning and weight gain are all regulated by the system in your body called the endocannabinoid system and that's the system that that cannabis interacts with so cannabis can have a direct impact on your appetite your fat burning and your weight gain and the great news is that there's a couple of things a couple of compounds in cannabis that are shown to directly enhance and support weight loss but I definitely want to point out that cannabis and weight loss are both multifaceted subjects these are there's multiple reasons for weight gain and weight loss and there's multiple things happening within cannabis and within your own body so um this isn't like a quick fix pill cannabis isn't isn't a pharmaceutical medicine it's more multifaceted you have to work with them a little bit first we're gonna start out by talking about how depression pain and stress affect weight loss and how cannabis can help so let's start with depression I speak from experience here that when you are too sad or tired or worn out or depleted to you know wash your face and take care of yourself and get out of bed you are definitely not gonna go for a workout or spend an hour in the kitchen prepping delicious foods healthy delicious foods and lots of people when they are depressed you use food to help make themselves feel better so what I want to say here is that cannabis specifically lots and lots of different strains and lots of compounds in cannabis help people feel better help people come out of depression so that they can start doing things to take better care of themselves and lose the weight the same thing happens with pain if you are living with chronic pain if you have constant migraines if you have back pain all the time it is going to be very difficult for you to do the things that you need to do in order to maintain a healthy weight cannabis not only affects pain helps you not feel as much pain it also allows most people with chronic pain to have a different relationship with their pain where they're not nervous anymore about getting up and going for a walk the cannabis helps them with their anxiety about the pain and with the pain and it'll help you sleep so people who are suffering from pain come to cannabis to help with the pain but they find out that it helps improve their entire quality of life because they're able to start getting up and get active again the relationship between stress and weight loss is very well documented I'm sure that you have seen it maybe in your own life or the lives of family or friends is when you're in a very stressful time in your life you eat like crab and you don't take very good care of yourself and it's hard on you and your body we also know that people who are under a lot of stress produce produce cortisol in their body and that when people have cortisol running through their veins those people are more likely to be overweight and obese so I want to ask how you are currently managing your stress for me my typical go-to would be to grab something to eat and then I would go watch Netflix just to try to chill out instead of maybe sitting with whatever feeling was making me uncomfortable or going for a walk reduce it doing something healthy for my body cannabis really helps people relax it brings people into a body-mind-spirit more relaxed space alright let's talk about exercise and cannabis this is one of my favorite things this is that when people consume cannabis they are able to exercise for longer and at more intense levels they just seem to kind of care a little bit less about the exercise they're in such a great place that it's they can they can do it for longer for me personally it helps also for me to stay in the moment and to listen to my body like oh I'm walking too fast my knee is getting sorry I better slow down and for lots of people they depend on cannabis post-exercise to help deal with inflammation and pain and also using cannabis topicals to help with maybe like knee soreness or back soreness or something like that and yes it is totally true that THC increases your appetite and it makes food taste very very good but the great thing about that is that it makes everything taste good it doesn't just make you know cake and cookies tastes better it also makes a bag of mini carrots and some hummus tastes better so try to surround yourself with healthy treats when you're gonna consume cannabis and you can also turn cannabis into a multitude of healthy treats you do not have to make pot brownies in order to enjoy cannabis edibles you can make much healthier treats and incorporate that into your healthy lifestyle and keeping with low or no calorie theme lots of people who switch from using a glass or two or three of wine at night into using cannabis find that they're able to lose weight because there's no calories if you're smoking or vaporizing cannabis or putting it into a healthy edibility of little to no calories there's also no hangover so the next morning you can actually get out of bed and go for that walk that you promised yourself that you would and cannabis is health enhancing I know a glass of wine is good for you as well but you can use cannabis throughout the day to enhance your health and I don't know me I don't think that you should probably be drinking glasses of wine all day long to enhance your health we told you that there was two compounds in cannabis that really help people to lose weight and CBD is the first of the CVD is a compound in cannabis that's best known for being very anti-inflammatory it's not psychoactive at all and it's a great appetite suppressant so using CBD oils throughout the day might help you manage your appetite it also does this thing where it promotes fat browning so basically we have both white and brown fat in our bodies and our bodies can process and metabolize brown fat easier than they can metabolize white fat and CBD helps your body change white fat into brown fat so that your body can use it the other compound in cannabis that is like the golden child of the weight-loss world right now and I'm super excited about it myself is THC V so this is an analog of THC which means they're similar but not quite the same it's a reported to be about as a quarter a psychoactive so not not a psychoactive as THC at all and it has been shown to help with weight loss decreasing body fat and increasing energy now I want to say that this was in a mouse trial almost well lots of the trials are in mice but if that translates to human and there's anecdotal evidence that it does and this is very promising as a weight-loss supplement for people who struggle with appetite and weight and all of these things so THC V if you can find it on your shelf check that out because it might really help you two strains of cannabis that are reported to be high in THC v are Durban poison and Swasey skunk but let's face it you could take all the CBD and all the THC v that you wanted this is still not going to be a quick fix for you I invite you to think about cannabis as part of your weight loss toolbox you're doing things like exercising and eating well and you're incorporating cannabis in there as well just like you might take vitamin D as a supplement you're taking cannabis as a supplement to help you live fulfilled happy healthy life now you know how cannabis can be used to help you lose weight but you might not know how to get started with cannabis that's okay I've created free video for you that teaches you how to get started

buy right now over the counter uh and currently market valuation is i believe 11 billion in change and so yesterday it was up like 17 percent uh and then today it's down about five percent and all the pot stocks have just started to dump off a cliff since it became obvious that they are not going to be legalizing at a federal level anytime soon and that's one of the problems with these types of weed stocks is it's just so speculative you know this this thing comes up is this going to have any real value because like the the the european cannabis market's really not that big no but i think the potential for what they have it's going to be greater than the united states because they can travel so uh kira lee's holdings agreed to buy a mac life sciences ltd for 285 which i think is kind of a low entry bar to this industry when it's already been producing billions of dollars in tax revenue right like like currently if only like i clipped i think like 184 million dollars worth of medical say or cannabis sales last year so we pull up the curl leaf chart and see what their quarterly results are to determine whether or not they have acne like year-over-year growth to be able to um account for like a 17 pop in the stock in one day uh however it probably isn't going to be much of anything um we'll see you know curly can immediately start selling his cbd products in europe's and plans to bring thc products and its select brand oh yeah the curry leaf select brand never heard of it but markets through the deal yeah but you know unlike in the u.s where the company can't move federally illegal cannabis across the state lines kiriley's products can be shipped anywhere in the euroboc through the emac their their network so uh appropriate licensing i thought they could only move their cbd products not their uh thc products well i imagine uh this was in bloomberg so i'd imagine there's there's they're working on it you know because in spain uh they have uh like what spannabis it's a huge you know canvassing new out there it's i mean as much as the ignorance still prevails you know you still have gw pharmaceuticals and all these other people you know making a [ __ ] ton of money out there and they're not so ignorant or stupid i guess over there oh we'll see you know it's one of those things where these licenses they tend to become uh less expensive over time and so it implies which you know this isn't necessarily the best implication ever that there would be fewer licenses and limited markets in the future but they just raised all this money and then they spent all that money to acquire this and then it makes the stock go up because why oh they have the right to buy stuff in europe now yeah i mean that's all that is that look at that so that's your home group that's uh oh that's yeah that's some homegrown that's some florida purple homegirl right there medically cannabis right medically hungry yeah that's right medical homegirl it's the way to do it in illinois then uh so we also got a biden's usda secretary gives final approval to hemp rules despite ongoing industry concerns yep the emp rules have been finalized and so we saw those final rules come out there's actually some really nice uh some really nice changes that happened to the final rule from the interim rule and therefore it could be worse it could be worse by a few leaps and bounds because the final rule allows for a difference in the um level of negligence and so the level of negligence has been moved from point five uh percent thc to one percent thc which should provide for like the vast majority of the genetics that are out there as uh as hemp cultivars and then of course the disposal and remediation and so now let's say your hemp comes in a little hot and by that i mean like you're you're over the point five percent total uh you know just throw some more um stalks in and chip it all up and put in some more fan leaves and then test it so that it's it goes back down like your total cbd count might go from like 20 down to 15 or something but then your thc count might go from like 0.5 down to 0.1 which is nice and so now they are allowing uh the hemp farmers to be able to recapture uh and remediate their non-compliant plants with that remediation they're gonna also be able to you can do an extract right and then and create that limit of whatever potency you think it should be uh i don't think they allow you to do the extract i think just allow you to mix stuff back in and then retest it and then once you have then you have to do the extract yeah well still what a painting has though it's like you fill a test like at school they give you a second chance you're like come on i got i know all the answers were right there but it's just it's just the regulations it's just the regulations that's really the problem yeah yeah not exactly and then yeah that's what we call nice things man yeah yeah that's one of the problems all right we have it's agriculture secretary tom vilsack so we're actually going back to the future he was um barack obama's agricultural secretary as well and he's an ally of the hemp industry and so this this new reg takes effect on march 22 as originally planned so this crop year it appears that we're going to be under the new usda regs and so they released these rules yeah so they released them back when did they release that rule i want to say it was august of last year or something like that because they had public comment periods and all sorts of things and they came up the final rule uh the final rule was released back in january so yeah you see like even if we had um federal reform for cannabis it would be like this it would take years after the law has changed because then they have to come out with all the regulations because marijuana is not him marijuana is not him that's right sthcn wait wait wait yeah they are both yeah in the end though you know the process is long and so here in washington the homegirl lost again it's gonna get wide it's just got buried again never made it out of the committee so yeah it takes a long time to shape things up to have that infrastructure it'll be a bit so we also have chicago or do you want to go stay on the uh on the uh the hemp topic no we'll go to chicago all right let's go chicago weed giant illegally took pot to arkansas in whole food salad containers federal suit claims ronald holding okay uh well i just think it's hilarious that verano and verano are they're probably getting torched right now i mean all the the cannabis companies are getting torched right now on the uh the trading floor for the stocks today but yeah chicago company worth roughly 3 billion with sued monday in federal court as part of a sweeping racketeering complaint that accuses the company of illegally trafficking marijuana from illinois to arkansas well how so they're sued but no one like raided what what what what what is this how civil but like isn't there a person behind verano like let's this was my thing about legalization and recreation was huh sammy dwarf is his name i'm just saying rich people don't want to go to jail so if they fix the freaking law go to jail this is freaking ridiculous well actually tom and john could talk about that rich people still go to jail oh yeah he wasn't the biggest fan of it you know he wasn't the biggest fan of jail i don't think anybody goes yeah granted jail like but he had some great stories about him and jordan belfort and you know him riding in wall street in jail while he was serving with tommy chon but uh anyway the lawsuit tireds dozens of cannabis executives and companies including our verano ceo george archus and harvest health and recreation and eris an arizona firm uh harvest is like one of the largest operators out of arizona that attempted to acquire verano for 850 million in march of 2019. uh i do not have a copy of the complaint if anybody wants to get me a copy of the complaint i can read it and be like this is what the state is asking for in their prayer for relief uh i'm not currently involved in litigation and i'm fine with that but i spent about a decade in litigation i'd be interested though but like like again back to why are they being like you know a business should be rated it just it just hurts my brain that you have a federal state to state case here that should involve verona being shut down period not not not being litigated over court or like you know they could lose their license you know if this is a federal crime uh and then again like in the future when these types of things break make sure that we get a copy of the complaint for them so that i can read that and be like this is what they're asking for that's one of the problems with like newspapers is that they're not staffed by lawyers uh and and so then you can't you know necessarily get the the kind of analysis you get from like actually reading complaint and so there's actually a plaintiff so nicholas nielsen worked for the cultivation center in newport arkansas which was managed by harvest as the company worked in lopstep with verano as the acquisition was pending this sounds like a butt hurt investor that's trying to take action to squeeze or exert some type of influence from the actual license holders but uh we'd have to see and so like you know from the way that i was reading it i'm like all right first is this a federal suit and by a federal student is this prosecution right here that is prosecution it just seems like it's a contractual b for some type of beef between these two people it's another reasons why i'd like to read the complaint you know before i well the accusation there is is of course that they're they're also uh diversion right like like this person's saying i'm i'm growing a bunch of plants for this big company worth a billion dollars like it does seem like a petty employee really it's not not a a federal case that's being uh you know government coming after them it's not a federal case the government's not coming after him it's this nicholas nielsen guy and so he worked for the cultivation center like where does he fit in how much stock did he open or own and then it says the 2020 police rate of nielsen's home uncovered 28 harvested pot plants in his garbage can all right cool and so now did he like bring them in he's like hey police this wasn't me it was these guys but you know i have no idea and so like neil nielsen was then arrested and charged after the cops found two more plants inside his home oh that's terrible two whole plants humanly christmas call the dogs uh this claims that those plants were actually being cultivated for harvest greenhouse while awaiting approval from state officials that's very convenient the stude claims that the nielsen's home was allegedly grown from clippings brought to arkansas by michael frontier a verano employee who was allegedly instructed by his employer to take young cannabis plants from an unnamed verano facility in illinois and transport them to arkansas that's derelict in the sense that why aren't these uh genetics like at least stabilized in some forms of seeds uh why are you gonna be flying clones you know coach that doesn't make any sense but why arkansas too i'm just trying to write a highly limited market and so verano probably used its um money to get a license in in arkansas i mean a lot of the illinois operators use their money to get licenses in arkansas cresco gti revolution uh probably also verano and so that you know there's three million people that live in arkansas it is a limited market state for only medical really kind of sucks so if like arkansas ever goes wreck it will be dominated by those five companies well i got you but again it doesn't seem like a diversion issue or it could be a diversion issue if you think about it like but and all these recreational and all these markets recreational medical that that initiate right that they always have this grace period right where everything magically appears the seeds the the cannabis never existed before until you signed that law in place that's right until the uh the zoning commission and then the department of agriculture or the cannabis regulatory commission they give that stamp of approval and your license becomes operational magically cannabis just appears a stork brings it very often you know like just like babies you know they just happen and so the stork comes in that's what it looks like it looks like this is uh some guy named nielsen gets popped for multiple felony charges in arkansas and then for him to get leverage against that um prosecution against him brings in uh verano and harvest health as uh probably had to join them in a suit and then and then but then what he would have to remove to federal court to like get jurisdiction over these other um uh of operators that aren't native for or residents of arkansas again like well nilsson by reading complaint is one of the most important things that a lawyer can do when he's trying to explain to you what's going on yeah well it says here nielsen who's facing multiple felony charges in arkansas has told law enforcement officials that he would definitely testify against frontier verano so it seems like ron's been putting it on their employee as far as like a like a front right like a like you're you're going to help get our business started oh [ __ ] you got caught um i don't know you bro you know it's all good then uh oh here's that one though that we were talking about the uh the beard bros article uh about the al said mid-men zex the new gig represents everything wrong with corporate cannabis and this is about you know uh the beer bros had a great how before actual the structure of recreational um uh cannabis uh you know your reputation precedes you whether you grow good weed and your weed spoke for itself or if you had shitty weed or if you were a shitty uh business person uh you know there was a network and people talk and they still do technically but unfortunately like how do people like people part of men men that started out this this shitty company that had no success and yet still probably acquire another six-figure salary right how do you [ __ ] up and still get a job that bad well it depends on how well capitalized you are but why like what gets them the foot in the door was that you think they paid for the pay to play yeah that you raise money from investors right but so are they just dumb investors i mean what's going on here that these guys yes there are dumb investors out there and so like they you know probably raised some money from some less than smart people uh and uh there you go but you know it's just one of those things where uh you know it not every cannabis company is about operations a lot of them are about acquisitions and assets and so like you know um those types of companies that are about acquisitions and assets and the image and like appearance and it's all real estate play or or what have you uh then you get your amendments right and that's what i mean like the the industry that you think like as a um somebody coming from a traditional market legacy market uh that experience uh you know you have these like you know that cannabis is commodity i paid 25 to save for an eighth so then a quarter is going to be fifty dollars uh a half a hundred and a whole ounce two hundred now and then of course you negotiate with your salesman sometimes you're like hey the more i purchase can i get more of a a refund right this is like the learning basics of business without any uh taxes and all that stuff so i think most people have an idea that any cannabis company that starts is going gonna be a reputable grow slash someone that's there for the plant itself and it's unfortunate when you see these like i want to say shell companies because they're not there's no substance to this there's no actual culture there's no um it seems like it's like funnel money like like hey i'm a rich person i need to funnel some money i know you're gonna [ __ ] it up that's okay it's expected like this is what's wrong with the world man yeah there's a lot of these uh and they're quite great at raising money it's kind of like you know curl leaf what did they do well they raised a whole bunch of money and then they spent it buying all these licenses in europe and what's the value of those licenses yes yeah but don't don't people google we can google around people there's no it's it's just greed and so it's called accretion they use words like that value-add that's another big one or like you know accretion where they they say oh the the sum of these two parts it's not gonna be two plus two equals four it's gonna be like nine and then um you get you get that type of stuff but uh so what is this beard bros company i see that med men is a um a real estate company that dabbles in the cannabis markets but uh you know uh so beer burns got a great blog i think they they're actually a store in a garden down there the thing about the california culture is a lot of these guys have uh uh uh blogs like uh one time uh rest in peace mickey martin was a uh in the early days of medical had a blog called weed activists and uh guy was just savage and just call people out left and right and uh that was the essence of like because he was also in edibles and doing all sorts of things so beer bros are just another legacy um grow that i believe in the recreational market now so they're a good source for california culture and news oh okay so then um beard bros says it's hard to argue that there's a less popular cannabis brand these days than men men how much do you think med men paid for that for the publicity or that for that blurb no good these five bucks 20 000 it's hard to argue yeah i mean it's just they had such great promise right they got the the spike jones video that represented like the the new cannabis culture the new consumer they were trying to they had a lot of blah blah blah intentions but there was nothing of fruition that came out of them except for one little video like i just don't get how these people still succeed in the industry like like it's just it's it's sad and frustrating to see wealthy people where we're like they're saying here in the article a lot of your legacy people can't even afford half these license they can't even get their foot in the door i don't know i don't know tell you what why don't we take a 420 break and then let's look at that verano lawsuit there's actually a pretty interesting chart and graph that we can go over to like point fingers at people and then we can keep ripping on med men or we'll we'll move on to the mexico news probably move on to the mexico loot news but just a second here's the lawsuit um it's a civil action in the united states district court for the first district of colorado again doesn't make much sense uh because like then whoa why do they follow in there well this is kind of normal um and it's not necessarily the worst nose bleeding um uh chart that you'll ever see when you have an mso and so then you have you know marijuana profits marijuana profits going to and from uh the first circle right there is verano llc the the one to the far right is harvest health inc you can see one of them is not an llc and then at the below it's natural state wellness enterprises llc that's probably the um uh the arkansas uh company that was right there and then it's it's just where they they move all the monies and and so those monies kind of go around allegedly according to these um charts and graphs there and so like they siphon off profits they provide uh financial and operating capital uh for people off of them and then uh you know it's it's one of those deals where it'll be interesting to like actually read this whole thing to see exactly what he's alleging and why and then it's it's a rico action uh a private action in rico and so like this guy's getting prosecuted pretty heavily in um uh arkansas sort of like try to offset whatever type of risk he has there he's like all right well i'll bring these people in but now these guys get to like appear and then their lawyers will say oh this should be dismissed and so like this litigation will now get exceedingly expensive uh including for uh with the plaintiff here which is a nicholas nielsen who's also being prosecuted in uh arkansas which is gonna make like affording this a little bit difficult because lawsuits can go on for years if not decades and and be thoroughly briefed before you can actually get to questions of law to get you actually out of those but that's very interesting he's got uh some emails uh attached here and then you know uh some other allegations in the complaint about the transporting across the state lines frontier airlines i'm assuming huh or is frontier one of the the actual things that was defined earlier on if you like this sexy uh mso content you gotta like subscribe right that's right don't forget that where we get to go over um uh more more fun stuff about uh okay who's fighting for what and and how uh but you know that's some news that's going on and that's some litigation that'll probably continue to happen yes they try to enforce the laws in a particular state and somebody gets arrested and then these other msos were playing fast and loose uh well allegedly playing fast and loose uh and we'll see how the facts bear out on this yeah no kidding that'd be interesting to see that that's definitely going to be one of those ones that might uh set a precedent right for how to operate in a multi-state right i mean it could be it could be interesting in the sense that you know these uh operators are trying to get their genetics in various other locations from one state to another and so like how do you do that like if you're if you're an operator that's got a licensing agreement like you know if you're a cookies because cookies keeps opening new shops in new locations so how do those cookie strains get into that state you know we'll all be in california right and pixies fairies of course pixies ferries and also the stork brings all the genetics straight to the dispensary without any questions and uh and then there's these types of questions so it's kind of interesting i mean like this is one of the reasons why you're gonna eventually i don't know when it's gonna be but eventually you absolutely need uh federal legalization because you have this this dual nature of the plant and so like it's quasi-legal in these jurisdictions but it's still also criminalized i mean it's it's medical it's not full adult use well if you think about it too you're setting up in a monopoly for for these companies that have enough money to to litigate their way out like this is wrong on so many levels for the citizens period but meanwhile mexico is gonna might be getting ears right mexico's moving which uh is surprising for me i'm gonna have to issue a retraction from last week or i'm like yeah they're always calling wolf but no the full chamber of the mexican lower house is expected to discuss and vote on the bill this week that just criminalizes cannabis in a move that would make the country one of the largest the world's largest legal cannabis markets then they're going to build that wall so we can't go down that's right well i'm assuming then they're going to like start re-exporting all those wonderful mexican hazes from the 70s um however i don't know if that will happen uh how and then the other thing is they're gonna i think they would be the largest legal cannabis market because there's more mexico uh people than there are canadians like canada right now i think is the largest and there's only like 30 million or so 30 to 40 million canadians you know if you think about this too it doesn't have to be cannabis that once they legalize this in cannabis as a recreational use there's they're opening the the floodgates for hemp like for being a number one producer because since the united states is still behind the curve as we regulate our own stuff we're too busy saying the farmers are bad they're gonna they're gonna press on and create their own hemp and you know because that right now canada is our number one outsource for him and then south africa i think so there you go i mean they have some wonderful mexican hemp coming in but there's almost 128 million people that live in mexico and so there you go it'd be like the largest cannabis market by a mile if that happens and it's been it's been scheduled to happen for so long and it's been delayed for so long once they actually get there and i'm not sure if they're gonna get there this time or if they're gonna get there next time but it's it's moving that's like homegrown for washington you guys still have homegrown for medical it's just you want homegrown for adult use right america i want my rights freedom and so yeah that's we don't we also don't have home i mean like the home grow that we have is medical home grow and and i understand the argument for that when it comes to access to supply but then you know there's a profit mode of argument which i don't like it's like hey uh you shouldn't have access to supply if you just want to smoke weed you should have to pay yeah but that's still shitty argument because the you know home brews haven't put budweiser out of business you know hasn't put restaurants and everything out of business so it will only add to the variety of life god damn it i yes like you know you're not wrong you're not wrong it's just that the um the people don't care yeah well the ones in charge don't care that's that's what it is yes that's one of the bad news stories that continues to be on the radar too uh i'm not sure if that was the one that we had signed up next no that was the true leaf one let's talk about that well there is some more bad news eventually once we get to the florida news yeah yeah trinity team teams up with morehouse school of medicine though on medical cannabis research that's pretty neat that is yeah true leaf cannabis corp turned up with an hbc morehouse school of medicine on a medical cannabis research and education initiative about time that they're going to do some cannabis research dude i'm looking forward to the day i can actually go to the store cvs and buy uh you know a two to one ratio uh cannabis uh extract something you know uh pill anything to add my you know like anywhere i already kind of have it with the legal stores here because we watching is kind of ahead of the curve when it comes to products but still everybody should have this opportunity yep yep and so the florida cannabis company that's truly signed a research education and development agreement with morehouse school of medicine medicine under which true leaf georgia will assist with the school's cannabis related research operations and offer educational courses now this may also play into the lawsuit that truly filed against georgia to get its application in for its medical cannabis cultivation license and now it announces this new partnership with the morehouse school of medicine i wonder if that was an aspect of the cannabis application that they put in it had to be you know you know they're they're right now litigating going but we're gonna be in a medical study that's right you gotta let us in because we're right here all this jack going straight to your educational facility seriously we've got doctors yeah such [ __ ] i mean god damn it's brilliant [ __ ] strategic planning but [ __ ] you for [ __ ] having that kind of money hey gotta pay to play man so that's that's great and it provided if oh can you imagine if they don't get the license are they gonna come through then you know because they haven't announced who's won these because there's only two licenses up for grabs and then there was four licenses for the the tier two the fifty thousand square foot operating facility and then there's two licenses for the hundred thousand square foot operating facility and you know they want that they thirsty for oh god yeah yeah isn't the the requirement still says citizenship right in georgia you got to be resident oh sure there's all sorts of chicanery and relationships with um the residency requirements or like the doing business for the time requirements all those types of things um and then they they were nitpick the truly people were nitpicking regarding like how they uh implemented the application relative to the rules whether or not the administrative department overstepped its bounds when they were creating the the list of the uh the application which another fun thing you know that'll happen sometimes yeah you know the collaboration is considered as being one of the first steps in creation of a personalized medical cannabis treatments that would be a wonderful future yeah totally um there we go well yeah leading to the medical though colorado colorado bill requires schools to store cannabis-based medicines for student use so when the school board refused to let her daughter marley receive her cannabis derived medicine from willing teachers sarah and mark porter made the difficult decision to pull molly out of school on october 2019. in 18 months since marley has been able to take her prescribed medicine regularly while learning her at home keeping her crohn's disease more manageable than it's ever been her parents testified to colorado legislators crohn's is horrible man there's a lot of that so uh senate bill 21-56 aims to make life easier for kids like marley and their families it would require schools and school districts to have a policy allowing their employees to store and administer medical cannabis recommended for a student by a doctor thank god sb 56 yep but i mean this is a crohn's disease patient that's trying to access her medical cannabis and and it's been this is even in colorado and so like the one of the bastions one of the first states for this has still had these types of regulations in place to prevent cannabis medicine from being at schools well washington had the same way we just did it three years ago i believe just recently i know the gentleman that was behind that bill his daughter uh passed on a beautiful little girl she she had something way worse than crohn's and all that stuff but he pushed this bill through for all the other kids it was pretty awesome so yeah i know it's great that uh this so this can be called jack's law and i think i followed this guy's case for a little bit hey or no it builds off of jack's law which allows school districts to let parents or guardians administer medical cannabis to their children on campus in jack's law medicine must be administered in forms of oils nasal sprays or capsules no smoking can you imagine that but the light you're also certain nasal sprays and stuff so at least they have some type of aerosols so that it could actually be um you know so yeah you could get it titrated quicker and so you could get into the the the system faster that you know but the smoking aspect is just just us i mean like they're like oh my god there's a hint of smoke somewhere oh no any smoke at all don't even know what paper you know no it's ridiculous the the the the expectation that like you have to say the kids can't be smoking like no parents can rolling doobies for the kill i mean i mean mr older but you know if it's a medical issue a medical treatment god they're getting titrates they're getting tinctures getting oils they're doing all kinds of stuff they're not rolling up dubies for the [ __ ] kids they would probably prefer to not have to use the medicine to be honest it's one of those things you know usually when you have medicine very often you're like man i wish you didn't have to use this but i'm sick you know yeah there's a kid out there calling because you know colorado had a uh it was the mecca for a lot of the uh uh parents leaving their states uh you know uh charlotte's webb was the uh the initiator of all that right um and uh funny thing about this the because i i give the uh charlotte's web the brothers uh credit for creating that conversation you know keeping it going forward but looks like i gotta answer it text my bad all right well you do that you know colorado also has quentin's amendment which allows school nurses to administer medical cannabis at school for qualifying medical conditions and with a doctor's approval well that's that's a good amendment to have clinton but the left the law left out an opt-out clause for districts that didn't want their employees giving kids the medicine senate minority leader chris holbert a republican from douglas county said sb 2156 is more important to him than any other legislation he sponsored this session seven lawmakers in the education committee approved the bill unanimously on february 24th and now goes to the appropriations committee for review on a yet to be determined date and that is again how laws are made you start one committee hopefully you don't die there then you get out of another committee hopefully you don't die there you get some floor action hopefully you also don't die there and then there's a vote and then you pass if this is nebraska that's it now every other state besides nebraska then you have to go get passed in the other uh legislative body let's say you started in the senate you have to go to the house side of the house you have to go to the senate and it has to be the same one uh and then let's say you get all through all that and then they've been reconciled so it's the same bill and now it goes to the governor's desk and if that governor is mario cuomo yeah sure he might sign it but if that governor is uh gnome i believe is her name in south dakota oh she's vetoing the crap out of that bill and and that sucks and so that's one of the reasons why cannabis legalization news will be here for a bit because these things won't play out over the course of like a fortnight it's it's going to take years miggy is still on the phone so let's move on to the next thing no more urine tests no more urine tests proposed california law would end most workplace marijuana tests again i mean just so dumb just drug test right like yeah i mean the point they have to do random drug tests proves that you can't identify a a consumer of recreational drugs i mean as an employer unless that person's [ __ ] up and then if that person's [ __ ] up then you you take other precautions but writing rejections just don't find [ __ ] nope they you know i mean if they really want random drug tests i think that's fine let's start with the legislature see what they're on and then after that we'll see if we could do it to the people that aren't making any money or like getting a whole bunch of subsidies from the federal government in the terms of um pensions and other fringe benefits okay new legislative bill that's ending a common employment practice five years after californians voted to legalize recreational cannabis in which privacy companies can require workers to test for marijuana use it's assembly bill 1256 introduced by assemblyman bill quirk a democrat of hayward and he has intended to prevent employers from using past evidence of marijuana use such as hero or urine as justification for discrimination against an employee such as denying or terminating employment yeah zero tolerance is a shitty policy overall it's been a shitty policy you know since the reagan era like that it it's why what well a lot of the times it'll have to do with like where does the company get its money from if a lot of it is coming from the federal government they may still have to do the zero tolerance policy as conditions of getting uncle sugar's money and a result of that that's one of the reasons why those types of tests are still done prevalently a lot of people just don't like wheat no i get it it just it bothers me because like my son he asked me or he was saying you know i wanna because he wants to go in the military when he graduates high school and uh he's like i can't wait till i joined the military and hopefully by that time uh the perception of cannabis because of everything that he sees me talking about with morocco and everything he's like maybe it'll be legal then i was like you know i was like even if it's legal tomorrow still another five six years until attitudes and you know zero tolerance happen overnight it's it's [ __ ] up that it's harder to free a man than it is to create a law to put everybody behind bars yeah it's it's harder to get people to accept facts like there's no like this isn't this isn't something to debate and we need more research it's like no no uh we discovered a nandabide in in march 22 fourth of 1992 it's only 29 years old we figured out how this plant worked fairly recently and now we are dang sure this is how it works and look at all these recreational legal states right the zombie apocalypse hasn't happened planes aren't falling out crashes aren't happening everywhere i mean economies are actually thriving but i i i mean we live in the family including painkillers by the way uh you know pizza use is up yeah domino stock [ __ ] goes up [ __ ] i mean it's a win-win baby man people feel great people feel great but it's one of those deals where you're dealing with people that don't know the actual objective facts and and you're trying to just get people to understand facts that's it opinions you don't i don't care what your opinion is on marijuana do you know how it works let's have that conversation and so then once you get moved past that conversation they should be like oh well our laws are really [ __ ] stupid right but if they if they don't understand how cannabis works then it's really easy for these losses to continue yeah yeah and they don't understand also why can't prohibition exist like that you know we have to constantly educate like yes it's all based off it idiocy nothing scientific based it's all racial uh propaganda uh there's nothing legitimate about why prohibition exists like there's no saving the people it's about controlling the people you know it's about controlling the people and uh speaking of control though or no longer uh be a judge of your moral character when the administration marijuana would not count against immigrants good moral character under new congressional bill thank [ __ ] god i mean this is immigrant submission to prior marijuana use can no longer be used to deny them u.s citizenship under a new congressional bill representative brandon boyle a democrat from pennsylvania filed the legislation on monday it addresses a part of the federal immigration policy that's concerning concerns establishing good moral character because yeah everybody already hears good moral character as part of a national application yep they were using our cannabis laws in immigration for decades as something to justify uh you know revoking your uh your visa and deporting you yeah so i'm glad to see that they are introducing uh bills to try to change that this is one of the aspects of the more act that gets into it so like now it looks like they're you know breaking off that piece because the more act is a very large you know bill that they contemplated and and it was going to amend the immigration naturalization act to uh get rid of a lot of the references to marijuana which can prevent people from you know getting their visa or becoming naturalized and they said they're also going to have another the congressman's bill specifically cars out an exemption for applicants who admitted to have using possessed or distributed cannabis and then it would also remove another stigmatizing question that the united states citizenship and immigration services asked you on some of those forms when you're trying to get naturalized have you ever been a habitual drunkard which will no longer appear on uh the questions as well that's an old-timey [ __ ] holy crap have i been a habitual drunkard well yes but like my job was to be a drunk at uh disneyland and it's it's what they paid me for you know i'm the town trunk okay i gotta jump out for a second all right you do that and i'll say uh you know boyle the the rep that sponsored this he said these questions are wholly unrelated to citizenship and it's extremely troubling to see federal applications like this that continue to use a harsh and antiquated terms such as habitual drunken this careless language only serves to reinforce societal stigmas and misunderstandings about substance abuse and it's time that we matter modernize the process that is pretty darn awesome uh let's let's move on to the new vaporizer shipping band impacts the industry and high times is now reporting that the preventing of online sales of e-cigarettes the children act which approved by the congress last december states the ups can no longer handle vape product shipments check out the video that we've done on this it's called the delta 8 vape ban and so the delta 8 vape ban we're going to do some more content on in the next uh two three weeks because it goes into effect on the 26th of this month however it will not really really start catching up to the people that are probably going to continue to sell these things online for another 90 days or so it's not like you want to be on that list tune in for more on that and so yeah what they did was they defined this electronic nicotine delivery system in such a broad way that it would also encompass for no real good reason uh uh vapes and this is a delta eight vape find them at your local head shop that'll probably be where most of them are being sold in a month so they're saving the children that's awesome save those children no longer will anybody be buying e-cigarettes online especially children you know that's one of the reasons why i have not given my daughter a credit card yet because kids don't know how to get into the goddamn uh dark web which i know they know like this is a failed attempt again being another [ __ ] daddy state you know whatever you want to say and then like you see how it's defined and you're like ah crap this is gonna fall straight into what a vape cartridge is and did they intend to do it no they didn't but like it's one of those things where it's so overly broadly defined and says that this nicotine electronic nicotine delivery system is any product that delivers nicotine flavor or any other substance to a user inhaling from the device delta 8 or cbd um so does this mean so like the product itself like the empty cartridge the empty battery cartridge right empty no product in it can that not be shipped to you then as a company because really this doesn't really affect any recreational markets because they're not doing interstate commerce anyways right but no it's basically what it means it's not going to be able to be shipped to you uh using the post office there's maybe like one very small exception but that's kind of like if you're shipping in between friends uh and you're only going to do that like 10 times a year and it's like very small uh and even then they might give you [ __ ] if you try to like mail it but there's going to be uh mail regulations that are coming out about april 27th and then we'll see uh yeah i just anticipate a lot of the and you're seeing it right now like all the delta eight products are starting to evolve a little bit away from the vape carts for example now they're taking a lot of cbd flour and then they take the delta eight and they spray the cbd flour uh and so now you have this blended product where you have delta eight plus you also have cbd for the entourage effect and and what is it it's flour you can mail it but it also delta eight so it's in demand or you're seeing drizzlers uh you know which is essentially like the liquid stuff in here but then you're going to have to be like trying to refill your own vapes and that's going to get frustrating so you just go down the street to the vape shop and buy yourself a delta egg cart well i'm saying like well someone in the recreational market that i see you know they're i don't think there's any change to those guys like because they're not shipping their [ __ ] out there's we don't have any mailing options so you know washington's safe in that market yeah i think you know i mean it just seems like it does hurt all the cbd people who are trying to be on that gray market on the edge right it seems like you see it's either you're in the uh recreational market or you're traditional or you know that's it yeah the healthcare market is uh we'll see we'll see the next farm bill you know in 2022 farm bills coming out we'll see if that addresses delta yeah thousands of california marijuana convictions officially reduced others dismissed good stuff man last month with the stroke at penn san diego county superior court judge eugene a gonna kill it i hire a bead nearly 26 000 people with belly utility marijuana convictions on their records had them reduced to misdemeanor convictions i wonder if i'm one of them i wonder if i had to apply for that that's where most of my arrests were at night in addition to the thousand people rested i'm so proud of you for being arrested for weed well underannounced was a misdemeanor when i was younger so twice twice well you know that would make me a social equity applicant yeah in the first time uh i got pulled over and i've always been honest with cops like my activism comes down to like good policing and stuff like that like uh the first time uh actually three times i got pulled over the first time honest the cop cop lets us go takes our bag and dumps it out but gives me back my pipe it says don't smoke and drive uh second time uh i got pulled over for an out brake light and then i had five cop cars come up in my car after i was already honest with the cop with an eighth like hey this is what i got you didn't catch el chapo and then next thing i'm in the back of the car freaking out like what the [ __ ] i was honest with you and uh he's like i'm gonna kick you in if you keep it up then uh yeah i mean just these just petty stuff you know the third time again under an ounce so they're not gonna like take me in they're they're looking for the bigger boys and uh you always gotta like know your role right know your rights type [ __ ] yeah let's talk about your rights in florida you know where rights can very often go to die go florida not only not only can your rights go to die there but good luck trying to get unemployment in florida so let's let's talk about florida should marijuana legalization limit thc probably not but it's happening according to forbes uh thc of course is the most famous cannabinoid out there however a lot of these types of states are trying to cap thc they try to do it in washington state with extracts so state legislatures in florida have proposed a 10 thc limit on smokable flour and a 16 thc limit on edibles still sold in the state's medical marijuana marketplace let's talk about why that is ludicrous go for it oh governing nature i mean just the whole nature and so you're going to force people to pick it when it's not ripe which again that's not necessarily going to help the patient achieve the uh entourage effect of the whole plant that you're looking for moreover it it continues to like over emphasize the importance of thc you know that even a 30 thc plant is fine hash has been around for thousands of years and so has keith for thousands of years and been way way stronger than uh 10 or 30 percent flour we've been fine and then the 16 thc limit on edibles is that by weight because that's insane you know because if this thing weighs a gram does that mean that i can have 160 milligrams of thc in there that is like an elephant-sized dose of an edible right there and florida's had medical for how many years now uh florida's had medical for i have no idea i want to say it was about the same time that illinois maybe a little no 2016 i think they actually finally passed it because they had to pass it twice because they had to get over 60 percent so i think it was 2016 and like all the licenses are not that old like 2017 and stuff and then truly just access to capital and took over but why is florida so florida like i mean like what's the point like what happened who got hurt here that like now we gotta capture it like what is going on and you're gonna kill the genetics of florida like i think don't think people are understanding like your state is legalish you are you have a chance to be on the forefront of like genetics and appellations like we talked about like if people were to start like okay we can start having this florida sunshine or whatever you want to call it you know there's prime opportunities for your state to pull in a [ __ ] ton of money right you're not going to do that with limiting goddamn thc caps and [ __ ] [ __ ] regulations right i mean like the only thing that that thc cap would do is make the illicit market just fine they'd be like hey i'm going to go back out to the street to buy it why because that stuff will get you high this stuff gives me a headache because they're going to have to do something to that flower to get it down to there i mean like a one-to-one blend maybe that's all you would be able to get and then you have to be watching that ten percent um and so there's there's that aspect and then it's like some of these medical patients need higher thc concentrations i'm glad that they have it inedible but they probably want to also be able to inhale it yeah dabs i mean concentrates or anything uh straight back to the weed man you know yeah that's it i mean uh where's where's moral beach at myrtle beach i always thought was in south carolina but i have no idea okay because uh i don't know if uh because we're getting close to the end here but the horrible story you're talking about is the uh the war on weed leaves one myrtle beach man paralyzed cost 11 million in landmark civil rights case wow so home surveillance video showed in april 2015 a team of heavily armed officers used a battering ram to enter julian benton's myrtle beach home to execute a search warrant three officers fired 29 times [ __ ] kid johnny mccoy julian benton's attorney said they hit him nine times effectively crippling him paralyzing him he had multiple surgeries and still can't walk and then they lied to cover it up yep south carolina south carolina's finest demonstration of not understanding that weed is harmless now this is this is just horrible uh i don't know if you're familiar with j cole the the rapper uh he had a song called neighbors and uh he actually uses actual video footage from his house of officers raiding his house because they thought he was a grow operation opposed to a rap studio is what he had in his goddamn basement so they thought the power was going to growing weed as opposed to growing beets yeah yeah i can't wait to nicholas i'm looking forward to the high mighty i gotta get the puns out now i don't want to embarrass myself when he gets here i want to be all a fan boy some of the questions about 1985. you know uh let's go let's do chong's weed through the decades so we're going back to the 60s where were you smoking all right were we puffing on that i could imagine that you remember blueberry coming into the scene and then i wonder what his criteria though for having to grow now because you know part of what the circuit he's going on is he's got the uh the new chong line out and uh and then chicha says has a line too if we could cheat each other after chong and then we'll be like john was blaming you for everything is that true right and then we'd ask to teach the exact same goal that never mind we'll have fun but like hopefully enough hopefully enough yeah that's pretty fun man to it man it's going to be a lot of fun this is our first show we did over 20 000 subs you know yeah we can't we can't stop until we have more subscribers in peoria illinois hilarious and so we're talking i think 115 000. so like what in a year it depends like i uh i got sick there last week or last month and then um and now the website's down so don't visit us at campus legalization oh canvas industry lawyer cannabis legalization news is still online uh and so you know in a few more months hopefully we can start messing around with more um shows that are like directly related to trending national news uh yeah that's one of the ways that you get a lot of suggested videos and just a crapload of views and so you know if there's something that comes out that we think it'll actually break you do a quick video about it or or um other videos about how to get licenses those get smaller views and then they're more localized but it helps us like you know find visitors or viewers that are in those particular jurisdictions that want to get this game oh yeah and then you know uh yeah and then i can't wait for the site to find it up because i do like to do the word stuff right like for people who like to read you know the video thing was just kind of a happy stance of what i like to do like you pulled me into this and now i'm in this dark web of [ __ ] and you know but the words come come visit the website once it gets rocking it's not rocking right now it looks like it looks like it's not pretty right now that's all i can display into it it's not she's not she's under construction folks just just go to the canvas legalization news and be like in work you know but uh you know one step at a time and the the site was pretty big and so like it was going really really well and then i just tipped over and dived uh which is terrible you know but at the same time it's a lot of fun that we still gotta have the channel yeah no this is great i mean [ __ ] we got 90 people hanging out with us and i [ __ ] love it you know i look forward to our moments you know i mean there's gonna be lots more news coming and uh just take it one day at a time man that's it there's always something to talk about i told you man yeah like that was one of the things do we already talk about the bakery licenses no ah the bakery licenses i can't wait for these things to be a thing like you know everybody's like oh i want to open up a weed restaurant you know where you can make these types of infused dishes and i'm just held on there bro uh that's not how this works they all have to be pre-packed and like you know pre-dosed and all that and then there's really not a consumption lounge license type that's out there yet like where do you go in washington where do you go in seattle down the street to smoke a bowl with your boys or like your friends you know like where do you go yeah no there's no place uh you know and in uh the park right like i mean i'm endorsing public smoking but it's it's decrimed here at the point that's what i'm saying like that's why prohibition is so important ending prohibition is so important so law enforcement can worry about the [ __ ] that's important and not some guy smoking a joint with his friends in the corner of a park you know well and then the guys would have an opportunity to smoke their joints somewhere else yeah yeah if i had if we had well we used to have lounges during medical times but it'll happen again you know so but yeah that's the next step there's a lot of levels to this uh regulation that needs this infrastructure that needs to happen uh want to take the listener mill all right let's do one question if we have one question but then i got to have a call about the websites yep we got whitney city gardens on instagram ass i find myself in the new illinois speaker of the house's district do you think there's any value of lobbying him to fix her cannabis laws any strategic tips to change this [ __ ] because honestly the cannabis regulation feels like it's poorly written and being poorly rolled out um all right so the new speaker actually introduced a bill on this and uh well he introduced a bill that would have increased the ownership of amounts of craft grows from three to ten and so if anything it would have allowed fewer operators to own all of those licenses which are the most accessible cannabis cultivation license currently in the state of illinois uh that's not a good sign if anything it looked like that was an mso bill like you know multi-operators like hey one craft grow that's that's okay but that's only 14 000 square foot flowering i want um and so can i own ten of them is that okay if i can own ten uh and and that's the bill that that representative ford introduced i can't remember what h b it is off the top of my head but it was like ew ew did he introduce a bill that says hey 5 000 square feet is too much we need a micro cultivation license of only 500 plants no he did not he wanted to increase the amount of ownership to essentially allow for greater m a amongst the uh current caps of three licenses he wanted that raised to ten what's the small do you guys have small associations there like like they do like they did in rhode island where they fought that one no nobody has license just seems to me that you guys need more um uh we call it uh community gathering type things you know we do there's a lot of work to do in illinois but uh i know we gotta get out of here so thanks for tuning in everyone make sure you like and subscribe to keep up with all cannabis legalization news we'll see you on sunday you", "0jIJnE7YRcg": "hello Peggy the pot lady here it's almost the love day almost Valentine's Day one of my faves we're gonna get sexy today we're gonna learn how to make salut that's right most of us already know that our vaginas can get high too and so today we're going to be preparing for that so when Valentine's Day is here we are ready Freddie I got three grams of weed here I got some coconut oil that's it how simple can it be got a little mason jar here whoa there goes the lid back in the 60s we used to call a lid now so marijuana buy three grams of weed now you can use bud I prefer to grind mine up because it solidifies and mixes with the coconut oil a little easier there's no concentration in one area and weakness in the other it's pretty evenly spaced so that's just my personal preference three grams and three three tablespoons okay I went a short on that one because the first one was so full anyway we did measure pre-measure three three tablespoons and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to take this and put this jar in a boiling pot of water then I'm gonna leave it there for two hours come watch watch two hours follow me I'm going to take the option of the oil and read and I'm going to place it into boiling water not the lid is loose there's no sense in tightening it up because what we're going to do the minute it hits that water we're gonna turn it to simmer in this case mine doesn't say simmer it says no no no keep it like that for two hours now periodically you will want to swirl swirl swirl use these tongs because this wait a minute you'll hold on to the pot so it doesn't walk away you will then put the tongs around the jar you can see how many times I've done this that's all it takes so have fun and in the two hours that it takes to do its thing think about Valentine's Day and how fun it's going to be yes you can get high down there too and the great thing about this is you can use the leftovers for massage oil hell you could even eat it if you know what I mean yeah because it's just coconut oil and weed I've changed out my songs so that they didn't have those rubber things on it which I found to be very slippery and I have been this been on simmer for two hours and you can see it's pretty well mixed up we'll remove that from the air and then you know everybody will tell you go out and buy some cheese cloth which probably you have to get off of Amazon which is a real pain in the ass if you're in a hurry every woman has these bags all over the house for their jewelry they have no purpose other than receiving or giving jewelry in all right so take my little bag put it over the strainer take my concoction wait until it cools off because it's really hot ouch ouch ouch ouch ouch ouch ouch ouch ouch okay what I did was I poured most of the oil in there and now I'm going to take the remnants all right and put those into the bag and just take it and squeeze it out just squeeze it down as much as you can and all we've done is infused coconut oil with our weed deep horrible eyes start weed meaning just heated it up so that the THC potency can come out this then is discarded and we take the oil your Lube your Lube put it in your jar and it's up to you whether you want to apply it warm or cooler some some ladies like to put it in the refrigerator because it's kind of cooling around however when you apply this to your boo boo you know it's always fun maybe to have somebody else do the placement that's always fun if you rather shy about that buy some capsules off of Amazon and fill the Capel's capsules up with with the syringe filled up with it and just swallow it swallow one and shove the other one up let them meet in the middle have a great time you will love it there is nothing like romance and sex on Valentine's Day and night eating chocolate strawberries infused and having the lube job awesome awesome evening romance sex in the jar like me subscribe to me comment on me and have a great Valentine's Day you", "ITxmvqDsFfs": "[Music] hi there welcome back to the canvas kitchen I thought today would be a great day to make some cannabis suppositories so there's a few things to know about making cannabis suppositories one is that if you insert them properly they actually won't get you high so you'll get all the medical benefits of using it without getting that high that some people don't really want when they're trying to medicate themselves another thing to know is that this recipe can also be made with CBD however if you're going to use CBD flour for this recipe you're going to need to double the amount of CBD flour that you use because the tendency is that this doesn't work as well rectally if you use CBD so you have to double your dose if you're gonna make it so if you have some cannabis kick around the house use that instead and save the CBD maybe for some vaping so what I've done is I've chosen a really high strain and I'm actually gonna use some shake for this recipe a friend of mine just finished her grow and brought me all her shake and so I thought it would be perfect for this recipe because the plant is actually a very strong strain it's called El Chapo and that one will give you some couch lock for sure so I wanted a really high strain because I want to get a maximum benefit out of this without having to get high so what we're going to start with I've actually made a little bit here but I'm going to show you how I made it so in this mason jar I have 5 grams of shake you can use flour but if you want to and I have 100 milliliters of cocoa butter so it's very important to use cocoa butter because coconut oil can melt at room temperature and especially at body temperature a month very quickly so I would imagine that wouldn't be very fun if you were inserting it rectally so this is basically a chunk of cocoa butter you can buy this deodorized or not deodorized if you buy it and it's not deodorized it actually has a really really nice chocolate smell to it but as you can tell I can handle it and it's not melting in my hands so that is definitely something that is going to kind of help you out while you're going through the process especially if you're just learning how to do this so all we do is what I did was I actually added a little bit of extra cocoa butter because I know I'm gonna get some loss so I added a little bit more so it's probably about a hundred and ten milliliters in here and so we're just gonna take it we've got our jar of shake here and we're just gonna add the two together there yeah we're gonna put the lid on our jar there and we're just gonna add this to a water bath so I've got this already heat it up I don't know if you can see the steam if the camera picks that up or not but all I've done is I put this in a jar put it in the water bath and we're gonna let that go for about four hours so I've got one here that I've already done this one's already been simmering away for four hours so the process is actually quite simple all we're gonna do is the same as if we were doing any other kind of infusion so we're just gonna take our jar and we're gonna pour the contents just through some cheesecloth just like that I want to make sure we get all of it here we go perfect all right so this is already cooled off a little bit too so it makes things a little bit easier later on when we want to try and squeeze this out so I'm just going to start by squishing it down and try and get as much of it as I can through the cheesecloth then I'm just gonna take my cheesecloth and I'm going to give it a really really good squeeze now actually I think I'm gonna put some gloves on for this and we want as much of it as we can get so why would anybody want to use a cannabis suppository is a good question I have had actually some requests to make this recipe and so some people already know the answer but what is nice about this recipe is if you have any kind of chronic pain or for women if you have get bad cramps and you want a really really quick quick fix that's not going to get you high this is the solution so the other nice thing too is that often people can't if they have an illness or they're going through maybe a cancer treatment and they can't keep any food down or keep any medications down a lot of times even doctors will give medications rectally and so a really really quick relief of nausea or again any pain is is to insert regularly so if you do this properly and you insert it properly you will not get high because when you insert these things they will actually bypass the liver and when you bypass the liver then it doesn't deliver anything up to your brain so I think we've given that a pretty good squeeze so we're just gonna put that aside and I'm just gonna pop off these gloves these aren't the best ones all right so what we're left with here is some really really nice oil made with cocoa butter so I don't know if you can see that it's got a really nice color to it so the next step is to insert these into a mold now you can actually purchase molds for this but what I've done instead is I went to the dollar store and I picked up a bag of bubble tea straws they're a little bit tighter than a regular straw and I think that's gonna help for our purposes so the other thing I did was I just found a piece of foam just an old piece of foam kicking around from buying something and so what I've done is I just took a little bit of hot glue put it around the edge of the straw and and pushed it a little bit into the styrofoam so that we can form a seal so also - I cut these straws in half just to make them a little bit easier to work with and we don't need to fill them all the way up so we might as well get some use out of these so the next thing I did was I got a syringe you can use any kind of like medication syringe or whatever works for you and so what we're going to do now is we're going to take this oil and put it into our molds so what I would like to aim for is about 10 milliliters per straw so let's try that first all right so now all we're gonna do is just squeeze those into the mold just like that if you can fit 10 that would be great I don't know if they'll fit or not okay so we have our little sticks here they have been put back to a solid state which means they've just sat for hours at room temperature you probably could put them in the fridge but definitely like I said do not put them in the freezer so they're very very simple to use this straw is not all the way full I'm not sure if you can see that it's filled to about here so all we need to do is just give it a squeeze and it's gonna pop out it's still a little bit soft so you've got this popped out it'll be probably if you leave it overnight it would be a little bit harder you can see it's still a little bit melting in my hand so just imagine what cocoa butter or sorry coconut oil would have done so they're super super easy to use super super easy to make and hopefully you have good luck with it as well so I just wanted to a little recap so the first thing you're going to do and I think I forgot to mention it earlier is you're going to decarboxylate five grams of cannabis the higher the strength are the higher the potency the better then you're going to measure out 100 milliliters of cocoa butter you can melt it first if that makes it easier to measure for you I will put links in the on the website under the recipe section for all of the stuff that you need then you're going to put the two together put them in a water bath in a jar for about four hours and just let that go and then you're going to take your straws your bubble tea straws I'm going to cut them in half and you can either just put them into a container that's going to hold them straight up or you could look into melting the bottoms also you could probably just take a lighter and just melt that bottom down so that when you pour the top in that they'll stay together or you can do what I did and just use a little bit of a hot glue gun around the bottom edge and then stick it on to something flat and that should hold a seal and hold everything in for you and then you're just going to let them sit so about four hours or overnight just long enough to get it back into a nice solid form kind of like the ones you see in the container and then you're ready to go so the one thing to remember about inserting these pieces is once you have it out of the mold make sure that when you put it into your bum that you allow your sphincter to grab it and pull it in so if you go too far it will actually make you high so the secret is is just get it in there enough that your sphincter can hold it in then it will do the work it's magic and it works pretty quickly I would say within about 20 minutes to a half an hour so you can relieve some nausea some cramps sciatica pain it's great for our thright is pain pretty much anything that's causing you trouble it can help now one other thing you can do is you can do a CBD THC mix so because CBD tends to have a lot of anti-inflammatory properties if you add some into your mix that will definitely help if you have some swelling that you're trying to get rid of our sore muscles or whatever so you can play around with the mix a little bit you can do a one to one ratio my preference is to do it the way I made them which is 5 grams of cannabis and 100 milliliters of cocoa butter but you can increase that dose you can decrease that dose and remember like I said in the beginning if you are using just see me a flower for this you're going to want to double it so you're going to use 10 grams of flour and 100 milliliters of oil or of your cocoa butter so again though you can play with the recipe like I said you can mix the two together whatever makes it work for you so it make your batches small in the beginning just so that you can test your strength in which you what you need to make you feel better and then once you have it down pat make sure you write it down write down the recipe the way you like to make it and then you'll always have it for future reference and you can make bigger IJ's and just keep them in the fridge the other thing for women is you can also use this vaginally and it'll really help with people I have like endometriosis or just you know nasty cramps or nausea or whatever it is that you suffer from that will help as well but feel free to try both and see which one works better for you so again decarboxylate your cannabis you're going to do it at 220 degrees for one hour 200 Toyota Gries Fahrenheit one hour in the oven take it out you can use it almost immediately it doesn't really tend to hold any heat and mix your batch up let it go for a couple hours and you are ready to make your mold now if you have a little bit left over don't worry about it pour it into a little container let it go to hurt again you can use up for any other recipe you can use it to make more of these or you can use it to use in some cooking whatever works for you don't ever throw away those little bits of extras that you have leftover you can always keep them in your fridge put a little date on them so you know that when you put them in the fridge and then you can use them up as you wish so I hope you enjoyed this recipe it was a little bit different than what we normally do so hopefully it helps someone out there I did have a few requests for this one I will also see if I can find a link to find the actual suppository molds for you if you feel a little bit more comfortable doing it that way it does have a little bit nicer of a shape for insertion if that helps you at all and so I will put all the links for everything into the recipe section at the Canadian weed forum calm and I hope you will come there and join us and add your input or ask your questions whatever you would like and also if you enjoyed this video please hit the like button and we absolutely love it if you

video's purpose is to shed light on cbd and how it could be used to treat anxiety amongst many other remedies and medications out there is school stressing you out your job giving you anxiety or can you just not fall asleep at night well this just may be the video for you the use of cbd could be an effective and safe way to alleviate anxiety stress and improve your sleep but what exactly is cbd cbd is short for cannabidiol which is one of two compounds found in cannabis the other one being tetrahydrocannabine or thc for short what you may notice is that the chemical formulas of cbd and thc are almost chemically identical but they both elicit different reactions within the body the chemical structure of thc that is found in marijuana is what gives you the feeling of being high while the chemical structure of cbd which is also found in marijuana doesn't give you the feeling of being high but affects the body in different less noticeable ways cbd is known to elicit relaxing and soothing effects without the feeling of intoxication that is usually associated with marijuana marijuana and hemp are two types of cannabis plants marijuana contains a high concentration of thc with some cbd this contrasts kemp as hemp is bred to remove the majority of its thc content leaving the plant as only a good source of cbd this means you cannot get high off hemp derived cbd oils but how do we know that cbd is effective in treating anxiety one study outlined an experiment done on 65 men and women that were classified to be obese majority of the participants were in their 20s to 40s in this double-blind experiment some participants were given hemp-derived cbd oil or an olive oil placebo daily for six weeks alongside their normal diet throughout the six weeks the participants were asked about their feelings of stress as well as other factors including their overall well-being anxiety levels and sleep quality participants were also asked to complete physical activity on a regular basis the study found that overall participants who were given hemp-derived cbd were coping better with stress experiencing improved sleep quality and quantity and showed improved pleasure in life amongst many other benefits so how have people been using cbd cbd oils and creams are currently being used topically to reduce pain and inflammation teas coffee blends and even cbd infused beer help with anxiety relieve stress and help with sleep cbd has also been used to help with withdrawal symptoms panic attacks insomnia depression as well as ptsd although there is little to no side effects of cbd use as well as no proven tendencies for abuse or dependence potential cbd is still relatively new on the market cbd studies are still in the preliminary stages as long-term effects are still unknown so please before trying anything new we recommend you speak to your family doctor and inquire about cbd and find what works best for you if you are interested in learning more about the use of cbd research currently being done or the science behind it please refer to the links in the description of this video [Music] you", "EjiObSAftOc": "I think the best way and you know if I'm from a safety standpoint and certainly I think you know I'm really thinking about this as a medicine and my role as a doctor I think smoking is by not the best way to do this because when you smoke something you are literally burning the compounds so in addition to maybe altering the medicine in this case you could be in creating byproducts which may may have some other detrimental effects eating it is is tough because it's very hard to get the right dose and the right absorption of it so there is something known as vaporizing which appears to be a pretty good option I mean there's all sorts of different ways that people ingest marijuana but in this way you're super heating the marijuana but you're not burning it you can more accurately predict the dose in this case of a medicine and and you know you're not getting potentially some of the other side effects the pill forms that I heard of typically people have tried to extract the compounds from marijuana from cannabis and put it into a pill form I think they've had some success with that but the there's a scientist in Israel named masoom who really describes this thing known as the entourage effect which again means this idea that you need all the various compounds for it to work at its maximum capacity so I don't know where that research is and being able to extract all the compounds and put it in pill form I don't think that's been done yet but maybe that's where the future is headed", "9UHYp6leld0": "hi everyone my name is David Spratt and welcome to episode 10 of carp a sweat series this week we're gonna be talking and answering the question about whether CBD oil can be used to help manage the symptoms of hyper I drove this last week episode 9 everything you need to know about iontophoresis we go VIN - what iontophoresis is how it's used and how it can help in addition to some feedback that we've heard from people who have used iontophoresis machines and kind of feedback from dermatologists so this week we're really excited to dive into this very trendy topic which is CBD oil we've heard from people on reddit forums and online posts and articles that people have actually been using CBD oil to help manage the symptoms of hyperhidrosis and someone said that I've worked so we're gonna dive into that today but first my embarrassing story so about four or five years ago on Christmas Eve we went to a church ceremony and it was late I was tired and I'm so ready to go and it was it was a service that I wasn't familiar with so at the very end I I just feel like it's you know everything's coming to a close and worth into the program and everyone is sitting down and people start singing and I just jump up out of my chair like ready because I expect everyone else to stand up - and they're about a thousand twelve hundred people in this church and I look around and I'm the only one standing up and I just felt this wave of anxiety and sweat I just immediately started pouring sweat everywhere around my body my hands my feet my face my underarms everywhere started sweating it was terrible so this week sweat story comes all the way down from South Carolina one state under us from a woman named Donna Donna has a really interesting story she's had two sympathectomy x' which is as we talked in an earlier episode a surgical procedure to essentially like clip sweat glands to help reduce underarm sweat she hasn't seen any success with the sympathectomy x' and so she's still desperate for a solution and unlike our previous sweat stories Donna actually hasn't tried car pay but she's really really excited about it because nothing's worked for her she's trying to everything she's had two surgical sympathectomy x' and she she just got car pay and she's thrilled to be able to try it and Donna has a really interesting story she has a lot going on in her life outside of the two sympathectomy x' that she's had and the various other prescription and OTC solutions that she's tried to help manage her hyperhidrosis her husband needs a kidney transplant and her son is going to be the donor so everyone please keep her and her family and her thoughts her daughter just got married and she really needs some support right now and she's definitely excited about the support that car pay will bring to help manage the sweat but she can use your thoughts as well so let's dive into it so first I want to dive into what CBD oil is so CBD oil is a substance that's derived from the cannabis plant and it's called cannabidiol and THC is also derived from the cannabis plant that is like that's what gets you high and everything we're not talking about that CBD doesn't get you high it doesn't have any psychoactive effects CBD oil has been really trendy recently for helping with anxiety and epilepsy and now some people are reporting sweat however it's a really new area so no one really knows much about it so most of the findings are qualitative and based on people's personal experiences so there's not a lot of scientific research if it's really new but that research is picking up and we're starting to learn more about the impacts that CBD oil can have on epilepsy anxiety inflammation and a host of other things so how would CBD oil help with hyperhidrosis and does it so some people think that the anti-inflammatory impacts of CBD oil along with the anxiety reducing benefits of this substance can help reduce the activity of the sweat glands and actually reduce the amount of sweat that's being produced by the body so that would obviously help with hyperhidrosis now what we don't know is whether that's true or not so there's no scientific evidence that actually proves any correlation between CBD oil and reduce sweat however based on online forums and some reddit posts and what some people are saying it has helped some people and they've found some success with it so we don't really know if CBD oil does help with hyperhidrosis it could for those people that do currently use it it could be placebo we don't know it could actually help but what we have heard from these people who are really all about it is that they think the anti inflammatory and anxiety reducing aspects of CBD oil help them manage their sweat and help reduce the sweat and that makes sense to a to a degree because anxiety anxiety stimulates the the sympathetic nervous system which then stimuli it's the sweat glands which produces sweat so could be possible but we can't make any conclusions before there's scientific evidence supporting it so with that thank you so much this wraps up episode 10 of carp a sweat series and please remember if you have hyperhidrosis if you sweat a lot if you're looking for a solution check out carp a we love to have the opportunity to help you manage your sweat just like it's helped us so please check it out let us know what you think we can't wait here and please submit your sweat story to me at david at carp a lotion calm i can't

(upbeat music) - I want to try CBD because a health food store near my apartment sells it for so much money, and I don't want to buy it. So I pitched a story on trying it for Jezebel. (laughing) - Cool. - I'm generally very angry, and filled with hate. And, I also like to get wavy, and weed makes me paranoid. So hopefully this will be a good remedy for all of those things. (laughs) - I was picturing like a Monopoly piece size. - The thimble, yeah! - Yeah like the thimble. - These are like, I don't know, the size of like, a large thumb, like the tip of a large thumb. - I really thought of CBD gummies as something that rich people who love Goop and The Wing are into, however, it comes in this sort of fancy cigar box, which makes me think that they're french. (chill beat) - It's like slime, kind of. (techno beat) - You get that sort of undertaste of weed, like when you eat a regular edible marijuana. - It's more flavorful than my antidepressant. - Okay - Which I don't chew. (all laughing) - I feel pretty much the same as I did before eating the gummy, but I also just ate a lot grits and pork, I think, so I feel a little tired from that. - I feel like my normal self. My normal self I think is like, everything is fine because it has to be. - I also can't tell if it's like, oh am I just feeling the effects of something, and feel more relaxed and having a good time, or like, maybe I'm just having a good time being around all of you. - [In Unison] Aww, yeah. - But it could just be like the gummy I ate, yeah. - Oh, interesting. Cool. - I kind of felt a little light outside the studio, I had a bagel before this, so, the results might be skewed, I don't know. My results might be different, 'cuz I didn't eat it on an empty stomach. I wonder if that's better or worse? - I think that this is gonna be a video that's partially about Jezebel understanding how we react to food, because I think that some of it coincided with the lunch that we just ate. - On a daily basis, I usually feel very anxious. Constant anxiety every second of the day. I'm not feeling anything right now. - I do feel something that sounds like descriptions of people, almost when you're like, coming up or something. Almost like something's mounting, just like, very subtly or something, there's like a slight tingliness in my feet. - Sometimes with edibles, I can't really tell if I'm high, either, but then some of them I feel it like, 10 minutes after, and I can like really tell. This is more like, I can't really tell. - It's subtle. I mean I feel like, slightly different maybe, but I can't tell if that's just because I want this thing to work. - It doesn't compare to most of the other drugs that I've done, in any way shape or form. However I would actually, like, I do feel very relaxed, and I would say that it is akin to my SSRI. I did feel like actually pretty tightly wound, and quite angry, I do not feel that way anymore. So maybe it is working. My arms feel slightly weird. They kind of feel like... - Like jigglish, like kind of loose? - Kind of just loose, yeah, and it's not like when, don't do this at home, kids, it's not like when you take like MDMA or whatever, and you're like, \"Ah, I have to put my arms over my head!\" - This works more than I thought it would. I think. For sure. - Yeah. Yeah, like I wanna take the leftover box. - Yeah yeah, like, we would split the, yeah sure. - Yeah I'm not sure yet, I might just like, stick to my SSRI, but I mean, again, obviously I took my SSRI this morning and felt rage, and now I don't, so maybe I should. - Maybe you could supplement your SSRI with this. - With CBD, yeah. It just seems like, a little bit, like it's more expensive than my SSRI. It seems like a little pricey, and so perhaps the CBD industry should think about making it where it's more egalitarian, so that more people can use them. - I think these gummies might be good for people who don't want to go full-on into weed, or they maybe don't feel like vaping, or having an edible. And they just want to like, feel something nice, or calming. - I definitely think that it works, and I feel like whereas before I was very Daenerys Targaryen with my rage, now I feel more Cersei with it, where I'm very like, sort of removed from the rage, and then therefore I can use it more as a weapon, which is exciting to me. - I think it reduced my anxiety, in combination with lunch and friendship, and I think that the pain of being alive is a permanent condition. - I must agree with Katie, actually.

are created purely for education it's inevitable that there will be people who consume these substances therefore it is extremely important to educate people on the effects and how to properly use them so edible pot is a lot different than smoking it it's more potent it's processed in the body differently and the effects lasts longer the difference with edibles is that the active ingredient the chemical that gets you high THC is processed in the liver before the user experiences any effects the original THC from the edible is converted in the liver into a more potent metabolite 11 hydroxy THC it's estimated that this compound is about four to five times more psycho active than normal THC and because the edible has to go through a portion of the digestive process before effects can be felt it can take 30 minutes - as long as two hours before a user feels any effects because of this people who don't feel any effects after an hour so might want to reduce only to have the entire thing hit them like a train all at once an hour later so my advice just wait it out it may take a while but it will come on and unlike smoking cannabis in which the effects last about two hours and gradually drop off after a quick climax right after inhalation edible pot takes its time before it reaches its peak in effect and this peak lasts longer typically the effects of edibles lasts four to eight hours when it comes to the effects there are certainly similarities between smokeable and edible weed but there are some properties that appear to only occur strictly on edibles there are two main reasons someone would want to consume an edible the first is for medical benefits such as aiding symptom relief of stress or anxiety or to help one sleep and the second is simply just for recreational purposes just to have a high and have a time aside from these two reasons there are actually a few people in the psychedelic community who use edibles and very high doses in a similar way to what one would use LSD or magic mushrooms for but we'll touch on that aspect at the end of the video so now we are going to get into what you can expect to feel from the different doses of weed edibles but firstly it's important to know that tolerance is everything tolerance plays a huge role in your experience and if you're an everyday pot smoker you'll likely have to take a much larger dose of an edible that someone who has no tolerance to THC in order to feel the same effect so take the following effects of doses I give with a grain of salt as this is just generally what you can expect to feel when you take this particular dose so first off we have the micro dose and this ranges anywhere from one milligram to about 2.5 milligrams of THC it's unlikely you'll experience any active effects from this dose but it is possible for people who are hypersensitive to the effects of THC this dose is more just for purposes such as mild relief of pain stress anxiety etc people who Micro's THC edibles might also report increased creativity and focus the effects of this dose are pretty passive you likely won't feel any different fundamentally this can be somewhat compared to people who micro doze LSD and magic mushrooms who do so for similar purposes next we have the low dose which ranges from two point five milligrams to about 15 milligrams and the two ends of the spectrum can be very different especially for people with low tolerance to th see someone consuming the edible for medicinal purposes will experience stronger symptom relief and this dose can also be used for people who have trouble sleeping you may begin to feel a sense of euphoria and that classic high feeling where coordination is slightly impaired and overall perception is altered but if this dose the high is unlikely to be overwhelming and because of this this may be a good dose to try for a first-timer in my own experience there isn't a significant difference between this dose and edible in your average smoking weed high the medium dose ranges from 15 to 30 milligrams someone with a decent THC tolerance still may not be feeling heavy effects here but for many vistas can make them pretty high it's at those dose that people may start to feel negative effects such as anxiety and paranoia you might ask if people use weed for relief of anxiety stress then how could this dose bring on anxiety and stress well THC has biphasic effects which means the substance can have opposite effects in different doses anxiety can be reduced in lower doses but can actually be stronger in higher doses so if you're taking edibles for symptom relief it is important to be aware of these biphasic effects the drug in half coordination and perception will likely be altered at this dose that agree to which it is altered will likely depend on your tolerance some people might start to get the classic red eyes from being high maybe some people experience close eye visuals for me personally I tend to have a close eye visual on low to medium dose weed that looks kind of like this let me know if you have experienced the same type of visual in the comments the high dose ranges from 30 to 50 milligrams this dose will likely bring a significant high even to someone with tolerance and for someone with low tolerance this can bring an extreme high their coordination will definitely be impaired somewhat you might feel a strong euphoria maybe you'll feel very laughy some people's mouths get very dry and get cottonmouth this is due to THC mimicking a naturally occurring chemical called an and amide which binds to cannabinoid receptors in our saliva glands which causes saliva production to decrease you might also get the classic munchies and just want to absolutely binge eat it's important to remember that the effects of THC impacts everyone differently so no two people's high will be exactly the same and you likely will only experience some of the effects I listed not all the very high dose ranges from 50 to 100 milligrams I would say it's more likely than not that you will probably experience some negative effects at this dose but the high may become so intense you may feel uncomfortable or overwhelmed people often experience a rapid heart rate panic nausea in headaches at this dose so definitely don't venture into this realm if you don't know what you're doing for someone with an extremely high tolerance this dose might not be too heavy but for the average person this will likely be overwhelming there are still medicinal benefits at this dose but is only used for people who really need it as this dose is sometimes using cancer patients to boost appetite and is also used for people with certain inflammatory disorders personally any dose at this range or above just completely puts me on my ass the come-up is nice for me as I feel very laughy energetic and social but once the effects really start peaking I honestly begin to struggle to stay awake and wish to do nothing else but to find a cozy place to lie down and fall asleep this may have been due to the strain though as THC isn't the only psychoactive chemical we it's just the most prominent CBD is the chemical that aids with sleep and this chemical also plays a role in the overall effects of the weed and the amount of CBD in the strain will most definitely impact your experience and finally the extremely high dose is going to be anything above 100 milligrams I've heard of some edibles having 250 milligrams some having 500 and even some containing as much as a thousand milligrams obviously the effects will get significantly higher as those increases a 100 milligram edible might not be incredibly strong for someone with a very high tolerance but certainly 500 milligrams is going to put anybody on their ass be very careful of consuming edibles this powerful as there will certainly be negative effects due to the intensity it's in these very high doses that have experienced visuals reminiscent of a psychedelic trip on say LSD the visual might be something kind of like this and speaking of psychedelics there's many people who report having psychedelic like trips from high doses of weed edibles the world-famous Joe Rogan likes to discuss edible pot as along the same lines as psychedelics such as LSD psilocybin mushrooms and DMT saying that edible pot can take you down the rabbit hole there's a comment I found from someone on reddit that I thought described as similarity of the psychedelic feeling on high-dose edibles perfectly not long ago I did a hundred milligrams of THC edibles and had zero tolerance on my couch my eyes closed and no music it was awesome and the peak was over three hours I swam through the psychedelic mind a tunnel with many doors and behind each door was a memory of mine I went through them and had Total Recall I could recall past memories memories of being born my first laugh before thinking and the experience that my first thought as an infant the pure thrill of thinking now the effects of THC in the brain is nowhere close to resembling that of a psychedelic classical psychedelics interact directly with the 5-htt to a receptor in the brain and cannabis does not do this from doing research it seems to be that weed edibles tend to resemble psychedelics more often for people who have already had experiences with psychedelics in the past it's likely more often that this psychedelic feeling is also associated with strains with higher THC levels and lower CBD levels as CBDs antipsychotic effects will likely lessen the psychedelic effect but if you find yourself feeling like you're in the middle of an intense psychedelic trip I'll say what I've always said before let the experience consume you surrender to the substance let your mind flow freely and try not to attach yourself to these thoughts just simply observe don't make any attachments so that's about it for this video hopefully you have a better idea on what you can expect to feel by the different doses of weed edibles if you're new start low THC affects everyone slightly differently so see how you react to the substance stay safe consume responsibly and you'll be fine if you seek to support my work on a deeper level consider joining the patreon I run a book club on there where we read one book a month about topics we go over on this channel if that interests you definitely consider joining as always guys have a great day and peace [Music]", "qqvJOAV7oAc": "it was 2012 at the age of 12 that you then became one of a very very exclusive club one that you never want to get into one in seven billion five people on the planet have Langerhans cell sarcoma what's that there's not a lot of research into it so I'm not too sure on what it is it's it's very confusing yeah so that should treatment you were facing that the doctors recommended was a bone-marrow transplant yeah it was extensive chemo radiotherapy and then yeah and then bone marrow transplant and you didn't have just one transplant this was three that you had to have and and how did you get on with that well they failed until the first free yeah they were not - it's not too trouble so it's not it's not a big problem to have and then after that this isn't as a mum because he then really began to suffer ya have to watch himself and how bad was it um well after the fourth transplant they told us that you know the first three had failed and and literally all they had was one more chance for him they had one more bag of his own cells no more they were there you know they'd stress the the the thing to us that there was no more chances after this and and unfortunately three days after he had his final transplant he tracked his fingers down side of the bed and then picked up some infections now obviously infections with no immune system whatsoever and no way for an immune system to even even start to build within his body he was literally being kept alive by antibiotics that's what they told us he did get incredibly ill throughout his whole treatment he'd been very happy and smiley and he'd always been tried to be quite jovial but actually those last those last couple of months are very very difficult he was in a lot of pain you would given I think three days three days a week at most is what they told me when I asked him the the timescale you planned your funeral haven't you yeah to what extent all of it we're gonna do it was gonna be fancy dress and I'd chosen all the costumes for people and it was gonna be quite embarrassing for some of the people though yeah who actually said you want you wanted to go yeah I did he was looking forward to it after four years of treatment it's enough enough was enough so this story then takes at him yeah entirely different turn how did that happen through lots of research I've done lots of research on to see when his secondary cancer arrived and it was so unknown I then said I turned to the internet inside looking and and over the over the following months and couple of years afterwards cannabis just kept popping up people kept emailing me you need to try this you need to nice if he hasn't got cancer you know the cancers have gone this is now a completely different issue it won't work for him is no but I would dismiss it and dismiss it and actually came to the point where I was in hospital with Darren and he was so incredibly ill and really on a high dose of morphine he was actually now on fentanyl which they can't go any further than that and it wasn't working against his hand and and the other issues he had with his stomach and I asked the doctor for bedrock on which is a cannabis based pain relief so it's available in Europe and because I've done I didn't you know I don't know I wanted to go through the proper measures and she actually told me we can't because it hasn't been licensed for children so you know and and more of it came out but people just kept saying and I thought you know what what to lose and you've got nothing nothing nothing to lose it that's dying anyway you know so they just rejoin your antibiotics at this point there was no other treatment so you took this yeah and you asked him and you said yeah yeah I was happy to what did you notice how quickly to think oh my god I mean I honestly do the effect of it blew my mind it wasn't what I expected all I expected too it's done live a research and some people use cannabis to kind of alleviate their anxiety and and some pain and that's what Devin was really experiencing on day 17 when they said there's definitely nothing in his bone marrow there's nothing there you've now just got to wait seven got very anxious and said well how much longer do I have to wait they started to trying up the morphine introduced sleeping tablets and so that's when I actually gave it and within half an hour's hours it administered under the tongue sublingually it's just a tincture it's it's it's not the oil that people talk about it was just a teenager then what we know it's within half an hour to an hour but he was just chilled out he just relaxed the anxiety stopped he no longer was panicking and he was able to just he was able to be compas mentis which he wasn't able to be on the belly always the health-wise I mean actually things being tested against you your white blood cells began to go up yeah after five days or C they told us nothing in his bone marrow so gave it to him five days later when the bandages came off his hand and we saw a healthy fingers which we were told there was no way they were under there when we saw a healthy finger see the doctor started panicking this was now based 75 after the transplant and he was then Tony be there for three three days yeah and nobody has ever engrafted after fifty days so day 75 and all of a sudden his white count has appeared the doctors start running around frantically doctors from Bristol Children's Hospital were called in to do some more blood tests which I said well there's no point you told me on your week ago there's nothing there and obviously in the blood count it was there it's very small but it was there and to test the theory you actually withdrew the cannabis after a little while and the blood count started to go down okay so where are you now how are you now perfectly healthy I'm glad you're normal you stress this is this is this doesn't work for everybody this is not a cure no this is something that worked for you and you could be prosecuted let's be honest well the under current laws in England the world's cannabis is not registered as having any therapeutic value anyone using the drug if medical reasons could be charged for possession possession carrying a maximum sentence of five years in jail or an unlimited fine fascinating story it was so happy that you're here and healthy good luck with the diner he wants to he wants to open his own vegan American an apprenticeship as a chef then you know please who would not want to the boy in seven billion yes you", "hOybxMsJIkk": "welcome back in this video we're going to be taking a look at different cannabis etfs so we're going to be taking a look at six of the largest cannabis etfs the reason why it was so important for me to make this video is because the quality of these etfs varies very significantly so unlike other sectors where you can buy different etfs and have relatively similar performance in cannabis you can buy one etf and do very very well and then buy another and do very poorly so we're going to take a look at all the different etfs within the space so the six etfs that we'll be reviewing here today will be mj we'll be looking at msos we'll be looking at yolo hmmj and thcx so without further ado let's hop into this and what we'll be looking at with these companies we're going to take a look if they're actively managed or if they track an index uh we're going to take a look at the management expense ratio how much you're actually paying to hold the etfs we're going to take a look at how much each fund has under management and most importantly this is what we'll be mainly focusing on is the holdings in the fund i don't mind paying a higher fee if the holdings are higher quality so ultimately that's going to be the determining factor of how these funds rank and as always i'm not a financial advisor this is not financial advice this is made to be entertaining purposes only so to start it off might as well go in alphabetical order here starting off we have hmmj management expense ratio of 0.86 with assets under management of 684 million fun fact this was actually the first cannabis etf ever launched uh so what we're going to be looking at here we're not going to be looking at uh if the fund is tradable or the short-term opportunities we're really going to be focusing in on the long-term sustainability of these funds we're going to be taking a look at the actual fundamentals of the underlying holdings within these funds so because hmmj is listed on the toronto stock exchange it actually limits them from owning companies that operate in the u.s but we will still look at this objectively for what it is which is a canadian fund so starting off with their largest holding canopy growth definitely the best canadian operator seemingly the only canadian operator with a meaningful strategy to enter the states uh through acreage and terrace end so without a question the best canadian operator in my opinion uh aphria not super crazy about afria not a terrible operator either uh i'm kind of neutral on afria kronos only thing holding this company together seemingly is the ultria partnership other than that company doesn't seem like it has too much going for them uh gw pharma definitely a great company no complaints there same with iipr big fan of that company these are gw pharma is more of a research related company and ipr is a reit in the states uh that is listed on the new york stock exchange uh scott's miracle grow not really a cannabis company more of a fort fertilizer company only one third of the revenues actually come from cannabis then we have tilray which is merging with aphria village farms probably one of the highest quality cannabis operators as well and then everything under that is relatively small holdings just looking through it we have aurora hexo organogram sundial none of these am i too crazy about um so those definitely take away from the fun but the top holdings are all looking all right as far as canadian operators go next up we have hmus listed on the neo exchange that's when you don't hear too often this is also managed by horizon management expense ratio higher at one percent so now on the flip side from hmm j's uh fund uh hmus is actually 100 in the states so this one i am a much bigger fan of if you're looking at the holdings uh they own some great multi-state operators you have columbia care green thumb true leaf cresco cure leaf paris and jucie all of these names i am a big fan of uh charlotte's web i'm so so on acreage as well uh tuscan holdings is a spack as far as i'm uh aware uh you have air and liberty which are going to merge hopefully within the next uh within the next quarter uh but just looking through the holdings here everything looks fine i'm not seeing anything that sticks out as a really bad holding other than med men at a very low weighting of 0.75 so overall this is a great uh fund only thing that i'm not crazy about here is that it is uh traded on the neo uh so definitely a lot less liquidity than some of the funds that would be listed on the toronto stock exchange or on the new york stock exchange so now next up we have mj for some reason this is the largest cannabis etf in the world assets under management of nearly 1.8 billion with a management expense ratio of 0.75 percent so aside from hmmj which i feel did a great job building a canadian portfolio uh mj we'll take a look at their holdings here uh so you have aphro tilray as a quarter of the whole portfolio not sure why they would have that above canopy grove but they have that as the top holding then we have gw farm growgen that's all fine and then that this is where we run into a hiccup we have chronos aurora hexo and organogram as relatively large positions in the portfolio which i'm not too crazy about now to take a look at msos managed by advisor shares this one currently has assets under management of 684 million which has ballooned since they initially launched with a management expense ratio of 0.75 now if we look at msos's holdings it's actually very similar to what i have as my top 10 cannabis stocks for 2021. i'll actually link that video down below so you can take a look but this is very similar to what i have here so this portfolio is a hundred percent listed in the states and it's quality so you have green thumb cure leaf true leaf and cresco as the big four those are forty percent of the portfolio and then you have all your tier two names that you'd want uh so you have ayer you have tara send columbia care harvest health and juicy then you have the ancillary place as well grow gen and ipr this portfolio is great this is pretty well everything that you'd want i think i couldn't have done a better job allocating this myself and next up we have thcx this is actually the smallest one on this list with assets under management of 126 million and a management expense ratio of 0.95 uh so same thing here they actually have their top holdings as the afria tilray combo uh then you have grogen canopy growth village farms and gw farm which is definitely a fine uh those are all fine names uh but then here's the thing again you have um you have organogram you have aurora you have hexo you have supreme down there so this one's a little bit more spread out it's less concentrated towards the top and it has it's more spread out again uh among some of the uh smaller cap names which are lower quality which i'm not too crazy about and then finally we have yolo also managed by advisor shares an actively managed etf uh this one has assets under management of 367 million and a management expense ratio of 0.75 percent now this one here is a hybrid of both canada and u.s companies uh the thing with this one here is it seems like their weightings are just upside down uh so you have the kind of top names in canada you have vff you have uh gw farm you have aphrya cgc grojan these are all fine names but then the thing is is after these names then you have cure leaf you have harvest health ahead of true leave and then you have cure leaf columbia care cresco labs so it just seems like the waiting on this is a little bit backwards so if we were to rank these etfs from best to worse the way i would rank them is the us names at the top so you would have ms os as the best hmus as number two then the hybrid play which is yolo as number three uh then i would put the best canadian etf which is hmmj as fourth then thc x and then mj so that's my list again not financial advice this is strictly my opinion overall i'm a much bigger fan of the u.s market over the canadian just because you have 10 times the addressable market overall much bigger fan of the fundamentals in the states the canadian names could do better over shorter periods of time sometimes you see short-term outperformance but usually it's just based off of trades and hypes us really delivers the long-term fundamental value the youtube algorithm absolutely hates me so if this provides any value to you at all please consider liking commenting and subscribing so i can fight this youtube algorithm and get to a wider audience but overall thank you so much for watching very much appreciate it and have a great week you", "D_4Ey_W7Q48": "MANY USERS SAY IT WORKS WONDERS AND SOME DOCTORS REMAIN WORKS WONDERS AND SOME DOCTORS REMAIN SKEPTICAL.

In fact, in the 1930s there was a newspaper\nheadlines about homicide cases in New York people would say just being the room with\nmarijuana was enough to give them homicidal vibrations and to cause them to go violent\nand kill people. This was an absurd idea, but it was part of\nthe era of reefer madness. All of this is just to tell you that the effects\nthat a drug has on the psyche, especially a psychologically activating drug or psychoactive\ndrug has a lot to do with how we perceive it, the context that it's introduced to us\nin, and it's not just all about chemistry and neuro-chemistry and pharmacology and receptors. So it's important to understand the psychological\neffects of marijuana have a lot to do with how the user, the consumer, of marijuana is\nprepared to experience it. That's called expectation. There's actually a whole field called social\npharmacology. So that's social pharmacology 101. Now given that there are still some effects\nthat you can imagine in a naive or first-time user of a drug; very famously it was written\nabout in a sociology journal called Becoming a Marijuana User in the 1950s by Howard Becker. And he talked about how the user of marijuana\nreally just has to learn to get used to its effects; sometimes there's no effect initially,\na dis subsequent effects they have to learn to use what's called a relaxation response,\nassociate its use with an idea of chilling out or relaxing. And what does that have to do with? That has to do with the stress axis in the\nbody that the chemicals in marijuana actually interact with. And it's possible that that's what the body\nis kind of tapping into. Now placebo marijuana exists in studies and\npeople get the same effects that they would get from regular marijuana, because they are\nexpecting these things. So you have to always keep that in mind. The placebo effect is very strong with psychologically\nactivating drugs. But overall, if you poll many thousands of\npeople who have used marijuana they will all say that, or the vast majority will talk about\na stress relief or relaxation psychologically, a state that is both activating and relaxed\nat the same time. And people will talk about improved mood,\nand sense of well being. And all of that is related to the receptors\nin the brain that are in the higher portions of our cortex. The more advanced parts of our brain that\nare involved with mood and thought and as I mentioned, the stress axis, the hypothalamus. So those are some of the most commonly viewed\npsychological effects. Now in people who are fearful, or maybe have\na negative reaction, you can see reactions of paranoia, or confusion, or sedation, or\ndizziness, all those kinds of things can be also seen. And certainly when people are concerned about\nhow their use of this substance will be viewed by authorities or there can always be a reaction\nof a higher heart rate or kind of a fear reaction. Again, there is a little bit of an increase\nin your heart rate with marijuana, but if you are anxious about that, that'll cause\nyour heart rate to go up even further. So there's a lot of feedback to how the user\nis going to experience the effect. So a little bit of a psychological effect\nof marijuana.", "FSdjvEnyRzk": "what you're watching right now is mark zarlor committing a crime that helps his daughter who cannot help herself 17 years ago Christie's art ler gave birth to twin girls Keely her twin came home first and then three days later Cara followed her and they began the difficult years long task of learning how to treat Cara's cerebral palsy and severe autism this is an anti-psychotic there are antipsychotics and enzymes and sleep aids but few things helped fight off the worst of her symptoms that could sometimes go on for hours pretty much on a daily basis we have some sort of episode when it's heating up I turn off the fan I have a level eighth of a teaspoon when Mark found the one thing that could stop his daughter he made this video to show the world it takes six deep breaths and a father's dedication [Music] let me up okay [Music] are the videos the truth right that's typical of what we see a neighbor first suggested years ago that cannabis could ease Kara's symptoms mark then found that by grinding marijuana buds and heating them to 410 degrees Fahrenheit it created an immediate rescue response to his Donner's most violent behavior and by 10 she's usually back out here enjoying annoying life again for several years we were in fear of using it trying it giving it to her having it but now there is no fear for those artless who risked everything by posting the video of mark illegally treating Kara that more than 12,000 people have seen and by talking to us I just I got to the point where we looked at the law and said the law is not going to change unless somebody Gamble's in his post mark asks the Texans call their state senators demanding a public hearing on Senate bill 269 it would expand the access of patients with debilitating illnesses to use medical marijuana for Kara that law could make moments of calm come legally and if showing what works for her puts mark in jail so be it [Music] just saying if we want to make a difference for ourselves and for you know other kids like Cara we just hit somebody has to take the risk he's another father who'll do anything for his daughter

THC Tincher is recommended for patients with a higher tolerance to THC those with a lower tolerance should try the one-to-one tensors with equal amounts of CBD and THC usually around 100 to 200 milligrams each packaging for this cannabis Tincher is exactly as you'd expect it to be a small box housing a glass bottle with a dropper for the medicine the box is quite lovely with shimmery silver text and an elegant butterfly logo though details were a bit scant on the box the bottle itself is made of translucent glass muted and scuffed by a matte finish the dropper is functional and easy to use though the twist off cap was a little difficult to open overall this presentation favors functionality and there's nothing wrong with that the dropper works well and the glass has a great look and feel this tin sure is oil-based made with full spectrum cannabis oil MCT oil organic grapeseed oil a proprietary terpene blend as well as yellow cake flavor extract and that extract takes a front seat each time i medicated it felt as though I had finished a heaping plate of delicious birthday cake I didn't note any strong terpene flavors nor did the cannabis oil have that green leafy taste that extracts and oils can sometimes have but there was a subtle through thread like a dash of lemon accenting the delightful cake flavor medicinally this tin sure didn't work right away from me which left me initially disappointed but after an hour or so my worries about this product faded as I was hit with a proverbial wave of relaxation and restfulness my body fell into a state of total comfort and all I wanted to do was sleep and sleep I did euphoria with this tin sure is mild at least it was for me for those with a lower tolerance this teacher may produce more euphoria always remember to take it slow with any edible oil or tin sure start with a low dose and work your way up to a dose that best suits your needs even better I also noted that inflammation in pain lessened after using this Tincher and those effects like the restfulness lasted several hours I normally find myself reaching for Advil by the end of the day but to be honest I'll likely continue using this Tincher as a

the piston length for the cart size you are filling perform a couple of initial fills to make sure there are no air bubbles still trapped in the piston if there is you will hear a sharp fizzing make sure to leave some space from the bottom of the cart when you press the pedal to avoid spillage take care to not overfill try to finish the entire run to avoid reheating your mixture when switching flavors purge and clean thoroughly time is crucial when it comes to capping after you fill filling while hot will prevent large air bubbles also make sure the rubber gaskets are intact this prevents

"Hey everyone, welcome back its master-blaster and we're back at Johnny's green extractions Alright today, we're gonna show you how to make your own CBD edible oil, so if you have any arthritis Anxiety insomnia Back pain this might help you out. We're ready to start with our procedure As you can see we have a quart we're going to be working with a quarter pound of mazar-e-sharif I hope I pronounced that correctly because Where we live that was a highest CBD plant that we could find. I'm sure out in Colorado. There's a lot of Really high CBD plants. You could probably get out there What we're going to do is we're going to crush this up a little bit in our little bullet here and then we're going to fill up our 14-inch extraction tube And just show you some of the bud and it looks like It's filling up a little bullet now, we're gonna grind it a bit All right You guys I should mention that if you want to make your own medicine As far as CBD oil goes you have to work with a plant that is high in CBD You have to use a  marijuana plant, basically Indica sativa, whatever that has a high count of CBD because They can go up to at least 20% in these plants So that is crucial if you want to make effective medicine Almost make it like the material like you're all in a joint not too too fine Okay, we're getting close to the top we're gonna use These unbleached filters, I'm gonna put I'm gonna put three of them on So Get all the wheat off there all right, so We should probably stick these outside because we're sitting at minus 40 right now So you should end up if you order a machine like this You'll end up with some legs like this and the machine and I'm going to simply throw this together Set a legs and throw that bad boy in there Leave enough room for your can about right tighten their down And then we're going to add the can with the proper tip, which I have I Believe this is the one I was using that work quite well in there Strapper it alright, so this is ready to take outside and to Start blasting. We're gonna cool the tube off before we do it though, and then we're gonna throw we're going to throw three cans through 14-inch - Alright folks we're gonna set her off here outside This is the This is the juice. We got out of doing the extracting with the green machine. Now we've We've placed it on this element that is The spark resistant it's it's safe And I've set this to 160 F Normally, we don't do it that high for shatters and stuff but we're making a an edible CBD oil here and our next step here is going to be to decarboxylate it so that if you ingest it, you will get a medical effect from it and We're gonna do that at roughly 250 degrees Fahrenheit for about 20 to 25 minutes Then we're gonna soak it up into little syringes and it'll be ready to apply under your tongue also, this process here was done without a perjure because of the amount of heat that we used that was sufficient enough to Let all the butane rise and escape So it's a pretty clean product. This is also the same way as you would make your butane honey oil If you didn't have a perjure, that's a great option for you That's it subscribe you guys thumbs up peace we'll see in the next video", "qSyQEx-hd0c": ">> >> METRO >> METRO WANTS >> METRO WANTS TO >> METRO WANTS TO REMIND >> METRO WANTS TO REMIND\nWRITERS >> METRO WANTS TO REMIND\nWRITERS LIKE >> METRO WANTS TO REMIND\nWRITERS LIKE TO >> METRO WANTS TO REMIND\nWRITERS LIKE TO KEEP >> METRO WANTS TO REMIND\nWRITERS LIKE TO KEEP PRACTICING WRITERS LIKE TO KEEP PRACTICING WRITERS LIKE TO KEEP PRACTICING\nSOCIAL WRITERS LIKE TO KEEP PRACTICING\nSOCIAL DISTANCING.

Z's here smoking cannabis or vaporizing cannabis or eating cannabis or injecting cannabis whatever you want to do with it is it good does it I got an email recently I said someone said hey this it doesn't have a place in growth or is it all just about comfort and so I'm gonna answer a few questions about cannabis obviously it's a huge topic so this is not a comprehensive there's just some quick thoughts of seeing in my own life my own relationships with it as well as just working with lots of clients who all have different experiences with cannabis and other substances for the sake of this video I'm gonna leave it to just cannabis not lumping all substances together because they're all extremely different so there are a couple ways that people use cannabis the short answer is I think it can have a place in your growth it's not like in order to grow and overcome social anxiety and become more confident you have to stop using it entirely having said that though I found that there are a couple ways people use cannabis one is the most rare which is as a self-awareness building tool so that means they smoke or vapor something and then they go out into nature and go for a walk or they rock climb or run or or journal or meditate maybe spend time with a friend and have a good conversation that I'm in that case you know confidence can be enhancing your awareness increase your self-awareness especially with meditation or other things that can help you go deeper and can be a valuable tool now most people don't use it that way maybe even some people say they're gonna use it that way and then we end up doing what munchies I want it I want to eat as much pleasurable stuff for my tongue and throat as possible right it's like what tastes good in here and feels good going down here past my heart soothes me forget about what it does to my stomach and my waistline you know get high and just zone out watch movies play video games other stuff like that that is not helping you grow obviously that's used as a coping mechanism as a as a way to reduce intensity of uncomfortable feelings usually anxiety so in that case I would say that it is hindering growth because it's not giving you the ability to learn other tools to handle and cope with the anxiety now I was just speaking with someone recently who said yeah but you know my ex-husband has such bad social anxiety that he needs to smoke pot all day every day just to function to go to the supermarket you know in which case he's using it like a medicine and is that bad I was like well here's the thing whether it's an anti you know SSRI antidepressant for anxiety or cannabis or any other medicine when if we're in a place where we just can't even function help is good right I'm not against medicines and the use of medicines it's just that when we can't function and and and pain is high our motivation to do [ __ ] and fix it is high and I think that's really good that was what transformed my life all the clients that I work with that I have extreme you know life transforming gains are the ones who are coming in with like I can't live another day another week another year like this and so they're motivated and they're willing to do whatever it takes just like I was and as a result they transform so pain being high desire for solution being high it's not a problem the problem is if our pain is high and then we find something that that that deadens it quite a bit now all of a sudden our drive to find a solution what happens to that well that goes down too and so her ex-husband you know maybe it he's like okay I'm gonna use this because it helps me but then you know you use it for a day or a week or a month and all of a sudden you're like this kind of works fine the side effects aren't so bad I don't really notice that the the grogginess and the lack of motivation and other stuff like that that can come from chronic cannabis use so that's something to be aware of obviously using it as an escape be aware of that watch out for that even if you're using it for personal growth and self-awareness you don't really need it for that it can be helpful for that but there's better ways to get that you know check out wim HOF and doing like breathing techniques to get into an altered state just go for a long run work out you know just if we can do a juice cleanse do stuff it's gonna be like net positive and has no negative effects because cannabis people like to deny it and say oh it has no negative effects whatsoever but look just study studied beak you don't need scientific studies I mean you can look at those and you can get a general swath of the if there's really negative effects which there usually aren't from cannabis right I mean maybe chronic heavy use you can experience some rebound anxiety or depression if you stop using it but for the most part you're not like horribly hungover from cannabis there's no terrible toxic effects so the research only goes so far you got to study with any research at the end of the day it's like your own you must study yourself become more and more self-aware so after you smoke pot what is your experience like the next day if you smoke at three or four five days in a row or vape it or whatever what is your experience after that now what I found in me and I've seen it in clients as well is the next day there can be a subtle increase for a desire for pleasure it's probably because of the you know the dopamine increasing effects of the cannabis so I am gonna want to eat something sweeter I'm gonna want to do something a little more pleasurable I'm gonna be a little less inclined to discomfort and work and effort and a little more inclined to comfort and ease and safety and I think that builds up over time and that's what I've seen in people that are chronic cannabis users is there a threshold for how much discomfort they can handle is lower so what that means is look anything that you want to do in your life you're going to be uncomfortable if it's worth it right so taking on something more physical growth strength in your body with your diet you know growing in your career learning something new building your social confidence it all requires what an ability to be uncomfortable and so cannabis can't undermine that that's just what I've seen obviously you might have a different experience with us I'm not saying it's that way for everyone but I think when people they get attached to it it feels good it helps them feel better I've seen that in my own life you know I had a habit I mean I wasn't younger in college I would use it at least twice a week and I was loved less than most of my friends but I was like you know in computer science and then wanting to like do well in my early years of college and then but in more recent years that's in the last year or two I would probably do it maybe once a week and maybe once every other week and I would just notice these effects and I would be like yeah that's whatever it's worth it I have a good time and it's helpful but and I don't know maybe the last couple months I've just said you know what I'm just like why what if I just don't do use it at all so my own current experience isn't it's not using it at all and it's an interesting experiment I I seem to notice that it's nice not to have any subtle energy drains those are my experiences what are yours I'm not the final word I'm not the authority on cannabis this is just some stuff that you know how does it relate to confidence and social anxiety that's the thing that I'm an expert on and this is just what I've seen in my practice working with you know thousands of people now at this point so what's your experience though helpful not helpful helpful at first and then a crutch like

produce comes from indica strains indica strains tend to relax a person and give them more sleep rest and sleep are part of the healing process place the starting material preferably good bud in a plastic container dampen the bud material in the container with the solvent you are using then crush the bud material after the bud has been crushed add more solvent until the material is completely covered I generally use pure naphtha but 99% isopropyl alcohol also works well as a solvent as do many other substances work and stir the contents to let the THC dissolve into the solvent this process takes two to three minutes drain the solvent from the starting material and put it through a coffee filter the solvent now resembles the color of gasoline due to the presence of the hemp oil in the solvent make sure the area where you are going to boil the solvent off is very well ventilated the idea is to carry the fumes away from the boiling solvent to reduce the danger of an explosion",

marijuana is now the law of the land in new jersey but it comes with some real problems especially for new jersey employers here is top employment attorney michael riccobono from the firm of ogletree deacons to explain thanks so much for your time sir i know that the state politicians businesses all of us are trying to navigate through the new recreational marijuana law let's talk specifically about businesses how how do they set parameters what what what rules and laws can they make within their own business even if they're contrary to the state law sure well it's at the the new marijuana law in new jersey it represents a radical change in new jersey employment law the good news for employers is that nothing in this new law prohibits them from still prohibiting employees from using marijuana on the work site or during work hours employers can still prohibit employees from possessing marijuana on the work site or during work hours and it also can employers can still prohibit employees from being under the influence at the work site or during work hours the change in the law actually provides someone provides employees with some employment protections most notably what the law does is it prohibits employers from terminating or taking any adverse employment action against an employee or an applicant solely because they fail a drug test for marijuana so no longer can the results of a drug test a failed drug test for marijuana serve as the sole basis for an employer to take an adverse employment action against an employee aren't the two things you just said in conflict that they do have they do you can prevent an employee or or have rules against an employee showing up high and at the same time if you test them and they are high you can't let them go it does present some conflict um the law really looks at um what is going on at the workplace right so it actually regulates off-duty or off-conduct um actions such as you know taking marijuana right so on the work site or during work hours employers can still prohibit the use possession and being under the influence of marijuana but simply a failed drug test for marijuana can no longer serve as the basis for um an adverse employment action there are other circumstances for example the employee violated policies or um did something did someone engage in some other conduct that is prohibited under the law the employer would need to point to that in addition to the failed drug test in order to take that adverse action against the employee in that situation so if someone is high at work or gets high at work on their lunch break and comes back but they're highly functional there's nothing you can do if they're under the influence during the work during work hours or at the work site the law says you can still take adverse action against them you can't let them go you can let them you can terminate their employees how are you going to prove that they were high by taking the drug test right and and that's one of the difficulties with the current state of marijuana testing is that there is no uh medically accepted acceptable test right now which shows is the isn't it is an individual currently under the influence of marijuana like we do with alcohol so what employers are going to need to do is they're going to need to rely on objective um evidence and and contemporaneous observations of the employee another thing about this new law is that it requires employers to use a what the law refers to as a workplace impairment recognition expert and these are folks that are supposed to be trained in determining and evaluating whether an individual is under the influence of marijuana so going forward anytime an employer wants to drug test for marijuana they're all they will also need to do this physical examination that is conducted by one of these so-called wire experts these workplace impairment recognition experts it seems like everyone i talked to about this law and i know they had trouble with it and they there was it was legislative wrestling till the end and even the governor wasn't happy with it when he signed it it seems like there's so many so much conflict especially for law enforcement and for employers that they need to go back to the drawing board and and fix some of this with legislation would you agree with that when it comes to businesses i i would particularly with respect to the employment protections uh and parts of the bill parts of the law that affect employees at the workplace the the good news i think for employers and employees alike is that the law does require the cannabis regulatory commission to promulgate rules and regulations that are going to be that are going to implement some of these employment related protections in the law and the the law says that those rules and regulations are supposed to be promulgated within the next 180 days or so so we're looking forward employers are looking forward to those rules and regulations which will hopefully provide some clarity on the the anti-discrimination aspects of the law as well as the drug testing aspects of the law and how those are supposed to work in practice and whether there's any type of safety sensitive exceptions to the law for employees that are whose job duties require them to for example operate a forklift or heavy machinery and and what kind of exceptions might an employer be able to rely upon for those employees that are either public facing or again involved in a safety sensitive position so we're hopeful within the next six months or so employers will get some some clarity on exactly how the law is to be applied in practice well when they tighten this up or they give you some clarity let's talk again thanks so much for your time sounds good larry thanks for having me attorney michael riccobono from ogletree deacons still to come on jersey matters most of us if not all of us have been for a cova test so what's the process like we'll take you on a tour [Music] next", "tN7wF7UlTQA": "hey everybody and welcome to Lexus world today I figured we take a little bit of a break from the growing tutorials and that kind of thing and talk a little bit about cannabis allergies and cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome as a cannabis blogger I email back and forth with people all the time and people leave comments all the time and these are all folks who are really experienced cannabis consumers and as a result I've had a totally unintentional but a terrific eye in the sky for both cannabis allergies and cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome the latter of which is surprisingly common amongst heavy cannabis users but was virtually unknown as little as fifteen years ago and yet the latter can also be a very serious problem and it warrants serious discussion to ensure that it doesn't get out of hand that I'm not seeing a whole lot of education about it out there so let's talk about both first let's talk about the slightly lighter topic of cannabis allergies just like with any other allergy anybody who has a predisposition to allergies to herbs can develop an allergy to cannabis and unfortunately it's one of those things where like with every other allergy it doesn't necessarily have to be a lifelong thing that you've always had you can develop an allergy so there are some people who consume cannabis for years they don't experience any problems and then suddenly one day they're finding that they're having an allergic reaction by an allergic reaction here's what I mean typically it's dermatitis like symptoms that occur from either touching buds or even touching just the fan leaves of a cannabis plant people having a cannabis allergy might experience in their skin where they've touched cannabis redness itching inflammation that kind of stuff in very rare cases a cannabis allergy can actually mean an anaphylactic type serious reaction when you either touch it or are exposed to it by inhalation puffiness runny nose runny eyes watery eyes rather and and all sorts of other unpleasant symptoms again typically people who already experience large amounts of spring type allergies to herbes and other dandelions are prone to this type of thing the unfortunate thing is is that if you have a cannabis allergy or develop it there's not a whole lot you can do about it you just sort of have to avoid cannabis and cut out your own use of it the only silver lining I can provide to you if you do have a cannabis allergy is that most allergies do not last a lifetime they actually rotate in and out so just because you're allergic to cannabis today doesn't mean you're gonna be allergic to it 10 years from now so it may not be a permanent thing so there you go now on to cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome also known as CH s but for the purposes of this video we'll just say CH about two years ago I did an episode regarding experiencing multiple bad cannabis trips an episode that I don't feel got as much play as it should have but in it I touched on CH as a possible cause of multiple bad cannabis trips based on the feedback I've received since then and some extra research have done on the subject I now believe that it is the leading cause by far of multiple bad trips especially amongst heavy cannabis users the kind of users who watched this show and the kind of users who might use cannabis more than 20 times a month first off why does CH even happen well when you consume THC some portion of it and some portion of all the other cannabinoids in cannabis are is actually stored in your fat cells and it takes your body quite a long time to fool process the THC out of your fat cells it actually takes something to tune of a month depending on your metabolism anyway if you smoke cannabis multiple times a day or daily for a prolonged period sometimes it takes years for this to happen you could begin experiencing negative symptoms of basically THC build up in your body and in your fat cells not everybody even experienced the symptoms of CH I know there's altra heavy users that smoke multiple times a day for years on end and never have it happen to them other people it doesn't happen for years on end and then it kind of starts to kick in whereas for some other users within a matter of months of heavy cannabis consumption they start having effects of CH whether they realize it or not we're not exactly sure for the reason for this disparity in how long it takes and why are some people not affected because in all honesty we're still studying this condition and it was only identified as recently as 2004 as a distinct thing in the video description I will link to all the stuff that we know about CH and how it expresses itself because it's really worth knowing but the gist of it is you're going to start having increasingly unpleasant side effects from smaller and smaller and smaller quantities of cannabis quantities that you had no trouble handling before the most common symptom is that you'll simply start getting very unusually high and it's not a pleasant high it's kind of a nauseous one the next most common symptom is constant nausea while high vomiting or the desire to vomit abdominal pain in your sides that you're going to wonder whether or not that's actually kidney pain you might also find that you're shivering and your teeth are chattering and you're having some trouble maintaining your body temperature and then what sounds like a bizarre and obscure thing but it's actually very common you will find that showers and hot baths basically relieve virtually all the symptoms of ch unless you're really far along in which case even showers and hot baths don't go all the way towards fixing how sick you feel the dangerous part of ch is for people who have a heart condition or are already predisposed to other cardiovascular type of problems if you're within that group of people CH can eventually result in heart attack like symptoms numbness in your left arm in the left part of your body and you'll actually experience sort of an angina or a mini heart attack and even after it happens there's a serious chance that nobody's going to be able to figure out after you've had basically a heart attack that heavy cannabis consumption had anything to do with any of this that's where CH stops being sort of an irritating problem like cannabis allergies and actually becomes a serious type of condition that you've got to recognize to treat CH there's really only one way you have to take a prolonged break from cannabis and let the THC levels that have built up in your body slowly work their way through your system through your kidneys and have the THC levels return to normal in the link I included in the description they seem to state that abstinence for seven to ten days clears the system I strongly disagree with that conclusion based on my own observations and dealing with people who've had CH I actually think about three to four weeks of abstinence are required and with people who have a slower metabolism and more fat it might be something more like for the six weeks so just bear that in mind a lot of people are wondering how prevalent CH is how many people actually experience cannabinoid hyperemesis well again the research I link to indicates that of people who smoke Cannabis 20 times a month or more about a third of them could experience symptoms of CH based on my anecdotal observations I think that that's actually completely bang on I can also comment that it's probably the rising THC percentages of developing strains and the rise in popularity of high THC concentration products like shatter or wax or oil that have greatly increased the frequency of cannabinoid hyperemesis happening to people over the last 20 years it actually makes perfect sense that in the 90s it was probably a lot rarer and we didn't really know what it was so there you go if you're experiencing CH please take the necessary abstinence steps to fix it because I don't want any of you guys to have an enjoy or heaven forbid an actual heart attack now normally I end my videos with a simple hey subscribe hit that like button if you found this useful but today I'm gonna ask you guys for something a little bit different I hope that you share this video the most interesting thing by far that I've noticed about CH is when I talk about it even to experienced people in the cannabis industry there is a good number of folks who have no idea what it is they have never heard of it but once you start describing it to them they go oh my god I totally know one or two people who've had this or I'm having this myself in my opinion there's really no better way to spread this type of information than within the community on the type of shows that heavy users of cannabis might watch so here's hoping we achieve that on that note guys we'll see you all next time on Lexus world", "CCrJ3-UN0GM": "it is a matter of when not if we are extremely close new york state marching towards an historic moment after years of political debates and negotiations that looked promising but then fell apart

if they gain access", "vu1RKWQtN-M": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today I have a very exciting video that's been highly requested and I'm sorry it was taking so long I'm going to be showing you guys how I make my extra strong green dragon picture this photo has one cup of liquid and 10 grams of wheat and then I reduced it to 1/3 of a cup meaning that now there is 5 tablespoons in 1/3 of a cup so every tablespoon is 2 grams of wheat you're gonna need the carbs wheat for this recipe and I'll post a link of how to do that below here's what you're gonna need alcohol that is 95% alcohol or higher some coffee filters or cheesecloth a funnel some mason jars and 10 grams of the carb to read the first step is to freeze your Dakkar bleed for at least 24 hours I have already done that and now that it's been over 24 hours I'm going to pour in 2/3 of a cup of vodka that has been in the freezer for at least 24 hours the instructions for this can still be followed even if you're not using the same amount of wheat that I am which is 10 grams all you have to do is pour enough vodka to fill just to the top of the weed now you're going to shake it aggressively for 5 minutes then you'll put it in the freezer for at least 2 hours I ended up leaving mine in the freezer for about 20 hours there's no need to leave it for long within 2 hours I did that simply because I ran at a time now I'm placing a funnel into my mason jar and I'm going to poke some holes into my coffee filter so that it flows through a little bit quicker if you don't have any coffee filters you can also use cheesecloth then place that into the funnel now you can take your weed and vodka mixture out of the freezer and shake it aggressively for another 5 minutes pour your mixture into the filter and try to avoid spilling it over the edge like I do here then wait for it to filter through this can take a while sometimes even up to a half an hour you can see how slowly it comes out of the bottom and then once almost all of the liquid has gone through I'll move the weed around to try and facilitate more of the liquid to be filtered through I put some gloves on because if your fingers are touching the weed and vodka it can absorb some of the THC and we obviously don't want that because that would be a waste now that all the vodka has gone through the filter I'm going to scoop back the weed into the jar you can see how much weed is left in the funnel because I spilled it when I poured it in so again try to avoid doing that if you can [Music] now I'm going to pour in 1/3 of a cup of vodka that again has been in the freezer for at least 24 hours and then I'm going to pour it into my jar weed that I had already filtered once now again if you're using different proportions just use enough to just cover the weed you can just pour it straight into the jar I'm just using the funnel so I can try and get some of that weed that's stuck to it the first time now once again I'm going to shake that jar aggressively for five minutes now using that same jar and same filter that I'd use the first time I am going to pour in the mixture that we had just shaken into the jar that we first used [Music] now this step is optional but I'm going to pour in a little bit of that very cold flash-frozen vodka to get the remnants out of my jar again you don't have to do this but I don't want to waste anything so every little scrap I can get I'm gonna take now once again we're going to let that filter through and it is going to take a long time just like the first round did [Music] once that's all dripped through we're going to place a clean funnel into a clean measuring cup or mason jar as well as a new clean coffee filter and we are not going to poke any holes now we're going to pour it in and we're going to wait for this to drip through this step is not necessary but I like mine very clear so I like to filter out any imperfections if you like you can do this step twice but it does take a long time so I only do it once and I find that the one time is sufficient to get it very pure and clean I'm also going to take the filter with the weed that has been filtered already and press it out as much as I can of course make sure you're wearing a rubber glove so that your skin is not absorbing at all yeah and just try and squish oh as much as you can and then that little bit of leftover that is on the parchment paper there I mean if you're just using this for yourself you could just lick it up I don't know if you don't want to waste it anything works yeah so just squeeze out as much as you possibly can it's been about a half an hour and almost everything has filtered through and we have a total of about a little bit under a cup of liquid because some of that vodka is lost in the extraction process [Music] now we need to reduce our tincture to a smaller amount and we're going to use that by using a double boiler thing which I don't have so I'm making my own version and I'm just using my instant pot so that I can do it in the living room where I have better lighting so I am wrapping some tinfoil around it so I can contain the heat as much as possible and I'm just going to put my measuring cup on to the side of it and then wrap the tinfoil kind of around it that way not too much water and heat is evaporating all you want to make sure is that your bottom of your mason jar or your measuring cup like I'm using is not touching the water so same concept as a double boiler so I both to put it in there but I just have to show off how beautiful it looks it's so clear so golden absolutely beautiful I hope you guys appreciate how wonderful it looks because a lot of my friends and family don't really feel the same way as I do so I just love being able to share this stuff with you guys online please make sure you do this any well-ventilated area so I have all windows and doors in my house opened as well as if your dreams on the stove have your hood fan on there is no smell at all so unfortunately my instant pot broke part way through I don't know what happened so I moved it to the kitchen and I made this sort of contraption thing because I could not put the measuring cup on the edge of the pot because I don't have anything deep enough where the bottom of the measuring cup wouldn't touch the water so I just put a metal strainer on top and then created some insulation with the tin foil kind of like how I did it the instant pot so while you're watching it when it's bubbling a lot like this that's a little bit too much so turn your heat down a little bit you do want a little bit of movement but not that aggressively now I reduced it down to one third of a cup and that took me about an hour and a half I believe you can reduce it more or reduce it less it just depends on how strong you want it to be now it's ready to pour into a jar to save you can use this with a dropper or you can put into your gummies or into your drinks there's so many different ways to use it hopefully you guys will check out some of my gummy videos and try it out in one of those recipes and here's the finished product which is absolutely beautiful thank you so much for watching with the measuring cup I didn't want to waste any possible tincture so I heard some iced coffee into there and now I'm drinking that so that's a good way to make sure you're not wasting anything if you guys enjoyed this video please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe and please let me know if there's any videos you would like to see me record because I would be happy to do that thank you guys so much for watching have a great day [Music]", "DP_LaoABgrg": "the 87th texas legislature kicked off this week here with us this morning is jax finkel director of texas normal that is the texas chapter of the national organization for the reform of marijuana laws thanks for coming on jax how are you thank you so much for having me it's great to be with you this morning definitely thanks for doing it so talk about this session where does texas stand with marijuana right now and what is normal hoping lawmakers will will change this session sure quick overview of where we stand in texas right now currently we have a robust temp program where people are growing hemp plants which have to have less than 0.3 percent thc we have a medical program in texas with a limited amount of conditions and also a restriction on how doctors can dose their patients and also we have basically possession of cannabis is still completely illegal and highly criminalized though there are some patchworks of deprioritization policies first chance programs so that's where we stand right now so you can see that we have a lot of work to do to improve our laws here in texas gotcha what are what are some of the main things that y'all are fighting for this time you know really what is very important important and a core goal for us is to make sure that patient access is improved we want to see people that have conditions like any type of cancer not just terminal cancer ptsd chronic pain included in the program and we also want to restore the ability for doctors to decide dosing and give them that medical freedom to converse on that with their patients additionally we want to remove the collateral consequences that come if you are caught in possession with the cannabis flower currently you can get 180 days in jail a 2 000 fine and then you lose your driver's license and have um you know a record for life that can affect your rental ability your grants through school and then also we want to make sure that we're having a really robust conversation about where do we go in the future with cannabis on a broader retail type of market so i think the main goal is to make sure patients have access and people aren't being arrested and then we also need to have those conversations moving forward speaking of the retail i know governor abbott has said before you know things like we will never become a colorado as long as i'm governor i mean are we are we a long way from seeing dispensaries and things in texas like in colorado you know i think that there is going to take some time to have that conversation and we're going to have to figure out what's right for texas you know we don't have to be colorado we need to do what's right for texas look at the other states around us look at arkansas oklahoma new mexico all of these different places that are instituting different types of programs medical and otherwise and we need to make sure that we are making wise decisions for us so i agree with him that we're not colorado and hopefully we can have a conversation about what is the right path for texas last question here we've got a little bit of time explain what's going on federally is there a chance that something could could completely usurp everything that happens in texas well movement at the federal level is happening as i'm sure you know schumer and harris both promised to make sure that this was a priority for them so if changes are happening at a federal level of course that will affect what happens in texas the safe banking act could be addressed in the next covid legislation and we could see the more act being discussed sometime this year perhaps in the fall so i am hopeful that on all fronts we can have a very fact-based discourse and move forward with some common sense legislation jax finkel with texas normal thank you so much always a pleasure", "D9qaYuGHVFI": "what's up guys we're in the chronic kitchen where we make great food and better rosin today we are gonna be doing things a little different we are actually gonna do a press right in front of you guys on the notes master OG also a little different we're gonna be doing black tie hemp right now so we're about to make some 100% solvent list CBD rosin from there we're gonna throw it in our D carb activate the CBD and then you can throw that into anything you want but what we're gonna do is make some Korean buffalo sauce and drizzle that all over some you know tasty wings and we're gonna have a really nice meal prepared for you guys so I'm gonna go ahead and get started on this the process is pretty simple I got the Machine set to 197 temperature you want to go a little bit lower for him that's just what we've noticed it helps out helps keep your extractions nice clean without having burnt product so I got a seven grand bag right here I'm gonna scale out seven grams for you guys alright guys perfect seven grams right there seven point one five to be exact another perfect seven grams so just a little bit of input on him what we've noticed is the strains are tend to be a lot drier not as a dense and moist of product that's why the Boveda packs help but that's why we're gonna throw it in here and a little bit low over temperature but we're gonna add a good amount of time on it we're probably gonna do about 180 seconds where we would normally do about 110 for normal bud so I'm gonna go ahead and pack this bag full of tech for you guys it's easy it's simple it helps a lot basically what you do is you create a cylindrical shape with the bag stands upright that just helps with surface area and pressure and maximizing your yields when pressing rosin [Music] so here's what you want you see the corners are inverted then from there what you're going to want to do is flip them upright create that flat base and look you have your nice cylindrical shape next just start adding your hemp [Music] all right so we have everything added inside as you can see look at this stands up right that's what you want bottom corner still inverted everything's packed down nicely next what you would do is just fold the top like a present kind of mimicking the bottom shape and boom perfect balla textile bag this is going to maximize your yields and just give you those clean quality concentrates that you want every single time so there's that next I'm going to insert the parchment paper we're gonna throw this in there and we're gonna start extracting as always we got our handy dandy magnet boom alright so we're gonna go start adding some pressure now with EOG you have access to 12 tons of pressure it's a little extreme with no pressure gage we're just gonna judge it you know going nice and slow and using our thumb to kind of gauge the pressure not too hard just take things slow so let's do that [Music] as you can see super easy process anyone can do this super easy machine plug and play set your temperature put your bag in as you can see this thing's starting to run not bad for some hemp that's why we've been going with that that specific brand they've been sending us some really good quality hemp good results usually a CBD tends to be a little bit lower of yields sometimes being you know 10 to 15 percent this one we've gotten back up to 18 to 20 percent we're gonna take it out a little bit early that's still about 40 seconds on the clock but as you can see it looks great I just don't want to overdo it I want to keep that you know tasty flavor in there so I'm gonna go ahead and take that out [Music] all right so it looks good a couple notes right off the bat with hemp is you'll notice a little bit lower yields and a little bit darker color totally normal with hemp there's not a lot of indoor it's tough to find good crop but this is a good looking strain really happy with the yield I'm gonna go ahead and get that collected up and measure it out for you right now so we're gonna go ahead and scale this out looks good looks like a good looking yield scale be a judge of that alright 17% yield not bad at all this is hemp I've honestly personally had lower yields on traditional THC crops so I mean I'm really happy with this what I'm gonna do now is take that throw it in our D carb our D carb right here this thing's amazing as you can see silicone capsule inside take your rods and put it in here throw it in your machine whatever you want makes activating as easy as possible doesn't take really much effort at all this is the way we like to do it around here [Music] okay guys nuts master D car ready to go we're gonna throw in the next master og 250 degrees 45 minutes 20 minutes longer than not THC that's just the way CBD works I'm gonna throw it in and then we're gonna start cooking what's up everybody chef Eric here in the chronic kitchen where today we're gonna be making a Korean buffalo sauce if you saw our popeyes chicken video we made a buffalo sauce which is a fermented pepper sauce and buff and butter today we're going to be doing something very similar in Korea they have what's called gochujang sauce which is made from this gochujang which is a delicious smoky spicy fermented chili paste so it's a lot like sriracha if you just like cooked it down but it's not as spicy because it's got this wonderful smokiness to it a lot like chipotle peppers it's just absolutely fantastic it's one of my most favorite things and they put this on everything in Korea so today we're going to be modifying in our recipe a little bit to make a buffalo sauce for our wings so it's gonna be able to get our can of butter we're going to infuse this with our CBD that's how we're gonna be able to introduce this stuff into the recipe we've also got some delicious honey I'm a big fan of honey and brown sugar we have some ground ginger in there as well normally when you make a gochujang sauce you want to use white sugar but I decided to split it up a little bit cuz I love the dark molasses and the earthy flavors that come from brown sugar and honey we also have some sesame oil which is one of my most favorite cooking ingredients in the world it has a just a wonderfully unique flavor and it's oh we have regular soy sauce don't get the dark soy sauce don't get the premium sources just normal everyday run-of-the-mill key cumin or whatever that they have on the tables at the Chinese restaurants we're going to combine all this stuff together to make truly wonderful and unique chicken wing recipes so if you're excited I'm certainly excited I can't wait let's get to cooking [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey everybody welcome back I'm super excited to try these recipes I know that you can't smell it but holy hell does it smell fantastic so we made about a cup of our sauce there's seven hundred and twenty milligrams approximately or so in the entire recipe and we used about half of that for it to toss the wings so there's about 320 milligrams or CBD in here and I'm super looking forward to them but just a quick note if you've never taken CBD before please be aware it much like melatonin and other nutrients within the body takes time to build up so if you don't quite feel the therapeutic effects from CBD right away continue to take it and after a while you'll be should be able to see some awesome effects so thank you for watching chronic kitchen

can use it and what the benefits are of cannabis oil made in cold methods furthermore I will explain briefly how I came to this method cannabis oil can be used for many projects such as cancer skin problems patents on digestive problems rejuvenation of bones and even your brain cells to name a few for skin conditions like eczema or skin inflammations or skin cancer the use of cannabis can be very effective and very soothing to for people with cancer the use of cannabis oil is very beneficial and ensures that our body can relax and it gets the ability to heal itself in addition it is a pain killer in his entire inflammatory it strengthens your immune system and has an anti-tumor effect it reduces the damage the femur therapy can cause to the nerves and brings the body in a more balanced state in the case of colon cancer laboratory studies show that it really works with lung cancer the sputum production will decrease and it prevents choking cold oil is highly recommended for Parkinson projects the raw oil has many active ingredients that are very beneficial to Parkinson when taken regularly this effect is also noticeable when ingesting Cokely obtained juice from the leaves of the cannabis plant how to use cannabis oil the application of cannabis oil can be done in a number of ways for two are the most efficient the one is on the skin and the second one is under the tongue the oil can be rubbed in daily on the affected area like a kind of ointment it's best to dilute the wheat paste with castor oil instead of other oils in the preparation process because castor oil is a bit thicker and easier to apply and it helps the wheat oil to pet deeper into the skin in the case of any other conditions the cannabis oil is taken orally you can do this in front of a mirror so you can see easily how many drops you take then drop the oil under the tongue and leave it there for a couple of minutes before swallowing it this is done because under the tongue the oil is absorbed by the body much quicker the dosage it's advisable to take the oil every day and to continue the treatment for as long as possible for paint projects it's convenient to take the oil every few hours to keep the analgesic effect constant when it comes to treating a tumor or preventing a cancer from coming back it's enough to take the oil once a day because every oil has a different strength it's very useful to test your daily dose with every new obtained bottle of oil you can do it very easily by taking for example three drops and the next day take four drops build it up slowly every day with one drop until you get slightly high if you're slightly high you know you have to take one or two drops less to set your dose if you become very stoned during this process it's best to relax and enjoy it the effect will decrease sometime the advantage of cannabis oil made on occult meth is compared to the heat of method cannabis contains at least 200 different potentially active medical ingredients other than THC and CBD because there's little research done about these ingredients there's also little known but what we do know is when heating it a lot of it will be lost this inspired me to do a little research on cannabis oil made in a cold method the most common cannabis oil is made with the use of heat this process is called decarboxylation and ensures that the THC acids are converted THC the THC and CBD strongly stimulate the cannabinoid receptors that are naturally present in our body these receptors activate human system and heal the body an additional effect is that the intoxicating effect of the oil is strengthened and therefore more suitable as an anesthetic painkiller in cannabis oil that is made without heating air the assets from the THC are preserved as well as all the other ingredients that are present in the plant the THC acids have a similar effect as the family let alone Aveda the pe\u00f1a from our body which is a balanced riparian molecule this molecule provides an analgesic and and diplomat ory effect it has a positive effect on the immune modulation of our body and takes very effective role in protecting the nerves in chemotherapy the pe\u00f1a itself is also stimulated by the use of unheated cannabis oil my personal experience in the use of unheated cannabis oil my personal experience with the use of cold oil is that it works very well it keeps and makes the body healthy if you want a stronger effect you can even use to both oils at the same time because they work in a completely different way I hope this video has given you more clarity about the use of cannabis oil if you have more questions you can use the comments or go to my website feel Ofcom thank you for watching you [Music]", "ojMKQk9B38U": "if you took a cannabis butt and eat it raw it wouldn't have very much effect but if you heat it you can change the game entirely through an important process called decarboxylation decarboxylation what is it how does it work and why is it so important find out on this episode of weed easy by the growth of no matter how you choose to use cannabis it's important to understand how decarboxylation works so that you can get the most out of your bud while cannabinoids like THC occur in the cannabis plant naturally the concentrations are very low that's why if you eat raw cannabis it doesn't do very much two of the most famous active compounds in cannabis are THC and CBD however before THC and CBD become active they start out as pH CA and CB da th CA and CB da are not active and therefore can't get you high to get the full effects of cannabis you must decarboxylate it first or use heat to activate the THC a and CBD a and convert them into THC and CBD what happens during decarboxylation decarboxylation is a chemical reaction that removes a carboxyl group when cannabis is heated this happens to th CA and CB da converting them to THC and CBD without decarboxylation th CA and CB da wouldn't be converted to THC and CBD and you wouldn't get high smoking and vaping both decarboxylate cannabis because they both use heat to activate the cannabinoids and decarboxylation is especially important when it comes to making your own edibles or cannabis infused treats to decarboxylate your bud for edibles there are two critical elements to the process temperature the first is the temperature used to heat your cannabis depending on the device you use the temperature required may differ when decarboxylate and cannabis for use in edibles most people use an oven crock-pot or toaster oven let's look at an oven as an example ideally you want to shoot for around 104 to 115 degrees celcius or 220 to 240 degrees Fahrenheit this will help convert the majority of the cannabinoids and preserve the terpenes keep in mind that every ovens temperature varies by as much as 10 degrees so invest in a good thermometer to properly monitor the temperature inside the oven time the second element in decarboxylation is how long you heat your cannabis for if you don't heat it long enough it won't decarboxylate but if you heat it too long you can lose a lot of the cannabinoids terpenes and other good stuff it's a delicate balance for decarboxylation in an oven it's recommended that you bake your cannabis for 30 to 40 minutes to maximize conversion typically maximum conversion is reached once you've hit 70% decarboxylation the THC conversion slows down at this point and instead converts to CBN a different cannabinoid that isn't psychoactive to grind or not to grind some people will tell you to grind your cannabis before Nika box leading and some will not we recommend not grinding your cannabis before decarboxylation instead break it into smaller pieces with your hands as this preserves the trichomes better and will make the most of your but in the end the important thing to remember with decarboxylation is to start low and go slow to make every cannabinoid count thanks for watching me DZ by the growth of subscribe to our channel for more cannabis content and hit the notification bow so you never miss an upload visit the growth opcom

so your total is gonna come out too [Music] so just got back from cara leaf i was able to pick up a couple different eights of flour we got some sublingual tablet gummies here which i'm excited to try and then i also was able to pick up the new select live resin cards i am super stoked on these i haven't had decent live resin since i lived in colorado there's not a lot of places that offer live resin around here and usually when you find it isn't a cart i'm excited to try these the bud tender was really hyping them up and i was able to get the purple sunset which is 82.8 thc i've had their purple sunset shattered before so i'm really excited to try this because even the shatter had good terps but let's eat a gummy and hit some live resin oh man that's a pretty good gummy there's not a ton of edibles in florida yet either so these sublingual tablets are really nice i actually haven't seen anybody else with gummies yet so this is cool all right let's hit this cart whoa we got the live resin in the dip here i've got it on the lowest temperature let's see how these terpenes hit [Music] damn that's really good [Music] well it's got those nose tingling turps this is really good stuff so i'm really stoked i can get something that flavorful i haven't had dabs as good in months we got an eighth of the af candy we got an eighth of the citrus farmer i've had both of these before

Should you want to try it,\nhere are some do's and don'ts. The do's: if you don't know how\nstrong the weed is, take one toke... and wait 4-5 minutes\nbefore the next one. A good coffeeshop will advise you\nabout the type of weed and the effects. Indicate what effect you want,\nso they can help you accordingly. Only use it for your enjoyment,\nnot to suppress stress or other problems. Smoking weed stimulates your appetite, so\ndon't hold back on fresh juice and sweets. If it goes bad, drink something sweet\nor vitamin C to reduce the effect. Then the don'ts: inhaling deeply and\nholding the smoke inside is useless. The THC gets absorbed right away. If you eat the weed, by means of\nspace-cake or space-brownies... wait for the effect,\notherwise you may consume too much. Use weed in moderation,\nand definitely not every day. Don't use it when you're pregnant,\nnor in traffic. Don't use it at school or work... as cannabis affects your memory\nand concentration for up to two days. And don't combine weed\nwith alcohol or other drugs.

his life he got an opinion that's all he got he got an opinion gay plus or minus whatever then you get out there and play and see if I bust your head wide open you know I'm saying I tell her I'll tell her any any reporter come play me there and I'll bust your here why did the white meat what's going on guys speedy morman here from complex and the guy sitting across from me you may have seen him before you may know him as Gary Payton the second pops you may have seen him on the pack of the weed that she rolled up last autumn as the glove he's an NBA Hall of Famer Gary Payton is in the building admission my weed it's the way we always got a dance like that make you know that thing is hot too so fight yo I heard you here but I'm glad you got me here boy you got me set out over here so you got the old school GP and in an old school G but it's all good we only do that for people who are in being hold of Famers if you're an NBA all-star even nine times that's not enough but if you're a Hall of Famer then you get this tapestry man well and I'm Bank I'm not Hall of Famer so I'm good so we'll talk about NBA all-star stuff in just a second however your son is killing it right now has that feel not only to see him continuing your legacy but doing his own thing and making his own as well well you know what as I look at my son and the things that he went through you know thinking that he's gonna get drafted didn't get drafted and then all of a sudden you know going through the journey that he's going through right now I'm glad that the Wizard and finally stepped up and said yo let me get this kid what they don't want to where people don't understand is my son is not like me the Wizards for really understood that they made a choice they gave me a guaranteed contract now he's out there killing it when a kid can come in and for four games and get 17 steals is incredible you know what I'm saying and you know he's very athletic he's he's very long more athletic than I was and I'm proud of him I'm very proud of it but I lead him to herself you know I'm leaving to herself I'm a surprising in one game this year no I don't want to take the shine from him I'm gonna surprise him a little bit let him get that little shine on and and hopefully that you know I this can take off from here and he becomes somebody for sure now there aren't that many father-son duo's that pan out in a very successful way you are now I guess one of them how often do you keep your eye on some of the other father-son do us like maybe LeBron and his son or D Wade and his son you watch that no I really don't know get into that because we all fathers men and let them do what they do they've been talking about this LeBron stuff about how he be at his son's games and he's going crazy why not if he wedded LeBron you wouldn't be talking about him at your I'm saying I like what D way does he stays away from his son a little bit he doesn't take it as far as you know if you think about it how many superstars sons have been really really great not many not many superstars not superstar right there you go I don't think it's been one I don't think it's been one you know I'm saying we got to think about it superstars sons there's not been one I don't think it's been one at all I can't think of that there you go hey you know so we can't say curry because his father wasn't a really really a superstar we can't say clay cuz his dying son I started daddy wasn't really really a super strong it so that's how we got a we got to understand that and LeBron would be the first if his son come up and Andy way would be the first if he's uh and mine if he could pan out in the next couple of years so you know it's a lot to follow a Hall of Fame's dad that's a lot and then especially to be named after him you know I'm saying that that's a lot you were the only player I think still the only player in your draft class that is a Hall of Famer why do you think that is you know whether speedy I don't I can't I can't put my hand on that you know I'm saying Derrick Coleman could have been Chris Jackson was like move a roof right now but it's it's a god-given in the god-chosen domes and then nobody really know nothing about me you know I'm Shannon I became the number two pick and I was met I was all-american in college you know nobody knew about me coming from Oakland and in the town where they didn't know and then I go to a small school you know as Oregon State but it happens and it's just something that just happened because all of them guys were great basketball players and it's just something that I pan out and I became all of thing does not practicing or practicing less lead to a longer NBA career I remember hearing something about you mentioned it to someone yo listen if you want to play longer just practice less well that would that would that was working for me because you think about it as you look at what I did I played 82 straight games for six straight years in a row then that takes a wear and tear on your body and especially if I'm playing at 42 minutes a game out of 48 I'm only sitting down 66 minutes the injury's was coming but I was playing through the injuries because that's just the way I was you know I'm saying if I sprained an ankle or I'm not gonna tell you about it I'm gonna go back there and tape it up imma being in a training room all day every day trying to get it right they made up a chamber for me where you suck on action up and bring him your muscles back that was the way I did and I really didn't care about it but nowadays it's a mandatory now that you don't really practice like that they only can get you for two hours on the floor and then everything else is over so I don't understand why are you so tired what you're tired about now if I go back to back and I played two and a half hours in one game and I'm only really playing thirty minutes and then I come back the next day and only play two and a half hours again and only play for thirty minutes so I'm playing sixty minutes out of what is that 96 minutes so I'm not really really tripping so I'm missing 36 minutes somewhere so where can you be tired you know I'm saying so all this load management crap your arms play basketball man you're getting fifty million dollars a year so what you know go get your baby on the plane or something you know so I don't really get that but that's just the way it is in this era so that was my next question the load management you think a fluke like I'm done with that what are you lobe managing for they don't have double days no more they don't do none of that we don't have two a days in practice it's a mandatory that you only be on the floor for two hours two and a half hours you can't do this you can't do that it is what it is but this is like I said this is their error and this is what it is what makes it happen but the only thing I I'm tripping off of is that a lot of them are getting hurt more I see a lot of more basketball players getting hurt them and I don't know understand why that is we have to we have to do a study all know that you know what I'm saying is it because you're not lifting weights more to back you make your muscles stronger because you are playing a lot of basketball all year round right or is it that you know it's something that is the body is not the same you know I'm saying it's a different body you know Sam being younger don't understand how to take care of you like I'm curious as to all your opinion on these new self-proclaimed experts who speak about you know NBA analytics and you know the plus and minus and things like that does that mean anything to you a person who actually played on the court versus these people who have never played the game speaking on man first of all well you get it right and talk about something they never played basketball in his life he got a pinion that's all you got you got an opinion plus and minus whatever then you get out there and play and see if I bust your head wide open you know I'm saying I tell her I'll tell her any any reporter come play me there and I'll bust your head why do the white meat you know what I'm saying so that's what I tell them and they always think they know everything you know I'm saying you don't know nothing you ain't been out there all you do is watch a lot of basketball and you see us run plays so now you know about the game and then you ain't never been at that level ever in your life and you gonna talk about oh he's gonna be there he'll be you don't know what they gonna be you know what I'm saying put some sneakers on in there and try and let's see if you can do it you know Sam so that's why they really mess with media people during the time because they always want to critique you about what you're doing I'll be like man shut up you know what I'm saying cuz you really don't know nothing you know I'm saying you're just going opinion about anything that you do so I'm cool with it you know I'm saying but you know other than that if you ain't played the game shut up so when these experts say things like oh but when he's on the court you know he's - a door that means nothing to Gary - that don't mean nothing to me because the simple fact is is because you having a bad game you don't do assists or whatever your job is to make your team better and to make everything around you better you know if you struggling you're not gonna keep struggling why you in the NBA they picked you for some reason and they keeping you right and then when you look at these guys who made five or six points a year and then all of a sudden we give them a contract four years eighty million dollars they must be worth something you're all I'm saying so the plus/minus ain't doing nothing for me anyway because the office ain't really telling you not in any way cuz they awarded you with 80 million so in you only out of seven points so what are we talking about so plus minuses don't mean nothing to me that don't mean anything to me if you can make your team and do whatever your role be on that team be ok and you're fine no I'm saying it's about what the organization thinks about you and what they think your evaluates to that team and they're you good what was the best moment of your career aside from winning an NBA championship would you say the Olympics when I'm which one both of them really the first one was a major one because it was in Atlanta if you think about it if you get honored to be wearing a USA Jersey and we think about what's going on now in the world about people over in Iraq everywhere else dying and getting their legs blue off and to represent the USA to give us an opportunity to stay over here safe and play in these type of games and we're doing it for money and for free and they're there giving it and from the literal of nothing and they're getting hurt and getting killed and shot at and you think about how much is that a prayer a privilege to do that that's a privilege so when I bowed my head down and they put that metal over my over my head and I got that USA on my chest and I got millions of people watching me that's a bit that's a pleasure that's honor because I got other people that's protecting me that ain't getting them medals or honors all the time they get a medal as if something happened to invited them home right so we got to think about that and we got to understand that that's a privilege for us to be doing that and you felt that twice when they put their gold medal Weiss and and and then you know to become their know that we're the world's greatest we knew that from day one you know we just had to go out there crew obviously everyone knows Gary Payton for the trash talk I wonder though have there ever been times where you got into it with fans maybe celebrities that were sitting courtside yes I got it toward everybody I didn't care who it was if anybody opened their mouths you'll get it were there any celebrities that come to mind or stick out celebrities knew what's happening they don't know what they don't want to get out like that because you know that we got to go to the club afterwards we don't have a problem I'm saying I don't care about no bodyguards and nothing like that cuz I had a lot of bodyguards a lot of dudes from missoula hit me so it was all good so I didn't really worry about that and they knew I wasn't about all that talk you know once we get in the club it's gonna be on you know what I'm saying so I didn't care about no bodyguards and all that none of that cuz I had some dudes from the streets I was like bodyguards to them we didn't have to do all that obviously it's a different era where players are a lot heavier on social media no such thing back when you play at KD and Kendrick Perkins getting into it I know you've seen it what do you think about the whole Kendrick did what he wanted to do he became he became he became a blow-up icon right now that's why we talking about you know what I'm saying he went at it only thing I don't like is you did you talk about what you did in the locker room when we were teammates whatever I tell you in the locker room between me and yours is personal don't go there you became a Allen it's now I became that too but I keep it real if you've trashed you trashed I'm gonna tell you trash you know I'm saying I ain't gonna say nothing else about nothing else but if you trash your trash you know said if you're not playing the game the right way I'm gonna do it I think that they both went over the line by saying what he said he has opinion his opinion was that he thought that Westbrook was the best player in Oklahoma City okay that's fine Katie went out and said you average two or three points man as a center you should try to do you build your confidence or build your whatever it is what it is you know I'm saying they going back and forth but they got enough time to do that crap you know saying that that's crap to me you don't saying come talk to me personally you know I'm saying talk to me head up we don't even have to go around everybody you we can just go in that little room right there to see what happened you know I'm saying it is what it is it's going to room and talk it out you know what I'm saying they both 7-footers yeah you know but Perkins might be a little bit more heavyweight but you know what I'm saying okay [ __ ] might be a little yeah but if you got them things man and bangs we'll let you have it back pitching your nose in your mouth you you feel it your own concern so let the bangs go loose you'll be all right do you think that Westbrook is the best player everywhere okay see well you guys got to understand that if I actually this you you think do you think we're better than the Durant I don't think okay me neither so but I'm not taking that as personal and I don't know if you know I don't want people I don't want Westbrook the thing is personality is what it is you know what I'm saying Katie's is the better basketball player really you don't and but Westbrook is our outstanding basketball player but that is just a way people's opinion is that's a pinion you know I'm saying and Kendrick subpoenas because of what ktd a lot of people and I don't think you approve of what Katie Did when you're down to a team 3-1 and then you lose and you go and add Nate you going and join a team we wasn't cut like that Michael Jordan beat me in 96 I was up for I was up for free agency who did I go back to I went back to the Seattle SuperSonics because I wanted to bus Michael Jordan he had opened because I wanted to go back and get at its a party's opinion and that's just the way they are that's him he wanted to do that find Andy that's his choice so that's what people make a pinna bout things I don't have opinion about that we have to talk about the party pack GP you are on you have some sort of brand relationship with cookies and it seems to be pushing you know a lot of people to have a good time how does that feel to be in a whole new era not err a whole new realm and arena you know this would have been a problem in a day because they would have thought about the cannabis business in a in the marijuana being a negative situation now that is turning legal a lot of people are understanding I didn't get into this business because of the smoke there to smoke this cannabis and and it be partying like that I got anything to it to help people my mom just passed away three months ago sorry I wanted to wanted to get into this business so that I can get my mom off of medication and get her to just start feeling better and not being in pain all the time and marijuana was coming and cannabis came to my mind it came about when some of the guys in the hood in San Francisco said you know we just made a strand and he came out to 2020 and it was like nah we gonna honor the og and og is me so they put it they put my name on that and it's a guy in a guy named burner who everybody might really know about it cookies he's one of the young guys that got a mired me and wanted to do with this stuff and I just went into business with them and and I'm gonna get something started I'm gonna get something started it's not all about that but it's about the life now that but I'm gonna get into other stuff I'm getting it trying to help people get off of medication and do other things with it with medical cannabis and and it's a business that is is booming right now and I'm happy of it I'm just happy because they honor me the way you know they did they just gave gave a guy to dare Mart and they called me the OG and they put my name on there in it and became popular for sure I know you don't smoke but have you ever tried your own strand no no will you ever try it no I don't think so I mean no um I'll just be honest with people I don't I don't smoke you know I don't think that's that's something for me you know sanneh if I look down at my chest and I see my chest beaten and I think my heart coming out of it I don't think I should be a part of it you know your party you know what I'm saying that just the way it goes so but to be a part of it and have these guys enjoy it and be safe with it that's what I want to be Oprah or around be safe with it you know it's something that's happening my kids do it I can't stop it you know they've grown so uh but you know you guys if you want to try try you know what I'm saying it is good I just try to put a product out there that's gonna be really good and that's all I do I don't want you to be if you paying your money for it I want you to have a good problem NBA all-star weekend is next month it's shaping up to be a goo and I'm curious as to your thoughts on just NBA all-star as a whole why's it such a monumental tentpole event for culture at large well basically because what we're doing now you know you got music you got clothing all that stuff is starting to be big part of of the NBA you know as you see the Westbrook's you see the hardens they coming out here with these clothes you know you see the d-wave they coming out with different fashions the music is starting to be a big part of it what do you see all the time into all of the all-stars you see all the performers you see all the rappers you see everybody that's what it's becoming this culture is becoming that and I think for you to be named top twenty four players in the NBA and it all started I mean you're you're the the one you're the one and you're going out there and having a good time and this event is a big event this is probably the biggest out of all sports cuz you don't go to the pro bono mo you do nothing at the Hockey Hall star you know I'm do none of the baseball we don't see we don't look at the home run derby no mo what you look at you look at what you're gonna see on at the NBA all-star because you get to go around in these guys then you get to go to different venues and do today parties do it all they stuff they they collaborating with Rick Ross and collaborate with P Diddy they collaborate with Jay Z fans want to see that that's what they want to see and that's when you having parties with these guys and you hang with these guys you get to see them one-on-one that's what all these young people want to see nowadays and that's where the hip hop and all the stuff and the clothing comes involved and that's what it is the NBA all-star is probably the hottest one of the hottest sports you know one of the size if it's in sports right now and that's what it is the fan voting is open now for the starters for Eastern and Western Conference my last question before they kill me over here MB lb quad now don't kill him over here we got a lot of time over here you're hurt they're telling me we have no time left no we got time go go past time all right NBA all-star weekend is something that you've been a part of for nine years I know that you or you are an all-star nine times rather I read that you used to prank people during and B all-star weekend is there a prank that sticks out besides the caramel own story which is a class that was the biggest one you know he's we used to call him gaiters and jeans that's all he did because he were too tight Gators with the jeans on he's real country you know I'm saying but no we used to just I used to just they'd used to just give me the camera and I just prank everybody man Shaq was a big part of all this stuff because he's a big prankster I used to do a lot of things man come out and catch everybody when they were if something happened to him in the days before and I would hit him with it I got Jake he'd one year I got Kevin Garnett another year but it was just about fun it was just about coming out here making people laugh you know because I'm only gonna do it once because after that after that three days is bad like the war cuz I'm like you know more your arms and because the next part of the year I'm going show don't I'm going to hit with every all the time so have fun during that time and then get to introduce yourself to him and get to know him as a person and do that so that's what I thought I wanted them to understand that I was a jokester I'm funny and I'm cool but when you see me on the court from now on it's over for sure as a story defender maybe one of the best defenders and the only point guard to ever win the Defensive Player of the Year when you watch today's game who's somebody out there who you know that you'd be able to lock up well it's - I think I got I think I got Marty smart and then I got Beverly and then you know how to put my son in there so M three into is something that I think that's gonna it's close to me and not on both ends of the floor they on that defensive side because the office is thought I was pretty pretty good so I think they are close all right all right Gary Payton thank you so much for stopping by appreciate you all-star week in this next month will you be tuned in I'll be Tooley and I'll be right there okay on to maybe Chicago use okay all right thank you for sure [Music]", "pXneNdYo2Vo": "there is no perfect formula for determining exactly how long marijuana weed THC or pot stays in someone's system during a urine blood saliva or hair drug test with a urine test nine carboxy THC is often the substance that is being detected rather than actual marijuana and can last from 30 to 45 days in urine blood tests are not often utilized when it comes to marijuana unless the test is done within a few hours of when a person smokes or ingests marijuana but can possibly last in the blood for sixty to seventy-five days hair testing analyzes a hair sample for parent drugs and their metabolites

my lungs. Finally someone found me,\nthey went to the hospital, and they said, you have\nperiod cramps, take Advil. (ambient music) - Hi, my name is Sam, and I have PMDD, which stands for premenstrual\ndysphoric disorder. - I'm Laura, and I have endometriosis. - Biggest symptoms that I suffer from the most are mood swings. I can go from zero to\nblackout angry in a second. - Being in pain every day\nreally takes a toll on you. - The most powerful\nchange in public opinion in the past couple of years\nwhen it comes to cannabis has been children with seizures. Sadly, period pain is not\nthat obvious of a problem. It's something that women suffer from usually alone and quietly. - If there is a product out\nthere that can change that, then hell yeah I'm gonna try it. I'll try anything. (upbeat music) (phone ringing) - [Voiceover] Whoopi, you're on the floor. - Hey, thank you so much\nfor joining us today. First of all, we're just wondering what inspired you and Maya\nto create these products? - [Voiceover] My friend\nRick, who ran High Times, and he was telling me\nabout all of the people who had gotten into the marijuana space, and I said, is anybody doing\nanything in menstrual cramps? And he kinda went, (scoffs) no. And I went, really? He said, no, it's a niche market. It's a niche market that\nhas half the population. We're still doing this? It's kind of shocking. If a guy had these cramps,\nif a guy had this issue, there would be all kinds\nof shit out there for them. This was done in order to\nfind a way to relieve cramps, so please try it, and if it\nworks for you, tell a friend. If it doesn't work for you, not to worry, we'll continue to try to\ncreate something that may. (upbeat music) - So I'm about to start using\nthe Whoopi and Maya products. I'm not looking to get high, just looking for some sweet relief. It's not doing anything yet. Still feel like my uterus\nis trying to murder me. I only truly wish that\nyou could smell this through the camera, because\nthe smell is so good. So I've had it on for a while now, and it feels amazing. It's hard to explain,\nit's like this warm heat all over my abdomen, which of\ncourse, when you have cramps is all you can hope for\nis a built-in heating pad. - Day two of using the products. I took a tablespoon of the chocolate, and was PMSing pretty bad,\nand I went clothes shopping. On days where I usually just\nwant to sit on my couch, eat ice cream and watch Titanic while I sob silently into a\npillow, I bought crop tops. That feels like a victory to me. - I just finished the bath. Truly it was an amazing experience. All the bloated feeling and the pain just kind of melted away. It makes you hella comfortable,\nwhich is pretty much all you can ask for when you\nhave a really bad period. - I use the Tincture today, just did a couple drops in my coffee. Today was a little rough,\nI had one kind of outburst, but again, only one\noutburst, compared to what I can usually do, is pretty solid for me. These products allowed me to exist clearly while helping me maintain\nemotions that I do want to feel. - If you have endometriosis and you're struggling\nlike I am every month, I would absolutely\nrecommend that you try this. I think many women would\nagree that they're willing to try almost anything\nto get the pain away. - [Voiceover] People\nbelieve that you're gonna scratch 'em up because you have PMS, why don't you believe\nthat I'm also in pain?

notifications on and stay in tune to see more reviews comedy videos and basically anything weed related so yeah we got the vitality sativa citrus cannabis tincture alcohol based by Liberty I think it's uh yeah 250 milligrams of THC per bottle 15 milliliter bottle you know and I who's going on trying to research this and see other reviews or anything and I didn't see any so I pulled up their website here and I'm just gonna read it real quick if you don't mind so it's commonly used for pain anxiety seizures muscle spasms it's an energizing alternative to our vitality sativa flowers for patients who prefer smokeless consumption of cannabis the vitality tincture is referred to as a full spectrum alcohol extract the original way medical cannabis was administered more than 100 years ago this tincture will fit right into your modern lifestyle many patients like to simply add the right dose of tincture to a cup of tea juice or even to a favorite recipe now like I said and this says it's alcohol based so my favorite way to use a tincture is sublingually I put it under witches you put it under the tongue and you know if you can't take a shot or you're weary of alcohol I wouldn't suggest this method but yeah you fill it up and then you let it sit under the tongue for a minute or so when it should kick in in about 15 or 20 so let's do that and I felt better we've got that came true cuz it's all been right there now since I want to talk I'm just going to swallow down I'll leave it but yeah usually I let it sit a little longer but like they said you can put in your favorite tea or whatever juice I happen to have some apple juice I would say my favorite juice is probably - shoes but what whatever we got a weird pomegranate blueberry juice is really good too but let's go ahead and drop it in there whoa cool reaction look at it in there I don't know if you can see it it's kind of floating on the top there had an interesting reaction kind of clouded up let's see what this is about [Music] easily drinkable I honestly can't really you can tell it's in on the back end a little bit but let's check this down [Music] so I did two squirts one in there once up lately now let's see how I feel in about 30 minutes I'm gonna come back to you guys see what's good and let you know from this products worth buying again so I'll see in a little bit and it's 40 minutes later and I'm back to talk about the vitality because right now I'm feeling excellent a nice clean crisp and that is what I love energized ready to get productive today do some writing get on the grind so I do suggest the Liberty here give it a shot I want to try the indica as well see what they got going on with that but I would say overall legit product I think this came in at like 32 bucks Oh a little one a pricey side but I still have a lot left and I'm feeling nice right now so give it a shot if you see it at your local dispensary thank you for tuning in the true buds TV it's good to have you here as usual please leave a comment alike whatever you want but I'm here to make videos that you guys want to see so drop a line thank y'all wanna see this product review don't want to see this comedy we'll make it happen here at truebloods TV we have a really cool team and we are excited to keep these videos coming at you guys the way our subscribers are growing is awesome and it's a shout out to you guys showing some love on these videos Thanks I'll catch you guys later you", "lT0k_xhqXkc": "next question is from ants dope life can smoking weed impact gains sure yeah let's do a fly fish yeah definitely can't you know um i i talked to a cannabinoid scientist recently had a great conversation with her and we went down a whole bunch of different paths with cannabinoids these are the the compounds that are found in marijuana plants and hemp plants there are some potential health benefits um that you can get from cannabinoids if they improve your health then they'll might help you with your gains but i i can't you know i'm trying to think of all the people i know that smoke weed how many of them have improved their health from smoking weed i can think of one person out of i don't know 30 40 people i know who smoke weed most people smoke weed like to get high and that kind of use is yeah it's going to take away from your gains cannabinoids high dose especially thc probably negatively affect your anabolic hormones they predictably lower testosterone levels or anabolic hormone levels i should say in animals they can do that in humans too especially at high doses it can definitely if it's used chronically um it can definitely reduce motivation which that's not a drive goes down yeah that's not a great thing for for working out um they can balance out inflammation if used at low doses but just you know two or three hits from a joint is way higher than low doses and at that point you may be in influencing uh inflammation in a negative way in terms of gains so i i don't think it's it's not something i'd say go do this to improve i've heard long distance runners though like they do well uh with under the influence yeah yeah just during the yeah yeah because you ever died have you ever done a long run no i haven't i've done it i love mobility yeah uh yeah under the influence no it's hot because it you trail off dude you trail off in your thoughts and i mean it's like when you know when you hit that like when you're running right it takes about 10 15 minutes or so yeah then you hit that runner's high and then if on top of that if you got a cannabis high on on top of that like you just kind of drift off into your own thoughts you know what they very therapeutic and you know what they they attribute the runner's height to um natural cannabinoids that your body releases yeah so it makes sense right anandamide i think that was called 2ag if i'm not mistaken and here's something you can do okay if you want to utilize cannabinoids for potential benefits use uh hemp oils full spectrum stay away from too much thc too much thc's got some negative effects on the brain use things like cbd and some of the other cannabinoids that are non-psychoactive what those things tend to do is they tend to increase your body's own production of its natural cannabinoids this is not a bad thing so if you're going to if you're going to notice any benefits from using cannabinoids then you go in that direction not buying the weed at the dispensary that's you know 20 thc or smoking a joint with your buddy that's probably going to be detrimental so that's why you know for me nowadays i stick to things like ned which is the full hemp oil extract you know full spectrum and that i don't notice the negatives if i were to have like weed from the dispensary you know i i get that you can have fun with it a lot of stuff but it's negatives is what i know yeah you have to be real careful i mean this is a conversation i have with my younger brother a lot right like i i was lucky that i didn't really even find cannabis i mean i had a bad experience with cannabis twice in my early 20s and it wasn't even until i was like 30 that i really like smoke weed and like the way i look at right now so i like weed the same way like a desperate housewife likes wine and i look at it the same way they're like you got to watch that you got to be careful of of that like if am i smoking uh every single night am i is it gonna turn into a cougar you might do am i dependent on this am i having the whole bottle type of deal like and because there's so much positive messaging around right now with marijuana and the health benefits of cbd and yada yada yada at the end of the day it could turn into a an addiction and an issue like anything else so if it's getting in the way of you learning more and growing and spending time on your business or working better at your craft or being a good husband or being a good father or being a good son if it's if it's starting to bleed into those things and you have to be you only you know that you have to be self aware of that to make that decision and most certainly can bleed into getting into way of your gains if you know getting high ends up happening and you don't go to the gym because of that like that's it's an obvious issue but if there's ways that you can find it to complement your life and have balance i think there's nothing wrong with it just like i don't think there's anything wrong with someone having the occasional glass of wine to enjoy that with their dinner but very easily you can turn into somebody who has two or three glasses of wine every single night and then at that point when you start asking yourself okay is this more of an addiction and something that i rely on more than something's actually helping me or complementing or enhancing who i am yeah and when they do studies on on cannabis and performance it clearly reduces power output and explosive uh performance so for lifting weights probably not a good idea the best idea i've done it before lifting weights terrible it's not a great idea yeah it just doesn't for me it definitely doesn't improve performance um but maybe for long actually more interested in it though maybe maybe for long lower intensity kind of long duration stamina based movements maybe the pain killing effects the fact that you're in this other state of mind might help with that kind of stuff but for lifting weights and for explosive power uh definitely not a good idea it doesn't make me stronger for sure i can't lift as heavy you know but i might be in the gym longer and i might you know focus more on squeezing and pumping the muscle or i might just lose my my focus and start looking at articles yeah or whatever walks by yeah", "_-R-Oe1NpYY": "what is hemp flour in this video i'm going to tell you exactly what that is and i'm going to tell you that even though this looks exactly like marijuana it's legal on a federal level and while we're at it i'm going to tell you about cannabinoids which determine the intensity and it determines the physical sensations you're going to feel in your body and i'm going to tell you about terpenes which determine the smell and stinkiness of the flower so when you go shopping for flour online you're going to be able to find the best stinkiest flower that just really smacks so without rambling too much i'm gonna get right into it my name's chris with cbd extract.co i've been in the cannabis industry for 10 years and hemp specifically for three years and what i can tell you from my experience is that the words hemp marijuana and cannabis all mean the same thing technically but thanks to our good old buddy donald trump he now made federal legal definitions for these terms for example marijuana is defined as any cannabis product that has more than 0.3 percent delta 9 thc now we're not talking about thca we're not talking about delta 8 thc and we're not talking about any other form of thc we're only talking about delta nine so if it's above that threshold it's marijuana so and that's really weird because on a federal level that's a controlled substance it's a schedule one controlled substance so it's up there with meth heroin crack cocaine whatever those drugs are i don't know specifically because i don't do those drugs but what i do know is that it's in the same category which is totally bogus and messed up but what's crazy is that hemp is defined as less than 0.3 delta 9 thc so what that means is that all the other cannabinoids like cbg cbn thca delta athc these are all compounds that have free reign to be bought sold and shipped over state borders on a federal level it's completely legal and usps will actually ship this no problem they will not confiscate your product as long as it has a lab test in the package now what this means for you is you can literally go on google right now you can go on google right now and type in hempflower or delta8thc or cbg and you can literally buy products that look like marijuana but are completely legal to be bought and shipped to your house that is literally crazy that's insane so and as a matter of fact if you want to get your hands on some indoor flour you can get an eighth totally for free at cbdxrack.co we actually give a free eighth of our greenhouse or indoor grown flower completely for free all you got to do is hit the link below so definitely check that out um it you got nothing to lose it's totally free we covered the pot all you got to do is cover the postage but anyways to figure out if the product is legal or not so it's actually safe to be shipped because keep in mind marijuana is illegal to be shipped over state borders you don't want to send marijuana over the border or buy it accidentally online and then you get caught and get in trouble so what you need to do is look at the lab test and so i'm going to pop this up on the screen right now but if you look at the lab test you'll see the triangle 9 thc as long as that percentage right there is less than 0.3 you're in the clear and it's considered hemp um if it's over obviously it's marijuana that's considered hot hot hemp as they call it and completely illegal unless you live in a recreational state so um and keep in mind like i said total thc doesn't matter on a federal level um the thca doesn't matter delta a thc cbg cbn none of that matters only the delta nine so keep that in mind i know i'm like a broken record at this point with the delta nine stuff but that's literally just how it works um so if you want to find the best quality this is the we need to look at because we're already looking at the lab test i might as well teach you how to get the best quality hemp flower there's a lot of people there's a lot of crappy dirty ditch wheat out there but basically if you look at the lab test you'll see the total cannabinoid percentage cannabinoid cannabinoid i don't know everyone says it different but basically the higher that percentage is the more you're going to feel so for example if you have a high cbd flower it's going to be relaxing if you have a high cbg flower it's going to be more stimulating because cbg is considered a non-psychoactive stimulant some people react to it differently they don't know too much about it but obviously each cannabinoid has a different effect cbn it's actually slightly psychoactive and it um makes you sleepy all right and then obviously if you have a high thca product when you smoke that thca it turns into delta 9 thc so obviously it gets you high same thing with delta 8 thc okay so basically you can buy these products online okay so if you want to get the products that really smack because a lot of people say oh hemp flour kind of sucks like it doesn't really make me feel like anything you need to get a higher percentage flower okay it's really that simple it works just like the medical industry with marijuana the higher the percentage the more you're going to feel and like i said you have different ratios of the cannabinoids the the percentages of them the next thing you want to look at in terms of the smell is going to be the terpenes now the terpenes are essentially the oils found in the bud that give it that pungent smell so if you're smelling pine you're smelling skunk you're smelling weird marijuana smells or whatever you know it just smells like weed in general that's a result of the terpenes and these terpenes actually indicate whether or not it's indica or sativa so for example uh limonene is considered a sativa uh terpene and mercine is considered a indica so if you look at the lab test you can see which terpenes are dominant that actually determines what effects are going to feel because these terpenes actually indicate um how you're gonna feel right they bind to your receptors in the same way that cannabinoids do so it's really crazy and one more thing to look out for when you're shopping for hemp flour online is don't just go off the pictures because you're gonna see these big dank beautiful buds you're gonna see like all these reviews and stuff but you might get it in the mail if you're going at it blindly and you'll be like man these buds are like dull smelling they don't really do anything they kind of smoke it i got a throat itch and a headache you don't want that so always look at the lab test right because the lab test is like your safeguard to make sure you're getting quality product you don't want to be wasting your money you don't want to smoke dirty ditchweed and also you want to see on the lab test if there's panel testing for pesticides because who knows maybe they're selling pesticide hemp flour you need to protect yourself so always look at the lab test and that's pretty much it so hemp flour yeah it actually can get you high if you buy a certain type of product just have in general you can get high if you buy a certain type of product but really guys it's just so simple if you want to feel good look at the lab test check the cannabinoids and the terpenes and you're going to get good product so that's pretty much it i hope you enjoyed this video and like i said if you want access to indoor and greenhouse grown flower hit the link below we're doing a free eighth promo uh there's nothing for

"hwyhxIThFmg": "hey guys Nick with precision here and today we're gonna be talking about terpenes so we want to understand these compounds what they are how they occur in nature how we're extracting and isolating them so the first thing that I'd like to bring up is terpenes are actually a variety of organic compounds and these organic compounds are naturally occurring in all sorts of areas of nature the main things that you will find terpenes are in is cannabis conifer plants like pine trees spruce things like that are one of the most abundant sources as well as a variety of insects and even some mammals now it's it's interesting these compounds because they serve a variety of different purposes so in plants they're mainly signaling it's signaling for a predator to stay away or for a sweet you know delicious smell to be eaten by a certain mammal and there's kind of this underlying communication standard with these terpenes amongst everything in nature and in the universe and if you start looking at these compounds and where they're placed and what they do it's it's quite amazing the the matrix of what's there with that all being said you have other terpenes that are produced by insects that are produced by by mammals and these are actually produced in some cases biosynthetic aliso in many cases humans produce terpenes biosynthetic Lee meaning within our own body they come endogenously produced and our signaling receptors not only are they signaling mechanisms but they're also biosynthetic building blocks so a good example of this would be squalene and the steroids that are derived from that and things like that you can look into that but it's very very interesting so understanding these molecules and what they do is very very important to understanding why they're valuable to an extraction process and why they're valuable to the cannabis plant and with understanding all of this it's really important to know that they are anti microbials they're anti virals to help keep your body into a homeostasis into that balanced state that we've spoken about before so in many many cases there actually have a lot of similar properties that they exhibit on humans the same way cannabinoids do and the key to all this is that you get this entourage type effect and it's almost like nature's produced and packaged to this perfect little plant and this perfect little combination of terpenes and cannabinoids in order to aid a variety of medical conditions and bring your body back into balance now what we do at precision is we're highly focused around the extraction and isolation of these terpenes the extraction of isolation of these terpenes is a very special process because the molecules in and of themselves whether they're monoterpenes or sesqui terpenes or triterpene there's a bunch of different types of these terpenes but in general they're all very delicate when I say they're very delicate they're very prone to degradation they're very prone to really being diminished or their molecular structure being changed with any sort of heat any sort of excessive stress will say to that molecule without getting into overly technical terms so what we're trying to do from an extraction process is extract these very very gently extract them in a very low temperature and and do that in a manner that is going to actually render that molecule unadulterated in that extract well we commonly end up with as a process for extracting cannabis and extracting these terpenes that uses a very light hydrocarbon mainly butane or propane but most cases moving more towards a propane dominant blend not only we do do we do do that but we also actually take the plant and harvest the plant when it has peak terpene content and the peak terpene content ultimately is extracted with these very light hydrocarbons and we get this soupy sort of saucy type mixture and the key to this is being able to remove that solvent because that solvent is a very light hydrocarbon for example propane can boil off at negative 41 degrees and what we'll actually do is we'll just apply a very light heat so it'll be enough heat to remove the solvent but not enough heat to disturb or degrade any of those terpenes ultimately we can centrifuge those terpenes and separate them from the cannabinoids because the the two layers obviously separate able by the centrifugal force and we have a purified terpene compound and there can obviously be further from chromatography purification steps and things like that but isolating and extracting these cannabis-based terpenes are a key value stream and it's interesting to know that you can isolate these terpenes from many different types of plants now one of the things I said when we when we started out was conifer trees were one of the most abundant sources of terpenoids or terpenes in the in the world right now that that we know of and basically you get very high levels of Alpha and Beta Pi Neen that's why a pine tree alpha and beta piney and you can obviously put that one together but they also have things in there like limonene and lena law and these other different terpenes that kind of make this perfect package and turpentine ironically is mainly alpha and beta pining and it's used as an in cleaning a cleaning agent antiviral antibacterial and insecticide and for a variety of other uses works really well as a solvent in addition so the question is why can't we just isolate these terpenes from these high concentrated areas like say conifer trees and combine them back into cannabis well the answer is is that many state laws actually restrict the use of outside terpenes or non cannabis derived terpenes to be entered back into a cannabis based product so for example in states where we have like a metric system that has a traceability throughout the entire we'll call it seed to sale of the of the cannabis value stream they want those terpenes to be extracted isolated from the original cannabis crop and them to be re-used and re-entered into ultimately that suite of products that's going to be sold so understanding terpenes what they are what they do this level of science how to extract them isolate them refine them very very important to an extraction business it's very very relevant particularly in the cannabis space because most states don't allow for the use of outside terpenes to be reconstituted into a cannabis based product for traceability purposes so with that all being said I really hope you enjoyed our short talk today on terpenes hope you have a better understanding of what they are how they're relevant how they can aid in human health and conditions and how they are specifically relevant to the cannabis industry and how we use them within

you over consume shatter can contain 80 to 90% THC but what is it and how is it made find out on this episode of Wheaties II by the growth up you might have heard of shatter a potent cannabis concentrate made from butane hash oil it's one of the many forms of butane hash oil or BHO in league with wax and cannabis oil used in vapes shatter is the solidified hardest form of BHO earning its nickname because it's transparent and can shatter like glass it's highly potent containing 80 to 90 percent THC according to Health Canada and its effects come on quickly and can last for several hours for that reason it takes far less shatter to get you high when compared to cannabis flour which generally contains up to 30% THC but how is shatter made and how do you consume it firstly shadow is made from the trichomes of the cannabis flower click the letter i' in the top right corner of your screen to watch our video on trichomes and learn just how critical they are to your high to make shatter the trichomes of cannabis buds are separated from the flower using butane and extremely flammable and dangerous gas once separated the trichomes are collected and heated to remove the butane the new substance is mixed to a creamier texture and then solidifies into shatter making shatter is very dangerous and it's not recommended to do it at home people have died or been seriously injured trying to create shatter and this is definitely not something you should do I this is because making shatter or any other BHO involves using butane gas in the process in the extraction process butane gas becomes a liquid and then evaporates when heat is used to remove it from the concentrate since butane is heavier than oxygen after it evaporates it can fall to the floor creating a very hazardous situation especially over a hot stove top this is not the only risk when it comes to BHO though any form of BHO weather shatter or otherwise is highly dangerous to consume orally there's the real risk of poisoning here so shatter and other be a chose shouldn't made into edibles that's because there's a possibility that not all the butane was removed when creating the BHO with all that said shatter can be a pleasantly potent concentrate if used correctly and with care shadow is consumed by heating it and then inhaling the smoke you can consume the shatter by adding a small piece of it to a pipe bomb hash pipe vaporizer or dabbing rig be cautious with dabbing rigs however because they can reach temperatures as high as 400 degrees Celsius and should be handled with care and keep in mind that while shatter can be baked it might be trickier to do so and you might prefer vaping another type of BHO very potent and not for the faint of heart shatter is one of many concentrates available from the cannabis plant and likely better suited to more experienced users thanks for watching we DZ by the growth up subscribe to our channel for more cannabis content and hit the notification Val so you

products\noften worry about bringing their products into foreign countries. They are uncertain of the rules and regulations\nconcerning the use of the product in that country. In this article, we will delve into the laws\nand regulations of Saudi Arabia to determine the extent of the legality of CBD products\nthere. So, keep reading to find more about the CBD\nlegality in Saudi Arabia. What is CBD and Who May be Using it? CBD, also known as Cannabidiol, one of the\ntwo major active ingredients found in hemp. Advancements in the field of medical science\nhave revealed an abundance of potential applications for CBD in treating certain ailments. Consumers dealing with various medical conditions\nfind CBD to be beneficial. It appears that daily consumption of a small\nCBD dosage has assisted in making the ailments more bearable. Research shows that cannabidiol could be used\nin treating chronic pain, arthritis, excessive anxiety, sleep disorders such as insomnia,\nor appetite loss. Researchers are still running studies on this\ntopic due to the increasing popularity of the miracle treatment. The studies done so far have had positive\nresults throughout. Test subjects had a decreased onset of any\nof the symptoms caused by the before listed ailments. Cannabidiol functions by interacting with\nneurotransmitters from our endocannabinoid system. This is the system responsible for regulating\nappetite, sleepiness, pain, and our immune system\u2019s response to infections or disease. By doing so, CBD can alter our perceptions\nof these functions or reduce any symptoms felt by dysfunction in these body areas. There are little known side effects of the\nfrequent consumption of CBD products. Amongst these are: nausea, irritability, and\nslight diarrhea. However, unlike conventional forms of medication\nor treatment, there is no risk of developing an addiction to the substance. Thus, CBD is a very safe alternative to conventional\ntreatments such as opioids. CBD Legality in Saudi Arabia Bringing your beloved products to other countries\nmay seem a tad bit tricky due to the unknown circumstances in those countries. In Saudi Arabia, CBD, hemp-derived or not,\nis forbidden and punishable under the context of drug smuggling. Basically it should not be carried into the\ncountry upon harsh penalty if caught. Also, it is always best to carry a doctor\u2019s\nprescription along with your products when leaving the United States. In the case that an instance does occur where\nyou can be accused of drug smuggling, your prescription may be your best defense. One rule of thumb to remember is that many\ncountries are increasingly strict on bringing certain substances into their premises. Even by bringing something as harmless as\na bottle of CBD gummies, you could potentially be at risk for the harshest penalty of all. It is best not to risk it! Happy Tea Serving Your CBD Needs Regardless of the legality of CBD outside\nof North America, it is still federally legal in all fifty states under certain restrictions\n(check your state\u2019s specific laws on those restrictions). Thus, you are still able to make purchases\nof CBD at renowned website.

republic unfortunately i'm not here to report on the legalities for marijuana in the dr which by the way cannabis is not legal here but while i am here i did think to bring along my weed pen and this morning i placed it on the counter i turned my back for a second and it rolled off and broke and i'm heartbroken but it got me thinking about a few ways that you can salvage the oil in your wheat pen if you break yours of course breaking it accidentally is not the only reason a pen will malfunction sometimes when dealing with weed pens atomizers burn out from turning the temperature too high on a battery or sometimes the battery just won't hold the charge at the end of the day the majority of the vape cartridges are not made with the best quality batteries and technology so they're bound to break from time to time one of the best ways to remove oil from a vape cartridge is to take a small syringe similar to the ones they use to put the oil into the cartridge the mouthpiece on the majority of the standard pre-filled cartridges can be unscrewed once the mouthpiece is unscrewed you can then tip the tip of the syringe into the open cartridge from there it should be pretty easy to pull out all the oil next all you would have to do is just purchase an empty cartridge from a vape shop or online once you obtain that you can simply push the oil straight into the empty cartridge and you're good to go [Music] now if you don't have an empty cartridge to refill but you have a syringe full of oil well then it's time to do some dabs you can use any dab rig that you would normally use with the concentrates that you purchased from a dispensary just simply heat the nail or banger on your dab break let it cool and slowly push on the syringe until a drop of oil falls out and then inhale the smoke now if the oil seems to be too stable to push out of the syringe then try and heat the syringe so that the oil becomes more viscous but don't over heat or burn the syringe hot air from a blow dryer usually works best or you can even use hot water as long as there's a strong sealed cap on your syringe [Music] now the simplest way to salvage oil that you pulled out of a broken marijuana cartridge is to eat it that's right after you pulled the oil out of the cartridge you can actually eat it you can add it to any meal or drink to consume the concentrate since the distillate does not have thca there's no need to decarboxylate the marijuana as it's already ready to consume the moment you pull it out of the cartridge the other ingredients in vape cartridges are generally regarded as safe to consume by the fda so you're pretty much good to go and you can add the oil directly to any food or beverage risk-free another option for you is to simply put a small bit of oil on top of a regular marijuana flour bowl now you can use a pipe a bomb a bubbler or any other smoking device just put a few drops per bowl and that should enhance the flour you're smoking some people even like to put some drops of oil in blunt wraps or on joints um and it works like a charm and it makes the smoking experience just a little bit sweeter i think anyways now if you're thinking of using the oil to make your joint a super joint well then i recommend putting the oil on the outside of the joint after it's rolled then if you want to get really crazy and you happen to have some keep saved up in your grinder then you can actually roll the joint into the key basically making your own moon rock joint and lastly if the oil you have is thin and might have already been cut with polyethylene glycol or something similar it should work in an e-cig or an e-juice vaporizer and there you have it making the best out of a bad situation i hope this video helped you figure out a way to salvage the oil from your broken weed pen obviously you want to be as careful as possible with cannabis products because sometimes accidents happen but marijuana is expensive so don't waste it if

protein powder and when we were looking into it look I can't even believe that you can't grow this like doesn't do anything to your consciousness zero it doesn't affect you at all because it's related to pot it's illegal the National hemp museum is in versailles kentucky isn't really where I graduated high school do because it's Woodford County Kentucky was at one point the largest him producing Counting the entire nation whoa it just I don't know something about the limestone is total conditions the humidity sunlight now shot in him it was really really well Wow the first legal 508 or acre hemp farm in Kentucky unveiled so now it's legal in October oh wow so now they can grow it excellent beautiful I don't live there anymore so I'm out of touch but hey that's great news that's fantastic news that's amazing well we're just talking about something that I was gonna bring up oh [ __ ] I can't remember something about something about new mr. Nelson something new stuff that had to do with with legalization marijuana in Kentucky we were just talking yeah yeah it's just it's just pretty crazy that you'd have a hemp museum and have it be illegal for so long with no argument there's like there's no science it doesn't pollute anything it doesn't do anything the environment the nation makes amazingly built on it yeah everything was made out of that [ __ ] do you ever see the first Henry Ford Model T where he made the fenders out of hemp and he's hitting it with a hammer not know though dude you had to watch this we'll play this for you it's the craziest [ __ ] ever Henry Ford's very first car that he made he made the fenders out of hemp and you're watching him hit this [ __ ] fender with a hammer and a hammer is just bouncing off the fender check this out and this is crazy I mean I don't know when was this what did it say Jamie was the time it said their 1941 1941 so in 1941 before it was illegal so it was made and it was made illegal right around the time where alcohol prohibition had ended and they needed something to go after so then they started using the same guys to go after weed and this was pre that look at this he's hitting this [ __ ] thing with a the back of an axe it's just bouncing off it was also a great way to discriminate against Mexican immigrants it was and black people to the whole name marijuana came from a Mexican slang for a wild tobacco didn't have anything to do with marijuana they just created this thing like when they made it illegal the the people that were they didn't even understand they're making hemp illegal they had all that explain it to everybody then they were they had like tax stamps that you had to but about DuPont understood that all the Institute's to the [ __ ] out of it so did William Randolph Hearst that guy was the craziest the guy whose Citizen Kane was based on rules that guy was the craziest so here is this guy's hitting this hemp fender with a [ __ ] hammer Henry Rollins testing it Henry Rollins goddamn it look you barely smudged the thing I mean they're so superior to metal and it's easy it's a renewable resource like we're we've [ __ ] this up so bad it's so obvious it's one of the biggest example said why are you drone on about pot all the time it's because these things like that are one of the biggest examples of just how egregious making it illegal is it is a it's one of the most amazing plants we've ever discovered you can make your house out of it you can [ __ ] eat at you can get high with it you can make your clothes with it it has all the amino acids you could use for heating oil you could what to treat cancer patients treat cancer patients with this here first I mean somebody put it here come on come on come on right it helps reduce tumor size it's crazy helps a host of different diseases I know a lot of people that have like serious inflammation problems they smoke some weed and they're alright just lightens everything up and it's illegal and you can grow it you grow your own you can grow a [ __ ] ton of it in your backyard anybody could do you have a sprinkler okay you got some good dirt alright you got some weed that weeds just good to go that's a [ __ ] hardy ass plant yeah my grandmother she just had some some health stuff and it's like you know how do I you know she's pretty old-school like well knowing there's this thing out there that that isn't anything that these doctors are gonna offer it's just gonna make her feel awful yeah and and you know ever have to go through all of that somebody just give you comfort and it ease nausea or make you want to eat food or those kind of things like why wouldn't you want someone you love and care about to have that but then at the same time you know you want to be the person trying to feed pot to your grandmother yeah it's a hard sell it's a hard sell yeah it's just stunning how well propaganda from 1933 carried all the way the [ __ ] to 2018 it's stunning is it I mean but it's almost a hundred years yeah with what we like the amount of information that you can get on a subject now like say if you're the bet the medical benefits of cannabis just google that and you'll just start reading all the [ __ ] like if it seems to me that enough people would go wait what are we doing like why is it illegal nobody's died from it like no one more people die of aspirin every year because zero die from pot so it's really the number zero it doesn't mean that people are going to get high and walking at traffic some some are gonna but I think part of that is because we're not too teaching people how to get high properly someone gets high for them but it's time you let a poner how many of those people that are getting hit by cars are actually looking at their phones it could be a lot they were high and looking at the phones you don't see that here like you're doing in Nashville I drove around and that's like if I can't hate that and you look every time was driving on a town everybody's texting everybody's looking down you can always spot on the interstate yeah we've been home but you don't see that in California guys you guys have like really heavy loss saw today yeah so today some lady had drifted completely in my lane and I looked over at her and I saw the back of her head like I was I was on the driver side I was on that side looking over at her and all I saw was the back of it she literally wasn't looking at my car and she was just looking her phone and working her thumb and occasionally like looking up at the screen or looking up at the wind chills like whoa you crazy lady you think just cuz you're going 40 miles an hour that's okay cuz you're on a side street like you're not even looking where you're going you driving a car what if you hit a kid Jesus Christ [ __ ] what if you slam into some old lady you know what if you rear-end a bike you're not even looking you didn't notice the bike was there boom you run over some guy's leg what in the [ __ ] lady or dude maybe I was misgendering I don't know I don't know what her statuses you gotta be real careful today Sturgill amazed it like that Nashville is ever like super I don't know bro I don't leave the house I really don't have any idea I just I think that's a good move yeah you know I like my kids I mean I'm somewhat aware of everything going on it's surprising that none of that's really hit the music business mmm as hard as it is but there's just yeah I try to just do my thing yeah there's a weird weird world were living

"[Music] hi there buds I got quite a few requests on my cooking with cannabis videos for me to make cannabis coconut oil and after looking on YouTube how to make cannabis coconut oil I can totally see why you guys want this video there are legitimately a ton of different methods on YouTube on how to make cannabis coconut oil and a lot of them give varying instructions and times so I'm gonna give you guys my way of making cannabis coconut oil and I have tried a few methods then this method is what works best for me and what I think will be easiest for you guys so without further ado let's get this video started you're going to need a few things in order to make cannabis coconut oil the first thing that you're going to need is coconut oil I'm going to use 14 fluid ounces and I'm going to infuse a half ounce of bud into that you could also use an ounce of shake or if you have a lower quality wheat you could probably use an ounce but I think I'm only gonna need a half ounce because I used some pretty good weed the next thing you're going to need is a half ounce of wheat which I already have my decarboxylated you're gonna want to do that before making this cannabis coconut oil and if you don't know how to decarboxylate we click up here and I'll show you how next you're doing the need cheesecloth and then the last thing you're going to need obviously is a slow cooker let's get to making some coconut oil the first thing you're gonna want to do is set your slow cooker to low the next thing you're going to want to do is add your coconut oil and let that all melt down [Music] and be sure to save the jar because this will be perfect for storing your cannabis coconut oil in after your diet [Music] the next thing you're going to want to do is add that 1/2 ounce of decarboxylated cannabis to the oil and stir it up well to make sure that all the cannabis is coated in oil you're gonna put a lid on it and you're gonna let that sit for four to six hours while that coconut oil is cooking in the slow cooker I went ahead and removed the label from the coconut oil jar and look it says 4:20 on it this was meant to be you guys this was meant to be cannabis coconut oil sometimes you just get signs like that five hours late ale and this is what the oil looks like after about five and a half hours it's turned this nice green color as you can see now all we need to do is strain this out and it will be ready for use [Music] [Music] and this is what we're left with a nice dark green and fuse cannabis coconut oil I'm gonna go ahead and take that jar that I had open it up and pour the oil into it [Music] and there we have a whole jar of cannabis coconut oil you could use this in cooking you could use this in baking you could use this in smoothies I think that's what I'm gonna do next is make some type of medicated smoothie with some cannabis coconut oil if you liked this video give it a thumbs up leave a comment down below if you've ever made cannabis

IN BALTIMORE, THEO HAYES WBAL TV\n11 N", "mfXGpVi-YRs": "hi when I was invited here to give a talk on marijuana I wasn't sure exactly what that meant on the subject of or just on I hate to disappoint so I'm doing both my pleasure have you ever really looked at your hand I tell that joke because according to lore people high on marijuana are amazed by their limbs often Wells slow motion speed eating Doritos in their parents basement I hate this joke because it invokes a stereotype that is reductive at best and supports a system of diabolical lies at worst but I'm getting ahead of myself my name is David Schneider and I am a pothead by this I mean that when it comes time to enjoy an adult intoxicant I will forego beer wine and spirits in favor of marijuana which for me offers a world of nuanced delight and inspiration beyond the more crude effects of booze but I am NOT here to proselytize and for a long time I kept quiet about my own enjoyment of weed it was illegal for most of the time I was enjoying it and why make myself vulnerable as an out-and-proud law breaker if I didn't have to I also dreaded being saddled with the stoner stereotype of having my every move interpreted through the lens of pothead a label that calls up images of mr. Magoo levels of forgetfulness and passivity bordering on the comatose so what if I used weed not to escape but to engage with art and ideas and food and dogs and hilariously terrible movies I was but one man and I couldn't reconfigure society's image of the pothead all by myself I stayed in the closet and I'm familiar with the closet I grew up gay in the pre Elin bad old days when the only out gays were those who couldn't or didn't want to hide it drag queens and butch lesbians and gay bar raid victims whose faces wound up in newspapers and these Trailblazers might have been the whole of queer representation if Harvey Milk hadn't urged everyone to come out especially all the non remarkable queers who'd previously flown under the radar only then could an honest portrait of this subculture emerge it's the same with weed only instead of drag queens and Butch's weeds visibility parade is led by Cheech and Chong and Snoop Dogg and unlucky subjects of weed busts and I love drag queens and Snoop Dogg but leaving such exceptional outliers to do the heavy lifting of representation not only skews perception it allows damaging lies to flourish and the primary source of these lies is unfortunately the US government which has strenuously vilified weed and its users for over 80 years in 1930 the head of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics declared and I quote marijuana causes white women to seek sexual relations with Negroes and makes [ __ ] think they're as good as white men this type of slander presented as science was codified in 1970 when the Controlled Substances Act scheduled marijuana as a Schedule one narcotic a designation reserved for extremely dangerous drugs with no accepted medical use it is hard to overstate the pernicious effects of this weeds Schedule one classification for one thing by scheduling weed as a dangerous drug with no medical benefit the government makes it extremely difficult to conduct research that would prove that marijuana is a not very dangerous drug with a wealth of medical benefits for example to study allegedly less dangerous schedule to drugs scientists just the schedule to drugs like cocaine or crystal meth allegedly less dangerous schedule 2 to study these drugs scientists just whip up some crystal meth and study it but to study schedule 1 marijuana researchers must be pre-approved by the FDA apply for government grown marijuana from the National Institute of drug abuse and be temporarily deputized by the DEA as only federal agents are allowed to handle schedule 1 narcotics add to this the fact that most funding for drug research comes from the pharmaceutical industry which views weed is a threat and has a vested interest in keeping it labeled as a dangerous drug with no medical benefits but as patients in two dozen Medical Marijuana states can tell you weed has a ton of medical benefits from quashing nausea to minimizing arthritis pain to controlling seizure disorders and in the face of all this cognitive dissonance with the government's lies chafing against the actual experience of humans speaking honestly about my own we'd use seemed like the least I could do so I started doing it I'm a writer who often writes about myself and being honest about we'd was a lot like being honest about gayness both called for greater specificity instead of saying I was on a date say I was out with a guy when writing about celebrating with friends mention the ball when I started this coming out stoner campaign weed was still illegal where I lived but I worked in an alternative news weekly that encouraged radical honesty and where I'd gotten high with the editor and publisher still fixing myself with the stoner label was itchy and I offset dread of stereotyping by stepping up my professional courtesy game I was aggressively punctual ostentatiously well-organized and as reasonably well motivated as every other person on earth and the world turned now it's 2015 and within a five-mile radius of where you sit here in Seattle there are a half dozen stores where anyone over 21 can purchase marijuana for recreational use there are also a couple dozen dispensaries where authorized patients can buy marijuana for medicinal use meanwhile 300 miles east selling the small amount of marijuana for any reason can earn the seller a life sentence an insane state of affairs summed up well by CNN's Mike Riggs it should be cruel and unusual to mete out life without parole sentences for a drug that's so mainstream that Colorado is using state collected pot taxes to build new schools yeah and sorry about the notecards I'm really bad at memorizing so we need to strive for integrity in our nation's pot laws and a good first step is moving beyond the marijuana monster myths peddled by the feds one such myth marijuana is a gateway drug no it's not the gateway drug theory holds that people that smoke weed are more likely to try harder drugs but the main thing pushing weed smokers towards harder drugs our black-market weed dealers selling harder drugs the prohibition creates the connection another myth people just want medical marijuana to get high shut up the most exciting developments in medical marijuana involves strains that are incapable of making anyone high opening a world of treatment for people who want their medicine without a side of stoned like kids with seizure disorders also it is fascinating how this people just want X to get high argument is never applied to prescription painkillers which killed ten thousand people a year prescription painkillers killed 10,000 people a year while no one in the history of the world has ever died from marijuana another myth marijuana will make you stupid and maybe insane this one's harder to dismiss and not because it is true but because it can be true for weeds most vulnerable potential users which are kids for those whose brains and bodies are still developing marijuana can create a lifetime of problems from diminished learning capacities to an enhanced chance of mental illness and humans under 21 should not smoke or otherwise ingest marijuana and actually maybe even 21 is too young if I were in charge people wouldn't be able to start smoking weed until halfway through grad school speaking of white privilege earlier I mentioned Seattle's many weed stores all of them raking in huge legal profits on the same streets where earlier weed entrepreneurs earned prison sentences and if recreational marijuana is ever going to be a truly guilt free pleasure we need to rectify our nation's pot laws and do right by those whose lives were ruined by draconian war on drugs sentencing for now if you are someone who appreciates marijuana either as medicine or diversion or both come out you don't need to cast yourself as a marijuana spokesmodel but stop treating your weed based pleasures as a source of shame to be kept secret and the rest of you stop lazily accepting the old stoner lore I understand that we live in an age of fewer and fewer acceptable stereotypes and we want to cherish those few we have left but the stupid stoner one is just boring seriously if I could get every weed smoking surgeon and lawyer and new New York Times bestselling author I know here with me on stage and if we had spent the past couple weeks rehearsing the Thriller dance we could blow your faces off thank you", "tz6QveHJ4y4": "to smoke or to vape that is the question at least according to the state of New York hey guys Tara here for dnews and we've reached a turning point in our country where marijuana use is starting to become the norm whether it's medicinal or recreational andrew Cuomo the governor of New York State is expected to sign a bill soon that will legalize the drug but there are rumors that only certain methods of intake will be legalized specifically anything that does not involve the actual flower so edibles THC pills and vaporizing would all be okay now we've been hearing a lot of news lately about e-cigarettes and how those are supposedly better for your health than smoking actual cigarettes but how do we there stack up and are they better or worse for you than smoking say a joint let's go back to basics for a second now a raw cannabis plant contains over a hundred different cannabinoids which are chemical compounds that bind it to the cannabinoid receptors in your brain cells one of those cannabinoids is THC which is what's responsible for the psychotropic effects of smoking weight then there are others like CBD which gives you a body high but without all the mental fogginess now depending on where it's grown a cannabis plant will naturally contain anywhere from four to 65% THC and products with a high THC content like hash don't actually need heat in order to be activated you could still experience their effects just by ingesting them it's just that heating makes them even more potent now when you smoke a joint you're using an open flame which is very high heat and that combustion process activates the THC so when you inhale it the alveoli lining your lungs will deliver it straight into your bloodstream that's why you feel the effects of marijuana almost immediately after smoking vaporizers on the other hand use a process called conduction heating where either the raw plant or an extract of the plant has direct contact with a heat source but without an open flame so it uses a lower temperature and it heats it up just enough to be able to vaporize the THC that way you still feel the effects of it but without all the health problems that come along with smoking now much like a cigarette paper rising marijuana is still a relatively new thing so it's hard to say exactly what the long term effect but unlike ecigs you really don't have any outside chemicals to contend with so it's still widely agreed to be better for you than smoking burning marijuana produces carcinogens it can cause you to inhale soot and it can exacerbate problems like asthma shortness of breath and coughing basically it irritates the hell out of your lungs and there have been many studies showing that switching to cannabis vaporizers from smoking is effective for relieving those symptoms a 2007 study found that marijuana users inhaled fewer toxic compounds and less carbon monoxide when vaping compared with smoking it also tastes and smells better and from a medical standpoint it just kind of makes sense there's no medicine out there that you have to smoke in order to use so if the option to vaporize cannabis exists why wouldn't we use it well like anything there are a few caches for one paper izing can be way more potent than smoking and it's harder to actually determine how much THC you're getting many people say the effects of vaporizing lasts longer but also produce a more even high it also depends on your specific method if you're using dabs which are a super concentrated form of hash oil it can be really easy to overindulge dab users have also been shown to develop more tolerance to marijuana and have a greater risk of withdrawal which can lead to things like irritability and sleep problems even so it's hard to deny the relative benefits of vaping over smoking as long as people are responsible about how much they're dosing then this law may very well set a precedent for future marijuana laws what do you guys think would you support legalization even if it bans smoking outright or is this a step in the wrong direction let us know in the comments below as always thank you guys for watching", "33Tow5gDvoI": "they explain to my viewers what RSO is in the most simple terms you can so as we hear that term a lot tomorrow RSO is basically a full plant extracted with ethanol oil so you get all the benefits of the you know the fact that wax is the lipids and the terpenes of the cannabis plant we more focus on we use freeze pure hundred proof of ethanol we use we get our ethanol down to freezing temperatures and do a quick wash so we focus more on extracting just the cannabinoids experiment the fats and waxes that go there give you three process yeah okay that's why ours is usually a lot better color than your traditional RSM oh so we don't really consider it too much our our Morikawa a CEO for alcohol but it is all fully activated it is generally it's just harvested over which is what you're actually wanted to take this", "hQ-2ooQuUkU": "[Music] hi and welcome to canada basics today we're going to learn how to make bubble hash [Music] bubble hash is one of the oldest and purest methods of making concentrated cannabis and uses only ice and water as a solvent it's easy to do but requires time patience and some elbow grease so let's get started here's what you need to make bubble hash when it comes to making bubble hash you are going to need some bubble bags and these are usually vinyl bags that are designed to fit inside of one gallon or five gallon buckets and they have a silk or micron screen bottoms and those that vary in different sizes 25 to 220 microns and you're going to need three to five different sizes of those you can find links to those kinds of bags on amazon in the description you're also going to need a wooden dowel to agitate the cannabis you're going to need some ice about 10 15 pounds of ice you're also going to need some cannabis you can use any grain of cannabis that you want for here we're going to use about three or four ounces of outdoor grown cannabis if you're using outdoor grown cannabis or any kind of cannabis you're going to go ahead and manicure it down to its buds so go ahead and pull off the major portion of the leaves until you get down to the pods unless you're actually using shake and trim which you can also make bubble hash out of shake and trim but we're using the buds and we're going to go ahead and manicure that down the next thing you're going to do is to layer your bags inside of the bucket we're using a five gallon bucket you may use a one gallon bucket also depending on the bags that you have but the thing that you want to do is you want to layer your screens inside of the bucket starting with the smaller screen first so in this case we've put our 25 micron screen in then we put our 73 micron screen in now we're putting our 160 micron screen in and then lastly we'll be putting our 220 micron screen back in and micron screens and that a micron is the measurement of microns with 220 microns means that 220 microns will fit through each hole in that screen and then so the smaller the number the smaller the size of the holes so and now that we've added our screens and layered them up and now we've added our cannabis into our 220 micron screen we've added about three or four ounces of cannabis and then now we're adding in ice now the ice is being used in this case to lower the temperature so that it freezes the trichomes and so that the stems of the trichomes are brittle and the trichome heads break off into the water so you want to use as much ice as possible so we're putting as much ice in we're covering up our cannabis and we're coming about six inches from the bottom of our pocket and now we're also going to add water and you want to add water so that it covers up into barely covers the cannabis which is in the the bottom of our top bag so you can tilt the screens or tilt the bucket to find out if see if you estimate if you have enough cannabis enough water to cover your cannabis but that's the idea is that you want to have enough water to cover your cannabis as well as up into the eyes and what we're doing is we're freezing the the trichomes so that the stems become brittle and the trichomes heads fall off and the idea is that to break and agitate the cannabis so now we're agitating turning and using our wooden dowels to actually literally just agitate and mix the cannabis being sure not to poke holes into our micron screens we're going to keep agitating as much as possible you can do this for several minutes 15-20 minutes or so and then after you do that you're going to let it settle and we've uh what we've done is we've broken frozen those trichrome heads and we've letting them uh fall into the water and then they've fallen through those micron screens and this larger micron screen we're now taking that out it's been several minutes after it's been agitated and it's been sitting for about 45 minutes and now we're taking out the the top screen the 220 micron and setting it aside and now we're going to pull up our first green which will have trapped some of the uh larger pieces of cannabis and our thc and trichomes and also some plant material so this first layer of screens that we're pulling out is going to be our least pure it's going to have our most plant material it's our biggest micron screen and most of the thc has actually fallen through this screen so but you can see there we've pulled out a little bit of bubble hash there and it's a darker color hash and then now we're pulling out our second screen and in order to uh save the cannabis that was left on the screen that we didn't wash off we're inverting it carefully and then dipping it back into the next green down into the water that's in that screen and that is to wash the trichomes off into that next screen so now we're removing the second screen out i believe this would be our uh 73 micron screen and we're we're letting the water fall out of that we're not going to squeeze it we're gonna let it fall out and then you can see now that the trichomes that are left there a little lighter color than the first set and there's also more of them and there's a lot less plant material here as you can see compared to the previous hash that came out it's a lot lighter color but again we're rinsing the remaining hashtag we didn't scrape off into the next batch or into the last screen so we make sure our screen is nice and clean and then we've come to our last screen and this is our 25 micron screen and we'll see this is the finest screen and this is going to make sure that pretty much anything left on here that's any thc is going to get trapped in this screen here and as we scrape that up you can see it's pretty easy to collect the cannabis or the thc that's collected there or the hash and it's a nice uh lighter a little more blonde color than the previous two a little bit more pure and you can see that's why those screens are used so that you can get different grades of hash and the next step now a lot of people would use a micro on screen here we didn't have a micron screen we're just using some cheese cloth or a muslin cotton muslin bag here and we're squeezing out the water it's just being pressed out gently with some palm pressure there to press out the water and what's going to be remaining is bubble hash and what we've got here is three different grades of bubble hash depending on the three different screens that we used and and in the end we're actually going to combine all of our hash altogether so i'm just showing you the different screens there for demonstration purposes but if you're only going to use one grade of hash in the end uh there's really no need to have multiple screens you might just use one or two screens in that case but for demonstration purposes we're using multiple screens to show how you'd get different grades of hash and now that we've uh we've gone one run of our canvas you can do this two or three different times or even up to five or more times with each batch of cannabis so this is the second run with the same batch of cannabis just with another run of the water and ice this one actually sat overnight this second run we got a pretty good yield off of it even better than the first and then we even decided to go ahead and run a third run off of the same batch of cannabis and so even after collecting two pretty good batches of bubble hash with it we went ahead and decided to go the third one and even after the third running we're still getting some more hash out of it you can see after the third time the cannabis is getting it looks like a lot like seaweed it's very foamy it get agitates a lot easier and it also gets foams up a lot easier as the last two or three batches were gone but once they pressed out the the phone goes away and you can see that there are three different batches of bubble hash there at different stages of drying out and you can see that the uh the newer batch is much muddier looking uh the batch in the center there is the first batch we did is dried out from overnight this episode of cannabis is brought to you by the roughhouse studios smoke shop selling raw rolling papers accessories vaporizers much more a great process save 10 off everything with the code kind of basic i do

choose to send their kid back to daycare at six months and go back to work are stigmatized moms will always be harshly judged more harshly judged than anybody else but as soon as I became a mom I hit it it was a secret even though I have a prescription and I use it for medicinal purposes Vickey below lows is a month the growing number of women who use marijuana while breastfeeding and while pregnant even as medical experts warn against doing just that in fact a recent national survey Fallot there's been a two-fold increase in women using cannabis during pregnancy many of them do so to find relief from things like morning sickness chronic pain and depression among other ailments [Music] Vicki had suffered from debilitating migraines foreigners at age 18 she found what she says was the best remedy in the form of a joint the first thing everybody told me as soon as I got pregnant is you're gonna stop consuming cannabis right you're not gonna use kind of this while pregnant right and she did it during her first trimester she also stopped taking migraine pills it's been three days I'm in bed with a migraine I can't go to work I'm throwing up I can't eat like my body's in a state of distress like that can't be good for my pregnancy that can't be good for the baby that can't be good for me Vicky's doctor prescribed a morphine drip to ease the migraines but for her that didn't seem like the best option I decided to consume cannabis and within 30 minutes I did feel better and I did have relief why did you feel more comfortable using marijuana instead of using the morphine your doctor prescribed because it's an opioid and it's a proven addictive substance but if I continuously took and put it into my body not only would I be addicted but my baby would be addicted by drinking my breast fill I'm back I knew in my heart of hearts that there was other women and mothers out there like me that we're using cannabis for medicinal purposes instead of pharmaceuticals because they didn't want to use pharmaceuticals and I knew they existed I just never knew how to find them recreational cannabis has been legal in Canada since October 2018 and it's been possible to get a prescription for medical cannabis for almost ten years but a shift in the law doesn't always mean a shift in attitude in Quebec doctors are reluctant to prescribe I think there's a lot of a lot of fear a lot of worry when it comes to kids anything involving kids in cannabis and whether it's pregnant women with a fetus hysteria around that cannabis use is still stigmatized Jordana's of its key looks marijuana every single day before she was a mom she used cannabis to get a handle on her anxiety and depression and when she found out she was expecting so pregnancy for me was a nightmare I jumped to being pregnant my entire adult life and when it finally happened I was bedridden with symphysis pubis dysfunction and that's all so it's when you were and your pelvis basically separates from a hormone called relaxin in your body and it happened too early on at 18 weeks I was throwing up until I was 22 weeks pregnant it's up to three times a day if I hadn't used cannabis I'm a prenatal depression and anxiety was so severe that I was not able to get off my couch even in the severe pain that I was dealing with physically it was really bad for me mentally and cannabis was the only release that I got from pain and from the anxiety that Jordanna was reluctant to use cannabis at first but changed her mind after coming across studies conducted in Jamaica back in the 90s that research found that babies born to mothers who consumed marijuana heavily during pregnancy didn't suffer any psychological or neurological setbacks after birth that was enough for Jordanna to take the plunge well I knew that it was working for me and I continued to advocate for myself with my doctors Jordanna was desperate for support and someone to talk to about her marijuana use that need led her to start a cyber support group for other moms in a similar situation that's how she met Annie clawed Bertrand another young mom who turned to cannabis during a difficult pregnancy the two teamed up to create Mother's marry mother's Mary is a not-for-profit organization that empowers and supports moms to live their most authentic lives using cannabis consciously through introspection and attempt right now we are an online peer support group and essentially everyone can utilize the group every day and you know be supported and empowered in that in that space they come to us with questions we accordi three new members today I feel like our Facebook group is growing at a rapid pace today with the exposure in our local community it's proving that like there's you think there's a stigma that comes with being a mom there's a ginormous stigma that's why we're moving our movement for us it's really important to not say terms like stoned or high now or baked like that's not that's not where what's going qualify though I'm Olivier listed faded and yes medicated you guys have a whole slew of synonyms yeah for marijuana and for the feeling of vampire on it yeah [Music] [Music] Annie has two kids and didn't touch marijuana during her first pregnancy but her symptoms both physical and emotional became unbearable with baby number two I vomit up to three or four times a day like being in meetings that were having fun run out and just being like I cannot wait to go home and just have it blend a little puffs like have dinner and try to keep it down you know it's really people I think people underestimate morning sickness like it's really debilitating postpartum depression just took me to the very deepest darkest depths of my life and I didn't know how I was gonna come out felt very suicidal and if it wasn't for cannabis thing I would be I would be divorced or I wouldn't be here we want to give women the pros and the cons and then you make your own decision based on what's right for you what's best for you like your own risk benefit ratio and analysis you know as well yes you advocate for themselves to go to their doctors and other doctors their family members their spouses whoever and are you showing the research article oh yeah oh yeah what do you say to the medical evidence that suggests we're not entirely sure if or how harmful this could be to kids mm-hmm I think that what we have to remember is that no mother is taking this lightly it's definitely not moms who don't need medication who are doing this recreationally that's not what we're talking about but what exactly does the medical evidence suggest we know that marijuana exposure during pregnancy affects the brain of the developing baby dr. katrina mark is an ob/gyn who has closely studied marijuana use during pregnancy the effects of marijuana on the developing fetus are much more long-term than immediate and so you may not be able to see them directly after birth but long-term the effects could range from no discernible difference to difficulties with learning learning disabilities attention disorders and even mental health disorders the response when I tell people that it can be harmful is often but it's not really proven right which I disagree with it is proven that it crosses the placenta and it has effects on the baby's brain and so although I can't show you a picture of exactly what your baby's going to look what like the way I can with something like fetal alcohol syndrome the changes with marijuana exposure are much more nuanced they're not seen five minutes or five days or even five months after birth typically they're not seen for five ten fifteen years and so they're much harder to study and much harder to characterize although pregnant women may experience relief from morning sickness after smoking a joint dr. mark doesn't want women to turn to marijuana as a first resort marijuana use during pregnancy has risks to both mom and baby and I would encourage any women who is using they're considering using it to talk to her doctor about the risks of use and about the potential safer alternatives in the same breath I think that we all need to distinct Nancy and outside of pregnancy because the stigma that surrounds marijuana use some pregnancy makes women feel uncomfortable disclosing their use and if they don't disclose their use to their doctors they can't make an informed decision because they're not receiving the information about the risks Viki never told her doctor that she smoked marijuana while pregnant as with any medication just like morphine or anything else they ask you if the risks outweigh the benefits and for me they did I don't think I would have made it through my pregnancy I don't think I would have been okay to make it through if I wasn't able to medicate when my migraines were that bad I would have ended up in the hospital and I would have ended up on a morphine drip and those have known and proven side effects they're known and proven but th is unknown and unproven that you were using marijuana while you were pregnant my parents my sisters my husband would we eat after Bach you need a diaper were you ever worried about people knowing only in the sense that the fear that maybe they would call child services on me that my child would get taken away from me was that a real concern were you afraid yeah it wasn't actually very afraid I was actually very afraid that I would have been seeing like a drug addict when I clearly wasn't how did you get over that fear I guess I didn't I really I guess I didn't I live without fear my whole pregnancy Oh mommy's here you're so sneaky Spears and sense of isolation went away when she discovered mothers marry online after her son was already born hey Vicki we're so excited today to officially be offering you at your role and we also are gifting you of course you're very excited she even ended up joining the team I put myself out there and um I feel like just so blessed that I was so well received and everybody was so kind to me and so supportive of me and I instantly found the community that you know I loved and here was a bunch of women that I never met I didn't know them personally but I loved them and that when they would write something in the group or comment something I worried about them and I cared about them and that was something I had never found before and as a mom for me it was just life-changing I don't know how else to describe it here we so emotional I know [Music] is it worth the risk um yeah it is worth the risk I know that it made me better I've seen my children from having them in my bellies to the age that they are now and they've hit every milestone they're developing beautiful ease [Music] I don't think cannabis is for everybody especially if you don't suffer from anxiety mental health or fibromyalgia or epilepsy or multiple sclerosis there's a bunch of the elements that cannabis does has been proven to help with so if you don't suffer from one of those things and I don't think you know you really need to consider it but I definitely think you need to consider it if you aren't being prescribed morphine or effects or or serafall and you're pregnant I think that it's a much better medical benefit for yourself and for your child I do stand by that and as opposed to poo as opposed to pills as opposed to pharmaceuticals with with proven by effects with proven site like birth defects in children kind of a saved my life so I don't think I would be here without it being a mom and suffering from severe postpartum depression the cannabis is really the only thing that kept me feeling like I had hope and if I haven't gotten my medical cannabis good morning I'm a new member from Quebec I felt very alone in my universe of a mother smoker they also feel better when he smoked when I'm under the effect of marijuana you

of edutainment the place you are laughing being entertained but most importantly where you're learning something that you apply it to your own personal life and make it better how am i doing today I'm doing more sing less and keeping that same energy no cap so had a young lady a woman message me about her drug test situation so she's in the process of getting into the military and she was talking about how detoxing business isn't necessarily the issue but if you're actually smoking weed while she trying to detox to see for my body and pass the drug test so when it comes to the quitting leave so that you can actually detox and not have not no longer have heat in your system it's a couple components right you know how to detox ideally you've seen some of my past videos intermittent fasting at least 16 eighth fasting to eating our window income laughs of water Gandhi ideally working outs but not 24 hours on to your actual drug test and also incorporating more movements throughout your day the goal each day I would say based on my research based on my videos are watched get about 10,000 steps in each day this will help you not be so sedative right so that you work a knob of three to four times out of the week but each day you are still getting about 10,000 steps which for further help your lymphatic system transfer toxins out of your body and help you to get the necessary nutrients to various various areas of your body because you have the lymphatic system and we also have the circulatory system right you know if the thing about pumping your hearts you don't think about blood going from your veins to other everybody but the lymphatic system actually needs you to be active to move in order to get the various nutrients and toxins out of your body in a coherent time period so that's that part but as far as quitting really concerned right she was saying how because she can't quote-unquote smoke weed or she doesn't want to smoke weed it makes your brain actually you want to smoke anymore but you have to wait okay don't eat it I'll be right back okay don't touch it wait for me to come back don't eat it okay yeah I thought I'd told you to wait but is it good why did you even it don't know but was it good what I mentioned this in the past but I just wanted to make sure that more people are aware do focus on what you don't wants focused on the outcome that you actually want okay anytime the thought to smoke arises or pops up into your head at cravings what is your is your thought process pop pop your thought process that should be what do I want out of this why Mike why am i quitting me right the more pregnant is to you the more personal it is to you the more likely you are to follow through and not do that for get me into your craving for example it's important for you to take a take inventory of when you usually smoke will you usually I'm awake and Baker were usually smoking to fall asleep or were you smoking throughout the day right once you know the time means that you that you tend to smoke the next process should be what can I do that time now instead of waking and baking for the first three minutes everyday or as soon as you wake up you go for a walk 30 minutes don't just focus on the outcome that you don't want but creates new habits and focus on the outcome that you do want right the craving hits you okay I'd rather go for a walk I'd rather save money I'd rather save money second build an emergency fund so I can buy a house so I can have my own apartment I've ever seen money so that I can quit my job and be okay for a couple months while I look for a better job I'd rather be healthy and go work out I'd rather be healthy how have the desire to go for a walk stuff like that that's what you want to be focusing your mind on not on you want to focus your mind on the outcome that you want but we're also creating new habits creating a new no association between a certain time period of the day and an activity so in the evening if you usually smoking what can you do now because not your time we hands now the hour two hours 30 minutes that you would have been smoking what are you doing through time now right are you reading a book are you creating content for your own YouTube channel might make some money so carrying your own bag are you spending that time with your kids 30 minutes of playing with your kids or playing video games it doesn't have to be this is ugly talking but just playing video games instead right but essentially you're creating new habits or creating a new activity for yourself that coincides with the time that you used to smoke weed right so focus on the outcome that she wants and create new activities for yourself that can further change your normal association to marijuana right so this is something to think about when you are trying to detox to also new pass the drug test we know about the detox methods but I mean that's all gonna be very useful if you are relapsing throughout your whole seven-day 14 days leading up down to your drug test and like I said time and time again if you want to know whether or not you are actually addicted to marijuana or you're smoking too much you go for a week one week tolerance breaking you can go for a full week and not experience withdrawal symptoms like insomnia my sweats cravings stuff like that sure I guess you would never really addicted but if you go through the seven days either you can't make it the seven days or you experience withdrawal symptoms throughout those seven days you were smoking it a bit too much and let's even go further you can go thirty days without smoking marijuana you will be able to have a greater perspective on whether or not marijuana is the thing that was holding you back in life or holding you back from making more money holding you back from being healthier or holding you back from having the amount of money in your bank account that she would like right 30 days without weed will give you that perspective as to know what are the things that what other things are holding me back as opposed to me being the person that blames things on weed right I'm not saying it is bad I've never said this but bad I never say what is the issue but it can be one of the issues that you no longer need it in your life if you can't handle smoking it eating it responsibly no Sam wah-wah thanks feature will I be here to find some good lighting it is as you can see is evening dark wouldn't be able to see me in regular conditions um BIA so what I want to say was there is also important that you have consequences for when you when where if you do relapse what is the consequence a lot of us just human psychology we tend to avoid pain more than we seek pleasure if you compare two situations right someone says a meeting tomorrow and I'll give you a thousand dollars does that or if you don't mean it tomorrow I'll kill your mom I'm sure I thought it still sounds like a lot but the urgency to kill your mom or to have some type of pain is greater so for example I need time IV laps tell yourself I'm gonna get my friend $20 anytime I smoke weed I don't give him $30 whatever it is or anytime I smoke weed I will wash all the dishes in the house for that night so for that week I mean is when you alright thinking about your decision to smoke again you're weighing the pleasure of that high and the pain of doing a chore for a week or I don't know giving your friend $30 every time you smoke right so now you have a choice and a consequence as opposed to just a choice with no consequence and when you think about it for a lot of people even living life through your weed magnifying glass for a couple years now right every single day even smoking with the other day the smoking I have been able to really see life from from the perspective of an on/off a little bit so [Music] the opportunities that you missed out on the inability to stick to your commitments cuz we just like and you can get that high moment just like and like a mini organism this isn't one of the reasons why people get addicted to pornography right you get high you you are the pukes you think you are the person having sex with all of these this woman like one guy gangbang two girls on one guy one guy in two girls same thing or whatever it is right and you feel like you are that guy so you have no desire or need to go on approach girls in person or going to talk to cause a person and likewise marijuana when you do too much makes you feel like you've already reached a pinnacle of life you're really making amount of money that you want you already have a body that you want you're you have business that you want and like what is the point what is the use quote unquote right oh do anymore or putting down the blunt and Ashley isn't doing more work so nothing quick pro tip is to definitely try and push your first if you don't have a detox test or you don't not trying detox for a drug test my goal my op my recommendation is to actually push your first smoke session quote-unquote later once a day right if you are smoking multiple times a day try and reduce it to once or twice and then you gradually take it away right so be busy be as busy as you possibly can in the morning afternoon and then have a smoke session the evening this not only will help you save more money but it will gradually break that Noll Association that you create to marijuana nonsense so big ups all the mandem all the Gotham boys girls bro the trying to detox for a drug test either for government job military whatever it is big ugly is excess passing much love god bless peace enjoy almost number does it feed you don't water it and too much everything good thing it's good for nothing how are

today's video was submitted a video idea for reviewer like you so thank you so much to everybody and thank you you know who you are so it's gonna be all some tips and tricks on how to grow like a pro some things I do and some things I use if you're new to the channel this is what we do we grow we do rosin press reviews we do rather than squishing you can see all this on my page go check it out I have all these grows everything you see here go check it out give me a subscribe you know hit the little subscription button down below thank you so much if you want to support the channel watch the video all the way through give me a like and thumbs up I can't fit all the tips and tricks in the one video so that's how I'm gonna engage on whether or not I want to keep doing this one or not so if you really want to see some more of this give me some likes give me some comments down below thank you I'll get right into we're gonna go start out in veg and work our way through flour so a first tip I'm going to use is get some make host microbes definitely check them out I have a few videos highlighting them really really beneficial stuff for your root system and bigger roots bigger fruits right that's what I always like to say a lot of people you know so definitely do that badge and flour super crazy important have really good airflow and I mean just in general about temps you want to mimic outside like their plants that came from outside so mimic outside you want to have my go-to temps for my veg tank it is like 70 to 85 degrees 70 is my low 85 is my high you don't have to worry about it as much and badge because they like to be warm don't overwater how I gauge how I need the water is I'll pretty much like put my plants my soil water and I'll let him dry out to the point that they start to droop and that's when I start to get my idea of how light my buckets are and I hold my buckets up and if I remember that day you know and like oh my [ __ ] it's pretty light like that day then that's when I water so that's how I decide on how I'm gonna water training there's all sorts of different ways to do it low stress trainings my go-to method but you can do a bunch of different ways by five by five as you can see I don't need to know trellis Nets I still have a great canopy everything's pretty even everything's only been talked to one time and they're so uh just do training and I train my plants in a funny way I like had him every single day I go in there and I just pet him trying to be rough with them been immune to the ways that I want them direction I want them to start growing and it's really beneficial for a lot of reasons you can get more tops that way as you can see I have crazy tops all over my tent but I've only topped those plants one time and it's just because of training you can also decide how a higher canopy is with that and the reason I don't really use nets and stuff because I can get really nice canopy without it and I can still move my fence around when I go to defoliate and everything I don't have that big a problem so you know definitely important to train the plants the way you want them it helps you also see things that might be going on I started really small plant pots and I worked my way up and every time I change my pots like when I go to transplant I give a good flush every single time get all that old nutrients out start with a nice new base I run sixty forty sixty percent Coco forty percent like Fox Farm soil and that's just for you know my personal preference and then so every time you also transplant throw something that make us him they're super good stuff can't stress it enough do your research on it I keep my lights in bed anywhere between 12 and 14 inches away side run cobs and LEDs so if you're running HPS you know you want to be definitely a lot further away so that's my go-to for my light setup you want to see like what stuff I have in my real room go check out my channel and I highlight everything I'm running in my 5 by 5 on one of those videos so we'll go into flour times now super-important again good airflow definitely you need good airflow I can't stress it enough through your whole canopy top and bottom and then I also start dropping my temps back when I'm in flower I like to drop them back you know just like outside so like just not quite as cool as outside but I usually like to go back my preferred range is 65 to 75 that's another huge thing is a tip make sure that try as closer you as hard as you can to keep your temperature within 10 degrees like so you don't want your temperature to much more than 10 degrees off from your high and your low so I usually like to do 65 to 75 ID foliate week 1 week 3 so right when I throw them in there I'll give them week D fully at once and that's just take all your big families and all that stuff off it's good for different like reasons like light penetration and get more light down to those smaller bud sides it also helps with the air flow back again so I'll do that week 1 week 3 there pretty much most strains are done stretching by that time almost done stretching by the time so I'll go through and the more you do fully there's a big reason why you do it it's innocent instead of the plant using all the energy for that to keep those leaves alive and keep growing new leaves those ones it takes all that energy that you take all those leaves off and it just puts all of the butts all that extra energy that would have been used to grow those leaves is now all gonna go to blood production which is what we're all looking for anyways right so that's my tips on that I didn't defoliate this time as good as I really wanted to as you can see but it's still getting the job done my lights in this setup I like to you run 14 to 16 inches away from the top of my canopy in those terms nutrients you don't want to over water your or over water or over feed the plants either because if you're starting to get like you know follow your feed schedule if you want to know what I use go ahead and reach out let me know I will tell you everybody runs different stuff so so follow your feed schedule but if you're noticing when you burn tips and stuff late kind of take it back and not flush your plants like so that's a good tip there and you don't know everything is different so do that flush your plants lay back on your nutrients a little bit if you're noticing burn tips and stuff because you don't want to get it build up in there and stop production pretty much no go I don't like my relative humidity going and you we're past 55 when I'm in flower just you start buying more risks of bud rot and all that stuff so really nice another important thing is that is your air flow I run my fan at nighttime to a little heater and humidifier in my room so do that and then flushing super important at the end especially if you're in soil and another tip about like in terms of like seeing burn tips and stuff like that is when you're in the soil and stuff like that here's a really good pro tip that a lot of people don't know starting out is when you're in soil like what you're noticing now happened days ago like a week ago it's not like hydro where it's like super noticeable right away and you can fix it right away so it's also gonna take that week to fix it and see corrections so don't go crazy and cause another problem trying to fix one problem but that's a good tip there flushing I usually start like three weeks before I know I'm gonna take them down I'm checking my trichomes and it's gonna help you through flavors and everything like that and your spoke quality I wanted to get my video done to show my cure tips and stuff but that'll come next weekend so if you're looking for that that's when that's going to be coming out I had to do this whole video on my phone because my Wi-Fi is out at home right now so I can't upload that video so that's why I'm doing this one today instead but yeah I hope this really helps somebody and when I'm flushing you know I'm starting three weeks before I'm flushing down to like 200 ppm is 100 ppm is because also if you ever test or notice like after you flush you'll be getting that reading but if you wait a couple days and try test your run off again you'll notice that your ppm rose again because your soils coming coming back to life so I like take a real low three weeks before 100 ppm is as close as I possibly can to my tap water and then I just give nothing but water after that Mike and I went doing that flush I use pH water after that I don't use anything so I hope that really really helps everybody have a wonderful wonderful day any more questions you know go ahead and reach out to me if you knew please subscribe I hope you enjoyed the

advantage man take it down i'm in love she's my main place these [ __ ] what the [ __ ] what's good guys gee ct weed reviews medical marijuana purposes only have a license card or if you're not you're definitely missed out this time all right guys one wifey took my beanbag chair so i'm literally on my knees right now but it's all good it's all good i didn't give a [ __ ] class right now i got such an amazing strain right here to make you shake your pants all right so got another new strain not from ct pharma little cg farm include you like what the [ __ ] you talking about credit anyways we'll get to that so care leaf has been dropping off some strains as you can see a lot of the producers actually been dropping off some [ __ ] down the healing corner truly don bristol connecting with dispensary best dispensary the whole entire universe hands down i've been to a couple another planet they weren't that good um and boy are we going off to space today um very fitting so today we got a strength from cureleaf here leaf came out with strain they want a little two gram things which sounds good it's called the aquamarine let's see aquamarine and you'd be like what is the aquamarine well the aquamarine which is clocking at 26 thc well it was what get that again dr marine is the kiwi candy kiwi candy that's the main tie across the apple fritter my pad across the upper kiwi candy sounds awesome it's only 20 bucks for the two grams these shits these two grams cost me 100. i made some moon rocks and two grams of [ __ ] moon rocks from here that's right so we took the kiwi candy we [ __ ] coated that in some [ __ ] aj sour diesel [ __ ] oil soaked in the aj sour diesel and then we rolled that and the aj saudi easels from their plant so we're kind of cross screening a little three-way trifecta here we got the carolee flower the kiwi candy soaked in the aj sour diesel thera plant greniva oil coated in the ct pharma tetradine seattle sour cush keef these shits could be the bomb look what the [ __ ] you been hundred dollars or two can go no i made these i made these rocks so technically you can't really get these exact same ones but you can produce them just like i did if you want to kind of match me um and if you think about it moon racks are expensive but even if you go like if you were able to actually access these things from a dispenser you're going to spend about 50 bucks a gram anyway these ones are going to be good i know because i made them so that's why i'm excited about that all right so let's check this [ __ ] the [ __ ] out and uh blast off time all right so again i haven't tried these yet i made them i put them in the fridge that i'm soaking set and here we go oh my god all right so the smell is ridiculous you can smell a ton of that oil smell that aj saudis oh that's actually freaking out and then you get this it's just like just strong like it's it's not it's not fruity it's sourish smell and they smell a lot of that kush melt in the tetrahedron you honestly don't get much of that the kiwi candy smell because i think it's just covered up in all the stuff so i'm gonna check these [ __ ] out wow yeah yeah okay so yeah okay [ __ ] yeah all right did i really just touch that [ __ ] on my [ __ ] jacket actually then probably knocked the moon rock off and i don't even know about it one two three i honestly don't know who the [ __ ] knows they probably got a moon rack somewhere on the floor here right in my pocket in my pocket all right anyways look at these [ __ ] shine like yeah what okay yeah son all right so we got some moon rocks here we got some [ __ ] moon rocks these [ __ ] these [ __ ] are just shining like diamonds so again i i made move rocks like this look at the crew i made these extra oily get my straws i've made moon rocks a couple times look at the oils nice nice i've made moon rocks a couple times and uh look at that really [ __ ] wow look at that big clump oil right there it's probably anyway my occasion piece and obviously no that's going to happen so we got right here i'm going to do one little moon rock obviously but these shits like you said these shits right here i made these before i mean you crack these [ __ ] open they're stinky like like look at that like you're saying they're sticky they're oily they're super keefed up in like like you see all the black stuff that's all the oil the pumpkins are almost through the keef okay i even got a little bit of [ __ ] some butter spots mashed up in there look at that [ __ ] so these shits are guaranteed to medicate you out the [ __ ] ass um i mean they're expensive as [ __ ] i mean but they're just awesome i mean look at these things look at the whole perspective like those are if you got that for a hundred bucks at a dispensary you probably wouldn't actually be that upset about it realistically i wouldn't i'm like [ __ ] yeah let's just look at the bomb and they are the bomb um i mean so you should cut in half like figure one two three four five six seven so you take those three and those strings split that big boy in half for 50 bucks a piece would you buy that yes i would i mean i wouldn't second i'm gonna shoot [ __ ] fire all right so very excited about these [ __ ] very excited um like i said and they're nice i mean they're they're good they're solid they're chunky i soak them what i use what i do is i take my bud i squirt obviously comes in syringes i squirt the oils on through and through like a little bit here and here i mean i took what i took was the two grams it's technically like any i took two grams of like product to two grams i took a milliliter off the oil and then uh i took a gram and a keef so if you're two grams of flour gram to keep probably about a half gram equivalent of oil um and then like if they just sprinkle it on and then i put it into the heat container i just kind of press the buds and i roll it with my dabber press it but the trick is and then you got to take it out and then i take the extra oil having here because i don't use it all up once and i stick it on again and then i dip them again so you double dip the [ __ ] and that's where you really get the stickage i press hard with my fingers like pressing them into the key so it just kind of like flake off if you want to get that real moon rex texture that's basically what i do all right guys i'm going to grab this little guy right here this piece right here is going to be my med piece and break that up in two balls and uh i'm excited as [ __ ] moon rocks yeah care leaf airplane and ct farmer in a sense the one i really didn't get here was agm you know i was thinking actually about grabbing like a little bit of their shad or something sprinkling in the mix but like then you're going past the point of where it's actually you know costing more than you would if you had to get it commercially so i'm fine with matching the price point for scientific purposes i don't exactly want to go past point to make it just like over you don't want to overdo anything i guess is what i'm saying all right all right let's pack these [ __ ] up these shit's gonna be nice these shits are gonna be nice now some people handle their moon rocks with like gloves or chopsticks or tweezers all a good idea to be honest with you like it's not really because [ __ ] when you break it up it's gonna stick right to your fingers and you're kind of pissed like you like [ __ ] dance on my fingers like you know but just let me know so when you see people breaking them [ __ ] up like that like why did there's actually a good reason like i'm gonna do is shoot my fingers i'll probably lose a little bit of product on my fingers but it is what it is also with the moon rocks i don't completely break up the buds like into little pieces i kind of just break them into like sections if you will wow all right i should show you what the inside my god that shit's is all right so look hey hold on sorry guys all right so i broke this [ __ ] open look that's what the inside looks like as [ __ ] so you wonder what it looks like there you go nice right these are real deals no mess around here all right let me put this [ __ ] down because one shit's all stuck to my finger right now okay sitting there holding on to the thing sorry all guys all right so nice because that breaks in like sections if you will okay oh there's smaller bowls but crazy balls all right there's a little one here's bowl too a little air space in between the balls don't don't pack on tight because it's just going to get gooey you don't want to clag up your bowl definitely pissed if you [ __ ] up all that my word let's do this [ __ ] so word so wow now i taste that flour but a lot like kiwi candy is nice there's so many flavored spices going on my mouth right now i'm getting so edited good job greg well holy [ __ ] them shits are good all right so again i mean i'm not even sure how much of a medicinal product this is because it's really taken from zero to like not even a hundred from like zero to like a thousand it's like way off the scale so you can't even see any of the charts like that's how it hits you i'm [ __ ] wicked medicare most of this is like a sativa i just [ __ ] fantastic right now i want to laugh i want to giggle and it's still just creeping up and i can feel all this weed just building up my system i mean i can't even tell you what the stream would be good for unless you want to just get [ __ ] you know like listen i need to get medicated hard right i can feel it on my face right now like i'm looking at myself from the camera my face feels like it's going like this it's not really moving though but it feels like it's going again all right i'm gonna pop these little buds in here and i'm gonna do bowl number two all right bowl number two is much bigger than bowl number one nice wow holy [ __ ] i apologize she's making sweat [Music] [Music] i will make it so uh i can't [ __ ] breathe all right i don't even want people to smoke these things these are too strong if you don't smoke weed don't ever smoke moon rocks they'll kill you hey i'm out gee c2 reviews peace oh my god", "Wm7NGuSZnGI": "but what what dr. heart is talking about is in the first chapter of the book which I guess you haven't read and I really should have a copy for you it's stupid of me I got a copy of my bag but so this is fascinating to me the the British you know they colonized India and they set up what they called lunatic asylum was really psychiatric hospital sort of very primitive psychiatric hospitals and they were really initially for soldiers in the Indian Army and they were run by British doctors and what these doctors really as early as like the late 1850s 1860s noticed was that a lot of the people who showed up in these hospitals were showing up with canopy what they called ganja actually in Indians called ganja or bong which is a very weak preparation of basically or Indian hemp just sort of low-grade cannabis and so and so they started counting and they rose the twenty to thirty percent of the people who were coming to asylums or heavy cannabis users and that was way more than alcohol is more than opium and this really fascinating doctor named George Francis William EWTN's wrote a book in 1908 and he looked at the evidence and and it is amazing to hear how he describes schizophrenia how he describes cannabis how he describes the cases of violence around cannabis it's like it's like any psychiatrist today certainly any forensic psychiatrist like my wife would would like everything in the book would ring completely true and it was so fascinating to me to stumble on this and realize this is something people were talking about for more than a hundred years mmm so could we agree that there are some people where cannabis is not a good idea absolutely right we could agree that that's a all right would think we all great we're also agree that some people can't eat peanuts absolutely yeah yeah right yeah you know why peanuts kill you that's yeah it's more dangerous Oh so these second six hundred a year yeah people die from peanuts so yeah I think more people die from canvas as a result of homicide in the zoo okay well there's no correlation there's no study but I know somebody's got to do the work but why you saying that then because I've looked at enough data to tell me you think marijuana is causing homicides oh yeah this is what the book is about but anyhow so what does it causes paranoia and psychosis in people and paranoid psychosis are huge risk for homicide and schizophrenia studies that refute that it was notable there are no studies that refute that paranoid psychosis are huge risk for homicide schizophrenia is a 20x20 Times Joe well Jamie I sent you a document yesterday I mean there's there's multiple studies that they show that you know marijuana laws are not associated with a new drug yeah so the use of the drug which could possibly trigger psychosis psychosis and schizophrenia which are correlated with murders are we're not correlated they're triggers that's a grab salute fact yeah triggers because of the paranoia and delusions and you think that someone's out to get you and they're not absolutely I mean the the out of the numbers okay so the numbers are if you're if you have a diagnosis of schizophrenia you are 20 times as likely to commit homicide as somebody who's healthy now it's actually worse than that for cannabis okay and here's why what so the National Alliance for mental illness and the mental illness advocate advocacy groups hate talking about this why they hate talking about it obviously because it stigmatizes people with mental illness so what they say and this is true is if you have a diagnosis but you're taking your antipsychotics even though the side effects might be unpleasant you're in treatment you're you're you're not using recreational drugs your risk for violence isn't that high it's not that much higher than a healthy person okay and you know fortunately healthy people don't commit murder that often the problem is if you if you think about the math for half a second if there's this one group of people who don't have a very high risk for murder or serious violence who because they're not using because they're on antipsychotics it means that the excess risk in the people who are using and who's untrue whose psychosis is untreated it must be spectacularly high and the numbers bear that out so so there's a really good study from last year 2018 a small group of patients in in Switzerland Isis what's wrong Linda's a safe country is a low base crime rate but 50% of the people who are using cannabis and had psychosis over a three-year period committed violence in that group of people that's mostly 20-something man well you know there's a study here and I just sent it to you Jamie and it's it's titled risk factors for violence and psychosis a systemic review and meta-analysis of 110 studies so you know that's it's quite a few studies okay so you know let me just just read part of it out to you so violence was strongly associate with the history of polysubstance abuse strong associate with diagnostic oriented substance use disorder and recent substance misuse and moderately associate with a history of alcohol misuse a history of substance misuse recent alcohol misuse recent drug misuse and a history of drug misuse it was unclear if there was an association between violence and history of cannabis masseuse so again this is a hundred and ten studies they very carefully looked at all of the different risk factors as to what could trigger violence just let me finish Alex and what they said again it was unclear if there was an association between violence and a history of cannabis misuse alright so that's a hundred and ten studies so cannabis use in there is gonna get locked in with poly substance use like because a lot of people who use are gonna be using other drugs Holle substance means multiple sub zactly so odd everything else was found to have significantly sophistical announced and I have not not just mine a study that doctor heard a song that I'd like to look at it without looking at it I can't push back as hard as I would like what I can tell you is that I have many studies in the book that show that cannabis use is associated with violence in people with psychosis okay and more broadly it's associated with violence in the general population in large studies in studies of high-school students and bullying in studies of people who were vacationing in Ibiza in in in studies of young men in China and the UK there are big studies out there that show cannabis use is associated with violence Ibiza grilled over there for that they get manager just said it yes some dignitary or royal person how Lisp right isn't that how it all starts right yeah yeah I believe so noted yeah the way the people in Spain prints words was directly affected by this one person apparently but um so this these this correlation between people that have schizophrenia and using cannabis how do you is schizophrenia a diagnosis it's purely based on behavior basically yes yeah it's a clinic there's no blood tests do a brain scan it's basically how you behave and and what you tell the doctor about how you rise rise or it's very subjective because you're you're asking someone basically a series of questions I mean it's no different than you know depression really I mean you just just asking someone a series of questions and then you know based upon that which is very subjective then you're gonna make you know a clinical decision whereas when it's like a blood test like if someone you know passes a you know a certain amount of hemoglobin a1c and depending on which chart you're looking at then you're going to call that person pre-diabetic or diabetic but you know our fortune we just don't have those objective measurements and again that's why you know Alex was saying earlier that that you know the they couldn't really figure out you know how many people in the United States had had schizophrenia and I understand that but at the same time too I mean it's okay to to adjust you know the way that you diagnose someone over the course of the years and you learn things because you know you could easily say that almost everyone has some type of mental illness and I mean people should understand that you know there's seven different basic human emotions you know I've talked to sports there's the anger is contempt there's disgust there's fear sadness surprise and happiness that's seven so you know depending on which way surprise goes I mean six out of those seven are negative right because we're wired to basically detect threats so you know we're making you know the all these diagnosis I think we have to be careful because you know some people are calling themselves depressed and some people call themselves anxious when really you know they're just not dealing with basic human emotions that they need to understand and need to deal with like people are getting angry about being angry or like depressed about being depressed like if you feel one of these emotions just kind of sit with it and just kind of reflect on it and I think you know that's a much much better way to kind of kind of T to T's things out but you want to come back to to my original point I think that you know more people are understanding that you know we don't just need to give out a pill for everything and that you know everyone shouldn't just be labeled as having a mental health diagnosis because if things just keep you know going the way they are you know what it's by 2040 it's gonna be like 50% of people are gonna have like a mental health disorder so I people just need to understand that life is hard you got to deal with these emotions sometimes it's not that big of a deal and that's why and that's awesome for some folks and that's why I'm such a big fan of Jordan Peterson because you know he's he's kind of tough on people and he said but let me stop there because Jordan Peterson was on SSRIs for years yeah yeah for a long long time I mean it like for a long long time as was his family and that's what's crazy about him is what got him off as a carnivore diet is an elimination diet where he only eats meat with salt and drinks water and the healthier that he's ever been in his life and that is a another massively controversial subject yes let me push back a little bit because I think people you know as controversial as the book has been about about cannabis and psychosis this violence issue is even more controversial and obviously for a fair number of people it doesn't really doesn't sync with the stereotype doesn't say it doesn't say with how they've experienced cannabis use right so I think I think alcohols are really interesting [Music] comparison um I'm a Canadian from Newfoundland oh I'm sorry youthful age understand marijuana loose and land decisis a Newfoundland trade myself to say that way your tongue I'm wrong lane look what you just pulled up marijuana use increases violent behavior 50-year study finds casual link between cannabis and subsequent violent behavior new research published online in advance of print of the journals like psychological medicine concludes that continued use of cannabis causes violent behavior as a direct result of changes in brain function that are caused by smoking weed over many years researchers have long debated a possible link between the use of marijuana and violent crime in contrast to alcohol meth and many other illegal drugs the metal bang effects of cannabis seemed unsuited to promoting violent behavior however ample ample previous research has linked marijuana used to increased violent behavior the sticky problem in such studies are that many confounding factors co-founding factors involved in interpreting this correlation so okay it is very difficult to determine whether or not any statistical correlation between marijuana use and violent behavior are causally linked or instead the two associated or instead the two are associated through some other factors such as socioeconomic status personality traits or many other variables that are related to the propensity to use marijuana so I think that's a fairly good summary as well of the issues to add the study came from 411 boys who were born in 1953 in London 97% of which were Caucasian and all of them are raised in two-parent households so so you know so those people are relatively stable if they're to family to parents to have parents be tissue that's also know it's possible but so so so I think the alcohol comparison is again a good one because anybody who's ever been in a at 9:00 p.m. and gone back at 2:00 a.m. knows that alcohol dis inhibits people right it causes fights right it it makes people loud it makes a lot of [ __ ] it does alcohol and sex you're a terrible idea right it certainly causes some sexual violence okay but at the same time everybody knows that you can have a drink you know you can have a beer at that backyard barbecue you can classify that's right it doesn't mean that you're gonna get in a fight and it actually might enhance your conversation social lubricant all that good stuff all that good stuff and you might even know people I mean I do know people who I would say have a problem with drinking okay but it's mostly they're sitting at home drinking scotch watching baseball until they fall asleep that night now that's obviously not a healthy way to use alcohol but it doesn't make them violent but we know on a population basis that alcohol causes violence it causes drunk driving it causes problems and it's said that in the study that that I quoted earlier but it's it's said that alcohol again they they didn't or sorry cannabis they weren't sure right so okay so this is again I would like to read the paper that you're quoting from because I have so much other research but here's here's what I'm saying about cannabis okay cannabis for a lot of people yeah they can just smoke it and as people you know many people have tweeted at me the only thing I attacked was a bowl of nachos hmm like and so and so that's true for some people but that could be eaten with the alcohol as well that's exactly logical variable and there's so many studies that say that that the cannabis laws have actually decreased crime so so even though for many people cannabis isn't gonna cause violence that doesn't mean it can't cause violence in some people especially or at least could be affair or at least could be a factor especially with the kind of violence that I am talking about and then I write about in the book which is again so alcohol it maybe makes a argument into a brawl it makes a brawl into something where somebody picks up a stick it makes that into something where somebody pulls out a knife it escalates right cannabis is different cannabis causes paranoia and psychosis and it certainly causes those things temporarily even if it doesn't cause them permanently so a distortion in reality that could lead to you doing some things terrible and it's usually to somebody you're not actually fighting with it's a family member that the worst cases that I've and I've really seen a lot of these cases are basically innocent family members who are just in the way when somebody loses touch with a reality and literally thinks like this my 85 year old grandmother is going to kill me so I better stab her to death first that happens it happens a lot and if you look at the amount of violence that people with psychosis commit on a population level basis it looks like people with schizophrenia commit about six to ten percent of all the murders in this country and it looks like people is sort of broader to more broadly defined psychosis again bipolar with psychosis other psychotic conditions temporary psychosis they might be responsible for as much as twenty percent of the violent crime in the United States that's a lot of violent crime and what I'm saying is that it is quite clear that drug use mediates that violent crime in other words if you're not using you can keep your impulses in check but when you do use you become dangerous so when we're talking about biological variability if we factor in schizophrenia you know essentially what you're saying is that there are people that have schizophrenia that don't commit violence but that they're much more likely to commit violence if you add some sort of psych medication whether it's marijuana whether it's something else that perturbs reality for them and particularly psychotics bring down these yes so recreational drugs the worst the worst cases of all are cannabis and a stimulant because to these they both like cocaine or meth exactly yeah so when you get that you get paranoia from two sources mm-hmm and you get the only good thing about cannabis from this point of view is that kind of knocks people down a little bit but meth brings them right back so is it fair to say that what we don't know is that we don't know whether or not these people like this young man with this terrible story from Connecticut yes we don't know whether or not he would have become a schizophrenic and and exhibited those symptoms without the marijuana we really don't know we do know he did with it that's that's correct and and what I would also say is that for somebody like that and this is quite clear on a population level basis with people with schizophrenia is you've got to discourage them from using we really have to be described because it brings out the worst Brian and and you know somebody said this a friend of mine of old friend mine from the New York Times said so every time there's a hurricane people some people on the right say well you can't prove that global warming caused that one hurricane that would have happened anyway and he and they're right you can't prove it and you can't prove that any one case of psychosis was caused by marijuana but when you look at the big studies at the population level data the association is really clear and everything points the same way and the synthetic cannabinoids k2 and spice those can clearly produce psychosis in people and people with psychosis tend to slip back into it if they use at some point you got to start to say to yourself why does everything go the same way yeah I also have a personal friend and I'd really didn't think about this guy but there's another personal friend that I know that is a martial arts instructor that had a psychotic break he became schizophrenic and he's a regular marijuana user and the people around him associated that with that and in fact people that are regular cannabis users were trying to get him to stop using marijuana if you're close to being on the edge and you use a little bit of cannabis for sure let me tell you something this guy was not on the edge when I knew him yeah when I knew him he was very rational very rational but something happened somewhere along the line was he would did he become a pretty heavy smoker over time I do not know because we don't live in the same area anymore but he got really heavily really heavily medicated and did some really crazy [ __ ] and wanted being hospitalized and this was not the case before I mean whatever it was that triggered him I mean it when I was around him when he was younger I would have said he's a total normal guy and I would have never saw that coming he was a heavy marijuana user heavy heavy but I don't know how he's doing now I hope he's okay but we're you know we have mutual friends yeah and he became a schizophrenic and and you know you will see you know cases like that but you know when you do a lot of the larger data on cannabis and violence I mean it's just it's just not there like there's lots of data that suggests that you know medical marijuana laws for example can actually have a decrease in overall they could I mean I think that's a study that says there's no comfort to the people who lose their children because of these psychotic breaks that's right and those studies are really bad so the place that you can criticize is bad though because they're because state-level data is not great the place the book has been criticized or andr there was a rand review though in 2013 and I mean that that's again that stays by statement that marijuana use does not induce violent crime and the links between marijuana use and property crime are Thayne right there I think we all agree that marijuana use by itself with people that aren't schizophrenic probably doesn't induce violent crime but with people that are schizophrenic or people where it triggers schizophrenia it could potentially induce violent crime my friend did not get violent although he did do a violent thing it wasn't to a person yeah I think I think we have to be really careful because there's no just like with diet just like with the food and you know like allergies all these different variabilities when it comes to human beings I think we have to be really really careful about lumping all people together when it comes to how they get affected by various compounds yeah so so the state levels thing if you want help so the place the book has been criticized in my mind sort of the most fairly is it points out that in the four states that legalized first which is Alaska Washington Oregon Colorado if you look at 2013 and then you compare that to 2017 mmm-hmm murders and AGG assaults violent crime are up substantially in those states and substantially more than in the u.s. can I stop you there but is there a possibility there's a correlation between organized crime because one of the things about selling marijuana is the people that have always been selling marijuana have been criminals when you make things legal in a state the people that were selling an illegal flock to that state and that's true so that there's there's a direct correlation between people being robbed that there was also a significant problem with credit cards and banks where everyone was having to do all the transactions with cash there was a lot of violence as was associated with marijuana in regards to that and also massive increase in population so so and that's the reason why Trump is actually not really against cannabis in some ways is because he feels that if we have medical marijuana laws that especially the states that are that the better border states that the crimes going to drop drops a lot tremendously and it has dropped they they did a study last year and it dropped over successes all around drop seven percent in Arizona and then again you know Benjamin Hansen who's who's in the wrong data silver so he said that the murder rate did not demonstrate that marijuana legalization increases fonts and then it may have actually demonstrated that legalization slightly decrease fonts and he thinks that the reason that there was an increase in the murder rate particularly in Washington is because there was a large income gap they say that Washington has the tenth largest income gap in the United States but that's how did that change the ex-cons to the murderer good question Durham I'm so I haven't you know I didn't get to speak with Benjamin about this it sounds like confirmation box well he I mean if that that is one thing that has been shown to you know increase mental illness like we talked about and can definitely increase violence is when you have an income gap right that happens but how's the income gap shifted that directly correlates to the legalization of marijuana because during the scene because during the same period the income gap particularly in Washington and increased okay so he feels that you know the corresponding number right so he feels that that it's it's likely more to that and I mean he'd I mean I understand but I mean you have to respect this guy I mean I don't I respect them because I know what he did with this data and and so Joe this this is maddening to me okay okay okay violent crime in those four states increased more rapidly than in the u.s. period between 2013 and 2017 Jamie just conjecture Assad no credible data exists it supports a significant association between the increased violent crime and legalization furthermore studies suggest that so far violent crime decreases in states with legalized medical marijuana until new research credibly suggests otherwise the claim that a demonstratable link between the two exists will remain classified as false okay so that's just not true okay I know it's knope's okay and I know we trust Snopes how do we trust them that okay I was gonna say that too but they're they give all of their their source okay so again these do you are you on of those where are these sources and what's wrong with it here let me just go back to okay what I'm saying yeah please do 2013 Oregon Washington Colorado Alaska mm-hmm there are 450 murders in those four states there are 30,000 AGG assaults period okay 2017 Oregon Washington Colorado Alaska there are 620 murders in those four states that's an almost 40% increase there are 38,000 AGG assaults that's a 25% increase if you adjust for population you still get big increases in Denver 2018 almost 70 murders there were about 35 in 2013 Seattle 27 2018 there were 34 35 murders there were I think 19 in 2013 these increases are real okay they now know now okay can we say that marijuana legalization caused those increases we cannot yet there are other possibilities and your what are those well one positive all population did increase it's also possible that these states quote-unquote imported violent crime in other words that you've got a population of transients coming in in part because marijuana was legal and those people are likely to commit violent crime and on top of that organized crime people that are selling absolutely there may have been some people who are exporting to Nebraska to Minnesota to other states there's crime associated with that but what I am saying is that unequivocally unequivocally the people who said legalization is going to decrease violent crime and people did say that and Cory Booker in 2017 said it he said that it actually had decreased violent crime in states that legalized and he didn't say it randomly he said it when he was injured using legislation to legalize marijuana on the federal level those people are wrong and they need to stop saying it I know and by the way that Oregon economist used he used the wrong data set for his charts okay he used I used the real numbers okay the FBI homicide numbers he used numbers that include justifiable homicide no police that's not right because the FBI reported that the murder rate went up 1% from 2015 to 2016 as compared the nationwide which went up 7.9% and then it dropped by 11.6 percent between 2016 and 22nd do not know what you're talking about okay those are FBI numbers I'm reading not know what you're talking about the numbers are clear okay I use I'm reading them right now 2016 release of FBI uniform crime reports from Oregon okay yes Oregon you're not reading the reports from the United States you're picking one state for Jamie sure the entire country from that time period too so yes I picked those four states where marijuana was legalized as a sort of cherry-picking you know it's not it's picking every state where they're illegal country arrays no that's what I'm trying to show yes something wrong we'll pull back so we can see the holster so first of all that's a that's violent crime for murders and a crime great be in there Oh violent crime and that assaults aren't they no so so the four categories of violent crime are murder AGG assault robbery and rape rape is sort of gone sideways the last few years robberies actually have gone down it's murders and AGG assaults that our interpersonal violent crime okay just to go back to this Oregon economist because this Madden's me he used a dataset that is not the standard data set to report murder what is the difference he used the data set that includes justifiable homicides meaning I'm in my house you come in I shoot you and kill you the police don't charge me with anything right and police homicide because let's not let an interrupt let me finish the those two categories of crime are not likely to be impacted by cannabis use cops aren't smoking when they're on Patrol is hope and if you are using you're very unlikely to have your murder viewed as justifiable homicide the fair comparison is the base murder rate in the US and that's the number that I used and I am Telling You I mean I know these numbers I sleep you know I wake up with these numbers cannabis the for cannabis legal states on a per capita basis crime murders rose 31 percent on a per capita basis in those four states over the 2013 2017 period maybe I'm sorry I said 31 maybe it's 29% so maybe I say I woke up with anyway the for the u.s. its 18% 29% versus 18% that's the gap and I am NOT saying that I know that cannabis legalization caused that gap what I am saying is people need to stop claiming that cannabis legalization reduces violent crime it in it has increased in those two I asked you in those states was it Universal the increase was it almost identical yes Alaska was the most then I think merged why not more in Colerain Washington and and what's also interesting Joe if you're if you really want to go into the numbers is the gap actually widened year by year so that's sort of what you would expect if this is the result of a psychomimetic effect in other words a psychosis causing effect because cannabis doesn't cause psychosis right away people break down but if it's causing heavy use and some of those people are sliding into you know paranoia and psychosis you'd sort of expect the gap to increase over time and that's what's happened okay so you know I'm gonna go back again to the Netherlands okay because they've had you know cannabis legalized forever and they have one fifth of the homicide rate that the United States does right but they also have a lower cannabis use that's true but still you know one one line cake box result one one fifth I mean it's still it's pretty drastic overall and and again you know Alex you know you know I appreciate some we're talking about the correlation between cannabis use one of the things that we have to accept in America is when you're in a place like the Netherlands it has a long and accepted history of use people are accustomed to it so I think things kind of even out I think one of the things that we're dealing with with the United States is people that have just they don't they don't have a long history of experience and it becomes legal and then they use it and maybe some of them like we're talking about don't have a tolerance for it have too much and like I was talking about with my friend who's like this really continent the the one who had an edible and became suicidal and this [ __ ] up for weeks that is very confident very articulate very intelligent he's not a not a weirdo not a not transient extremely extremely successful you know I think there are there are variables that we need to take into consideration there's certain human beings that exhibit a pattern of behavior that's directly correlated to cannabis use that I don't experience so if I could say from my own personal biases that that's [ __ ] that's nothing it doesn't do anything I've been smoking for years doesn't do [ __ ] well you probably don't have one of those three genes that we were talking about and you probably also too you know don't overuse or you have some type of you know legitimacy as to why you are you are using it and you know one III want to keep going with this but you know at the end of the show I think that we should make some type of like recommendations for people just because I hate when you know you have this big you know three-hour podcast and then at the end of it it's just like hey guys just be safe you know some type of like recommendations like I love the podcast with with with with crecer and Joel Wright but at the at the end of it was just sort of like hey guys the American diet I think most people realize that one person was going on data and the other person was you know yeah yeah I mean I'm sure I find it so fascinating that now when you think back through your you know through your life you've thought of somebody who was affected that I have several people I'll bet Oh if you think about it you'll think of more people maybe but those are the big ones and like I said my friend who is a martial arts instructor it was a pretty significant issue with a lot of our friends we were trying to figure out what was wrong with him beforehand he was sending me these videos that didn't make any sense and I was like what in the [ __ ] is this like I'll explain to you more off air because so I don't have to out this guy but a lot of people that were close to him were really seriously concerned now it is it something that would have happened anyway I don't know how is he since 20s late 20s 20 you know that's right around the age a little a little bit late ish like because like I said a lot of the studies even when you look at the ones on adolescents like for sure it's it's below like they have done studies like below 18 is worse yes and say below 25 below 15 is worse than 18 like the younger you go the worse and he seems to be fine now that's good that's good it's using that I don't know after I know and it's you know I'm not an expert on this subject but it's because of this of something called pruning that we go through so everyone goes through this and basically if your adolescence you're gonna drop off some some weak neural connections to kind of pick up some stronger ones you know it's the best way to kind of explain it I'm gonna use cannabis you can potentially accelerate that process and then because you accelerate that process you don't get those good neural connections and then you know people unfortunately you know develop things like like psychosis and and schizophrenia so you know that's kind of where they were the issue lies so you know one thing that I am you know very happy that we're talking about and I know Alex will be too is that you know we want to discuss the benefits in this podcast make sure that people understand that you know I believe that marijuana is medicine it's an excellent medicine but the other thing though too is we do want to mitigate the risks because there are real risks out there so you know I do appreciate you know us talking about adolescents and making sure that they do stay away from cannabis yeah and I mean especially that's like I've read these you know these cases files sometimes you know the kids started using when he was 11 and you know it's like that kid never had a chance right and obviously oftentimes these are kids coming from disadvantaged backgrounds anyway but you know they were using by 11 and it's 16 they put a you know put a gun to somebody's head and pull the trigger I mean the pre-adolescent and early teen use we got to do everything we can to stop the problem is yeah like if you if you smoke pot in junior high like say 7 8 9 like you're probably gonna smoke pot and highs yeah like that's the I mean that's what I saw we went out when I was growing up and you know even when I was home for Christmas for a few days like yeah a couple of my friends even talked about you know some people that we knew you know smoked ton of pot in high school and like now like they're they're they're crazier they're not really doing too too much you know so but there's you do have to be careful with that I think we've learned a lot of ignorance we're dealing with a lot of ignorance in a current when it comes to biological variability right we we don't really understand how a lot of these different things affect people including like just diet and what what what causes depression like how much how much of what we constitute or what we just decide is depression is inflammation poor gut health there's a lot of variables a lot of them marijuana is absolutely one of those variables and again I don't have an issue with it I liked it I loved the stuff but it does it doesn't [ __ ] with me right but I'm also honest and so I see these people were it's pretty obvious to me that something's going on and that marijuana is not a good idea for them and I just think you know like I said in the past I might put myself have been guilty of using this this sort of blanket description of it as being a positive influence and then it's a good thing for people I don't think it's a good thing for everybody no it's definitely not a good thing for everybody and it's definitely not a good thing for the people who have that those genetics that I discussed earlier and you know also to like you know if you you need to have some type of like self awareness like the people who you know don't do well with cannabis you know you you shouldn't have to you to have your friends tell you that you came in like you're not going to work you shoulda got yourself like but that's hard for people yeah it's one of the most difficult things for people to do is itself of self-assess yeah you know to be objective you know and and it's a I've obviously I've heard from a lot of people who used heavily and seen other people who've used heavily in last month and I think it's very interesting why people continue to use when they're getting paranoid and and you know the the most cogent argument and again I'm I'm not it you know you've smoked a handful of times in college and Afrikaans I usually don't think I'd be comfortable using high THC cannabis now knowing what I know but anyway so the people the most got some right I'm gonna get hot-boxed I'll give you the shitty law on the ban the most cogent argument I thought was so interesting this guy's well you know my friends I talk to them they say I'm I'm paranoid now but I'm gonna smoke through it I'm gonna smoke so much that I'm almost comfortable being paranoid and I think that's a dangerous thing to do to your mind because you're you're sort of counting on being able to step back from that and stop using yeah that's a that's a silly way of looking at", "JPpbvDZzE_8": "[Music] my true buds I was about to shoot this video up in my apartment but there was tons of people yelling screaming I'm like [ __ ] it I'm gonna get outside get some of that summer weather that's still here in November that's the beauty of California and we're reviewing the breeze here a CBD THC spray five milligrams of THC CBD per spray you know my limits about my limit but my go to specific great place is about twenty to thirty someone go ahead and do about five sprays I live six I'm actually swauk in my car got to take care of putting my registration on you know how that goes once a year you get taxed we're having a car even more but I'm gonna go ahead let this sit here it says the full effects are one in two hours I felt it a little quicker being a spray but I'll come back to you let you know my final thoughts is the spray it's convenient it tastes good just bear with me because I'm kind of let it sit in my mouth I want it to fully absorb if you know what I'm saying so let's keep strolling keep walking I'm gonna go put these tags on and we're gonna get some sunshine get some palm trees let's go yeah this is supposed a mary-jane now we ain't do this for my stoners and from my cannabis enthusiasts bring it comedy my friends this [ __ ] got me pretty lit I was weird I never seen my back reflection when I'm shooting a

guys later peace you", "NTLw6EgR6ck": "bye is hong kong is actually one of asia's most progressive cannabidoid markets unlike other parts of the region australia new zealand singapore it's actually quite a progressive cannabinoid law in hong kong so we can sell most cannabinoids in hong kong as foods as long as we don't have any thc in the products additionally hong kong is a great mix of the international and chinese parts of culture and we felt like it was a great place to introduce cbd to china for the first time recreational use of cannabis is very different to the therapeutic or lifestyle use of cbd so everything we do as a business is to make it a separate conversation including from how we talk about the products to the imagery we use and the branding we pursue we like to have conversations about cbd rather than cannabis and we like to distance cbd from canada's cannabis and recreational use of drugs um so i think that craft beer and cbd are both kind of lifestyle products you know it and when you drink a beer you want to hair you want to chill with your friends you want to enjoy it same as taking cbd you kind of want that kind of de-stress calm and and and very relaxed moment yeah well first of all the coffee is delicious um and i like the you know the effect that cbd the cbd has on me i think it's like a subtle uh i guess a subtle kind of feeling i get throughout the day afterwards um quite relaxed and i think kind of cognitively and physically it kind of helps me get through the aches and pains of a normal day when i do have it it's generally a relaxing component to my day if i'm really stressed out or a lot of times if i'm stressed with work because i do have long hours i do really like to add it within my day just before bedtime", "3lnX_oYFDjc": "every day a to development every hour a huge story every minute history in the making news interviews education we are TNM news hey guys I'm Christine school Ivana your culture host 40nm news so the topic came up the other day about mixing alcohol with antibiotics and it made me think should we be smoking marijuana while taking antibiotics well that's a question that has been asked for several years now and there really is a direct answer certain things just do not mix and it's important to understand what medications don't go well with other substances usually if you're sick with a bacterial infection doctors will prescribe some form of antibiotic with strict instructions on what you can and cannot consume while taking them according to the UK's National Health Service it's smart to stay away from drinking alcohol one taking antibiotics although only two medications call for completely avoiding alcohol altogether and that's metro night is all and tanida's all even something as harmless as a grapefruit can cause issues when taking antibiotics did you know that it's super interesting how something like grapefruit can interfere metabolism in fact when trying to understand how cannabis and antibiotics mix in the body doctors first examined the grapefruit the reality of the situation is that there hasn't been enough testing done to determine if cannabis and antibiotics mix safely together well this of course is due to cannabis being illegal for so long which has limited the amount of research and testing that was allowed with marijuana but now the cannabis is legal in one way or another in 38 states and more available doctors are beginning to test to see if marijuana and antibiotics can work together to help people heal them faster one of the ways that doctors are beginning to study cannabis and antibiotics together is by reducing a patient's antibiotic dose and adding cannabis to see if the same benefits occur as if the cannabis was never added and then testing to see if the body has any negative or positive reactions to the combination now there still isn't enough evidence to show if mixing cannabis with antibiotics is good for you or bad for you only time will tell as more and more doctors are experimenting with cannabis as the legal market continues to grow but then that brought me to my next question what about CBD CBD acts as a super vitamin for many people and is able to help with several different ailments in fact some studies even suggest that CBD has an antibiotic property and Newsweek reports that Australian scientists have discovered that cannabinoid numerous strains of bacteria including some that have been notoriously resistant to traditional antibiotics with that being said they will most likely be a very long time until you need work to replace antibiotics and some warm so shouldn't we consume we with antibiotics well according to some doctors it shouldn't cause any issues when mixing your marijuana with an advice you may however feel an increase in side-effects of the antibiotics you are taking most doctors will say that if a creep fruit can cause an issue with antibiotics then cannabis may not be the smartest decision however there is no direct proof that indicates that marijuana causes issues with antibiotics if you are suffering from a lung or respiratory infection then putting smoke into your body is probably not the smartest idea so be your own judge and put your pipe down and go grab some edibles as a different option you can even get a free pipe right now if you click on one of the links on our website at TM news.com just pay for shipping the pipe is yours for free you're welcome so in conclusion when you have been prescribed antibiotics you are most likely suffering from some form of illness so taking it easy should be part of the healing process if you still choose to consume marijuana take it easy and if you have some kind of respiratory issue make sure you switch to edibles please for more cannabis news go over to TM news.com also give us a follow on Facebook Instagram and Twitter at national m.d. news and don't forget to subscribe to our

you do well what they do they put you in a mask and a costume so that no one knows who you are and you come out and you sing a song and people try to guess who's the star or who the singer is and because I'd been on dance with the Stars I had a nice little little TV following and so they got me the I was in the first mass singer show and did they correctly get you thank God yeah they did why thank God because then I didn't have to live in that costume oh yeah cuz when you're in there no one can know who you are and so they put you in isolation I felt like Hannibal Lecter you know they

hit the gold mine we found like I remember years ago reading about Charlie Chaplin and the way Charlie made it good because Charlie was like Cheech and Chong in a way where Charlie had a lot of different characters right but he figured out that the the that he played now appealed to everybody because everybody could look down on him and so when Cheech and I started thinking Cheech and Chong I mean the ones we play in the the characters in the movie they were just a couple of characters that we did on our record albums but when we'd shut the movies I realized these are the guys that everybody can look down on and so we used those characters and true enough everybody can look down on us but enjoy us what's change do one teach is healing teaches he had a knee operation so he's healing he's also one of the world famous art Chicano art collectors really yeah he's got a huge Chicano art collection in fact he's getting his own Museum out in Riverside are you old friends yo yeah ya know when you're in California you need your Mexican you say that you're known for Mon foremost is Cheech and Chong obviously right yeah pretty the most part yeah what made is so special teaching show what made what set them apart we told the truth about marijuana that's really what it was you know up until then marijuana was like an evil drug that was that if you smoked it all bad things were gonna happen or you hunger with bad people well what we did we showed the world that marijuana was not only a fun thing to do but it was healthy it was a healthy alternative to you know to alcohol for sure and and then we made light of real simple things you know we were just ending up and smoking were just a couple of musicians looking for it to get high that's all were you ahead of your time you obviously war with cannabis yeah I went to jail for bongs I was a little bit you went to jail yeah yeah I was put in jail by the Bush administration for you know three they had an operation pipe dreams right around the same time they invaded Iraq and I made a joke on on TV one time I think that set it off and said I said that the only weapons of mass destruction they found were my bongs so they they literally charged me was sending paraphernalia through the mail and even though I was innocent I had to take the rap because they threatened to go after my family my wife and my son you know she grew up where in Canada I grew up in Calgary Alberta oh that's the West that's West Canada yep what was that like that's rough boys yeah cowboys and especially now when when I was a kid we used to play cowboys and Indians and my brother and I we were always the Indians and then we did a DNA test recently I made percent native really yeah my brother and I are both percent how did you start in the business ah well like growing up in the country I learned to play a guitar when I was 8 years old and so I used to play with the fiddle player across the field and we used to play parties and so you know when you play a part you know when you play an instrument and you play for parties you don't just play a couple of songs you play all night right and so I played all night a few times growing up and who discovered you how did you get your break actually I ended up in an army van rhythm and blues band and Bobby Taylor and the Vancouver arbiter in the Vancouver's and it was Diana Ross and The Supremes they came to our club one time one night saw us and she phoned Berry Gordy and he could he flew in size of each each Cheech was up dodging the draft and he was selling he was delivering carpets for living really and and a mutual friend said that he was really funny so I invited down to a club that I had was the topless improvisational nightclub and it's actually the first pot club to because we that's all we smoked came up put Cheech and Chong together I did yeah in fact I came up with the name too really yeah because we were trying to figure out we did what we did we formed a band we were going to play music because I'd played was Bobby and I you know that was back in my past and so when we went to play our first gig Cheech and I started doing comedy first and we never got around to playing one note of music we just played that we just did the comedy was your first record a hit yeah big big big hit right out of the park and you made a few films with him right we made five five major motion pictures yeah do you like directing love it but I love directing Cheech and Chong movies I'm not good at anything else cannabis has we've completely legalized now in 11 states you've advocated for total legalization you think it's coming oh yeah absolutely to the on a federal basis it'll be in every state you know what they need to do more than anything is to make it so we can bank our money use the banks see right now everything is cash and the biggest seller in the marijuana industry are big Sates walk-in safes that you can put in your establishment because they don't allow banking yet in any of the legal states what's the difference between cannabis and hemp well hemp is the hemp plant it's a male it's a male plant it doesn't have the THC you don't get high you don't get high but you get CBD or a lot of bit out of the hemp plant you get a lot of good things out of the hemp plant it's a female plant like in real life is that's worth anything and that's the that's where the teach because you have your own brand called Chong's choice well it's Tommy Chong's no it's not just choice choices but it's mostly Tommy Chong and what do you sell we sell chocolate we sell breath mints we sell flour we sell individually wrapped Chalmers their joint big human's own had all the med men all the dispensaries you what you have prostate cancer and you said that cannabis helped you it did it really halfway well I believe that cannabis what it does it comes to mind and when the mind is calm then the you mune system kicks in and see you can't that's why stress is a bad for a lot of things and stress what it does stress it makes the body think of fear you know gives it fear and puts a body on alert whereas cannabis takes away the fear and puts a body on on like into neutral and so the everything that works in the body works really well like you that's why you get hungry and that's why you get sleepy everything that the buddy does it helps cannabis helps it more because it relaxes the brain how are you doing now oh I'm well I went from prostate cancer to rectal cancer and so then I had a tumor removed and now I got a colostomy bag but I'm cancer-free as far as the rest of the rest of the body goes so I'm doing good you learn to live with that oh yeah you got no choice no choice you got no choice how's life like for you are you yes children yes what's happening I've got I'm married to one of the most beautiful women on the planet in fact about ten years ago and see what Noah's o3 was when I was going to jail she my wife shall be sent a

also known as Jolly Ranchers this episode is sponsored by fat bull and the new ill-mannered film series custom agents check it out on our channel in our playlist section the following are the ingredients you'll need to make the candies okay today's ingredients are sugar light corn syrup flavored oil food coloring water vegetable oil Keith and confectioner sugar for this recipe will be using Keith if you'd like to learn how to deke are pure Keith you can go ahead and watch episode 3 this Keith is from this tangerine dream are you high for today's recipe what you'll need is a candy thermometer a pastry brush and several spatulas I prefer silicon some candy mullets metal measuring spoons and a large saucepan start with your large saucepan our first ingredient is 2 cups of sugar and I like to sift the sugar in case there are any large lumps that's annoying next we'll add 3/4 cups of water which I've already pre-measured here for this next part I recommend you pre grease your container with a little bit of vegetable oil spray that way the corn syrup won't stick to it and you'll get the correct measurement oh yeah got any grease yes I also recommend you do this with your spatula as well and your measuring tool I'm just gonna use this to make sure it's all coated okie dokie for this we're using a 1/3 measuring cup all of the tools have been sprayed with vegetable oil now we're going to measure out the light corn syrup we need 2/3 of a cup so we'll measure 1/3 of a cup twice you can see that the syrup is not sticking normally you have to fight for it to come out we're gonna do this again now that we've measured out our corn syrup we'll just add it to the rest of the ingredients and you can see how easily it comes out of the bowl now we're going to take this over to the stove this next part of the recipe is going to take some time so you want to make sure that you can really pay attention to the saucepan on the stove you want to watch what you're doing make sure you're not on the phone or distracted you don't necessarily have to attend to it in terms of storing or mixing it but you were going to be watching the temperature because we want to make sure that we get the right consistency for our Jolly wrenches it can go from soft candy to hard candy to burn candy the mixture can easily burn and then the taste is going to be really off you'll still be able to eat it but probably will not be enjoyable so make sure you have time to pay attention that way you won't have to start over from scratch and waste your batch you want to turn the stove on to a medium heat you're gonna stir your mixture until the sugar dissolves you can see that it's sticking a little bit so just put some elbow grease in it oh that's greasy that's really [ __ ] I said yeah it's greasy get in the corners because sometimes the sugar tends to clump up together on the bottom and then once you see the sugars pretty much dissolve you can just leave that alone we're gonna use our candy thermometer and you want to make sure that you don't put the bottom of the thermometer to the bottom of the saucepan because then they'll give you an inaccurate reading I put a little bit of water in here what you're gonna do is you're going to take your pastry brush and just dip it a little bit in the water and then I'm gonna wash down the stuck sugar crystals onto the mixture you don't want that to interfere with how the candy comes together you can see that the mixture is coming to a boil and that's perfectly fine we're waiting for it to reach 260 degrees so once the temperature of the candy reaches 260 degrees you're going to add your food coloring okay you can get this at any grocery store and we're actually gonna do the mint green color for the green apple flavor that we're doing today and that's just following the instructions on the box start with nine green drops and 3 yellow drops and then we'll see what that looks like and then adjust the color accordingly if we need you we just need about one or two more degrees some more and then we can add the food coloring one two three nine well once you've added the food coloring you're not going to mix it at all you're going to just let the boiling action mix it itself it looks like it's a nice bright green I added a little bit more yellow because it was just a little bit too much of a grass green than a green apple green I passed on grass all the time the minty green gives more of a green apple tone to it we've pulled the pan off the stove at 300 degrees we're gonna add green apple flavoring to this I'm adding a full tablespoon you want to keep all of the essential oil with in the saucepan and now we're gonna add our Keef as well now remember this has already been decart so we don't have to worry about that and we just need to get it off the paper there we go star very quickly you don't want the essential oils to evaporate completely this may smoke so I have my lid ready and because we're using Keith versus BHO you may not have the same uniformity but this came out really really good all right we're gonna lift the lid on and now you're gonna take your candy moles and spray them with vegetable so the color looks really good I try not to over pour it if you have someone that can help you they can kind of shimmy the candy tray so that all of the portions are pretty equal I've done this several times so I have a pretty good grasp on it the colors of these Jolly Ranchers look really really good they're really bright and green they have a uniform texture to it you can't see the keep at all I can't even see it in these when you pour these you want to have a very steady stream and a steady hand the higher you go the smaller the stream will be but just remember that the candy cools very quickly you just want to make sure that each one has about two-thirds full these green Apple Jolly Ranchers are for Bernadette price we'll be seeing her later in New York what would be filming a video for the new Sean price out and they have compressed show senator so they don't we'll put a link to it in the description I hope you like them you want a lot of these two completely cool for this recipe we made 200 pieces using five grams key so I use all silicone tools because as you can see the candy is all on it all up on it so I usually just run it under hot water along with the saucepan and any other tools and I find that it cleans very easily some of the mixture fell onto this silicone pad that I have here and that's actually completely cooled it cooled we're gonna stack the candy rolled trays just the silicone mat with confectioner sugar and then we can pop them out of the candy molds that will prevent them from sticking to each other I also have a container with the lid that also has confectioner sugar on the inside and then we can store them into the freezer [Music] by spraying the moles with vegetable spray it allows that the candies come out very easily you can see that there are really nice bright green the Keef is evenly distributed throughout the candy you really don't see very many speckles at all if any I like to sprinkle in between now let's go grab a sandwich bag and use it as a glue here we are green Apple Jolly Ranchers if you want to make these sour candies you can just add some citric acid to the bowl and shake it you want to make sure that all the powdered sugar is coated on each and every one of these so what I like to do at the end is put a bunch of powdered sugar on the top put the lid on and just shake it vigorously before I put it in to ensure that they're all individually coated this is episode 4 of mmm medical edibles please subscribe comment and give us a green thumbs up that was awesome [Music] I'm rolling up all your good and all your gun [Music] this is not for you no chocolate for your dog you", "g7bApQhA1H8": "on today's video I'm going to teach you how to make cannabis infused butter or oil in the instant pot so we're gonna talk about why to use an instant pot how to do it I'm gonna give you a quick demonstration as well and then just so you know the instructions for this recipe are printed below so you don't have to write anything down hi my name is Andrea hard I'm a cannabis coach and educator and I post new videos here every Saturday morning I also offer private consultations over the phone in-person workshops around the London Ontario area and online classes from the comfort of your own home okay let's talk about why we use an instant pot well this is the number one advantage the instant pot internal temperature gets to 242 degrees Fahrenheit which is literally perfect for D carving and infusing and it's a nice constant steady temperature so you don't have to worry about fluctuations it also makes it so that it's really not all that smelly at all infusing in your instant pot in a mason jar is way less alerting to your neighbors then doing it say on the stovetop or in a crock pot and it is crazy quick this is why people love the instant pot or any kind of pressure cooker in general is because it makes things really fast the first step in the process is to deke our beer cannabis and that turns your THCA and cbda into THC and CBD which is what you want you don't have to grind it first you're just gonna put it into a mason jar close it up finger tight and put that into a bath in the instant pot where the bath water is about halfway up the jar so if your jars halfway full make sure that the water is halfway up the jar as well and you're gonna set it to 40 minutes on manual then let it release for 10 minutes natural pressure release and then release the rest of it pressure yourself and you have d carb cannabis in a flash you don't have to infuse this cannabis you could just use this d carb cannabis as a sprinkle on top of spaghetti or you could put it into capsules the point is you could use it right now as a ste carb you don't have to infuse but if you want to the instant pot is great for that as well so now you're gonna lightly grind the bud you're not trying to make it into powder you're just trying increase the surface area slightly add in your oil or butter make sure that it's melted first and make sure that there's at least of enough liquid to cover the cannabis that you have in there the more liquid you add the less potent your infusion will be then put that mason jar back in the instant pot and it's a little bath for 40 minutes on manual again ten minutes natural pressure release then open it up and strain it or not and you have cannabis infused oil or butter which is amazing super fast much much faster than any other way as for storage you can keep your your all of your abusers always in a dark and cool place butter should be kept in the fridge or freezer and coconut oil could be kept on the counter or also in the fridge the great thing about infusing cannabis into oil or butter is that it allows the cannabis to last for so much longer it doesn't degrade once it's infused into an infusion as for dosing there's no real precise way to find out exactly what's in your infusion unless you have it lab tested but for the home cook I have a little solution for you so this infusion calculator allows you to put in the information that you know about your cannabis and it will spit out how many milligrams of THC or CBD are in your infusion so I'm going to show that to you now this is at the wake-and-bake website and if you haven't been here before you should definitely check it out it's amazing so if you know the THC percentage of your plant material you can type it in because you have lab tested cannabis if you don't you can go to a site like Leafly and type in the strain name and get a general idea so you type in how many grams that you're gonna be using for my infusion that we're gonna do today I'm doing 14 grams into one cup of oil so I know that with my cannabis I'm gonna have 20 100 grams of THC and not very much of CBD and that in each teaspoon I have about 43 milligrams of THC so that's really helpful for me to have an idea of how potent my infusion is again this is not perfect there's lots and lots of variables to go on there but it's a great starting point and even if you have used the dosing calculator it is still really important that you start low and go slow and be your own guinea pig each infusion that you make might be slightly different and you don't want to have a really bad experience because you're going off of what you think will happen so I encourage you to keep a consumption journal and write down how does it make you feel how did you feel before you took it how long does it last keep all that in mind and that will help you really homey and Nona how potent your infusion is all right so let's get started I have here coconut oil you couldn't view this infuse this into butter or any kind of oil that you wanted but I'm going to use coconut oil this is sunflower lecithin we'll talk about this after this is bendy car and here I have my 14 grams of cannabis I'm gonna put this into its little water back in here again you want to make sure that the water in the pot is at least enough to cover what you have in the dark put the lid on and set the timer for 40 minutes and then walk away I'll see you in a bit as you can see my D carving is done it's already done about 10 minutes of natural pressure release and I'm gonna just let the rest of the pressure out open it up alright so I have some perfectly he D card to cannabis in here super hot careful when you're opening this so um D carbon cannabis will be a little bit browner than when you put it in your don't smell a little bit different once your cannabis is cooled off you're going to grind it up I have a coffee grinder here I have a separate coffee grinder for coffee or that would make for some very interesting morning the great thing about this method is that you can do it all in one meter so you're just gonna put this back in your mason jar then I have a cup of coconut oil that I've warmed up in the microwave first I'm also putting in a teaspoon of sunflower lecithin this helps to emulsify the mixture so that the cannabinoids don't separate from the oil it also helps the cannabinoids to enter your blood-brain barrier a little bit more quickly so it doesn't actually make it more potent but it does help to make it feel like it's working a little bit better however so I'm flower lecithin tastes like crap and you know I really hate it so I only had a teaspoon most people recommend a tablespoon to two tablespoons per cup but I recommend that you start low with that inserts and go slow and see how it goes for you then you just put it back in your jar and shake it up back in the instant pot before another bath of 40 minutes on manual and then we'll be done I've got my infused cannabis oil here you can now strain this using a cheesecloth make sure that you really squeeze the cheesecloth to get all the beautiful camera soil out you can then take that cheesecloth and dunk it in a tea and a pot of chai and then you can have some high chives there's still some medicinal benefit left in even the satchel of spent cannabis material but with this one I'm not even gonna strain it I started to add my unstrained cannabis oils and butters right into my baked goods and nobody seems to notice I'm gonna make this into cannabis infused protein bites and that would be next week's video all right if you have any questions I am super happy to answer them just leave them in the comment section down below and are you following me on Facebook and Instagram I really hope you do the links are below I post daily cannabis education there every day and if you head to my website reveal cannabis column you will be send some free stuff like an awesome recipe book and a video that teaches you how to get started with cannabis so why not head over there now until then I will see you next week", "IPP0OFjnEbI": "in today's video i want to talk to you guys about a popular drug combo that often goes south and it goes south fast a lot of people who smoke cannabis in their everyday lives think that if they're trying a new substance like say lsd for the first time that if they take a few tokes of weed during their come up it's going to help relax them and ease them into the experience unfortunately more often than not the opposite happens and instead the weed catapults them into a terrifying nightmare of a trip i personally have experience having a nightmare of a trip from smoking weed during the come-up and this is going to be quite the terror tale actually seems most of my terror tales of bad acid trips involve mixing substances you think i would have learned my lesson but um nope apparently i'm very hard-headed and not in the sense that it means i can take a lot of substances hard-headed in the sense that i'm just a [ __ ] numb skull as always this is a story from my past so don't do anything that you hear me talk about in this video i don't promote the use of illegal or legal substances but if you are going to take a drug like let's say lsd make sure that you always test your tabs before consuming it there are a lot of imposter substances going around that dealers disguise as acid but they're actually harmful drugs i recently put out a video called testing lsd so if you want more information on how to test your tabs to make sure they're safe then follow the link and check out that video there so this story takes place about a year and a half ago and i was on a camping trip with my girlfriend i was the only one who was going to be tripping i had a very important life decision to make and of course i thought i would consult with my personal gods which at the time were the acid gods and i thought it would give me some new insight into my problem and will help me just see things from a new perspective and come to a new conclusion i only intended to consume about 100 micrograms of lsd but what i didn't take into consideration was that i rolled for myself a joint that was probably three to four times larger than my average joint and i should tell you guys that i have a very low tolerance to weed it really doesn't take much to get me high i didn't realize that combining that much cannabis with what i thought was a low dose of lsd was going to create an exceedingly intense experience i didn't realize that the two drugs were going to potentiate each other i remember being in the tent with my girlfriend and i remember as the acid was starting to come on i was having very intense closed eye hallucinations and i don't even want to call them like closed-eyed visuals like they were full delirious hallucinations i was in my mind experiencing an alternate reality than what was actually going on in my mind me and my girlfriend were having this full-blown conv and during this conversation she was a [ __ ] i i couldn't separate what i was imagining from what was really happening and i started to imagine her being just this terrible person and i was just getting really hurt by her when in reality i think all that was going on was she was just trying to get me to calm down because i was freaking out because i was having some kind of a weird delirious ego death type experience i remember starting to just completely lose touch with reality and lose touch with who she was i completely forgot that she was my girlfriend i completely forgot everything about her i didn't know what her name was i had no memories of her all that i knew was i was trapped alone in this tent with this person she was in a bad mood and she wasn't happy that i was waking her up so she was being very hostile towards me and her hostility translated during my trip into her being like a bad guy like i was in some kind of a really negative like life-threatening situation and i had to under any circumstance get away from her so i remember going to uh the zipper and to go outside and she's trying to stop me she's grabbing my arm and she's like adam what are you doing stay in the tent with me like don't go outside and i were looking at her and being like no no i just need to pee i need to pee but meanwhile in my head i'm thinking hey adam you don't know who this person is she's obviously kidnapped you you need to lie to her and tell her that you're going to pee but really what you're going to do is run and the more she was trying to stop me from getting out of the tent the more scared i was getting because she knew that i was really freaking out so she just didn't want me to leave because i guess she anticipated that my behavior was going to be exceedingly erratic and i remember just grabbing the zipper and looking at her and just being like listen if you don't let me go i'm going to run i will run i'm running that's it i'm running now we were at a campground a provincial park campground and they don't really have like any lights like when you leave your tent if you don't have a flashlight it's pitch black and the visuals were coming on pretty intense i remember i was just completely blind it was like someone blindfolded me and i was just running uh in pitch black darkness i'm running through the woods now i remember all of a sudden like my vision starts to kick in a little bit but all i can really do is i've got enough vision to dodge the trees like i'm not even running through the campground i fully just ran into the forest i kept getting these weird visualizations of what i perceived to be rapists in the woods it was like i'd look and i'd see a tree and then there would be like a figure would like dart out look at look at me and then dart back behind the tree and it was happening a lot like the woods was filled with these evil rapists i i don't know why they were rapists but that that is where my mind was going at the time i thought that like i was on some kind of a crazy prison planet and everywhere around me was a rapist like none of this makes sense i was so delirious as i'm running through the woods i'm starting to remember that hey i'm not alone there's someone out here with me and i'm starting to get some flashbacks and some images of my girlfriend and i remember that my girlfriend was out here but at this point i couldn't remember that i had left her i convinced myself that i needed to find her but at the same time i remembered running into a car and i think because i remember just like smacking into a car i started to convince myself that um i had a car accident and the next thing i know i'm back in the nightmare trip if you guys have seen my video i have a video out called nightmare trip and during this trip i talk about feeling as though i was dead and i was looking for my body it was like deja vu i was pulled right back into that trip and i thought that i was again some kind of a spirit or something and i had to find my body and i was getting these flashback images of a car accident that i had when i was younger when i was about 18 i drove right into a tree and it's actually a miracle that i'm alive but i was having these flashbacks to that event as if i actually did die when i hit that tree and i was convincing myself that my whole life since hitting that tree has just been a dream and nothing's been real this drug was showing me that i need to figure out a way to get out of this reoccurring dream and just accept that i died like 10 years ago it was quite terrifying because when you're in that state and you're so suggestible even to your own crazy notions you you can convince yourself of some pretty wild things i was ready to accept that i died 10 years ago and my entire life was just a complete fallacy up to that point luckily i saw people in the distance i saw a fire and behind them was a car and as i'm running through the woods i remember thinking that's it that's it that's my car and i thought i was running towards my car accident and i thought that as soon as i joined with my dead body that was clearly going to be slumped over the steering wheel and full of blood that once i joined with that body and saw with my own spirit eyes that i had actually died 10 years ago then you know i'll ascend into the light and i'll go on to whatever the next dimension is keep in mind that i'm running towards another person's campground like these are people i don't know all that i remember is popping out of the woods and you know like i scared the [ __ ] out of them they were like holding their hearts it was these two guys drinking beers and they're just like oh my god and i'm like hey it was like i just snapped right out of my trance of believing that i was finding my dead body slumped over a steering wheel and now i'm back in to find my girlfriend mode and i'm back in the trance earlier where i thought that she was cheating on me i'm thinking oh my god here's the guys these are the two guys that my girlfriend is sleeping with or she's sleeping with one of them one of these guys is hiding her and i have to figure out which one is hiding her think of what this looks like from their perspective all of a sudden this lunatic looking guy just leaps out of the woods and enters their campground like that's not something you see every day when you go camping with your buddy i proceed to just like stop and i'm catching my breath and they're like oh my god we thought you were a deer or something and i was like oh no sorry i was just i was lost in the woods i have no idea where i am right now and they're just like looking at me like you okay buddy like is everything all right here like can we help you with something and i just blurted out i'm tripping hard right now i'm just like i'm really tripping out i think i took too much psychedelics and then they just kind of laughed and like oh oh okay okay that makes sense then the next thing that comes into my mouth is have you seen jasmine i'm looking at them with these eyes like i know you're hiding her from me i targeted this one guy in particular there was a bigger one and a shorter one i was targeting the shorter guy and he's like jasmine no i don't know who you're talking about i was like oh okay well i've lost my girlfriend and i can't find her so i was just running through the woods looking for her and they're just like oh is she on like psychedelics too i didn't tell them exactly what i was on i think they said are you on mushrooms and i just said yes just to make it simple so they're like oh is she on mushrooms too and i'm like no no she's sober i just i can't find her and i don't know where she went she disappeared and like oh oh that sucks and i was like yeah do you think you guys could uh help me find her and they're like yeah i guess so and i was like well maybe you could just help me walk back to my campground because i have no idea where i am in this campsite i don't have a frat flashlight and yeah i don't know where anything is i had left my phone back in the tent so i pretty much i had nothing on me they're being really nice they're being super chill and super down and one of the guys cracks open a beer and he hands it to me and he's like here dude you look like you need a beer just you know just try to calm down it's okay we're gonna help you out we'll help you find your girlfriend and i was just like oh okay thank you i was thanking them like a lot i was like thank you guys like i really appreciate this i know you don't know who i am just like thanks i remember asking them does it look like i'm really tripping out and they're like no you don't really look like you're tripping that hard so they grab a couple beers and they're like we're gonna take a beer with us for the road they were obviously drinking all night they were probably pretty drunk or buzzed i can't remember and of course we run into park security now one of the rules of this park is you are not allowed to do acid no that's not it you're you're not allowed to walk around the campground with open alcohol you're gonna have open alcohol at your campsite but you can't walk around with it so i remember this female like park ranger comes over to us and she's like you guys know like you're not allowed to walk around with alcohol right and meanwhile i hadn't actually drank the beer they handed me i was just holding it it was full to the top and as we were walking they had they took two beers each with them when they um had finished their drinks i offered to hold their empty bottles for them so here i am with two empty bottles and one full drink and they've just got one bottle so the park ranger is like laser eye targeting me and i'm just like oh no i didn't know you couldn't and i was like i actually haven't drank anything and she's like uh why do you have so many empty bottles and i was like oh i was holding it for them like oh i'm such a rat i'm writing them out now they're like she looked so confused but i was thinking in my head i was still very delirious at this point i was thinking oh thank goodness she's here for some reason because she was a figure of authority i thought she came to help me and i was convincing myself that these two guys who were being very nice and helping me like they didn't have to go to the way to help me i scared the [ __ ] out of them i was thinking that they were the kidnappers now and they were the bad guys and then she she took all our bottles away i remember being so thankful when she took our bottles away because i was thinking for some reason that the beer bottles were their weapons and when she took their beer bottles away i was like oh their weapons are gone they can't really hurt me anymore and then she charges us she wrote each of us a ticket for one hundred 100 for walking around with open alcohol they were furious the two guys were like they were they were ratting me out they're like this guy came to our tent he said that he was having a bad trip he said that he was really tripping out hard and we're just trying to help him find his girlfriend and now you're giving us a ticket and she turns to me she's like is this true i'm like yeah yeah i'm holding their alcohol this is all theirs none of this alcohol is mine and so they're thinking that i'm like trying to throw them under the bus but i'm just so out of it i don't understand like that we're in some kind of trouble because i think that she's here to help me thankfully my girlfriend shows up apparently she was looking for me she was out with the flashlight and she's like oh my goodness there you are i didn't even get a chance to say thank you to them they were furious i mean they each got fined a hundred dollars for helping a stranger who was tripping out if by the rare chance i don't remember your names you guys are watching this video uh thank you for helping me i really did appreciate it i would love to cover your hundred dollar fines for you i don't know just send me an email so my girlfriend grabs me and we head back to the campsite and for some reason as soon as i saw her i completely sobered up it was like my trip completely ended and i was back and i went straight to sleep mixing these two substances should only be reserved for those who are extremely experienced with the effects of weed because what things like lsd do is their mood enhancers they enhance how you currently feel and cannabis has the potential for a lot of people to put them in sometimes paranoid states so say now you're smoking weed on the come up and you get a very slight amount of paranoia paranoia that you'd normally just be able to ignore but because you're on the lsd as well which enhances how you feel it can just make that paranoia get infinitely multiplied to the point where you just start freaking the [ __ ] out anyway that concludes my story i hope you guys enjoyed

what they have available and I guess what I opted to get from the state so this is what I have it is part of the red group so let's open it up there so it looks like there's one actually stuck in there that's some residue in there well this is what we have here must keep refrigerated and there's the residue on some either they like to be hidden there's about thirty of them there these red caps come in either a concentration of two point five milligrams of THC or extra-strength at ten milligrams of THC if anyone wants to know any more let me know in the comments I will answer any questions that I know and I will do my best to find out anything else so let me know what you think thanks", "Y87yxZsDQTs": "hello everybody and welcome back your burger canvas and this week's video I'm gonna teach you how we make CBD oil here on the farm but first if you're new here to the channel please hit that subscribe button if you've already subscribed thank you very much so let's get right into how we make our CBD oil here on the farm so obviously first thing you're gonna need is CBD hemp flour now we grew this all year and this is about 3 and 1/2 ounces now they recommend magic butter machine which is what we're going to use they recommend 7 to 14 grams per cup of oil your choice of oil but the oil that I like to use here is MCT oil now this is fractured coconut oil to pretty much just have no coconut flavor and mono saturated fats what's cling on to CBD so those are pretty much the two ingredients in our CBD oil the next thing you're gonna want to do is after you weigh out your flour and you figured out how many cups of oil you want to use now typically I do two cup run and I will use about 12 grams of flour per cup I just like that ratio seems to work really well so you weigh it out on your scale and then you decarboxylate it now magic butter machine has its own decarboxylated flow and I put it in the oven at 250 degrees to 230 degrees really depends on where you want it how fast you want it low and slow I like to go with my D carb and you're gonna want to do it for twenty to thirty minutes so that's what we're gonna start off with so let's get right into how we make our CBD oil okay guys so now we're going to turn on the oven so first thing we're gonna do for our oven here is we're gonna hit the bake button we're gonna bring it down to 230 degrees Fahrenheit then we're just gonna hit start and now while it's preheating I'm gonna weigh out my flour and put it on this aluminum Flo so I'll be right back okay now that we've made our little container for our flour and today we'll be using our by ox flour that we grew this summer the next thing I'm going to do now that this is all good I'm gonna cover it up and more aluminum foil so you want to make sure that it's nice and covered because you want to keep all of those proteins in there and you really don't want to lose a lot of that flavor so to speak from the bud and then once we do that I'll take a knife it's almost like making a pie you know you're gonna want to cut a couple holes in it and that will let out any kind of moisture so now we're going to stick it in the oven for about 25 minutes okay so now we have decarboxylated our CBD hemp flour which is right here so this is pretty much what it looks like it just gets a little bit darker nothing crazy but it activates that CBD a and then what we're gonna do is I'm gonna get all that in here so that was approximately 24 grams of CBD hemp flour now what we're gonna do is we're going to add two cups of her MC tu Oh now the reason why I prefer MCT will is because it's just the best carrier for this CBD you can use coconut oil and you can use olive oil and a bunch of other oils but MCT really holds it the best and it has the most mono saturated fats per serving so there is our two cups of MCT oil we're just going to add it right into the machine get that all in there okay and that's it guys with the magic cutter machine it's a set it and forget it so now we're going to go ahead we're going to walk this thing on we're going to plug it in okay now if you can see the buttons here and I'll try to pull it up a little closer to the camera you're going to be able to see these flashing buttons first you're gonna want to go to a hundred and sixty degrees Fahrenheit and I like to do it for four hours because this is an oil tincture and that's it now it's good to go and you'll see the light starting this is starting the process of making the CBD oil and the great thing is guys there's no food processor there's no mess you can do this a whole bunch of other ways but I really love my magic butter machine because this is a no mess set it and forget it thing so we'll see you in four hours and you'll be able to see the final product alright everybody so the CBD oil is complete now I didn't catch it in time but the whole thing illuminates like blue and red and pink and once it's done it'll start flashing so this thing is ready to take out so now we're going to go through the process of extracting our oil from the material in the magic butter machine so as you can see it is all over the place in here and so what you should have is a spatula of some sort I just have a silicone one which is what a lot of people use I guess for this machine I don't think it's necessary but what you're going to do is you're just going to try to get all this material off the butter machine as best you can you know you can drive yourself crazy trying to get it all off but you want to get the majority of it a lot gets up underneath it so that's pretty good for me then what you're gonna do is you're going to kind of like scoop the sides you're gonna want to get it all in there okay so we are probably going to get less than two cups so I'm gonna get my bigger because you're gonna have to take this now magic butter gives you they call the love glove and the micron bag this is to extract all the plant material so you want to carefully get all that will in there now you use spatula again get as much of it in there as you can you can see down in there there's still quite a bit so that's what I'm trying to get out right now it smells awesome you guys alright that'll be good enough for now so next thing you're gonna do is gonna want to get your your silicone glove on your dominant hand so for me I'm a right-handed person you need to pick it up and you're gonna squeeze that bag this is the best you can you don't want to extract all that oil out of there if you can see it still coming out of there okay and that's it there's your CBD oil and I'll show you the finished product here so that is MC t CBD oil now what I'll do after this is I will put it in a bottle like this food-grade you can buy these at Walmart or Dollar Tree for for less than a dollar and then I will use it to fill these cvd vials so that's it for today's video if you like the video please don't forget to give

watching and we'll see you in the next video", "eDn3wTnbsE8": "how's everybody doing this is John with C&C connoisseurs and we've got a much requested one for you today so do you have a cartridge and you're having a hard time refilling it well this also applies if you happen to purchase one of these questionable cartridges and it fails how do you remove the mouthpiece to extract the oil I'm going to show you how to remove the mouthpiece from these cartridges in a way that they can then be reused or the oil can be recovered from them now the tools that I'm going to be utilizing are simply a common pair of vise grips and these are going to be csail 1 mil or 1 gram disposable one-time use ceramic coil cartridges that being said let's take this to the deck ok well here we are once again these are one-time use non removable sea cells as you can see right here this is a sea sail brand that is a batch code on the bottom alright this is another one this one here does not state sea sell across the bottom but on the base it does say sea sell m07 9 this is also a Jupiter distributed cartridge so the first things first we're going to take a pair of vice grips common write scripts and we're going to adjust them so when we apply them we apply them just at the base of that metal see how it's just barely barely at the base of that metal right there and we want to close it so it closed it just a little bit it pinches down just ever so slightly nothing cracks it barely bows and then you rock it back and forth rather firmly now there you have it you will get some flyer marks on the mouthpiece but if you look this collar right here which is what you want to preserve is undamaged completely undamaged okay now well there's the silicone ring right there that will seal around this shaft so you don't worry about that now in this outer sheath you can see that it is also undamaged that one was a little bit difficult I'll apply it to this just to stand it up and they'll have a go at one of these other ones all right I will show you again on this one here I said this is a C cell you take the pliers right at the base of the metal hinge it lock it back and forth pulling the cartridge off of the mouthpiece just like that [Applause] very simple easy there you have it alright now I'm gonna apply this cartridge to this battery just for a stable base and I'm going to open up this gelato right here and warm it up to dispense it into this cartridge okay now here is the cartridge we are going to refill all right here is the mouthpiece for the cartridge perfectly fine a couple of scratches on but that shouldn't affect it in the least here's the distillate we will be applying to it I have warmed this up substantially just to ensure that it does flow rather well into the system you simply place the applicator tip on the syringe twisting it to ensure that it has a good seal you put the syringe tip down into the cartridge and then just begin to apply the fluid all right there you have it as you can see the original line of the older oil right there at the bottom of the new oil coming down to meet it okay take that off the bottom there and see it's sinking down there very nice we didn't get a protective silicon cap for these threads right here apply it to the threads take the mouthpiece that came off of the cartridge put it over the top and it will it will not go on all the way that's a good thing that means that the seal still works it will not go on at this point you want to take a precision device and apply pressure now as you do that you will see this seal disappears and there you have it let's take this back up top and see how she does all right and here we are back on top with the csail refill that we have here now as you can see the oil has got down to the coil has mixed with that heather oil bubbles are rising to the top let's take this protective cover off the bottom of this hook it up to a battery let's see what we got shall we well there you have it that's working like a champ looking that of oil through there I can get that a little bit of gelato flavor from that distillate that I put in there it's very nice well there you have it that is how you can remove and refill one of these cartridges to extract the oil from it what you're going to want is a slightly longer blunt syringe tip and I have a few of those a slightly longer blunt syringe tip such as this one right here as you can see how long that is that would definitely get all the way down to the base of that and you would be able to extract any additional oil that happens to be in a cartridge where this this cell has failed this one no it's not failing all it's working great well thank you so much for tuning in this has been John with TMZ connoisseurs you be sure to remember to subscribe and give this a thumbs up if you liked it and tune in to some of our other videos to see if you like those as well thank you so much this has been great you have a nice day peace", "rUCymABIOps": "[Music] so we're right in the middle of what's being called the green revolution which is the systematic nationwide decriminalization and even legalization of medicinal as well as recreational use of marijuana of cannabis and this is really a radical upheaval of what was historically a very very huge illicit drug trade that involved multiple countries and thousands and thousands of people and literally billions of dollars for a simple plant kind of ridiculous the idea to try to make something like this illegal something you could grow in your backyard but it was done and continues to be done in some jurisdictions and so it's a pretty interesting time billions of dollars are now coming to the mainstream this is now a taxable good which is creating huge huge tax revenues in states like colorado and washington state and all the other places where it's become legalized and then the question is what does this really mean i'm not a marijuana user i'm not a huge advocate of marijuana culture it just doesn't appeal to me at this phase of my life but what i think is pretty interesting is when you have this plant which has been used for thousands of years and has some very interesting elements like cbd which is stands for cannabidiol which is one of many one of dozens of cannabinoids these compounds that are inside of this plant that has some really interesting properties first of all cbd it's important to remember as we get into this discussion is non-psychoactive which means you can take it and you don't get paranoid you don't get the munchies you don't want to watch you know south park episodes until two in the morning that's the end result but it's proven to be really effective for pain anxiety and sleep those are probably the three main things you'll find all kinds of crazy stuff online about it curing cancer and all these kinds of things i don't think there's really clinical data to back that up but pain pain anxiety and sleep constitute a huge percentage of prescription medications not needless to say opioids for example opioid abuse is on the rise and potentially cbd cannabidiol and maybe cbd plus some thc for certain people could be a much much healthier alternative i'm in no way a cannabis activist or anything like that but i'm all for decriminalization of drugs i can't see any good that's come from that there's probably hundreds of thousands of people in jail right now for marijuana possession which just seems crazy entire lives ruined for a plant which is definitely definitely less dangerous and harmful than you know a bottle of vodka or something like that on this week's podcast we'll be chatting about cbd specifically and i just want to emphasize this is non-psychoactive meaning it's not going to get you high and i say this because i know most of you are not interested in getting totally baked on a tuesday night and so i'd like you to think about cbd the the market unfortunately has been flooded with you know network marketing and all kinds of weird pyramid schemes and things and it's really difficult to figure out what cbd is good and what cbd is bad and hopefully we'll shed some light on some products and some ways to think about this especially just making sure that you get an effective dose if you're new here it's the lucas rockwood show i'm a yoga teacher a trainer i'm a serial entrepreneur i'm the father of three kids but first and foremost i'm a student i like to learn stuff so i go into the world and i meet medical doctors like today's guest yoga teachers

at lucasrockwood i answer all of those messages myself thanks so much for listening enjoy so welcome everybody we're doing a different version of the podcast today and the name of our podcast is cannabis for pain and sleep and i'm joined here with mary clifton who is right here on instagram if you're joining us here and dr clifton is a board-certified licensed internal medical doctor she's an expert in cbd and cannabis which is what we'll be chatting about today her website is cbd and cannabis info.com lots of great resources there she's the author of a couple books one is called the grasses greener and the other is called get wasted and she has a bunch of companion cookbooks and she speaks all over the place and we're happy to have her here again the website is cannabisinfo.com welcome mary great to be here great to connect with you you know i was wondering if we could start off with some uh definitions i've never been able to tell or i don't know if there's a difference between cbd from hemp or cbd from cannabis and i'll tell you sort of my understanding of what hemp versus cannabis is i think of like canadian hemp made for like us yoga people wear hemp clothing and then i think of cannabis as like when i'm in holland they have this crazy sticky bud it is that is there a differentiation to be made between the cbd derived from hemp and that from cannabis you know not really i mean i i think that hemp it differentiates from cannabis in most people's minds or at least in the industry as hemp being cannabis sativa and cannabis indica plants that primarily concentrate cbd or don't really concentrate particular cannabinoids and work really to be very fibery for the development of clothing or ropes or things like that so hemp and hemp is also protected under the farm bills here in the united states so it has a different position as far as its ability to be grown and the restrictions around its growth and then cannabis is also cannabis sativa or cannabis indica but generally those are the ones that grow you know and concentrate thc the cannabinoid that gets you high because remember cbd can't get you high it doesn't have a intoxication effect so having uh so having some uh having the thc concentrate puts it more in the cannabis or marijuana space whereas the hemp space is more for cbd or for uh textiles sure so i i first got interested in cbd i guess it was um nine ten ten years ago i guess it was i was living here in spain and so here in spain it was legal to get cbd coming from holland and so the first cbd oils and things i used came from holland and they definitely had thc in them uh definitely and and it was it was um some of them less some of them more and uh but it it wasn't something that i could just take without thinking about it you know i had a couple of experiences where you know up in the middle of the night paranoid and this kind of thing and i think this is what a lot of people worry about and obviously it's very very different when you're buying things in the netherlands where things are largely unregulated and if you're buying something in north america but for for people purchasing things how should they think about it because a lot of my family's in colorado and there's a lot of people living in states where thc slash cbd strains are you know high cbd strains are legal and these kinds of things for somebody who's like not a cannabis user and is freaked out in some cases appropriately freaked out you can have a really bad night on um how can they think about this if you're making a cbd selection cbd uh it and that is is legal in all 50 states it's available everywhere and you can use it in uh you know safely in all 50 states the only time people get any prosecution or any legal issue with it is if you try to give it to somebody who's under 21 then that's going to raise some flag so if you're using it on a child or you know if you in settings like autism or seizure you just need to make sure you've got all of the right experts around you to keep you safe and protected in that setting but the but cbd that is uh you know sold has to be less than 0.3 percent thc so it can't be intoxicating i mean there may have been some early products that leaned heavily towards cbd and weren't possibly you know properly following the rules but the cbd is is almost always tested every single batch has to be tested and and companies have to throw it out if the thc concentration is too high uh and then and then you know for a lot of situations when i'm taking care of people medically starting out with those cbd products do very well for getting a lot of people under control and then you can add a little bit of thc or a lot of thc depending on what you need to do but most of the time when you're making a cbd selection nowadays if you read the label carefully you shouldn't get into a position where you're getting thc but you're right there are a lot of people that can have sort of a paranoid side effect or a side effect where they get too much energy from using the thc addition or they get too sedated so that's where it's really helpful to have somebody provide a little bit of guidance and support while you're making selections within cannabis um you know when you're using it medicinally or recreationally what's happened to me a couple of times is i've gone to dispensaries we have sort of quasi dispensaries here in spain also and i ask for you know cbd and they say oh we have a high cbd strain it's like yeah i mean maybe it's higher in cbd but this is really it's still a very very psychoactive strain and so um this is this is i guess why i'm bringing it up because many many people live in in decriminalized or legalized states and when they go asking for cbd sometimes they just get high cbd strains which is still i mean that can still take you for a really unpleasant evening if you ingest if somebody accidentally ingests half a gram of high cbd strain or something like that people do really well with a high cbd strain i mean in a lot of cases in almost all cases that's where i start and give people to get the benefit of the cbd and then you know but sometimes in cases where you're dealing with like uh nausea or loss of appetite cancer you need to really get the higher cbd concentrations to get that and to get that treated or lots of you know chronic severe pain syndromes but in a lot of cases a little goes a long way as far as your thc but choosing the pure cbd you know if you have any concerns about thc you can just stay away from the fuller broad spectrum and go with the cbd isolate products and there's a ton of those that have that that go through another level of distillation and any thc that was contained in the product is removed and right now for well for the past five years cbd project products have just been exploding everything from you know cbd smart drinks smoothies face creams everything is is there a quality control issue are some of these ineffective i know like in the supplement industry if you were to buy fish oil or something like that there's a wide range some of that stuff is absolute garbage and some of its medicinal you're going to get a bottle of cbd that has like it'll say 300 milligrams of cbd which seems like a lot except for if you put it into a great big bottle you're talking about maybe 10 mil in 10 milligrams per milliliter so you might have to take three or four milliliters five or six milliliters in a lot of cases before you're getting a result five or six dropper fulls is not something people are going to do they're going to do a couple of drops see how they see how it works maybe go up to a half of uh half of a drop or fold maybe to a full dropper full of work a week later so i mean you know this when you you really have to make sure that when you're selecting a product that you have a product that has enough cbd in it to have an effect because i i do talk to people who say this didn't work on me and it didn't work on my dog either and then oh yeah what did you do with it and they gave themselves you know a couple of drops and then they called it a day and so but they're a lot of times i think that's almost like a prohibition uh concept talking because they're not willing to increase that titration very quickly they're not really willing to move through a process with it so it's a uh so it's a you know it's a it you have to be sort of ready to think about this in a little bit higher administration amounts and be ready to start uh uh you know up tooling it up and so let's assume let's assume people are purchasing liquid cbd oil i'm assuming it's in a carrier oil and what is what is the percentage that they should think about because i think especially when i first started consuming it i used to get uh syringes like a gel and syringe it's just like i just had no idea what the dosage was and i didn't know what was strong concentration what wasn't it was kind of all over the place i think in a lot of cases people start a little too low and they stop before they've given themselves adequate time to get enough to see if it's going to work so i think starting at a at a administrative amount of around 20 milligrams and then going up a lot of my patients settle out between 60 and 100 milligrams a day when they're managing anxiety insomnia pain so there's a lot of those settings where where you can get uh quite a bit done you know at that level um so i usually recommend that people go with a product that has at least 2 000 milligrams in the little dropper bottle okay and sometimes even as much as 3 000 to start because then that way a couple of drops is has the potential to make a difference you know uh and then as you're and then as you're titrating your administrative amount you're not going to have to take dropper full after dropper full so i i those weaker uh amounts are you know sometimes uh i think a little off-putting for people getting started and having a great result you know because who wants to have a mouthful of oil so a little bit is okay but i don't want anybody consuming a bunch of it so i mean so i'm guessing like one to three dollars per day is what people are thinking about if they're dosing right in terms of like actual out-of-pocket expense so similar to like a fish similar to like a fish oil like a high quality fish oil same same kind of price range in terms of i think that's a reasonable amount off the shelf you know if you're if you're in a wholesale relationship then you can probably get that near half yeah and the other i mean the other challenge with anything whether whether it's fish oil or whether it's cbd or whether it's deep breathing or whatever people fall into hyperbole really quickly and so you know the the medicine cures everything from you know ptsd to this and that it's like maybe but from an actual you know from a medical perspective from a clinical efficacy perspective what what what are what are just like i can throw this at the wall and feel pretty comfortable it's going to stick of course there's a bunch of outlying use cases but what are the use cases where you're like this is a pretty safe bet this is going to at least move the needle in terms of benefits well i mean it depends on if you're a lumper or a splitter in medicine you know i mean a lot of what is happening and i don't know that i don't know that phrase tell me what that means some people think that you know every little condition has its own little batch of pathophysiology around it and so they've got everything all split off but i think personally when you get to the bottom of anxiety a lot of eating disorders depression a lot of insomnia all of that is boiling down into dopamine and serotonin regulation and imbalance so when you restore homeostasis to that system you you can manage a lot of different conditions and that's true because when we're managing these conditions in medicine you use antidepressants across a whole spectrum of things that don't actually have to do with depression we use antidepressants to manage chronic pain and that's all serotonin and dopamine so that's where it's so exciting to be able to share a product that balances and restores homeostasis at that neurotransmitter level and the same thing is true when you're dealing with inflammation you know the other pathway that cbd and other cannabinoids are so powerful is in restoring i'm running out of juice restoring balance and homeostasis with inflammation so if you can help to reduce the inflammatory response i mean very acutely in the situation we're dealing with right now if you can decrease the amount of cytokine production and alleviate the cytokine storm reduce tumor necrosis factor in interleukin that reduces fever and body aches and mucus production and you know in one rat model took a group of rats who were like laid out with the rat flu to another group of rats who were pre-treated with cbd who were still eating and drinking and even um even solving a few simple mazes they felt good enough to get up and have a little fun and that's remarkable you know that we can modify the the immune response the inflammation response uh that that way and that powerfully so uh so these are really valuable products and and really our bodies were designed for them i mean you have the endocannabinoid system cb1 receptors all throughout your spinal cord and brain cb2 receptors all throughout your immune system three four and five receptors are located in some very limited places in the brain and probably aren't clinically relevant you know because everything's getting stimulated by cbd or thc at various levels or the other 80 known cannabinoids you know so uh so when you're doing uh when you're thinking about uh you know how is this stuff affecting it's you you have this endocannabinoid system you have these receptors and you have a plant that grows outdoors literally like a weed you know if we weren't in prohibition it would be growing in my ditch it's just you know right well i don't have a ditch you know i'm on the 23rd floor here in manhattan but it'd be growing in somebody's ditch somewhere and then and you'd be able to just use it the animals that you would be consuming would be consuming it and it'd be pollinating the air so you'd always be getting that stabilization and that balance to your system even if you weren't actively inhaling the product the the the whole system is is designed to uh to to work for you so i don't see any reason why you shouldn't view this product as more of an adaptogen like along with your mushrooms and your b complex and your your omega-3 fats all of the things that you're doing to restore that balance in your system and mary everybody i talked to who gets into cbd oil they're always starting to add back in some thc and the theory that i've heard is that you know these cannabinoids work in synergy and we're isolating one of them we don't really know how that works and modern cannabis is jacked up for thc um you know like you said it would be growing in the ditch but definitely it wouldn't be like thai stick growing in the ditch like the stuff that they grow now that this is like this is green crack i mean this stuff is so strong it's so so strong it's it's been it's been hybridized for thc and so you know the stuff that would have been growing native in north america or whatever it's nothing like the dank bud stuff they're selling it's nothing like that um i have a uh insurance connection within the cannabis community that said to me recently i um i eat all of my food organic and all of my cannabis is inorganic because i want it i want it under perfect growing conditions i want the highest concentration of thc and and i want i want a very certain type that can't grow in the ditch but he also you know it will take like one half of one puff he's using what he's trying to do is concentrate the thc so that he's not you know um necessarily getting that much higher but he doesn't have to have that much exposure to the inhalation which is really neat if he can do one inhalation yeah you know so but you're right it does if you're like if you were smoking back in the 70s when we were all kids the 70s and the 80s and you're thinking about getting back into it you know you're absolutely right exercise caution yeah things are a little different nowadays yeah but are you are you of the same school are you of the same school of thought where there there is there are benefits to integrating some thc into a cbd protocol if somebody tolerates it in a lot of cases i i i will add a little thc for patients you know and sometimes even when they're starting with a cbd consultation and we're talking about just adding cbd i'll tell them i really wouldn't spend a lot of time on exclusively cbd given your circumstances people who are having you know end stage cancer uh you know pain or loss of appetite that that's not a cbd uh issue although sometimes there's a decent response but there are certain circumstances where i'd like to go straight to a higher concentration of thc to get those symptoms under control but sure you know a little bit of cbd followed by a lot of cbd so you can see how it's responding for you and then add that shift to thc because in a lot of cases just getting the cbd at a high enough concentration is going to get you what you're looking for when i first started practicing yoga the biggest challenge for me was flexibility i couldn't sit cross-legged on the floor i couldn't extend my arms above my head everything was just so uncomfortable because i was so so stiff and i was in my 20s so my body was fully formed obviously as most of you are it puts you in a very different position if you're an adult and you have major stiffness major imbalance the traditional yoga advice to just keep coming to class for a lot of us is just not enough it's not that it won't work for mobility or flexibility but because a typical yoga class includes strength and balance and breath work and so many other things flexibility is number four number five on the list it'll certainly help but it can often just take way too long or at least that was my assumption if i just kept going on the path that i started back in my 20s i figured it would take me three four maybe five years to be able to cross my legs and sit in a squat and lotus and that was just too depressing i couldn't really accept that so i went on a mission and started researching didn't get a lot of love from my yoga teachers meaning they didn't like this idea of flexibility training so i went to other places martial artists i talked to gymnastics teachers dance practitioners and very quickly i learned it's not that complicated flexibility is not that complicated the way to open your body is through long hold passive stretches it's really uncomfortable it's a process i call gravity yoga i have been teaching this in workshop and class settings now since 2007 and just about a year and a half ago i started certifying teachers in gravity yoga our teachers work with two different types of clients one is they'll work privately to help somebody like a triathlete or a new mother or even somebody who doesn't do any exercise at all but they have an imbalance from working in the service industry or from caring around a kid or whatever it is and then the other way they work with people is within group classes and workshops so one hour guided classes um in some cases two day workshops to help people open their hips their hamstrings their spine and their shoulders those are often the tricky areas and it's been super successful it's really really popular it's one of these things that i thought i was the only one struggling with this but no no no turns out many people every day when they go to put on their shoes are hyper aware of the fact that their hips and their hamstrings are problematically tight and this just isn't just about feeling flexible it's also about taking care of your lower back and taking care of your joints if you can't stand and move in a functional way it can really cause problems imbalances in our body are one of the leading cause of back pain and knee problems even shoulder issues can derive directly from imbalances and this is where gravity yoga comes in i'm telling you this story now because we're about to start our last gravity yoga teacher training program of 2020. it's an amazing program it's 12 days long it's live with me and we'll teach you everything you need to know to work one-on-one or in group settings just so you know most of our graduates now are working virtually via zoom due to the coronavirus end and it's working just as well if not better than before to learn more about the chorus go to gravity yoga training dot com gravity yoga training dot com and you can read stories from past students watch a video from me and see if it's the right thing for you courses starting soon hope you can join us the actual course itself was i just want to give feedback and say it was superbly run the use of modern technology and techniques this feedback system i was not expecting this i was just expecting an email saying with a few bullet points um you guys are really set an example to every training college on how things should be done and i can't commend you enough for that it was money very well spent um and i'll be back for more courses i'm sure so um once again thank you very much i'm very happy now thank you cheers bye this week's nutritional tip comes in response to a listener question listener sally s on instagram says lucas i've noticed you've discontinued your nutritional supplements specifically your green me up super green powder why did you do that and do you have another brand that you could recommend i find some stuff at target but i'm not sure if it's good so we manufactured supplements for over 10 years and i loved manufacturing supplements i'm kind of a supplement nerd but what happened is over the course of the 10 years supplements became really easy to find which is great you can find supplements like you mentioned sally at target you can find really pretty good supplements at target in fact well i've only been in target a couple of times in recent years but last time i was there i saw some pretty good supplements and and so that's why we stopped there just wasn't really a need for it anymore when i first started selling supplements in 2007 many of our listeners many of our subscribers they couldn't find stuff and so it was a really fun thing to be able to do and i like nutrition i like i like putting things together so yes we had a formula called green me up which i also loved it was a really great superfood green powder in terms of do i recommend them yeah i definitely recommend them you know it's especially great when you're traveling to have little superfoods in your bag just because a lot of times the food is kind of lifeless and boring and dull in terms of micronutrients and so it can be a really helpful thing to carry for those of you who are wondering what we're talking about usually these green powders contain things like chlorella and spirulina and barley grass juice extract and other extremely extremely mineral dense micro algaes usually they're micro allergies these things these super green powders that look really really dark green almost purplish that's usually what they contain the gating factor for this is always i this is always my caveat for supplements is your belly and so some of these things will just wreak havoc on your gi system you just can't you just can't eat much of them or you'll end up on the toilet all day but in terms of brands and things like that i i hesitate to do brand recommendations because i don't know these companies come and go and suddenly they're making something great and they switch manufacturers and it's not that great but there are lots of great stuff to find i usually send people to irb like iphone iherb.com great site for buying supplements really great prices and they ship all over the world literally all over the world it's a good place to find stuff but especially if you're traveling i think it's a really great resource if you're at home you know usually if you can have any kind of fresh greens that's going to trump any of those powders but if you don't have access i am certainly a fan hope that helps we have a listener question this week from joseph joseph on instagram says lucas getting into gravity yoga for hip flexibility specifically thanks for that my question is i'm coming off of 10 years in an office we've all switched to remote work now and so i have time to exercise but i'm not sure what to do i have about 18 or 20 pounds to lose will flexibility training help i get some variation of this question pretty regularly joseph so i thought i'd answer this directly and the answer is probably not of all the different things you could experiment with to help with weight loss flexibility training is probably pretty low on the list now it could help with stress and reducing stress it reduces weight loss but that would be a that i feel like that would be pretty much of a stretch if i was to suggest that you know your nightly gravid yoga is going to help with weight loss when you are thinking about weight loss there are things that i think are often overlooked and those are things like sleep and stress mental emotional stress moderation lifestyle balance meal timing carb throttling but none of which involve extreme exercise or extreme calorie counting which is generally thought of as the best practice if you delve into the research around this you'll find really quickly that extreme exercise and extreme dieting is almost always correlated with failure it it has a very very low efficacy rate and the most successful long-term weight loss programs involve moderate to light exercise which would look and feel more like walking the dog i just want to say that out loud so that you know if you're not attracted to extreme exercise if it's not something that you enjoy and it's not something that's safe for your joints depending on where what what age you are and things like this you can be in great shape doing very very moderate things very simple things i encourage you to go back and listen to some of the past shows i have a show called everything i know about weight loss where i share just some of the very very simple high leverage tips that i learned from the years i spent working in the weight loss market and things like this we have a whole number of episodes where we chat about uh weight loss specifically we'll link up in the show notes i appreciate the question thanks for listening to the lucas rockwood show if you enjoy the podcast i have two asks of you number one share the show on social media with your friends and tag me my handle is at lucasrockwood number two is please leave a rating and review in whatever app you're listening on and last but not least before you go if you'd like to be on my mailing list every week i send out information about the podcast behind the scenes stuff announcements of online classes and special events i email about once a week you can do that at yogabody.com forward slash sign me up and right now we have a free breathing worksheet on that page as well it's yoga body dot com forward slash sign me up thanks so much for listening and we'll see you next week", "nJalmWldHNI": "all right an entrepreneur has feared out yet another way for us to get high on marijuana and it definitely has nothing to do with why Noah's not here today hello dear friends it is me filling in for noah glutton who definitely isn't too high to be on camera right now I'm sure you guys have all heard of scissor and lean thanks in no small part to your favorite popular rap songs well there's a new scissor out there that replaces the codeine with THC for your health a company called active list has created grape scissor with cannabinoids which they first introduced via free samples to the public on 4/20 I'm not sure why they picked Hitler's birthday for their pot sauce premiere but let's move on active list is a pun on the company activists were the folks behind the original prescription codeine syrup that you've heard you know little Wayne or Miley Cyrus or you know just whoever rap talk about see activists is pulling their stuff from the market because people are keeping way way too [ __ ] up on it seriously man that should kill you so legs the state way so active list swooped in and created their own medicine which is supposed to be a lot safer than lean they're touting it as a healthy alternative like soy milk but it still has the same purple color and goopy consistency it's $45 for two ounces which is up to two doses although some people just down the whole thing in one go cuz they're rebels and they don't care it seems kind of pricey to me since the high is over in about ten hours do you have any idea how much meth you can get for that kind of money guys the gentlemanly asking now we can get this stuff here in LA because pot is basically legal here but they are working on a THC free version so it could be shipped across state lines I don't know what the point of a THC free version of this would be but hey why not knock yourselves out active list there's a pretty good chance the activists people might try to sue ACTA bliss for a copyright infringement or something but they haven't done it yet and active list is just hoping they won't while still preparing for the possibilities I'm not sure who I'd pick in a fight between someone stoned on codeine against someone stoned on weed but let me know where you put your money in the comments I michael truly subscribe

welcome to cannabase ecstatic oak shatter tabs and wax today we're going to look at several ways to smoke shatter wax and rosin along with the pros and cons of dab rigs and nails dab pins vaporizers emails and nectar collectors you can find all these products and more at the wizard puff com online head shop and you can save money with the code roughhouse I'd like to thank wizard puffs for sponsoring this video perhaps the og of ways to do dabs is the trusty dab or oil rig fitted with the titanium nail or quartz banger and is truly one of the most effective ways to do a dab you'll get a huge hit instantly and usually get the most out of your wax - as it's fully vaporized in seconds dab rigs might be one of the most effective ways of doing dabs but there are drawbacks such as needing a torch and gas to heat the nails and also a recovery time to reheat it now for the next tab also when you introduce open flame and exposed high heat into the process you also sacrifice safety to some degree dad pens on the other hand are probably one of the safest ways to do dabs these types of pens usually use quartz ceramic or metal coils to heat the wax enclosed inside of a sealed glass or metal cap these types of pens can be effective and give big hits but usually will take several puffs to smoke the same amount of wax as doing a single dab off of a nail another common drawbacks to wax pans is that the unvailed wax builds up and they require constant cleaning to keep functioning properly some vaporizers that are made for dry herb can also be used to vaporize wax to these devices usually provide a cup or pod that inserts into the dry herb heating chamber to vaporize the wax these types of devices can be very convenient but the cons are that they often do a mediocre job of vaporizing wax as they lack the heat that's required and the small pods can be cumbersome and leaky so it can be hard to keep the heating chamber clean for dry herb nectar collectors or vacuum systems could be considered the Dark Horse of DAB methods these types of devices use a heated tip on the end of a handheld device that you dip directly into the wax there are both electric collectors as well as those requiring external heat sources such as a torch one big advantage of the collector type rig is that you can get huge hits when you're dipping the tip directly into the wax but they can have a bit of a learning curve and a little bit awkward to use perhaps the biggest favourite among divers is the email emails are very similar to the standard titanium nail on an oil rig with one key difference the emails have an electronic control center to set a precise temperature and a heating element that will keep the nail continuously heated and ready for a dab the pros of emails are that it's ready for a DAB any time that it's on and you can set to precise temperatures and you also you can do back-to-back dabs without having to reheat the nail they may also arguably be safer than using open flames and are clearly more convenient than needing a secondary heating torch cons are that they usually require a power source to operate so it may not be as portable as the other methods and it's also very convenient to use so you might find yourself smoking through your wax very quickly and passing out on the couch very early whichever method you choose dabbing wax or rosin so long as it's free of impurities is actually healthier than smoking cannabis flowers by not smoking or vaporizing the plant materials you are clearly putting less unnecessary chemicals into your body and by taking concentrated doses you're required to smoke less frequently not to mention that the time it takes to do it to have is far quicker than the time it takes to smoke a joint bulb or especially a blunt but if you're an everyday diver like myself a nice email setup likely be the way to go but if you only occasionally dabber prefer to vaporize then a three-in-one vape pen that does wax too might be satisfactory or any or an inexpensive wax pen might be even better or perfect for the beginner just looking to dabble in wax shatters and rosin concentrates again I'd like to thank the guys at wizard puff for sponsoring this video you can save money on a lots of the products that you saw in this video with a code roughhouse and wizard puff comm I hope you enjoyed this video on how to smoke shatter tabs and wax if you did please visit Rafal studios.com for hundreds of cannabis culture videos made just for you this is matt from ruff house studios thank you for watching [Music]", "GDgj4zVNub0": "so we are going to be doing a uh cbd versus thc delta 9 versus thc delta 8 blind test we're gonna have my friends try out these drugs and see if they can tell the difference between them uh this is purely for entertainment uh so let's get right into it by the way if you don't know who i am i'm chris with cbd extract and if you haven't tried our hemp flour before do me a favor and hit the link down below and you can grab an eighth of our hemp flour completely for free it doesn't cost you anything all you got to do is click the link down below to claim the offer let's get right into it we're not going to tell you what's what okay oh we're going to we're going to tell you at the end but for now let me ask a couple questions okay uh how long have you been smoking like a year and a half year and a half okay about six years six years quite a while yeah that's quite a while how experienced would you say you are with weed but i am not good at knowing types quite a lot of experience so i'm a big dabber so like um i get a lot of different profiles like i tried to switch up my strains and stuff and switch up like in because of a hybrid so okay i like to get a lot of different like experiences so i'm pretty well versed and he's from the uk by the way wheat is not legal there at all so he has [ __ ] weed [ __ ] weed in [ __ ] england they don't even have cbd weed there if they do they have to label it as tea because they they don't even allow cbd weed there so this is the first cartridge uh you're going to have to guess if it's delta 8 delta 9 or cbd and also you know just feel what you think about it tastes like ginger um it's interesting like it tastes like a flounder tastes like actual planters i could do your own i feel nothing it just tastes very like not strong but you can tell the flavor no but that just tastes like the ground it tastes like the ground yeah what cannabinoid would you say this is um it tastes a little bit different from like most cards i almost want to guess that's delta nine i really don't know i don't know cbd i'll i'll say this is cbd for now but i might change my mind so okay i don't know i get like a certain like throw hit off of the actual thc and i felt like slightly different but i almost can kind of notice some effects i could just be liking a placebo so this is the next card [ __ ] tastes a lot more like what i would expect a cart to taste like oh there we go right off the bat i noticed it's super clear i'm just looking at it it looks pretty concentrated and i can i feel like i can almost kind of feel it off of that suit and by the way on these parts we're doing a curveball because not only are some some of them delta 8 or delta 9 or cbd we're also some of them are botanical terpenes and some are going to be cannabis derived terpenes so we're going to talk not super vibrant flavor like if there's any terps in this i would guess it's you know minimal what do you think about the taste this is um this is delta eight would you say it's an indica or sativa i'm never gonna tell you that all right yeah whatever i get in the currency but it's just for like the flavor differential not really the effects i never noticed anything different [ __ ] does it hit strong though like i smoked delta 8 before but this is kind of different this is like that tastes very strong in the back of my throat i can feel that [ __ ] just yeah it's definitely there um this is delta a that's delta a i think the last one might have been delta nine because starting to fill that a little bit i'm gonna guess delta h [ __ ] i don't like that one like nothing like i can't taste anything really just tastes like is there a throat hit to it nope no throwhead okay it's fruity yeah i don't know and it hits good like very smooth it just tastes like him like i'm chewing grass taste reminds me a lot of like actual distillate like um delta nine still i like this one it seems to look a little bit like it unless it's just like terps although it does look really thick i don't know it's good though i like that one so would you say cbd delta 8 or delta 9 on this one um i'm pretty stuck in between delta no no no this is delta a not cbd i don't know that was delta nine which one the one that i just did was delta nine the first one cbd because this is way weaker than the last one right i'm not tripping like this has to be delta a i don't know you tell me man i think there might be like some cd in there too you think there might be cbd yeah yeah i think like the last one is more like pure delta eight if i had to guess and then like this one there's like some other additives i don't know it could be completely wrong but i don't know how you know the difference between [Music] [Music] okay hmm is that one clogged too they're all i feel like all cars wow that one hits more it's in the bathroom oh that one is like peaceful this is like taking him right before getting to bed i don't know whether it's thc cbd abc this is like not the strongest thing it's not the strongest like the second weakest in terms of like first impressions right but this is like i could smoke this like a lot you know like i could wake up a lot of bed and take a hit you know i have to prepare myself for this i don't need a big breakfast [Music] this is very casual this is delta r that's delta all right uh yeah or delta yeah delta nine here okay i always get it mixed up then i'd say that's you'd say this is delta nine yeah interesting i don't know i don't know what this is but it's not dealt to mine not about the man no okay so final verdict finally uh which one would you say was the strongest out of all strong ones one two three or four probably two two three two two no i lied three was this one yeah three okay interesting and so and out of the one two three four which one is cbd which one is delta eight which one's delta nine [Music] cbd was the one with the little white cartridge uh delta nine was the second one and the first one was whatever okay cool am i right nope you're completely wrong so out of the four which one do you think had like the best flavor to the worst flavor um i would say the first one had like the most diverse flavor like i could just like pick up like those things going on in it and i think that one would be the seemingly one the very first one i had um and then the second one there wasn't a whole lot of flavor but uh it seemed like there was a high concentration of thc in it whether it's delta eight or delta card and then uh the third one you gave me it was a lot like the first one but it just had like a little bit more flavor okay cool and then what about the and then the fourth one we just talked about that yeah yeah yeah that obviously tastes like almost any card up there interesting all right well hey that's you were actually spot on that everything was right oh okay then i'd say that's you'd say this is delta nine yeah and then this the third the middle one was dr eight and then the last one was the first one yeah okay we got that right i did she got everything right yeah oh my god yes so there you have it hope you enjoyed the video if you

produced prescribed and distributed still are not in place and it could take a year or two for them to be crafted people with certain conditions can begin using it right now but it's still unclear where they can get it legally and the legalization is creating controversy about what should be listed as a medical use advocates say one possibility is to help people get off heroin and other prescription painkillers good idea well as medical reporter Liz bonus found out today it really depends on whom you ask right Liz oh so true as the numbers of those dying from addictions to heroin and other opioids goes up in the tri-state so does the need for treatment to help people stay clean so far in states where advocates have tried to get marijuana listed as a medical use for addiction recovery that idea has been rejected but for those who support this idea it was enough to get some people wondering why not do I'm a recovering alcoholic I'm 17 years sober I also know that I cannot take Carrie Roberts who we spoke to by FaceTime today works for the company that helps people set up legal businesses to supply medical marijuana the group supports the use of it to help people get off heroin and other prescription painkillers she says in places where marijuana has become legal for medical use but dr. Michael Fletcher who runs the integrated chemical addiction Network to get patients off these drugs has other concerns about recommending that marijuana is known to be a gateway drug for for teenagers in particular as for the use of marijuana to stop using opioids and other drugs I can't envision its benefit in that in this arena dr. Fletcher says marijuana should go through the same rigorous medical testing that all prescription medications do before it is used for a medical purpose such as addiction withdrawal what is the potency what is the strength what is the predictability and all the things that are expected on earth at all other medications the rules have changed for marijuana for whatever reason is mainly social political pressures he says it's also important to note that switching to marijuana or any other drug won't cure an addiction that needs emotional medical and spiritual intervention I really feel like this is not a hopeless situation for individuals or our city or the nation care is available therapy does work and the power of prayer works as well you know I think the last couple thinks that doctor Fletcher points out are really what's important you got to look at medical therapy and clear scientific evidence that works with a team approach to treatment camp all right Liz thank you and the team

"xbLVewnt30g": "hey good afternoon um hi I never done this before but I just got a new product down at Mecca naturals and I thought I would try it and maybe bring you guys along whoever you guys are this is CBD alive many balance drops and what these are are just a one to one ratio of CBD and THC so I don't drink I do still go to bars and hang out with friends and dance and I like to go to summer movies ah all of those wonderful things like the typical execu stoner so this is a 1:1 ratio and for every nine drops you get two milligrams of THC and two milligrams of CBD so I wanted to try this because I was hoping that the CBD would help offset some of the little bit of anxiety that sometimes being around people and being people that I have like a large crowd and being a little bit high helps I was hoping that would help with that so I'm going to do is try a little bit of this and first I want to tell you the most amazing thing about the warning is that it is contains medical cannabis for medical use only scheduled and controlled substance yada-yada keep out of reach of children and animals and this product may impair the ability to drive or operate machinery especially me I don't drive when I've had any I'm just I'm just no doesn't work but please use extreme caution my favorite part is that these have been there have been no reports of negative side effects but do allow your body's innate wisdom to lead the way towards your goal of sustained health so I'm gonna do that I'm let my body take me this doesn't stand health so what I have here is I made a little breakfast actually out of my leftover sausage I got some sofas I think you pronounced them from the superior grocery and they you know over me do you make so I'm gonna take some of this not putting into my food but I do have some my generic seltzer water since again I don't drink what can you get it up are you can generally get seltzer water so that was a lime or lemon okay tasty I take some of this out comes in a nice little container again nine drops shake well before using take nine drops subliminally by swishing under tongue for one minute or add drops to beverage so we're gonna do this and wait seventy five minutes it says before giving another dose I'm gonna take something of that good measure take that fish they're all around your grab just gonna first but babies job go my mask that's nasty kitchen in this place so those seem to be blending quite easily I think it's maybe it's got some coconut oil some of the instructions say so it might take a little bit time to blend it may be so glowing well they might be the way to go kind of seems like it congeal a little bit but you know then we're gonna go maybe I should have put the icin after um just a thought hasn't had any taste to it but I'm gonna drink this drink and then probably come back to you because I don't think you want to hang out to see my experience now live probably not much fun I am gonna eat this so again also don't think you want to watch that oh I'll eat wait a little while watch something stupid on TV right now I'm currently obsessed with Agron suckow but that's over some weights just watch it again but anyway all right now today hi there we're back I tried the CBD THC one-to-one ratio mini balance drops made by CBD alive definitely feeling it this guy named really chill so maybe that's helping but I watched about half an episode of British Bake Off so it's been about 30 minutes and it is mellow so I'm feeling okay sorry losing my train of thought a little bit so definitely the THC is kicking in there but it's mostly just a good mellow body high I don't think that this would stop me from going and interacting with people or going to an event I wouldn't drive but again that's just me I don't I don't feel comfortable taking part in picking any kind of cannabis substance and driving it's just not I'm not comfortable with it and I do take take this for anxiety sometimes social anxiety and just to make old episodes of friends funnier and to make Cheetos more tasty but definitely also for the anxiety so it doesn't seem to make sense for me to take it and then drive I'm just gonna be nervous so it's a really nice mellow low dose high again it's two milligrams of THC two milligrams of CBD so it's not going to be a super super high and I'm not an expert at this I just I don't drink and I'm for alternatives for me and I figure there are other people like me that might want something where you can still be a part of the social activity and the conviviality of having a drink and cheersing and you know celebrating but without drinking alcohol or drinking to excess so this is just something for me that I do again I may be rambling a little bit so I think the THC could be working but you know I would recommend if you really wanted a strong hi maybe you know doing some herb or flower first and then having this on you in case you wanted to put a few drops in a drink later just for maintenance or to ease a little bit of that sort of yeah we need meet a whole new group of people and when you're out at a bar or when again Cheetos just aren't tasty enough so thanks for listening um I picked this up with my local dispensary means a couple I go to but the one that has a ton of edibles is called Mecca naturals not getting paid or anything by them so if you're interested you know ask me I can tell you about them or you know your you probably have a Google I think you can google so do that you know do something for yourself you can get a gold star for like personal achievements being resourceful but otherwise I'll have any questions I I'd feel free to answer them I'm gonna probably go get you know another drink and see if it tastes better with something else I don't know I know I'm rambling obviously it's working I'm gonna go because if not I'm just gonna sit here and talk to you cuz like I can't move like there I can they can thanks bye",

hesitated to make this video footage is like a year old and I'm gonna show you I just wanted to you know I decided you know I'm gonna make it you know it's by mistake you never want to give your dog marijuana or anything like that I'll kind of talk and give you guys kind of the story of when I went down and I'll have some footage of the day you know going in and out and then the end of the video I'll have some more footage so basically what had happened was I have an ex-girlfriend okay I absolutely loved her dog like I grew up with dogs my whole life but me and her dog just had like this special bond and I just fell in love with pit bulls ever since I was up people just got pit bulls just cuz their look and they look aggressive and all that stuff but pit bulls are the most affectionate dog absolutely love them so I get a phone call alright I haven't talked to my ex-girlfriend in like 2 or 3 months she calls me she's like hey she calls me cry and she's like oh my god like Avis had a seizure or a stroke or whatever I can't lift her up and put her in her car you have to come over blah so I hop in my Jeep I fly down there like I freakin robbed a bank I'm like super like oh my god like this sucks like I love you know her dog so I get there and you know sure enough she's laying in her dog bed can't really walk is like drooling a little bit and I'm just like damn it like this is it you know I had to put her down or whatever so I pick her up take her to the vet and the vet gets to asking her questions she's like she's like okay how old is your dog has your dog maybe eaten anything or whatever and she's like oh she gets in the trash sometimes but she's never like nothing's ever happened to her and then she's like has she maybe eaten any marijuana whatever and then Desiree kind of pauses and she's just like and then it dawns on her okay her brother was over a brother I'd cancer and you know eating edibles and stuff like that really helps like his appetite and he doesn't have cancer anymore which is awesome but basically they they made like 20 pot cookies and somehow you know it dawned on her that she left the bag and that's what must have happened to Ava she goes oh my god that you know that must've been it she must have had the pot cookie so basically we go from thinking her dog is dying and having a stroke or whatever - oh she just is super high right now on weed and needs to come down off his high so it was actually like a really scary day that turned out best case scenario because you can't really overdose on weed like it's not gonna kill you or anything like that so after all of this desert was actually going on a trip and she was like hey can you watch Ava over the next few days because I don't want to just leave her alone when she's working you know tripping so I was like yeah sure whatever you know awesome she goes to my house and I bring the kennel all along because Ava with some pit bulls no matter like even if you you you try to train him good some of them are just a little bit dog aggressive so Ava happens to be very dog aggressive you know won't hurt a fly as far as humans and stuff like that but does not like other dogs you know and I had my my English taffy shadow but you know I had a kennel you know I could just separate them into rooms or whatever but I thought you know what this might be a perfect opportunity to kind of see if they can become friends because Ava is dog aggressive - random dogs but if she like she has been together with other dogs before in the past and it's worked out but I was kind of scared you know being you know my little puppy I don't want it like Ava freaking biting her biting biting him so I was like okay Ava's were very high right now when you're high the last thing you're thinking about is kicking someone's ass so I was like maybe Ava's super chill and whatever and I can kind of introduce the dog so I was super nervous to introduce shadow and Ava but it worked out perfectly so Ava had no aggression she was just chilling kind of excited and all this stuff so they became actually best friends after this Ava stayed over at my house and they cuddled together they were freaking licking each other's faces and all that stuff so definitely be careful guys if you guys smoke marijuana or anything like that if you guys have edibles laying around the house you definitely don't want your dogs to get into it Ava was high for like two or three days she had trouble walking running just we're actually weird like normally she just licks your face but she was like kind of biting you softly I was just just not acting like yourself so I can't imagine like what it would do 12 pot cookies to a 60 pound dog or a 55 pound dog I can't imagine me taking two of those cookies I'd be tripping out of my mind but yeah guys that's what happened kind of hesitated I'm making this video just because it's kind of a weird topic and some people could take it the wrong way and I know you have to be careful you can't just leave stuff like that laying around but thank God it wasn't like some pharmaceutical medications or anything like that because that would kill your dog even like ibuprofen or whatever but the marijuana happened to be in cookies and dogs [ __ ] you know love cookies so April was high for three days and then after that she was just fine and shadow and Ava have been best friends ever since you know me and my ex went out together or anything like that but sometimes like if she goes on a trip I'll watch her dog if if I go on a trip she'll watch shadow so but yeah I hope you guys like the video give it a thumbs up share this video with your friends and yeah just be careful you don't want this to happen to your dog I know it's kind of like it might be a little bit of a funny thing at the end of the day because it did go from we thought Ava was dying to oh she's just tripping out so for us it was kind of like a really awesome thing that she wasn't having a stroke or anything like that but at the same time be careful you don't want that to happen to your dog it's just you know it puts them through torture for a few days so yeah I hope you guys liked it and I'll see you guys next time you walk inside one thing she too long wanna see her walk come here evil walk to me okay yeah this definitely isn't funny but it's kind of funny it's just so relieved that she didn't have a stroke or a seizure or anything like that so this is like best-case scenario yeah we can link relax now well not relax that's better she's taking extra extra extra my neck come on longest pee ever just come oh my god she's so stoned look at her hey left how are you peeing again this Danish cheesy so weird come on Yvette come on you're just running everywhere come on what are you doing David Oh with that noise that noise tripping out so I found the bag I think this was the cookie bag I mean it looks exactly like it so this was in the dirt and it's been raining so it looks all gross now but she ate the cookies dude a dozen pot cookies a pothead you poor thing baby okay [Music]", "mTsoEEmz7Rk": "hey guys today we're gonna talk to you about rosin not only are we gonna tell you what rosin is but we're gonna show you how to do it the right way so throw away those hair straighteners and let's get right into it rosin is a concentrate extracted from the cannabis plant using nothing more than heat and pressure the result a translucent sappy and sometimes shattered like product that is potent and flavorful enough to rival any of your favourite BHO products but what is the difference between rosin and other concentrates out there one word of solvents most concentrate extraction methods require the use of a solvent such as butane propane for co2 rosin however does not but how does the simplicity of heat and pressure transform cannabis into such an overwhelmingly great product the accumulation of trichomes trichomes are those small shiny bubbles that appear on marijuana believe it or not those microscopic bulbs actually contain most of the cannabis plants cannabinoids which provide most of the sense flavours and effects but can anyone easily make rosin themselves yes yes you can and will tell you how before you get started you will need a couple things a nug Smasher fresh flower micron extraction bags parchment paper and a dab tool grab everything you need aside from the canvas of course in a bundle at knucks master comm so now you're good to go let's jump straight into one very important factor starting product you may ask which nuts master gives the best results well the answer is all of them you get back what you put in it's as simple as that fire in fire out that is the number one most popular saying in the world of rosin because your extract will only be as good as your starting product if you put garbage into your oven at home it's not going to taste very good now how about a pizza it's gonna be the best thing you've ever tasted same goes for rosin if you put extremely potent trichome coated flowers into a nut Smasher mini well you're gonna get back some amazing rosin if

into this video please turn off any distractions turn off your phone and make sure to click the notification Bell and subscribe if you do want to see any more videos about lucid dreaming so lucid dreaming we know that lucid dreaming is the ability to control your dreams okay and all right so lucid dream is the ability to control your dreams what happens when you smoke cannabis weed or marijuana how if you want to say oh now this is a bit of a controversial video because a lot of people claim that it helps their dreams and it does to an extent and I'm gonna get onto that in a minute all right now with its tripod today all right for the most part it doesn't help your dreams it actually makes your dreams worse and in fact it sort of lowers your REM sleep so cannabis is a REM suppressant this means that if you if you smoke it or ingest it or whatever through edibles or whatever people are doing these days when you ingest the substance the active ingredients will suppress your REM sleep meaning you'll get less REM sleep which is rapid eye movement sleep in any given night what that means for you in practical terms is less dreams or no dreams and much less chance for being lucid because you need to have a dream in order to be lucid you need to have REM sleep in order to have a lucid dream so so short-term you smoke the weed it stops you having dreams or the very least it massively damages your chances of having dreams and having a lucid dream so that's one problem however the solution to this if you're gonna keep smoking weed and if you have to keep taking it for maybe medical reasons or you know if you want to or whatever obviously check with the laws where you live I don't know it might be legal and might not be you need to be aware of the REM rebound effect so what happens when you suppress your REM sleep where your body says okay I'm not getting the REM sleep I need because the body needs the REM sleep so it starts to think of ways to get that debt back it's like a bank if you borrow some money from a bank you can take some money short term but then eventually they're gonna want that money back with with interest right they're gonna want that money back plus a bit more your body's the same so with a sleep debt or with a REM sleep debt you suppress the REM sleep in the first part of your experience right so you smoke weed suppresses your REM sleep for a day or more but then when you stop smoking what when you come off it okay even if you just take a few days break your body will suddenly think okay the REM suppressant is gone I need to get back this REM sleep you know I have this debt I need to get back this REM sleep that I've lost so it just gives you longer REM periods of sleep so you go off the Cannabis you get this massive surge of REM sleep which is really deep like dreaming territory right you can have intense lucid dreams in this been in this period of sleep and that's where the myth that weed helps lucid dreaming comes from because when people smoke weed and then stop smoking weed or take a few days off they get the rim rebound effect which is where the body gives you this massive long period of REM sleep which are very likely to have lucid dreams in them it's not the weed affecting your dreams directly it's your body responding and claiming back your REM sleep that the weed has stopped you having now this is okay but long-term it has some implications that could be damaging to your sleep and your mental well-being so it's worth you know doing your own research on this stuff I'm sure you have already if you're taking cannabis but do your own research and make sure you know the risks and the pros and cons so it gives you REM rebound now in your REM rebound you can have intense lucid dreams for a long time like it feels like a long time when you have them but I wouldn't advise doing this all the time you know because it can have implications long-term it's not good it's pretty much the connection between cannabis and lucid dreaming it can give you REM rebound but it's not good long-term thanks for watching guys this video and this channel was supported by my patreon

as well and if you prefer audio podcasts you can find all of these interviews virtually anywhere check out cannabis update CA for more details welcome to the podcast spots thank you beer start off by telling us who you are a little bit about yourself yeah I'm Scott Riefler 62 years old we reside in Olympia Washington I have been a scientist my entire life specifically a material scientist I have participated in a couple of very rewarding careers my first careers in aerospace materials did polymeric development for adhesives and composites so on the lighter side when you fly in a plane the glue we developed the glue I helped prepare holds that airplane together so did that for about 20 years actually there's a there's a bit of detail there I was able I had the great pleasure of working at fringe Technology very high temperature materials low observables very early in my career I was taught that actually most things are achievable when somebody says something can't be done that's a marker for you should go out and do it after after spending 20 years in the aerospace industry I moved over to the food industry and that was primarily due to relocations associated with aircraft we had a daughter was starting to get up an age meaning you know eight or nine and we wanted to stop moving around so I changed industries enjoy the food industry at an ingredient company where we produced marketed and sold micro ingredients for food texturizers gelling agents those kinds of things did that for about 20 years with great success and was actually heading towards retirement and ran into a friend of a friend at a concert asked what they were out to so they had just left just left Microsoft had submitted for and were awarded one of the cannabis licenses in Washington State and being a lifelong cannabis user I asked him some probing questions and quickly got to the point where well have you ever thought about making beverages and got this long laundry list of why you can't clip THC into a beverage and as I said before when somebody tells me you can't do something that's a marker for you should figure out how to do it so I started working on that and over the course of about a year's period we developed water-soluble techni water-soluble technology platform for cannabinoids oil for mass which are particularly difficult to work with and then we've expanded that to include basically all essential oils okay I'm just not be there for seconds I'm sorry I'm gonna stop you there for a second this is with the company that you're currently with source technologies I've been reading online because I had heard many times in the past that CBD and cannabinoids are not technically water-soluble they're water compatible is there a difference yeah that's a good question oils are typically not water soluble so what we're doing is converting them to a format that makes them very war compatible and on a macro scale they behave like they're water soluble on a micro scale what we're talking about is emulsion technology where we enrolled the oil at a at a very small particle size level in rolling with a surfactant so that it behaves as if it's compatible with water so this isn't drinks in particular anything that's water-based is there a difference between doing that with that type of technology and something that is truly water soluble in terms of shelf life in terms of I guess developing a product and potency and all these different things yeah and and try to keep this you know at a level where it's very easily understood yeah but you are definitely talking about some of the finer points so when you look at the application level let's go there first there are some real challenges in bringing cannabinoids into food they range from the the more basic things like the sensory cannabinoids are very bitter often have an earthy or weedy taste that is not desirable in in food platforms there's a uniformity or homogeneity issue when you put when you put THC in a bearer is you want the first and the last to contain exactly the same amount of THC so that that would also be considered a challenge and then there's the whole way your body interfaces with the oil or the THC or CBD itself and you'll hear the term bioavailability tossed around pretty openly and freely but what it really boils down to is specifically with THC the edible space has this historic reputation of you know I'm going to eat this brownie or I'm gonna eat this cookie or drink this drink I don't know if I'm gonna feel it in 15 minutes or two hours I don't know what the intensity is gonna be so I'll use that term bioavailability what we wanted to do was develop a platform that be edible had as close to a combustion experience as possible meaning very predictable onset very short term onset and then a half-life of an experience meaning a predictable how long is this gonna stay with me which again from his story standpoint the brownies and cookies when you would eat quote-unquote your mother's brownie you didn't know when you were gonna get liftoff and typically the duration would last the whole day into the evening and maybe even to the next step quite often I'll smile a little bit when I was younger in college that's exactly what I was looking for not so much anymore if I drink a beverage I kind of want to know in advance what I'm what I'm what I'm gonna experience and essentially when I can drive a car again so managing that experience so what we've done is we've embodied all these elements into our platform specifically so the cannabinoids can be viewed as ingredients add them to the food platform you're not going to change the flavor you're not going to change the sensory experience and you know what let's get back to a platform of combustion or combustion like I should feel the onset in 15 or 20 minutes which I recognize is longer than a combustion but for an animal it's actually quite rapid and you know what I want to know that for about an hour hour and a half I'm gonna have this experience and then it's gonna flush out of my system right can you clarify source technologies then and just for anybody who wants you to listening it's SOR s EE technologies are you guys developing this Rd and then selling it to food manufacturers or are you creating your own products or combination of both it is a combination of both we have an arm a sister company that's called a green medlabs and that is an active license in the Washington State air area where we have a series of beverages fundamentally beverages that we sell into the marketplace they do quite well I think we have three out of the top four I think we have one slots one two and four in state of Washington but additionally source technologies and Fremont Health and Wellness which is another one of our sister companies we will convert CBD or cannabinoids sans TAC because of state-by-state legal requirements and present it as a liquid emulsion for incorporation as an ingredient in the TAC space we do it state-by-state on the license basis to work both with people who are producing foods that have their own source of cannabinoids and also we do a lot of work with extractors that want to offer their their extracted materials in water compatible formats okay I was fishing around your website a little bit and reading your bio and one of the things that you had said was that I'll read it here and make sure I get it right I would like to see CBD adapt ubiquitous form such as powder which can be added or sprinkled on to any food can you elaborate on that yeah yes that's simply saying that our initial emulsion work was all in liquid form at something that you would add as a liquid additionally we can we have in fact executed and we have dehydrated that liquid back to a powder form that at the moment it sees water the emulsion reforms so the CBD now can be presented for a whole range of dry platforms if you will on reconstituted beverages or spices or literally a format that can that can be sprinkled onto anything and where I got that idea it's not unique to me but if you go to South America Brazil for example and go to a little deli or restaurant on every table there'll be a little jar of a ground root which is a fiber source and people sprinkle it on their food routinely because it is viewed as a health benefit and of course CBD is developing that reputation or attributes in our space ok well let's talk about CBD a little bit in the US I think it's a bit more of a wild west scenario there than in candidates but more controlled where do you draw the line between CBD for medical use and CBD for recreational use yeah and for me that's a very clear line as I said I've got a background in the food space and we have these this wonderful regulatory body in the United States called the Food and Drug Administration and they're there one of their main charters is to keep the food supply safe as well as the pharmaceutical space safe and as you might imagine there's a fair amount of regulatory guidance available from FDA as well as there are a lot of requirements necessary to validate a material is safe to enter the food supply or if you're making structure-function claims that they're supported with clinical data and this is this is an interesting world for CBD right now because of course there is an approved drug out there based on CBD it's for a blessed child epilepsy it's pretty well known and it's relative to what we would see on what I call the recreational space considerably higher dosages our our parent I believe the sustaining dose in the epilepsy world is about 2.5 grams per day on the recreational space is the same thing as saying 2500 milligrams of CBD per day yeah in what I referred to as the recreational space CBD does not yet have regulatory status with FDA it's not an approved food ingredient if you add it to foods it's considered adulteration because it's not gonna prove degree D n't for the food space with this said FDA is very active in working with industry to get appropriate regulatory platforms in place and the FDA has provided great guidance they've indicated what their policing for in this interim space if you will and specifically what they have said is structure-function claims do not imply human benefit without clinical data to support that Yeah right what you see in that what you see in them what I call recreational space is relatively low dose versus the medical space medical space is 2,500 milligrams per day sustaining dosage roughly whereas in the recreational space typical dosages or content of beverages or food range anywhere from a few milligrams to maybe 10 to 20 or 40 milligrams per material surrounding this and I'll just put this out there there is actually a lot of historic use data for ham extracts outside of the United States teas this kinds of things primarily in Asia in India which shows a long history of use of relatively low levels and ultimately this use data is going to be used to support the contention that this is safe and appropriate for the food space but it needs to be accompanied by a pretty good slug of talks a lot pathological data specifically liver impact so on and so forth and that's that work is going on now we're generating that data he'll support FDA's position bringing it into the food space let's talk about regulations in the US and I'll stick with CBD for a little bit and I've asked this to a couple of other people have been reviewed but um apparently you can go into gas stations you go anywhere in many states and buy a wide range of consumer products that contain allegedly contains CBD is this kind of a losing game for the FDA at this point is it are the I guess manufacturers getting ahead of the ability to regulate what are the problems you guys have in the u.s. right now well one is acceptance and in terms of the various channels to market I'll start out by saying no I don't think it's a losing game for FDA if and and I'm gonna be I'm a hawk on this FDA has a very clear and substantial responsibility the first time a consumer picks something out at one of these gas stations and ends up in the hospital because it's made them sick because of an not because the product itself isn't good but there's been an unintended consequence because of interactions with other things the person's consumed it maybe even their other pharmaceuticals prescription drugs the amount of work required to bring something safely into the food supply is substantial interactions for example have to be considered and it's almost endless so what you're seeing is what I call the gray zone and we have lots of gray zones in our culture or a miracle in our country where we have a regulatory guidance that says one thing and then we have human behavior that is a bit different than what the guidance provides and that's what you're seeing happen people people believe they're safe so they're gonna go out and do it and then what happens is we have so you know when I call rationale selective enforcement where knowing minds look at the situation and say you know there is not an obvious substantial danger here so here's how we're going to handle this until data is available and I don't mean to be speaking for FDA but in my mind that's clearly what's happening right now and the data will catch up and what will happen the people are at risk are the folks that are viewing this is the Wild West and a short term gold rush if you will that aren't doing the real work aren't doing the real science and when regulatory does catch up and it will they won't have the database or the experience to participate going forward they're ramjet coming back out seems like the u.s. is doing it the exact opposite way as in Canada like it's actually much harder to get CBD products legally here in Canada than I think it is in the US we're a more horse before the cart you guys are cart before the horse maybe I know that this is a question you'd have to speculate on the answer because maybe it's a bit anecdotal but is it a possibility that people are over consuming CBD already the scientist to me say is the possibility exists we'll certainly it exists but that was a big question we'll break that down into a couple of answers first of all regulatory harmony around the globe would be wonderful each country if you will or each entity has their own regulatory body that's similar to the FDA and these organizations obviously interface with each other but there are different cultural philosophies I'm in the United States we actually have it may not seem like it but we actually have a posture of presumed safety the material is considered safe unless data is generated to show it it is not safe simply state it Canada on the other hand and and much of Europe is the opposite it's a it's an approach of presumed caution if you're gonna bring something into the food supply you must prove it safe under a variety of conditions and interactions before it would be considered appropriate so it's not surprising to see different different countries have different approaches and Canada's done something different and I think is showing great leadership they view CBD this is my understanding CBD V is viewed as the same way THC is viewed it's a holistic approach to the plan what's in the plant so on and so forth in the United States because marijuana as a plant but here on on our drug list if you will yeah and a carve-out has been made for CBD via hemp and hannah has got a very specific standard of identity that requires that in the leaf mass there be no more than 0.3 percent by weight THC present and while we don't have guidance that further extraction levels and concentrations with to the amount of THC that's allowed the industry has adopted a position of caution and said well if the plant matter you're only allowed to have a point 3 percent THC we're gonna say the same thing is true for extracted materials any form of the hemp backstrap shall not exceed 0.3 percent THC because that's the intent of the regulation in the farm bill it's clear that they want to speak to providing an avenue for CBD but they want an asand of the psychotropic effects provided by THC which is still very heavily regulated in the US and that gives back to again regulatory is catching up because the federal government has said we recognize on a state level there's a drive for making THC legal it's illegal at the federal level but we are not going to enforce that over states that have a program in place and that you know are doing I don't want to say the right things but keeping it out keeping it away from children keeping dosages level controlled so I'm not making structure-function claims so on and so forth talking about consumer packaged goods when it comes to food that has CBD or THC particular what kind of precautions our testing is being done in addition to what would normally be done with food products and and speak maybe speak to source technology when you answer that - so let's just assume that the food product design controlled its manufacture or what's known as good general manufacturing processes you'll hear the term GMP quite often in that regard that's what that stands for that the food is got the right preservatives in it the shelf-life is correct the label declaration is correct in your information is great you have all that stuff unless just assume all that's correct now I start talking about the cannabinoid now we are talking about what our technology addresses and blurs the easy easy stuff the not easy to achieve but a lower-level sensory I'm an old guy I have eaten brownies or cookies funny slides from the old days they taste terrible they're greedy they're granular it smells like weed it's just not a pleasant experience so we want to flip that if you're going to eat a food that has CBD or a cannabinoid in it we want it to be able to stand on a stone two feet in terms of enjoyment taste good so we wanted to manage and isolate the negative sensory which is embodied in our encapsulation approach to our emulsion the next bit is uniformity anybody that's ever made salad dressing at home you shake it and within about three or four seconds all the oil is rising to the top as quickly as it can get there and or another example perhaps closer to home if again you're my vintage everybody remembers a beverage called you go and kharece rimsky on TV telling everybody before you drink this stuff you shake it and the reason you shake it is the fasts better in there to make it silky smooth and rich they tend to float to the top and they appear as like a white layer so you shake it to get it in we don't want that in the ending cannabinoid arena we want the oils uniformly dispersed and to be stable a good example would be flavors and a soda pop the flavors are typically oils and you don't realize it but often they're an emulsion and they are dispersed and done in a manner that keeps them uniformly dispersed so we we have embodied that type of an approach into our emulsion and there's a lot of technology that goes behind that and a lot of specifics if you put an emulsion and beverage that is just water the water has a specific density speech how quickly the oils will rise or sink the now if I put a bunch of sugar in that beverage now the density of the fluid has changed so therefore I have to adjust my emulsion to make sure that I've got that kind of long-term stability present and then second to last is how does it interface with my body we've all heard a lot of anecdotal stories about how the body doesn't really like to process oils if I throw it into my stomach my gosh it could take two hours before I feel it so we wanted to do is deliver in a format that the body will readily accept that's probably the easiest way to say it we've actually done some pharmacokinetics studies you'll hear the term PK studies and it stands for Pharma kinetics the rate at which the material is absorbed into the body so we've done some testing where we look for CBD detection in the blood and in our first series of tests and we're very pleased by this we found it we found the presence of CBD in the blood within five minutes of ingestion which is pretty damn quick right it approaches it approaches that of combustion now to get the levels where you're actually gonna start feeling something it's going to take a little bit longer than that but one of the reasons we were so pleased as we did our first blood draw five minutes and was already there so in our next series of tests we're gonna be doing blood draws continuously from 30 seconds on and we believe we're gonna see presence earlier than five minutes and as a control for that we actually used a format that was essentially the same as the as a epilepsy drug at the dialects and that material didn't show up in the blood until about 15 or 20 minutes after ingestion and it has everything to do about the the format in which it's presented and lastly of course we need to make this something that can be easily incorporated into existing manufacturing lines which is often forgotten a lot of people gets their get their starting in the either CBD or THC or cannabis arena in their kitchens or in their garage where you're basically doing everything by hand well that's great and now I want to go on I want to go on you're factoring line that's filling cans or bottles of 20,000 cans an hour we have to be able to drop into existing manufacturing lines so a liquid format that's easily blended or a dry powder that can be dry or blended in is really the appropriate answers okay and this might be self explanatory but um are you guys at a point now with food products that have CBD in them that they you can create something that has the same shelf life as something that does not or you were talking about mixing and that sort of thing before is it safe to say now that beverage is maybe chocolates or anything else with THC CBD in it using perhaps your technology can it sit on the shelf for the same amount of time as an equivalent product that does not have CBD or tea infused into it that a great question and I'm gonna give several layers of answer Jen and a lot of it has to do with the material that's going into at the extreme size something like spam I don't even think has an expiration date and I don't mean that to be funny it's a very stable food product all ingredients are not stable for error yeah and the other for the other end of the spectrum you have something like milk that requires refrigerated storage and even with refrigerated storage you know you've got about a month shelf life so you've got to keep things in context cannabinoids themselves deteriorate slowly with time THC much more quickly than CBD does and there's a difference when you start talking food platforms if you're talking something like a vape cartridge I mean what I mean is a distillate or an extract of THC where it's presented in bulk form meaning relatively little surface area per volume the shelf life is actually quite good and the deterioration loss of THC assay is a very slow proposition when you go into the food environment you're introducing water and cannabinoids are somewhat stable in the presence of water but we're talking about very small particles now where the surface area versus volume is quite high so things like oxidation happen more quickly so the acid stability which is a which a very important marker definitely will have some sort of a shelf life associated with it and there are many factors the rate of deterioration is a function of temperature a beverage is going to have a longer a say stability at room temperature than it is a 140 degrees for example and are leading more stable at a refrigerated condition for our beverages we find the room temperature storage we get good shelf life certainly up to the six-month area beyond that again it's going to be somewhat a function of storage so the message here is in and I've skipped a little bit of step but the in under no case is the cannabinoid deteriorating into something that is hazardous that's gonna make you ill or you're gonna get a bad effect what the worst will happen is the effect will be diminished so spoilage isn't really a concern here that's gonna be driven by the food platform itself if that makes sense CBD tends to be much more stable than THC in terms of oxidative stability and deterioration but then there's something out and I'll throw it out there and then it is appropriate you also have to be concerned with interaction with packaging materials themselves in the beverage arena glass and PE tea are essentially inert to these materials cans though have linings in them and it's not unique to cannabinoids but the linings interact with materials and absorb things like THC or CBD or flavors so right now the industry is sorting out you know if I put this much CBD in the can I want to make sure it all stays in the liquid or if I if I'm gonna put a label claim of X amount of CBD on my can how much do I have to put into it to account for what's going to be absorbed into the liner because it's what the consumer gets what's important and this gets us right back to FDA and their role in protecting the consumer for label clamps if the label says it has this in it you you damn well better find it in there or the FDA is gonna have something to say to you right that's right it's it's not as easy as one would think and when you when you pull the cover back there's typically a lot of detail that has to be sorted and we were talking earlier about you know you go to the gas station and you buy something and no dig about people that use gas stations as their channel to market but branded companies are concerned with their reputation the longevity of the brand itself and consumers are testing things so that's going to be another sift if you will or as industry consolidates so those that have a good product good labeling good label matching those are the those are the companies that are gonna survive so should someone watching this video want to go and check a product that's being made by source technologies what can they look for right now on the marketplace mostly beverages the companies because we are fundamentally an ingredient supplier so I'll speak to CBD first on a national or even global basis many of the companies we work with asked that we not name drop them because they see use of our ingredient as a competitive advantage but if you wanted to see our technology at work I'd say the national brands that are out there beverages that contain CBD a good percentage of them have our material inside some companies like to co-brand and you'll see powered by source on the label and you can get and you can look for that on the THC side um if you want to see our product at work come to Washington go to the dispensary buy a happy Apple or buy a product call major happy apple is apple juice dosed and lightly carbonated and it's a range of anywhere between 5 and 100 milligrams of THC in a bottle you pick I tend to pick the smaller ones also the brand is introducing varying levels of CBD as well because our state regulations now allow that the other lis branding product is major it's actually the one that not our happy apple number one slot two number two major is a value drink and I I do grin a little bit when I say some of these things it's seven ounces in a bottle anywhere between five and 100 milligrams per bottle available in a variety of flavors but grapefruit and kiwi watermelon are absolutely killing it and we have recently launched a flavor known as unicorn tears that's also just just absolutely killing it and you'll get it you'll get a sense and not not to not to promote it so much but major went from zero to first in class in sixty days give you an idea of how well it's accepted by the community Wow well next time I'm in the US I suppose I'll have to check it out as you probably know the most potent THC infused edible product you can buy on the legal market here in Canada is 10 milligrams and for me that's enough actually a hundred but I will say that we have a partner or company that is licensed our technology for Canada a company by the name of balance they're one of the leading extractors in Canada and they are doing a tremendous amount of work in applications engineering so that they can white label products for a variety of the companies in the Canadian market so if you don't already have access to it you will you will very shortly and if you have time for this it's worth walking through ten milligrams when you eat it I consider that to be a pretty substantial dose yeah and you'll hear people all the time say oh we have this waterborne technology or water soluble technology that enhances the mic the bioavailability by 10x or by eight X and what typically isn't being done is they're not finishing the sentence a join a marijuana cigarette has roughly a gram of matter in it right a roughly a gram of plant matter and most of the most of the marijuana grown today is about 20% THC content so one gram 20% one grams a thousand milligrams that mean that Joey has about 200 milligrams of THC in it then you know you can smoke a joint by yourself or pass it around but that's a lot of THC people don't realize a tremendous amount is lost to smoke it just doesn't get into your body yeah so when people say the bioavailability is enhanced by ten times well I'll think about it a joints got 200 milligrams in it one tenth of that is twenty milligrams which is still a substantial dose if you're eating it right yeah so when people are bragging about their bioavailability associated with their product form it's like well yeah you're kind of stating the obvious aren't you the difference being if I can get it so that it all gets into my body uniformly I'm getting the benefit of that ten or twenty milligrams right away as if I was combusting it but if it drifts into my system slowly without the advantages of these delivery technologies now I've got something that's going to last eight ten twelve twenty hours of course the intensity isn't going to be the same yeah and sometimes too long for that thanks for doing this Scott I appreciate it I learned a lot from you today and of course about the source technologies happy to some good experience for me as I said this is my first podcast it's been enjoyable thanks for having us thanks for listening to the cannabis update podcast we do our very best to be as accurate as possible but take no responsibility for inaccurate details and facts if something interests you we're glad to have brought it to your attention but please take the time to research the details for yourself", "QfcCSh7-Y44": "[Music]", "xdnX3WBp-uo": "we are pro cannabis media all right here we go welcome back to cannabis chat for a monday afternoon i'm jimmy young in the pro cannabis media studio as we always are on mondays joined by the ceo of flowerandtonic.com her name is alyssa merrill she's my go-to person whenever i need to talk to somebody intelligent okay because lord knows we are talking to so many doctors and scientists so i admit my liberal arts education history major tufts university only takes me so far so now we want to welcome in ruth fisher a phd of course because you know after all we only talked to doctors or phds on this show and uh ruth fisher thank you so much for joining us this afternoon oh it's my pleasure thank you for having me so uh you've got a book out called the medical cannabis primer it's available on amazon what first of all what uh is in that book and what kind of prompted you to decide to write a book about this well you know i have to admit i'm a traditionalist and i was very much caught up in the whole stigma of this is your brain this is your brain on drugs and i i smoked pot before and and decided wasn't really my thing and was a little judgmental about it and other people using it um i've done a lot of work in healthcare and i've always i've spent a lot of time doing research in the healthcare industry and early on i had heard about canvas being used for medical purposes especially during say the aids crisis when it started gaining more momentum and i really to be honest i just kind of dismissed it and didn't even really think about it so fast forward now 20 25 years my brother about five years ago now was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and he gets tremendous amounts of neuropathic pain and he's been on every drug there is and they they're just the side effects are horrible and he was getting a little bit of relief but not nearly enough and at one point one of his neurologists said um you know i think maybe you could benefit from medical cannabis but i can't give you any guidance right and so i want to give that doctor credit for even mentioning that in any kind of a uh patient doctor that that kind of puts them out there a little bit was this in california by any chance yes it was yeah there are obviously more enlightened doctors i believe in california i just think they are i mean probably all my friends at mjh and beth israel and boston want to hate kill me right now it's a different environment it's completely different environment there as well do do you think we'll get to the point where people will look at it not as a last resort but as a immediate option when diagnosed with something like ms this is i i have a good friend who's trying to advocate exactly for that she uses cannabis for tbi and she said you know it shouldn't be a last resort and there's so many people in cannabis who are advocating for it who have gone through the traditional health care system and have been completely let down and disappointed by the system and somehow found cannabis on their own and it's literally saved their lives there are so many people whose lives have been given back to them by cannabis and they're all saying why why is this the last resort why is this something i had to find on my own it really it really needs to be a first line of defense but coming at it from your your background is an economic and economist correct economist yes oh just kidding i was trying to be all fancy and pronunciate like you guys um so you're coming at it from such a different perspective and again like doing the research um you know could you speak a little bit more to that and then kind of um how then you came to your recommendations based you know in the book because i think we're going to be at a place now where people are going to all have different opinions so how do we know like where to go i think you i'm suggesting that you are a great person to go to but i mean for for other people um it's it's challenging to it really is and and to be honest so so my brother at some point um he started using cannabis and he was getting some good results but he realized he probably wasn't getting nearly the benefits that he could if he knew how to use it better so at some point he called me in for help because i spent a lot of time doing medical research and so at that point i said you know what i don't care about what i might believe about this or you know not believe i'm you know he says it's working that's all i care let's see if we can you know help him better so at that point i dove in and started reading and i'll tell you um i'm not a medical doctor but i've been heavily involved in medical research i've worked on aids i've worked on diabetes and and a lot of different indications and i nearly fell off my chair when i learned about the endocannabinoid system and i i found it so hard to believe that um there was this major i mean it's not some minor thing this major system that essentially controls everything else in our bodies and so few people are aware of it and and i was totally floored in at that point i it wasn't even at that point as a little bit before when it was gaining credibility but with that my understanding of the endocannabinoid system that was a total game changer and it completely legitimized for me um the use of cannabis for you know we're just at the beginning it's gonna they're gonna find that it's gonna be beneficial for so many different conditions out there um but i will admit it took me a long time now i'm an experienced researcher and what i what i do is i see things from a systems perspective and when i enter a new industry and for me this is a new industry or a new market what i do is try and understand what the big pieces are and how they fit together and what are the interrelationships of everything and i've done this for every type of industry there is and so i'm reading about cannabis and i i couldn't figure it out there's so much information out there and it's coming at you so piecemeal and trying to figure out kind of how it all fits together and what's the big picture and i was so one of the things that was causing me problems for example is on one hand i'm i'm going through the the the medical journals on cannabis and there are literally tens of thousands of medical journals on cannabis and while there are many saying that it's harmful there are plenty saying that it's effective and there are pre-clinical studies and clinical studies saying it's effective yet whenever you talk to a doctor who isn't aware of cannabis or hasn't you know come to a realization that it's a good thing they say well there's no there's no medical evidence and so you know i keep saying well there's no there's no evidence that it's safe and effective and on the other hand there's literally thousands of journal articles and i sat with this for a long time before it was kind of cleared up that oh okay so this is kind of when the pieces started falling into place you have you have these different perspectives out there and they're all looking for kind of different pieces of the picture in order to consult about the benefits of cannabis the traditional health care system when they say there's no medical benefits what they're saying is it's not fda approved and or there's no random control trials the reason there's no random control trials is because it's very expensive to run them and mostly those are done by companies seeking to get fda approval and so you know when they say no medical evidence they're talking about a very specific thing that it's kind of a chicken and egg well people in cannabis if they're trying to research cannabis generally if you're doing the whole plant which is the way that i believe to approach it the whole plan approach it's very difficult to patent and if you can't patent it then you can't generate the money to pay for the clinical trials right so it's like saying tomatoes are good for you okay so who's gonna prove it papa gino's domino like if you want to try to say that tomato sauce and tomatoes is good for you like no one right is that the dumbest down a little bit um sometimes for even ourselves that's how i look at it um there's no random control trials but there's there's literally billions of case studies right it's anecdotal but there's billions of anecdotes but so anyway so as i was going through all this and and i i just kept reading and reading and reading and finally some of the stuff started to dawn on me and i was able to put it together um at some point my brother who's an engineer he came up with an idea for technology uh to help people find cannabis better so my job for that would would be doing research to try and kind of figure out some of these connections so at that point i really started the research and after putting quite a bit of time into it i i put together my puzzle and so i was able to at least understand how the pieces worked and um especially because i had so much trouble i think and uh was able to finally do this my brother at some point said you know we we have this information and you put it together in such an amazing way i think we really need to make it available to other people so let's compile it into a book and aside from being an engineer he's also a photographer and he does publishing and layout and design so he took my text which was kind of i thought kind of boring maybe i tried to to make it good and he put it into amazing formats um a lot of really beautiful charts and uh diagrams and photos so that's kind of the story of the book yeah i don't print out a lot but i loved she had a chart just a little can you see that it was just it's cute it looks cute and it but more importantly it very well defines um you know because we were in a earlier conversation we were just saying and i know that this must frustrate you when you say cannabis is good for adhd it's no not it's you know you really need to narrow it down to disease state or or condition um to really have the best effect so that's really what you're able to do like looking at endocrine disorders uh spasms ptsd and what type of combinations work best together i mean this this is this is awesome information it's uh available on a poster and it's in your book correct yes it is great how are we ever going to share and educate the public i mean lord knows if we could print 150 million of those books and distribute them to all the voters it would be a great thing i i'm sure you'd be very happy about that as well but one of my biggest frustrations as a media or a former media person is the lack of public service information that traditional media will share with the public now we're sitting here in a pro-cannabis environment we're talking about all the benefits and the research behind some of the science that has led this green wave but there's still i don't want to call it censorship but it's censorship at the social media level and the traditional media level won't even allow you to to run a psa like acres holdings tried to do telling three amazing stories about how cannabis saved people's lives i get so frustrated by it as someone you're in california you're in the bay area are there public service announcements about any of the benefits of this plant anywhere in media no no i think it's going to need to we we're going to need to wait until it's rescheduled yep okay hopefully that won't happen that won't be so long right hopefully yes yes i mean i don't think it's going to happen during the lame duck let's just say but perhaps in the first six months of 2021 wouldn't it be nice if this vaccine works and everything moves along swimmingly at the federal level we're able to get it out to people and then people are then becoming more and more enlightened about the benefits of cannabis during the same time and perhaps a administrative phone call might happen to the department of justice from the president-elect who says get that cannabis stuff off schedule one i don't think it will be that blatant but i do think that we're going to move in that direction of some kind it's going to be fascinating to watch what happens at the federal level because i'm big on not only should they deschedule it but they've got to keep researching it they've got to keep people like yourself working on finding out exactly what each cannabinoid does to the endocannabinoid system in all of us because there seems that there's so many benefits to so many people i absolutely agree and especially after this year 2020 i think we all deserve a break well you know it did get ruled essential at least the medicinal side of things for cannabis and that was a huge step of acceptance uh during this pandemic and of course we've all seen what happens to the human element when you have time on your hands and nothing to do you know the liquor sales and beer sales went up as did the cannabis sales because because we're human right now i do know i i think this is kind of interesting that there's a lot of people out there trying to um to obviously have certification systems done but the big push is to get cannabis uh reimbursed by health care providers and once that happens you're going to see a flood of activity now if you look at there's plenty of studies out there that show that when cannabis is legalized you get a massive drop in pharmaceutical use people stop using or either use less of their other pharmaceuticals or switch altogether and there's plenty of evidence to show that for example cannabis and opioids are complementary so you can radically radically reduce your use of opioids so maybe it has some benefit by using a much lower dose you're going to obviously get you're going to reduce the potential for bad side effects but when you have the you have these drops in other medication use and so obviously from the the the provider from the the health insurance companies and from the patients and doctors perspective the cost of treating medical conditions will will definitely go down the problem is is this is you know counter to the pharmaceutical industry's interests and so you get a lot of backlash from them and so it's it's going to be a power struggle there i think but if and as i said i know a lot of people working on trying to get the health care reimbursement done um if and when that happens i think there's going to be a radical flood of activity i believe now there's some reimbursement already happening for the workmen's comp patients um you know little pockets in certain states i don't know um exactly the circumstances but yes i think we're closer than people think but at the same time what products though like are they gonna do you think it'll be products that are have an indication for a pharmaceutical company or like this is where i i get excited about it but then i'm like thinking about the logistics and i'm like is it gonna because i actually in in massachusetts there's a psychiatric hospital near me that has uh see like a cbd formulary product and that's exciting to me because yeah you and i talked about this briefly like the worst thing is when you take someone um you know from a perspective where they don't believe in this and then like oh my gosh there's something here and then you go try a product so many are bad and there are so many that are pushed you know the top ones on the market are not the ones i would recommend so it's like it yeah it's certainly a challenge um i hadn't even thought out to the patients like who are going to require such a higher dose that they won't be able to afford it so yeah i guess i'm trying to figure out where it'll go and i my guess is it'll be a little everywhere it'll be available prescription and then over-the-counter through functional medicine doctors that like well you know i love your thoughts as in that's that's a really great question i've spent a lot of time thinking about that i think there's definitely going to be a pharma route so the doctors will prescribe it and you go to the traditional pharmacy and get it there like epidialex or sativex i think that we're going to continue to have dispensaries where you can walk in and see a wide variety i think that there's definitely going to be say nutraceuticals [Music] that you find in the drugstore or counter maybe even at like costco walgreens um for cbd supplements and and maybe at some point even uh cannabis including thc supplements um what i'm really interested in is kind of there's a lot of people doing specific formulations for specific uh indications so for example zalira they're an amazing company um and they're doing stuff for they have their hope for autism and i believe they're doing breast cancer as well and some other indications and you're having specially crafted uh high credibility products out there for specific indications but i think i mean if you go into a dispensary there's literally hundreds or thousands of products there right and the beauty of cannabis i think is if you look at the different modes or or methods of ingestion the way that you can take it you can take you know a pill you can make a gummy you can take a beverage you can take a tincture flower um so a patch there's so many forms of use that you don't you don't see that in any other medication and that i think is really amazing because it accommodates so many more people in so many more conditions at the same time the variety can be overwhelming but when you're talking about medicare medical care there are two things that are really really important one is consistency so that when you take the same product time after time you're getting exactly the same thing and if you're taking a plant a sample of cannabis even you know two samples from the same plant can have slightly different profiles and so the met the traditional medical industry has a big problem with the lack of consistency where if you're looking at the whole plant whole plant extracts those profiles are going to change at least a bit from plant to plant and even sample to sample and then you also have of course the dose size um if you're using say a vaping device uh smoking a joint you know how much how much you're getting in a puff and a lot of people talk about this and so there's a lot of work going on in people trying to fit between whole plant and traditional who are working on standardized doses and consistency in doses from batch to batched batch now the tension here is that by establishing consistency and certainly that is a good thing that comes at the expense of variety so someone who's trying to do say a line they can do a line of say five products and they're producing each of those five exactly consistently in exactly the same dose from batch to batch to batch but they can't they can do five they can't do a hundred or two hundred or five hundred um and when you consider that cannabis is personalized medicine and each person has a different system and needs something different then that's a problem because you want a lot of variety to satisfy all the different people so the thing i think that makes canvas so fascinating um but so difficult for people to figure out and kind of they want to pigeonhole it is is it it's not traditional healthcare it doesn't fit the traditional healthcare mold so people are trying to understand it in and kind of square that peg try circ square that circle whatever the sign is they're trying to fit cannabis into the traditional industry mold and it just really doesn't and for me the really interesting thing will be to see how that all plays out yeah well i think i am amazed that we can now dictate the type of dna in each plant that we can pick up different terpenes to steer the cannabinoids in the plant so that it comes out one strain or another i mean there's so many ways now to influence a weed and you know it used to be i used to think oh it's just the weed it'll just grow naturally and it's not like that at all they can dictate the genetics of these these seeds and the plant and hopefully we'll get enough research to actually start growing specific strains to handle specific ailments but one thing i do want to ask you about is the western medicine versus eastern medicine philosophies and the role that cannabis can play in it whereas in western medicine with big pharma and the consistency of dosing and handling and going after symptoms as opposed to eastern medicine with a holistic view of wellness and trying to actually cure why this symptom occurred the role that cannabis might have in the middle of this well it's interesting because so over the decades um we've figured out how to i guess to address the acute problems that cause death so we have like sanitation and vaccine so people generally you know this year has been a a bit different but people generally don't die of viruses or infectious diseases because we've cured that so people are living longer and they're they're also getting more complex problems and medicine started out back with the germ theory of disease and and when pharmaceuticals started first becoming standardizes in the mid-1800s to um try and they were trying to legitimize uh medical care at that point you had all the tonics and the doctors selling these solutions that's kind of like the cbd market now where you don't know what you're getting and the fda was trying to or the fda wasn't created then the government was trying to legitimize the practice of medicine and that's when you started with the isolated molecules and making sure um everything was purified and isolated and high quality stuff and consistent from batch to batch and safe and and efficacious um and so that has served us for decades and however and kind of going back to aids where cannabis started kind of gaining some momentum in society with aids that i think that was one of the first diseases out there where they really started using drug cocktails and they're using multiple different drugs um to address problems because they understood that it was a complex problem that had more than one mechanism of action and more than one problem going on in the body and so now if you look at what's going on there doctors are increasingly using drug cocktails for cancer for aids and for other diseases and if you think about cannabis one sample of whole plant cannabis is really a dry cocktail it's just that it's a cocktail designed by mother nature not by traditional healthcare providers and so they're kind of the the eastern and medicine and western medicine are kind of converging in the sense that over the past probably two to three decades we've been moving more towards drug cocktails which is exactly what cannabis is and the problem with cannabis is they're going to have to figure out how to accept a product that has a lot of moving parts that they haven't fully figured out yet uh we can wait say 20 years 30 years until they have fully figured it out but what about all the people in the meantime who are suffering and who need something now right and so i think um hopefully i hope that the traditional industry will recognize this drug cocktail issue recognize that there's always more that we can learn about something but even despite the fact that we don't fully know what's going on with cannabis and all the different compounds in the plant that are working together that they are having benefits and they can be effective now gotcha well ruth fisher phd and the author of the medical cannabis primer which you can get on amazon i certainly appreciate you joining us today i always feel

has been an abject failure smoking marijuana is illegal in texas but could that change nine new bills were introduced monday ahead of january's legislative session heather fazio is the director at texans for responsible marijuana policy this may be the first time that in the texas senate a bill has been introduced to repeal prohibition entirely if smoking marijuana is illegal in texas then how can this billboard exist downtown off of i-35 it was paid for by morris dendon with compassionate cultivation a legal marijuana facility here in austin i still think there's a lot of people that don't even know that this program exists in the state of texas the compassionate use program denton sells legal non-smokeable thc to patients with extreme medical conditions like alzheimer's and cancer but current laws limit his customers and his business practices because this is a schedule one substance we can't use any form of transportation services to deliver our medicine to our patients fox 7 austin spoke with the democratic state senator jose menendez who is proposing a bill that could allow more texans to get a medical cannabis prescription is this the one medical therapy that legislators feel that they should be telling doctors how to practice medicine if his bill passes patients with any condition their doctor deems necessary could get a prescription do you think that governor abbott is going to sign any of these no i hope so but why now pew research center released a new study monday indicating 68 percent of americans are ready to legalize marijuana many states already there but for menendez this is personal his wife had two back surgeries she's had fentanyl patches she's been on the horrible narcotics and and narcotics can kill people and they stop your

click this video it's probably because you want to learn how to make some edibles and you want to make some really easy to do recipes at home edibles which is a good thing because that's what we're gonna do in this video I'm going to teach you the five most easiest things to make at home with edibles and cannabis my name is Judy Shekar and you're watching puff puff toast let's start off with number one cannabutter one of the most common things to make with cannabis it's super easy to make all you need to do is melt some butter and as you're melting the butter you add a gram of ground cannabis into that butter and you keep melting it melting and melting it until it's nicely infused with the cannabis and voila you have cannabutter super easy super simple and a lot of people use it the second thing that you can make at home is cannabis tea using the can of butter which is interesting because I actually wouldn't expect putting butter in teeth but a lot of people do and apparently this tastes really good so all you do is brew your favorite tea and a teaspoon of that can of butter into your tea and it's this blend of something really delicious warm and nice the third thing that we're going to talk about on how to do our Keith's cookies so Keith is basically the extra powder that comes off of the cannabis bud or when you ground cannabis any leftover powder that happens all of that can actually be used to make keep cookies and and they're really easy to make all you do is you get that left over ground Keith add in some cookie dough bake it and boom you've got Keith's cookie super easy super simple very very delicious apparently number four is I want to tell you how to make pot brownies okay so super easy again but one thing that you want to make sure that you want to have is a brownie mix that uses foil because what you're gonna do is you're gonna heat the oil up and as you're heating oil you're gonna add the ground cannabis to it and then you're gonna mix that oil into a brownie mix and then you basically bake it and you have pot brownies the last thing that I want to teach you how to make is called a firecracker very very very easy all you need are graham crackers peanut butter and cannabis powder so ground cannabis call you to as you spread some peanut butter on the ground cracker add some of the ground cannabis on top of it slap on another peanut butter spread ground cracker on top to make a sandwich cover it in foil put it in the oven for 30 minutes and then you've got this amazing sort of peanut butter brownie cracker sandwich with cannabis so those are the top five really easy ways to make cannabis edibles at home however I'm sure there's more out there and if there is let us know in the comments below let us know what do you make it home with cannabis that's all for me my name is Trudy Shekar and you're watching puff-puff post", "pSXiYXHVKGg": "Oh No I woke up with this voice ooh the holiday is taking its toll but I won't have it not without a fight right I am going to run through a 24-hour detox let's do it first up always big glass of water maybe two voice already sounds better fortunately the body is always trying to detoxify itself we simply just need to get out of the way and give the body what it wants starting with good night's sleep a good morning run a good little coconut oil ghee butter mushroom tea concoction breakfast especially should be loaded with healthy fats of course the fresher the food the more nutrient-dense it is and I can't think of a more fresh place to get the food than the farmers market I have some healthy fat mmm it's not making good the other great thing about farmers markets is you get to eat what's in season and science has proven that when you eat what she sees in your immune system is improved and it's easier to digest those foods Cheers free to power I think for a good detox take your mind and consider that your detox [Music] more water laughs laughs laughs lots of water and as a bonus throwing some emergency the non-gmo kind yeah all right for lunch fruits and veggies and the more colorful we get the better chance we have of getting all the vitamins and minerals our body needs to continue detoxing much of our body's ability to detox starts in the gut because that's where most of our microbiome live they affect our development as humans in general so we need to live in symbiosis with them and what do they love to eat most they love fiber they love fermented foods and they love probiotics so for lunch we scored some kimchi we're going to chase down some fiber more water well and we're going to do some yoga but due to the snowpocalypse it was cancelled Yoga is my favorite detoxing exercising because we detox through our sweat we also detox through our blood and our lymph nodes the key for exercising while we detox is we want low intensity let's circulate everything through so we're gonna get the heart rate going with a little bit of cycling and then hit my second favorite exercise climbing let's get my heart rate going let's climb [Music] sonna cold shower alternating and now we must replenish the body with some much-needed nutrients we've got our squash oh and our beets we picked up this morning looking good I am we want to eat what's easy to digest one of the most important parts of the detox is your rest that's when your body replenishes the most so thank you that's fun happy detoxing make it your own take pieces that you like that's my challenge for you take maybe one thing you thought of watching this video that you'd like to try that's challenge let me know you tried curious what your experience is like and let me know what your way to detox is Thanks peace bye good night", "XQMHIiu1JFs": "hello I'm venom 4:20 and today I'm gonna be showing you how to make caviar [Music] before we get started with anything else let's go ahead and take a quick dab so one of the big keys to how I'm showing you to do this for cheap is because I'm showing you how to do it with some reeds and you'll notice when you take a nice low temp dab you're gonna have a little bit of reuse I tend to keep mine in this little jar just like that got that out of the way so first off the things you're gonna need are some nugs something to do this over I'm using some parchment paper you're gonna need a little Bowl or a little dish to hold the key then you're gonna need the actual Keeffe itself just from the bottom of three-part grinder you're gonna need some type of oil to cover the nugs in so the idea is you're going to be covering the nugs and oil then rolling them and Keith this is all stuff I have already at home but it's even better to use like honey oil another good one you can use is distillate another good one is rosin and you're also gonna want some gloves too because this is going to be a sticky mess at some point so it's then good to sticky in here [Music] so now the goal is to wrap this whole bud in oil let's go ahead get this going and we'll just take a nice see there [Music] see that's just pretty gettin towed it already just coat it as much as you can [Music] now that's fully coded and then we're just going to take our little jar keep like that and we're just going to start pressing it down just like that [Music] [Music] and now it's probably starting to look a lot like something you've said you know we're expecting [Music] that is what I'm talking about right there that is a fully formed ball perfectly round Moonrock for you oh one down we're gonna go ahead and do this one more time I'm gonna go a little bit lighter on it than I did last time because this one's like a little bit like a play-doh ball you know it's it's too soft [Music] [Music] [Music] yeah that one's this one's mostly hash oil kind of the difference is a little bit this one feels a lot better just a little bit less oil I spread it out a little bit more even this one has a bunch better texture as this one's like a [ __ ] gooey mess I put on so much hash oil but it's just I mean look at that that's too much there's a little nugge pot in there but I mean not much so I'm actually I break that little tiny piece and make it its own little moon rock so that guy too he's an hour like it's so so and this one I can I'm just flying away that's just so like kief so oh yeah but way to get my channel on this one I am like I'm just pulling off the hash oil and rolling it in the key I think I'm creating my own new thing right now I'm calling these comments with AK a little venom comments and that's just pure hash oil and Keith rolled into a little low ball making new things the cat see Ziggy likes a chef I'm just glad he's sleeping on the chair next to me and not [ __ ] getting involved with this one cuz it's too messy those are cool they feel like a little like candies or something a little caramel balls but they're just pure oil drops rolled and Keith from the excess I had made off that moon rock just pulling it off now that I pulled off all that hash oil look how much smaller that is I was able to take all of that off of that by pulling out so I weigh over did the oil you don't want to do that because that actually sucked like this one and this one now are like perfect you got these perfect ones so now these ones have like a great consistency and these are kind of cool I like these little new inventions I came up with I'm sure it's been done I'm sure someone's had it if anyone knows about these put it in the comments below and tell me if anyone has a name form or anything like that because if not I'm coin in that [ __ ] they're little little comments but okay so got your moon rocks here and now these ones feel really good they're really solid and they're gonna break apart fine we got this little mini moon not here another way I like to do it is to take all that oil we got it and just start spreading it onto there we're gonna touch it for two seconds and really [Music] it's got all these little chunks honey there yeah Randy the same thing just go spread it over anything it sticks to alright so there you go that's another way to do it right there to is to take a paper cover it in oil cover it and keep and there you go I've heard these called caviar or moon rocks I think moon rocks is more of a thing that's been coined to a certain brand I think it's corrupt its corrupts moon rock that's it yep so I believe that technically moon rock is coined by that guy and that's like a brand that he grows and that's his thing so technically this is all caviar so let's let's clear that up I've been calling it moon rocks and a little insider knowledge on that as well as when caviar was first coming out I need someone who had you know the hens had just a dispensary they knew what was going on in there they worked there and he always told me not to get caviar and I'm like why and he's like well okay did the coming Aaron type thing is like the thing is is sometimes we get bud that's just really really shitty it looks like [ __ ] there's no crystals it just doesn't really do much for us so what they started doing is rolling it in oil rolling it in Keith and hiding it just like you know you could take something that's not very good and turn it really good you know what I mean you could take pretty much swag and make it besa got one more thing for you now the last one we're going to do is something called Sun rocks so what we're gonna do is actually instead rolling it in Keef we're going to roll it in all this and you'll see how there's all these shards they actually work a lot better if it wasn't so [ __ ] warm right now and every time you break it up you know there's a little tiny shards all over the place little flecks so we're actually going to be using that we have that all piled up put that to the side I'm gonna steal one last rap [Music] he's pretty much covered now we're gonna go ahead and take that and start rolling it [Music] [Music] [Music] and then you got one of those guys it's like a quantum Jim Rohn [Music] [Music] [Music] this is an OG Mike Montgomery double bubble bubbler Mike Montgomery is one of the original artists at the Chong glass company and this is a UV one it lights up really nice I'd like to eventually own a piece by like all the dudes who used to work there let's go ahead and load one of these [ __ ] up so I'm gonna go ahead and break that apart you can see it just [Music] crumbles and there you got the layers like to give a special thanks out to mr. Chuck I'm gonna put a link to his Instagram he helped me acquire this bad boy I love this thing so it's got the Homer smoking a blunt [ __ ] Satan Flanders to Satan Flannery's I should say and playboy Oh Marge oh yeah that's [ __ ] awesome awesome piece awesome moon rocks again gather so it was a little son rock here made ourselves some new little comments I don't know if that's a thing and also just I think the easiest way is to just roll it on paper and smoke it that way a lot of people put down the outside of the paper but that's kinda I feel like for show more which is fine sometimes because it's cool to can I don't look at it do its thing you know but it makes a mess I think when it's on the inside it only makes sense anyway so that's how I make my own caviar for next to nothing that's all from reuse I saved from my dabs and put my jar for later it's all from Keef that I collected on the bottom of the three-part grinder and it's from you know just any type of bud you want to use like I said I like making it myself because I know what ingredients this is the cheapest way to do it not the best you know what I mean you know all stuff that we've collected now if you get some really good distillate or some really good rosin or you know all these different ingredients you can make it yourself and excellent excellent quality this is just a really awesome link to experience if you even like it again super awesome thank you to everyone who helped make this happen thank you to everyone who watched go ahead and let me know how you like to make it I'm sure this is kind of an open thing this is you know what I'm doing isn't the way to do it it's just a cheap way to show you how to do it if you have other tips on that go ahead and leave it I think that's awesome anyway go ahead and check out some older videos be sure to LIKE share and [ __ ] subscribe from me and Ziggy take it easy keep it keep see you next time", "6XDcsnxrX0g": "Jane is seven years old now Jane was was born perfectly healthy four months old Jaden had as a first seizure it was downhill road for there for the next few years she's having 500 like twitching my clonic seizures a day you'd have grandma's four hour hour and a half I remember he was crying from like one o'clock at night so like 9:00 in the morning screaming crying in pain he was seeing things he was hallucinating from the medications at foreign have Jayden was taking 22 pills a day he was at 25,000 pills he had taken by the time his five years old Jaden I tried 12 different medications we had 40 handles because we were fighting with the insurance companies all the time we lost our house we lost our cars we lost our business we lost our family I went to UCSF I said look I don't think James gonna make it another week for what do you suggest they're all you know I don't know I mean I would try anything I go what do you think about medical marijuana they're all well like we said he think their life in that situation you should try anything so I said alright I wouldn't picked up something I saw in a dispensary and came home I gave it to Jayden after four and a half years of having my clonic seizures 500 a day and twitching and head drops and seizing the first day I gave it to him was thank God 1 million times it was the first day he's ever one seizure free in his life then after that second day third day fourth day the seizures were down dramatically I could see his eyes lighting up it was summertime it was June first the first day I gave it to him 2011 he started swimming Jaden's never been able to swim before there's seven temperature of water would give him a seizure when I put him in the front yard and my neighbor's like oh my gosh we've never seen him in the front yard they're so excited they're cheering him on I started weeding him off the medications after one month I was on the on the CBD every time I took him off he would suffer for two weeks and boom you become more human then take off another pillow suffer for two weeks boom become more human Jayden started chewing Jayden was only eating Gerber food Oh always always five years old he started chewing we've taken 25,000 pills it really wears on your body and brain so it's kind of recovering more from the medications em from the epilepsy we decided to wean off the hardest one benzodiazepines he was having tremors nightmares the brain zaps I've contacted 30 different benzo withdrawal clinics they go how old's the person is coming on that you want to bring into our clinic that's home seven years old and they scream at the top of your involved their lungs every single one vividly say the same exact thing you have a seven-year-old on benzos because we have people here that are football players we have people here that are big tough guys that are dying literally dying from benzos and you have a seven girl on it that's a seven year old my son's been addicted to a sense he's 16 months old so now we have to figure out a way to wean them off by ourselves because the benzo detox clinics are not willing to take in a seven-year-old since we've been using the CBDs he's been doing amazing it has under 1% THC so it doesn't give me that euphoria second thing is that abstract it it's organic we know that dosage in the milligrams we're in the forefronts of something huge it's either you're gonna give up and just let your son be a child be a vegetable and die or you're gonna sit there and fight I still haven't met Jaden yet I know Jaden and twenty two pills but I'm down to Jaden in two pills that's who I know right now I don't know Jaden but on medication [Music] Christmas for Jaden was born that was my Christmas gift was that Jaden was gonna be born my ex-wife had to give me a box I opened it and I remember it's a hard one remember opening the boxes seeing a pregnancy test and saying positive for two baby shoes and having so much expectation you know have you so much expectation that you know you're gonna have your son as a parent you're expecting your child to play football if that's working a child to talk you know I mean right now my number one goal right now is to have my son say I love you I mean people take for granted [Music] people take that for granted the kids could talk and say I love you as well I won't hear my son say but if Ike is here to say that I'll be more than happy he said at one time on CNN I allowed to he was really close but um I got to hear it I mean if he says that I've already conquered the world seeing your child suffer there's nothing worse than that there's no torture worse than that especially every day now is not the time to send a message to our young people that marijuana is medicine it is not it is a dangerous illegal drug is it legit",

is there slowly to hear and today we're going to do a product review on Mary's medicinals transdermal patches [Music] so Mary medicinals is a brand and they have various products out there and today we're going to talk about these transdermal patches this specific transdermal patch is a CBD to THC one-to-one ratio so that means it has the equal amounts of THC to CBD okay I've already cut this open but normally it would be closed and you will have to cut it open it this type of material is not a material that you can tear because it's childproof and safety proof so you want to make sure that you have scissors and you cut them open on the back here it has some instructions at the top it has some the ingredient list and then it has the very important lab testing that I always say make sure every product that you use has been lab tested and if it has been lab tested it will have a label on the product okay so let's just review what this says so it gives instructions about it says that the patch is most effective on a Venus part of the body such as the top of the foot or inside the wrist and that the patch is is effective for up to 12 hours when worn continually which is pretty much any transdermal patch so how do you transform of Hatch's work so here is the patch it's like a second skin and it's sticky you simply apply the patch to where you want it to go and then it sticks there until you pull it off it's very simple this one has already been used so it's not sticking to me but that's where you can apply this effect pretty much anywhere and it's very discreet you can put it in places underneath your clothes no one can see it if you were in a place that's more open people may think it's just a band-aid because it's it's so discreet looking which I love about that the other cool thing about patches is that patches can be cut right so if you want to decrease the amount of cannabinoids that is located in the patch you can simply cut it in half and you'll get half the dose right and the reverse is true also if you want to increase the amount of cannabinoids you can wear multiple patches instead of just wearing one so the cool thing about transdermal patches are super discreet you can customize your dosage by decrease by cutting the patches to decrease the dose or by having multiple patches on to increase the dose so let's read more about Mary medicinal patch that I have here according to the lab testing this was manufactured September 4th 2018 and it expires September 4th 2019 that's always great when they have an expiration date on the lab testing in addition it says CBD is seven point two one milligrams per patch THC is eight point one three milligrams per patch and this also has CBC which is one point oh five milligrams per patch as we saw in the beginning this was supposed to be a one to one but like I've told you in my previous videos is that's what they want it to be what you see on the actual product label is what they desire the product to be but when they send the product in for lab testing the lab tests will give you very specifics of what the product actually is and that's why this label is so important so you would think that you would get seven milligrams and seven milligrams or nine milligrams and nine milligrams or whatever but now we see that we have a little bit more THC in this product than CBD okay so it's not truly truly truly exactly once one because we have eight point one three milligrams of THC and we have seven point two one milligrams of CB d okay but for all intents and purposes this is a one to one ratio and the other thing we want to pay attention to is the ingredients on the back okay those are always very important because you want to make sure that you're not applying anything to your skin that may irritate it or that you will be allergic to so for instance this has acrylic glycol lettuce in oleic acid cannabis extract eucalyptus and terpenes on the front here at the bottom it says that this is terpene and rich it enlists the the terpene that's in it so that's important to know because we know that terpenes do add to the entourage effect in terpenes do provide medicinal value so we love products that have terpenes in them and when they outline the terpenes better in them so those are important but overall the Mary medicinal patch is so simple to use it's so easy to use if you use continuous relief or effect for up to 12 hours I know personally when I use it it lasts for about 10 hours and then I have to replace it but still 10 hours and you don't have to do anything there's nothing to take there's nothing to smoke there's nothing as swallows nothing to eat you simply just put it on and go about your business transdermal patches are pretty cool if you have any questions just let me know talk to you later [Music]", "q2gsu7CnFSE": "[Music] welcome to true buds tv it's your buddy jack here and we're making a potent cannabis infused liquid coconut oil using the shake here i'm using about 37 grams whatever fills to the top of the levo2 that i'm using today you can use a crock pot you can use a stove top this will all apply no matter what method you're using so obviously you're going to need your flour you're going to need the coconut oil we're going to put in a little sunflower lecithin at the end to help it emulsify create a more even mixture throughout our baking sheet and foil to decarbon a strainer fine strainer cheese cloth tea check 2 is optional let's spread that cannabis out on the tray nice layer there coat it in foil tightly let's put it in the oven 240 degrees for 40 minutes or you could do 220 for an hour i like to let it cool and flip it over like this and then use the foil itself as kind of a device to pour into your whatever you're using crock pot or the levo in my case now let's add that liquid coconut oil a cup here to start we just barely wanted to top over the flour and we're going to repeat this process so next we'll do four ounces and then two we end up using about 14 ounces total to this 38 grams here and we're going to infuse it at 200 degrees fahrenheit which is about low on the crock pot for four hours you can play with this do what you like the levo ii has a stir so you don't really need to worry about stirring it automatically does it for you which is a nice little perk there it is let's strain it out we're going to push down with a spatula you could put it in like a french press to make sure you get all the oil out or just squeeze it with your hands if using cheesecloth we're going to pour a sample to the side here then we are going to add our sunflower lecithin to help it emulsify give us a more even texture and mixture throughout and then we're going to give it a nice stir for a while whisk it up make sure that mix is well make sure your infusion is still warm and hot we'll let that infusion cool a little bit and then we're going to use the t-check 2 here that's why we put the sample to the side it uses light to test your sample so you want to make sure you test it before you add that lecithin all right it's getting ready here the device my favorite part about to put the tray in here and test and see how potent it is today let's see we're about to make some caps with this so i hope it's nice and potent some 6.4 milligrams per milliliter that's nice that'll be some decent um you know infused capsules that we make 94.7 per tablespoon so that's gonna hit pretty good throw a teaspoon in a smoothie you'll be good to go if you know what i'm saying and if you're curious to know more about this tcheck 2 potency testing device i'll drop a link below so you can check it out see what it's all about i've done a ton of other videos using it so you can watch those as well they'll be in the description and i'll throw a little 25 discount below if you want to buy it you know i get a little something on the back end so i can keep these dope videos coming to you so

array of ailments you", "f4q97VUb284": "we can all agree having to take a drug test can be a bad thing when you've been given little notice figuring out how to get weed out of your system fast becomes a crucial question and aimlessly searching the web for the best remedy becomes your new full-time job since this is a question that plagued so many of you we've decided to do the work for you and compiled the best advice based on expert opinions let's begin with the little biology so that you fully understand the way the body stores and processes toxins and for how long metabolism it's the chemical transformation or breakdown of a substance from one form to another metabolites are the different substances produced during this metabolic process they are chemically altered derivatives of the initial substance THC metabolites which there are approximately eighty are the specific byproducts of THC metabolism these are what are excreted from our bodies and what drug testing facilities detect in various fluids such as blood urine and saliva how long weed stays in your system commonly referred to as the detectable period is dependent on the potency of the THC how much and how often it has been consumed individual metabolic differences and the sensitivity of the test being performed body physiology and day to day activity levels play significant role in the rate at which the drug is metabolized and excreted as metabolites are stored in fat an individual has a higher body fat ratio and is not very physically active will usually retain the metabolites for a longer period of time then someone who is thinner and physically active keeping this in mind a rough guide is that for the first time user it can stay in your urine for three to seven days someone who uses two to four times per month eleven to twenty days two to four times a week twenty three thirty two days five to six times per week thirty three to forty eight days and for the daily user it can stain your urine for up to forty nine to 102 days when it comes to at-home methods of how to get weed out of your system fast the Internet is saturated with story after story the most common of these myths are the use of vinegar niacin or berry juice here we aim to differentiate myth from fact first up vinegar of the at home cleansing methods consuming vinegar is often one of the most talked about but can vinegar really clean your system of marijuana and quickly experts agree that vinegar does aid in digestion and detoxification however these benefits occur over an extended period of time so the short answer is no now in the little amount of time you have while vinegar is not an effective means of getting weed out of your system fast including it as a part of a longer term cleansing routine may enhance the overall rate at which the toxins are expelled the acidic characteristics of vinegar effects metabolism resulting in an increased ability to break down foods and includes the purification process of fats that occurs in the kidneys and the liver niacin commonly known as vitamin b3 helps the body to maintain a healthy metabolism and also help the body use fats and protein because metabolism is one of the key factors in processing THC the myth that using large amounts of niacin to metabolize THC was born but can Isen actually be used to get weed out of your system fast the answer is no while one could certainly argue that well-balanced long term use of the vitamin would aid but only slightly in the metabolic process it is not a cure-all for short-term use furthermore exceeding the recommended daily dosage of niacin can cause irreversible liver damage in short dosing up on niacin in the short-term to pass the drug test is a myth and a dangerous one at that cranberry juice is acidic in nature similar to vinegar which is why arguments surrounding whether or not it works to clear THC are based on the same theories as those of vinegar with the added argument that cranberries are also antioxidants this is true they are antioxidants but not magical enough to get weed out of your system fast however adding cranberry juice to a long term cleansing routine may help now that we've cleared these myths let's talk about what actually works first lighten your toxin load any substance that acts as a toxin in the body is an obstacle that will only detract your ability to eliminate those toxins already present eliminate alcohol coffee cigarettes refined sugars saturated fats and certainly stay clear of THC in order to remove THC we need to remove the fat that contains it all of the methods listed here are an attempt to eliminate contaminated fat hydrating since water is the ultimate purification tool it will enable your body to work optimally helping to flush toxins and support liver function so that it can effectively metabolize body fat drink at least 10 8 ounce glasses of water per day if you're exercising or live in warmer climates you may have to increase the amount exercise since THC is stored in fat cells exercising as much as possible will accelerate its release exponentially good types of fat burning exercises are resistance training and aerobic activities like hiking running and biking try to do at least 30 to 60 minutes a day if you're unable to do any of these exercises walking a few miles a day will help diet as far in advance as possible modify your diet stay away from refined sugars and carbohydrates like sweets juices white bread white rice and pasta these are absorbed in the bloodstream very quickly raising insulin levels which prevents your body from using stored fat is energy whereas whole grains like brown rice whole wheat and low carb vegetables absorb slowly to maintain healthy insulin levels allowing your body to burn fat but since you really want to burn fat fast you're going to want to stick to low carb vegetables each one of your meals should include a protein source a fat source and a low carb vegetable many people believe that in order to lose fat you need to reduce the amount you consume to a minimum this is not true cutting fats completely out of your diet will cause your body to retain the fat as a safety mechanism preventing the THC metabolites from being released the key is to stay away from saturated fats and instead incorporate good fats which are polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats like olive oil avocados nuts and fatty fish to name a few when choosing protein sources you want to pick ones low in saturated fat like lean beef chicken shrimp eggs and fish low carb vegetables there's plenty to choose from but some of the best kinds are spinach kale broccoli collard greens and asparagus by doing these three things hydrating exercising and modifying your diet you can speed the release of THC out of your system by up to 70% not everyone has the time or ability to incorporate the lifestyle changes necessary to expedite the removal of THC for those who fall into this category there are alternatives MDT solutions offers products that help accelerate the removal of THC there same-day cleansers remove all metabolites from blood and urine are effective after just one

coach in your guide to living your healthiest best life and in today's video I'm gonna share with you the most frequently asked questions about CBD also known as cannabidiol [Music] so if you're watching this video either you're considering using CBD or you're already using it but you're a bit confused and you have some questions about it so hope to answer and address both cases on today's video so number one what is CBD well CBD also known as cannabidiol is a non psychoactive constituent found in hemp so a lot of people get confused well it you know is it is cannabis and hemp but the same thing is marijuana there's all these different terms out there it can be a little bit confusing but all you need to know is that CBD at least the CBD that's sold in the United States and is legal is extracted from hemp and does not contain a THC which is the compound that makes you feel high so CBD also knows cannabidiol is one of sixty different compounds found in the hemp plant now today it's been blowing up everyone's talking about CBD because of the amazing benefits from taking it now most people take CBD to for three reasons number one to manage pain number two to manage anxiety and number three to help with sleep so the chances are if you're watching this video those are probably three of the the reasons maybe you're using it for all three maybe one or you might be using CBD to alleviate a more serious condition like Parkinson's or some other type of condition now if that's the case some of the questions that I'm going to answer you're gonna want to dive in a little bit deeper and I'm gonna put a link below to a book about how to use CBD for specific medical conditions I'll put the link in the description below for you guys as well so let's get started with the first question so the first question is is it legal so yes CBD is legal in United States now there was a on February 7 2014 Barack Obama President Barack Obama signed the farm bill Act making the sale of CBD legal in the United States now there are some products that contain CBD and hc' those products are only legal in certain states but if you're getting a CBD product that has point zero three percent THC that is under the illegal limit so you that can be sold in any state in the United States at the time of shooting this video so the next question I want to address is will CBD make me feel high and the answer is no as long as you're taking a product that doesn't have also THC in it THC is the compound found in marijuana that makes you feel hot now if you're just taking CBD you're not going to get the same effects of the cerebral High effect as a THC as taking THC but you will get the benefits the physical benefits of smoking vaping or using sublingual CBD as you would if you are using marijuana in that way so next I want to answer the question what are the known benefits of CBD well studies have shown that CBD is really beneficial for people with neurological conditions like super cerebral palsy like MS and for other conditions that are related to anxiety in pain it's really important to understand that the research now is just kind of starting to kind of unroll and unfold but there's so many people that have been benefitted immensely if you just do a search on the internet from taking CBD to manage pain to manage anxiety and again too mad to help manage neurological conditions even like can the condition like Parkinson's disease people have been found to have great benefits now specifically one of the biggest things that kind of took the whole trend to the next level is seizures helping control seizures so you can also take CBD if you're a healthy individual and you just want to prevent preventative maintenance for diseases such as cancer it's been found to help shrink tumors it's been found to help be an amazing digestive aid for people that are doing chemotherapy I mean there's a lot of different really interesting stuff out there but those are the most common benefits of consuming CBD so next question I get asked often what is the best way to consume sea because now there's so many different products from vaping - you know tinctures - gummy bears - you know tea - popsicles - you name it everything has CBD in it now depending on the reason why you're using CBD is greatly gonna you know depend on which form you use it now vaping CBD has been found to to be the fastest way to get it into your system but I always like to recommend people use a sublingual dropper underneath the tongue takes about an hour 45 minutes to an hour depending on how fast your metabolism to start to notice the benefit taking it that way and that's just an easy way to get it into the system now there are also again there's so many different products out there you can try a bunch but again it really depends on why are you taking CBD once you're clear on why you're taking CBD and I'd love to know in the comments below why are you taking CBD or why are you thinking about consuming CBD why don't you drop me a line in the comments below be really curious to get a thread going about people you know sharing why they're taking it so the next question I often get asked is the CBD have any side effects Devin and the answer is not if you use it in the recommended amount dosage now if you're using more than 1500 milligrams a day which would be a lot then there is a possibility you might get drowsy you might have diarrhea but those are really the own the only side effects and that's only going to be if you're taking a massive dose of CBD another really common question I get will taking CBD fail a drug test and the answer is no not if you're using CBD that does not contain THC now if you're using CBD that contains THC then yes you will fail a drug test but if you're taking CBD that's sold legally here in United States you're not gonna fail a drug test because it doesn't have detectable amounts of THC which is what they're testing for in a drug test so the next question is all about dosing and this is a big one how much do I take and this is kind of the most challenging thing to talk about when it comes to CBD because depending on again why you're taking it is greatly gonna depend how much and how you take it but I'm gonna give you some guidelines right now number one start small so you want to titrate up with CBD because actually if you overdose with CBD overdose you actually might have the inverse effect so let's say you're taking CBD to help you get to sleep and you take too much it actually might keep you awake let's say you're taking CBD to help you manage your anxiety and you take too much for your specific body it might cause you anxiety so you want to start slow and then you want to titrate up so I recommend a good starting dose is 15 milligrams and then you can titrate up up to really even up to like 1500 milligrams depending on again why you're taking it now your body size how big you are how much you weigh is also gonna affect you know how much you're gonna take somebody that's a larger person is gonna need a little bit more than somebody that's a smaller person now of course this goes without saying if you're taking it for a medical reason please consult your doctor before taking it next question I get often asked is when is the best time to take it when should I take it should I take it in the morning should I take it at night should I take it at lunch again comes back to the same kind of question here your your theme why are you taking it so if you're taking it to help you get to sleep I recommend taking it an hour before bed if you're taking it to help you manage pain you want to take it in the morning so you know let's say that you have knee pain or lower back pain or hip pain you want to take it in the beginning of the day that way you're getting the effects the pain is gonna be Aleve for the rest of the day now again it really depends on why you're taking it and so if you're taking it for to manage pain and you don't you don't want to be tired throughout the rest of the day you want to experiment with different dosing amounts and find that just that range that helps you alleviate the pain but doesn't make you tired so you can go throughout your day with with energy so the next frequently asked question is how long will it take till I start to feel the benefits of CBD well it really depends on three things number one the quality of the product there's a ton of different products out there a lot of them are really low quality and you're not going to feel the effects because they're just not extracted right they're not full spectrum they're not organic click the below I'll put a recommended brand the one I partnered with and use personally but you outside of the quality of the product how much milligrams are taking and then the delivery mechanism again like I mentioned earlier in this video if you're vaping it you're gonna get the benefits a lot quicker than if you're using it sublingually but I recommend taking it sublingually you know I'm not a big believer in in smoking anything to be honest so sublingual drops are in my opinion the best way to get CBD into your body and you can expect to start to feel the difference if you're taking it sublingually anywhere between 45 minutes and an hour after you take the product so another really interesting question I get is can I feed my dog CBD and the answer is yes just like humans CBD has been found to help dogs with digestive disorders with arthritis with anxiety pretty much the same thing that people take it for you can give it to your dog so if your dog has digestive disease if he has you know tumors if he has cancer if he has different things that CBD would benefit a human from taking your dog can also take it and there's a lot of different products and forms of methods of delivery for for dogs but it has been found to help dogs the same way it helps humans so the next question I get from people is well where what product do I buy there's so many different companies different price ranges different you know isolates full spectrum all these different things and really I recommend that you look for a company that has high quality standards number one that it's organic number two that it's full spectrum and that's co2 extracted because the extraction method actually makes a big difference if you're getting your your CBD extracted in a using a Sullivant it's not going to be the same as using a co2 extraction method which keeps it nice and clean and again I'll put a link to the comp to the company that I personally use and recommend that's organic full-spectrum and that I know to be effective guys thank you for joining me on this video hope it was useful if you have any other questions about CBD please leave them in the comments below until next week live passionately on purpose [Music] you", "EK02vV7crkM": "hey you guys it's Donna from fed up with fatigue calm and today I'm going to be sharing my personal medical marijuana protocol and this is a video that I had a reader request she was wondering how I use medical marijuana in the treatment of fibromyalgia and chronic Lyme disease I probably use use it in a little bit different way than a lot of people with fibro and chronic Lyme disease I do use it for pain but I primarily use it for sleep and part of that is just because I have not been very successful at finding good products that I could use during the daytime hours when I'm trying to work and still still function and I'm sure there gonna be some people that are going to commenting and getting an are going to say you know you should try some of the CBD products during the day and I actually I have but I have not found them to be very helpful for pain for pain relief I've tried you know different different CBD oils from my dispensary I've also tried different hemp CBD oils that's actually how I got my introduction into cannabis for for pain and initially I did have some pretty good results with hemp CBD oil for a few months and at some point it just stopped working for me and I did make the transition to use trying trying CBD oil that came from my local dispensary didn't have results with that either so for whatever reason it just doesn't work for me I've tried some of the some of the CBD rich plant material you know vaping that just unsuccessful on that as well so I sort of just gave up on trying to use cannabis during the date hours when I do have a high pain and I get kind of desperate I do have a couple more products that I sometimes will use during the day and I'm going to share those with you so I get these THC capsules from my dispensary these are 10 milligram THC capsules you can see the price they are $32 for 20 capsules I live in Delaware which is a medical marijuana state fibromyalgia is one of the approved conditions here in Delaware so I'm lucky that I qualify these capsules you know 10 milligrams of THC that's not a that's not a very high amount it's enough that I can still function and like do chores around the house and you know still still converse and walk around and function and that sort of thing I would not drive on this I'm usually not really able to to work when I take this but I I can you know do get up and do laundry and wash dishes and watch a movie and that that kind of thing so this is one thing I'll use during the day I also will sometimes vape my favorite strain which happens to be MK ULTRA and yes I'm familiar with what MK ULTRA is that that is a secret mind-control experiment from the CIA so yeah this is my favorite strain that I will sometimes vape during the day you can see the THC content on that and the CBD content my dispensary is nice enough to put that on the containers this is the dry herb vaporizer that I use this is an Atmos jump so let me spell that for your Atmos 80 mos and then jump bike jay-j ump so you can put dry herb in this and vape it I was lucky enough to be able to purchase this through a Groupon and get a pretty good deal on it you know it's not a it's not a super expensive dry herb vaporizer some of the drier vaporizers are very expensive cost you know several hundred dollars I think that one once I got it on Groupon was only like around 40 bucks or so and so it's not a super expensive one and because of that it's actually not it's not a super high quality one either and so I don't use it a ton because I don't feel like I can get a super deep draw on it and so those are the two things that we'll use during the day if I'm just completely miserable and I've you know needs some formal relief generally before I turn to those two things I will typically try some other strategies first like I will try my quail pain relief device I will try some tramadol or some gabapentin I will try some of my pain relieving rubs or some of those things first and then if nothing else works I will kind of turn to the the THC capsules or the vaping of the MKULTRA now at bedtime typically every single day this is my bedtime ritual and it's like a one-two punch now my first year that I received my medical marijuana license what I was doing as I was just vaping the the dry herb and that would help me fall asleep and I didn't really see any any real improvement in my sleep doing that and so when it came time from my renewal I have a specific doctor that I have to go to here in Delaware to sign off on my medical marijuana license paperwork to send to the state to get my renewal each year and all he does is specifically see patients for medical marijuana certifications and so I was telling him I'm like well it really does a good job of helping me to fall asleep but I don't really feel like it's keeping me asleep I'm not really sleeping any better I'm not really seeing any great improvements in my pain or anything and he said he's he's like a really an older doctor he's probably pushing 80 at this point so it's kind of funny to hear hear him you know talk so freely about cannabis but he basically said look you need you need an edible he said because an edible last you know so much so much longer and that's gonna keep you asleep and so I'm like okay so the next time when I went left there and I went down to the dispensary I told them what he said and unfortunately my local dispensary they don't really sell anything like you know cookies or brownies or gummy bears or any of that kind of stuff that you might would find in like California or Colorado or anything like that they just aren't to that level yet so the closest thing that they have is something that they call cooking hash so that's kind of what I gravitated towards so what I do now is it's a 1/2 system so I vape my dispensary sells these little cartridges and basically this is a THC cartridges cartridge this is pure THC and it's like in a resin form and this particular card this is like 83% so to give you a comparison like MK ULTRA the THC content is like a 18 or 22 percent this is what I remember the package on this was like 83 percent and it goes in this like battery vaporizer and you can see it's the Jupiter brand and there's a magnet at the bottom here and it just slides right in and then you stick it in your mouth and suck in and draw and so I take probably maybe six hits on this and basically this takes effect instantly so we're looking at you know within within like three to five minutes this is in total effect and this helps me fall asleep and then this second part of the system is the cooking hash and so this is you can see that it's basically like a greenish brown powder greenish brown powder and what I do is I take a little MCT oil and I will take a little bit of the powder and basically dissolve that into i'll take a teaspoon put a little bit of the MCT oil into the spoon take a little bit of the powder put it into the oil and the spoon dissolve it down put it in my mouth and swallow it so the vape in this lasts for about thirty minutes to an hour so as this is wearing off the cooking hash takes about an hour to take effect so as the vape pen is wearing off the cooking hash is kicking in so the cooking hash lasts usually about three to four hours so as this is wearing off this kicks in and then this keeps me asleep if that makes sense so this helps me fall asleep this keeps me asleep and this keeps me helps me stay in some deep sleep and then I also want to share a couple of topical things that I use at bedtime so one of the things another thing that I get from the dispensary and just to be clear I get both of these from my local dispensary so these are not these are not things that you could buy online this is also a dispensary product so this is a cannabis salv you can see it's like a yellow sale and what I use this for is for like joint pain essentially I get I have joint pain and my knees and hips particularly I'm assuming it's from the from the Lyme disease and so I usually apply some of this on my knees and hips and also my lower back because I have a bulge discs in my lower lower back and I almost every night I apply some of this on those regions to kind of help with help with that and take some of the inflammation and soreness out of those areas and then and this came from the dispensary which I think I already said and then these two products these are two products that you can buy online these are available to everybody these are from resonant botanicals their body lotions pain relieving lotions one is called painless when it's called nourish and I use these as my body lotions and I apply these all over my body you know I just kind of rotate them just you know whatever I happen to reach for in any given night the neuro snare soothe which is the green one green one here this one tends to be a little bit better for like I have an errata the-- in my feet which is that uh kind of painful you know burning stinging so if I'm having some of that this is can be pretty good for that and for nerve pain and that kind of thing and then this is just painless it's just a good overall pain relieving lotion now these both of these have helped CBD oil in them so that's why I'm adding them to this video just because they they both have cannabis oil in them which is helpful for for pain I believe I would need to check and make sure but I believe they both have you know magnesium yeah they both have magnesium chloride they both have white willow bark it looks like painless has arnica in it and they both have lots of really really good lots of really really good herbs and essential oils and such so this is like really these are like really good stuff like I would immerse myself and thinks if I if I could so that's that's kind of everything that I use it's kind of cannabis and hemp related and yeah definitely like I I love all of all of this stuff I've found all this stuff to be like super super beneficial I feel like it's taking me several years I think I got my medical marijuana license for the first time let me say mm probably 2016 or 17 is when I first got it and it's it's definitely taken two or three years to finally get my protocol down you know where I feel like it's a good solid protocol I do wish that my dispensary had you know more like more of the edibles like that would it would be interesting to try some different options but they just haven't quite gotten to that point yet because the Medical Marijuana Program in Delaware is still fairly new so I wish they would evolve a little bit and we are still looking here in Delaware where it looks like I would expect within the next five years we may get marijuana may be approved for creational II and at that point I'm not sure what will happen with the the medical program you know will it even be necessary at that point because at that point you would just be able to go down to your corner store and buy it so what would be the point of having to have a medical license for it so anyway I hope you found this found this useful um I would be interested to know what your protocol looks like if you would like to share in the comments what you found most useful as far as what cannabis products what are your favorite strains as far as daytime use how are you navigating that have you been able to find any way of using cannabis during the daytime and still be able to work and function cognitively because I it's been like a big challenge for me because I need to be able to think and work during the during the day so share in the comments how you've been able to deal with that challenge and if you're interested in other articles and resources related to cannabis and fibromyalgia and chronic Lyme I will put some links in the description box below because I've done several articles on fed up with fatigue calm on that topic and take care guys I", "UEpl0ggsd48": "what's up yo dub

the tube in like so and then squeeze it and bend it around to make the hole a little smaller and then tape it up like that so i didn't realize it's got a little crack on in the side of it so i'm not
