{"vtwuy4VRtO8": "hi everyone I am Rebecca from chemnitz and I'm here today with a quick video to talk about acid dye powder weight versus volume when I am measuring out acid dyes for a project I will use a small kitchen scale and do everything based on the grams of dye so if I'm making a stock solution I will measure out say 5 grams of dye dissolve it in 500 milliliters of water for a 1% stock solution but this does add an additional step and has an additional server requirement and so there are some people who might prefer safer one skein of yarn to measure a quarter teaspoon on a teaspoon of dye and go about it that way the big reason to weigh your dye by grams versus by volumes is that the manufacturers mix these dye stocks they can keep it about the weight and the colors that you can achieve per weight of dye they recommend specific on weight of goods for example Dharma training company recommends and on weight of goods of 1.5% to 2% for most of their colors and then for some of their more saturated colors they recommend that you use a non weight of goods of 4% which would be 4 grams of dye per 100 grams to achieve the advertised color since I needed to make up some stocks today anyway I thought that while I'm weighing out my 5 grams of dye for each of these colors that it could be worth me using measuring spoons and measuring the volume as I go along and yeah who knows what we'll see as always I will be wearing gloves safety glasses and wearing a respirator while dealing with the powders so that way I don't inhale or accidentally get anything in my eye or anything like that we're going to start today with the paler cherry bomb and let's try measure one teaspoon of dye this is approximately leveled right here let's see how much the boys okay so that looks about two point eight grams right now all right let's do now a half teaspoon and again this is approximate okay so 4.2 4.3 it's good that there is some consistency on the food day for the same amount of that but it can really depend and the volume that you get in to the pen and how compact your powders are or even probably from color to color I'm not sure that we will see the same kind of weights with different colors necessarily all right next color is dirt navy and we're gonna get one teaspoon two point three grams so I'm gonna go ahead and do a second teaspoon oh that one was and that one was merde so the first one I got two point three grams the second one gave us about 3 grams of dye this one was notable because we get shootable teaspoons in a row and you can give us different weight I need the difference between two point three grams two point four grams and three grams insignificant the extra half gram of dye can make a difference in your depth of shape depending on the color now I think that we got such a different weight because one of our spoonfuls our second one that was more compact than the first one and so this was actually a really good example of what I wanted to show finally the last color I we know today is peacock blue and let's weigh out approximately a quarter teaspoon for about point nine grams second one that is pretty consistent so fun I was having consistency within this color but wait nine brands for a quarter teaspoon okay we've now added four quarter teaspoons and we have 3.6 grams again this is different a different weight per volume that what we've seen for the other colors this one is clearly more compact food I have been over filling my quarter teaspoon with this color definitely I definitely could have been doing that but oh yeah was measuring out what should be approximately one teaspoon we've got everywhere friend you know 2.3 to 3.6 grams which is a huge difference so why is this important and it really is only important if you're concerned about consistency because the density of your dye how compact or how fluffy it is can vary from when you first open it to when you use it a couple months later or even between one batch versus another from the same supplier so if you're gonna get like a huge variability when you're dealing with a specific volume of your dye powder then you could get inconsistent color results which is only a problem if you have a recipe and you are trying to replicate it so if you want to make a recipe for achieving a specific shade or a specific color way it makes a bit more sense to go for grams if you die more by feel and it's okay if there's some variability and what you within the end by all means you can go by volume there's nothing wrong with it one of my favorite techniques is just to go straight from the dye powder where I'm not doing any measuring at all I'm just dying by feel so that is absolutely okay but ultimately as long as you are consistent with the way that you measure the color you will likely end up with some reproducible results but there could be a fluke and you get one overpacked spoon and then suddenly your colors a lot more intense which you know you can always add more color but you can't exactly take it away so that could be a problem I am happy that I can finally answer a question and say alright there's between I guess like 2.3 and 3.6 grams of dye per one teaspoon and it really probably varies not just on the compactness of the dye but it could also vary a lot on the color different colors could have different volumes per weight just because they're made up of different molecules they have different amounts of filler and things like that when you're speckling with dermis silvered gray and true black the colors look of the specks of the actual dye and there looks pretty indistinguishable but there's no question that there's got to be some kind of filler in that silver gray dye stock so that way you can measure out a full gram versus having to do a fraction of the gram to get that more true gray versus sort of a deep gray this is something I talked about in the math of yarn dyeing where we actually went and looked at the different depths of shade of silver gray and true black and how they compare versus the amount of dye used for each of those scans I'll have a link to that video in the video description and my card anyway I hope that this was really helpful and helped answer some questions I have no problem dying by feel you don't need to do strict calculations to get beautiful results it's totally okay to go with the flow and just have fun but it's just when you want something more reproducible kitchen skills aren't that expensive and it's worth getting one one another thing the accuracy of your kitchen scale is something also to consider with this there's no question there can be some variability there and I know this particular scale has trouble when you're adding little amounts that are less than say point 2 grams sometimes in like itty-bitty increments sometimes those don't necessarily register right away it's important to keep that in mind and so if you're dealing with really low weights that you want to measure take that into account when you go and purchase a scale I am Rebecca from cabinets and if you found this video helpful make sure you subscribe to the convent's tutorials YouTube channel and give the video a like I released two new yarn dyeing videos every week on Tuesday and Friday mornings at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time and you really don't want to miss any of the fun so make sure that you also turn on notifications if you have a lot more dyeing questions you should go and check out the cabinets lab Facebook group we have a huge community of dyers and other fiber artists starting from people who are starting out and dulling their first skeins to people who have shops and businesses and so it's a great place for collaboration answering questions and talking about how to do different techniques you can find a link to it in the video description thank you so much for watching everyone", "_rI3FvDYcH4": "[Music] um in the world [Music] now then crew and welcome back to the andy mechanic youtube channel and finally we've got some parts for alan's cb 750 k2 these parts are for the front brake remember on the old brake on the old bracket should i say we had lots and lots of play in that mount it turned out that somebody had replaced the original pivot with a bolt that's right about about one millimeter larger in diameter and they drilled out the holes that runs through the aluminium you know in an effort to try and reduce the play again and give the whole construction another life but again of course it's now worn and it's it's not suitable for use anymore and sure as hell can't drill it out anymore my original plan was to make some bushes and a new pin but that will be a modification and this bike has to go through what we call certification here in new zealand it's not currently road legal it's sort of become deregistered for some reason and a modification to a brake component would cause it to fail that inspection so i bit the bullet and i had to order some more parts and what turned up is all that's available i ordered basically everything uh to do with the brackets a new pin the two housing bracket here we go look got two new bits and you can see there that's what it should look like when it's nice and new and of course the pin was available which is great news and it's got the little groove in the middle for as a grease reservoir so it stays nicely lubricated we've also got a few other bits and pieces i'm going to go through them nice and slowly because um you know this break seems to be quite popular on these four cylinder models of this sort of era we've got the little bolt that uh works alongside that sort of spring we'll come come to fit in that bit later on that's the part number for the bolt there was no partner for the spring but we can get that off the diagram that i've got on the screen on the laptop bit later on uh there were a couple of washers as well both the same part number there you go all genuine honda parts uh there's obviously a little m6 nut that goes on the end of that on the end of that bolt which is pretty handy and we got some more washers these to do the mounting bolts that hold that bracket to the uh the left hand fork leg isn't it so there you go so we've got a couple of washers in there and the part number for those there you go look is that i think that one's the same just to be sure there you go what else have we got ah yes we got some replacement mounting bolts because if you remember looking in the box somebody had used well they'd replace the bolts but with ones that were threaded all the way down and that's bad news they need to have a shank on them and these may not be the correct tensile strength either so we're going to replace those while we can i think there were two of those so we've got uh unfortunately they were available which is good news so there's one in that bag there look that's a part number there and i think there was a second one there was not sure if they're both the same are they both the same part number let's have a look no different part number so that's the other one so we'll work out which is which we come to assemble and fit the thing back on the bike and we also got by the looks of it yes two little locking washers as well in there look one in that bag there and that's the part number i think that could be the same part of the metal look it is so we've got two with the same part numbers two of those locking washers as well so all that's to do with the mounting of the assembled bracket as you know onto the bike itself what i'm interested at the moment is fitting this part onto the caliper and to do that these two large cap head bolts we've got to undo those split the caliper and then mount it onto the the new piece and they should be somewhere in the manual a torque setting for these hopefully we can find it if not ft um and of course we'll be putting some thread lock on the end of those threads in the casting there because again the last thing you want is this thing to come loose um front brakes usually pretty important aren't they on motorcycles right so without further ado let's get the front brake reassembled on allen's bike here we go help me darkly hopefully it's going to fit nice and nice and snug these are aluminium jaws by the way in the slice shouldn't cause any harm that's the old part anyway there we go right number eight allen key i don't know how tight they're gonna be not very tight not very tight at all to be honest and i've not been in here before so this is all virgin stuff somebody else has pulled it apart though at some point right now i've not pulled one of these apart before so we're going to learn as we go i'll take you on a journey see what we can work out right bolt number one bolt number two okay let's just pull that back of course there's the brake pad that's the old brackets and oh look at that it's a little comparison oh yeah that's interesting right time for a close-up now you remember there we are in shots remember all that term that movement that was there on the on the pivots well it looks like it does look like compared to the new one yeah i would suggest it's only my thoughts if you look down here we've got a line that isn't parallel to the bracket it goes off at a slight angle and it's not a casting line there's a distinctive step coming down by probably my word probably let's have a look probably two or three millimeters and that tells me that this bracket when the brake's been applied has been dropping down so much it's been catching on the disc itself and wearing the bracket so again there's a there's a slight burr yes on that edge there so there's definitely been way too much play in that original pin at this end you know the actual natural joint to allow that to happen that should definitely shouldn't happen so again a good little telltale sign if you're doing one of these and you see that mark where the aluminium has been worn you'll absolutely definitely need to replace this bracket it's not good you've got way too much play in this pivot point right let's get rid of the store string there we go right so we now need to install that into the two halves of the caliper assembly but first it tells us to put some grease in there so let's take a look at the manual and see where we should be applying some grease so it's houses in the manual and the manual is not that comprehensive to be honest uh they weren't uh quite as good back in those days it says apply grease here so if i use my big sticky finger use a pen we've got an arrow that comes down to that's your brake disc in the middle that's one brake pad and that's another brake pad and it says to put some grease at the back in the recess in the actual caliper body of where the pad sits and again well actually it's pointing towards the circumference of that component so rather than down the back so i think around there and around there obviously to aid the whole thing sliding in and out properly so your brakes don't stick on or rub on the on the brake disc okay well we'll pull those pads out and take a look see what we see oh and the grease we need to use is silicon ceiling grease temperature range of 67 to 392 degrees fahrenheit well that's no use to me 55 to 200 degrees c that makes more sense do not use molybdenum grease known as brake grease wow there you go you see it tells you not to use something as well which is pretty cool good job right let's take a little look inside okay so this is the inner pad and that's got a peg on it that goes through that hole there and we can see there's a little bit of rust and stuff because the bike's been stood for a very long time and i would say that the manual is telling us to put some grease around this edge here to help that pad you know move around as it needs to this one actually shouldn't really move at all to be honest but um it says to put some grease around here on this edge here and on the main caliper the outer pad much larger friction surface on there so we've got quite a lot of rust i'm going to clean all that off the wire brush and then we'll have a look around see what kind of grease we've got in stock that's going to do the trick so let me get that cleaned up and we'll crack on so when you buy new brake pads you obviously get this whole big thick steel backing plate as part of it which is pretty cool right that's that one clean for this one this one isn't anywhere near as bad obviously bear in mind when you're working this kind of stuff if you're going to reuse the brake pads don't get grease on the friction material because you won't get it out again once it's in so try and keep it nice and clean watching my hands out too bad at the moment should be wearing gloves as always but you know andy forgets he's too busy filming and there's plenty of meat on these pads there's no need to replace them okay wonder if these are genuine or not now you can see there that where there's the drilled holes in the steel and this is the friction matrix material that's basically riveted essentially it's molded into the steel to hold that friction material in place pretty cool okay what's that one like that's pretty good in there isn't it okay excellent right i now need to clean out inside there because there's a lot of rust inside there and give that a bit of a wire brush too because now is the time do it once do it right you know never easily stuff the camera is it where's tall girl holly she could be doing this for me she's brilliant at cleaning things up i'll do for that one now ideally i'd like to put this in the vice but it's not really anywhere you can really clamp onto it properly without preventing access here so i'm going to hold it but the good news is i've got my forged plasters just in case because i do sense an element of blood loss on this one or at least a bit of scuffing anyway [Music] oh it's coming up a treat is that i reckon that'll do good job rotary wire brush perfect okay so now we've cleaned everything up that one goes in there we're gonna need some grease and that one's gonna go in there so let's do this one first now grease wise it said silicone grease well the only silicone grease i've got is in a spray can and to be honest move that out of the way it's not really it's good stuff but it's i want more of a greasy grease rather than a spray grease now jarrod does tell me that eventually it does you know the carrier does evaporate away it leaves a residue of of nice grease but i need volume a little bit more than what that's going to give me so unfortunately the only thing that i've unforged get it unfortunately the stuff i've got is the standard copper paste now this one goes up to 1100 degrees c so i reckon that's gonna be just fine and this is what we'd normally use on brakes anyway to be honest and it's not the molly bender and grease that it says not to use so i'm gonna use this pretty sure it's gonna be just fine right so where do we start well probably a pair of gloves first and of course a rag i always need a good rack don't you okay so very important we don't get grease on the brake pad itself and when we're doing this kind of stuff less is more that's what i'm told so i'm just gonna put that around there i'm sure we'll get quite a long way around what we've got on there already don't need a lot and let's face it hadn't it had nothing before did it absolutely nothing whatsoever now somebody on the comments will not tell me off for using this but i think i'm pretty sure we're gonna be okay it's gonna provide lubrication and it's heat resistant what more do you want we'll stick a bit around the back as well look it's not going to get in the way okay definitely haven't got any on the brake pad whatsoever which is good those little copper tracers that you see in the pad material well that's in the puppeteer that's not what i put on so i'll pop that in fact just bear with me because normally we'd also put a little bit on the piston as well on this sort of stuff so we'll stick a bit on there look and that'll stop any kind of corrosion later on right sorry if i was off camera there not easy being as bad as me you know okay you're constantly going through your rag with this stuff because it gets absolutely everywhere okay so we'll drop him in there and he's now nicely greased up that one's done so i'll stick him over there let's get this side down okay so again we've got to go just around the outside this is a lot thinner so we'll be careful with this one a little brush should be good wouldn't it for this kind of thing trying to not to get any grease on my left hand so there's no way it's going to get transferred onto the brake pad material because the bike will get a break test when it goes for certification i'm saying that i've got a little blob on my fingernail all right we're not far off there we go look i reckon that'll do the trick and again a bit on the back which is just pretty standard stuff for automotive to be honest most of the paints go off so it'll need something to stop it rusting there we go look back in the center of the screen andy useless okay almost almost there it's difficult doing close-ups okay so we'll pop that one in there so they're now greased up and ready for assembly okay so we've got the two halves and we've got the new brackets so stick him down there like that that's gonna go geez honestly it's a really small working area on camera there we go look i should put an x max the spot on the bench look there we are that's where you can see okay so that goes on there like that and then this one drops on the top without losing the brake pad so we'll try and hold that little lug in place there we go okay so all we need now that's going to stay put where's my little tub of stuff that might work there we go right so what we need now is to clean these up get any kind of grease residue on those threads and then we can apply a bit of thread lock to them so time for the wire brush again i think we'll finish it off with a nice bit of brake cleaner as well on a clean rag that's one because to get front brake back on this bike yeah it's actually quite difficult pushing in and out of the garage because it's a bit of a slope on the outside and there's no brakes on this thing at the moment the last thing we'll do is drop alan's bike if you get very upset right okay let's go and find some some treadlock right said fred let's just shuffle that one out of the way for a minute because we're going to break cleaning now concentrate do things the camera here obviously that's one there two nice clean rag now when you if you do this put your nail into digging into the threads and then just wind it out and that usually gets it nice and clean there we go look how's that it's like a new one oh yes i like that it's amazing how much khak you get off these things when you clean them up that'll do nicely okay right bring back our temporary assembly now obviously this needs to be disassemblable so we're going to use the forge k120 which is the blue threadlock which allows for disassembly at some point in the future remember less is more so stick him in there hopefully it's going to line up for us yes look at that all right i'm getting about two before i squirt a lot of copper paste everywhere good job tube you came in multi-purpose that one okay same again sam there we go all right just double checking that pin is still there otherwise that pad's never going to go where it needs to go but i think we're good right there we go see top i even labeled it up oh my word get back right there we go perfect right they are where they need to be there's no copper paste on the brake friction material so we need to do now is tighten these up to torque so i'm going to hunt through the service manual see you can find a torque setting for these don't hold your breath nope there's no torque setting in the service manual i can find for those two bolts that hold the two halves of the caliper together on that bracket so i've googled m10 talk spec and it says 63 newton meters is about the maximum you want to go to so we'll do it 63 newton meters with some threadlock which i'll tell you now will be a lot tighter than it was before but i reckon it's right i don't want them coming loose i don't want to pull the threads either sir let's go over 60 newton meters just to give it a little bit of a margin because this is an old bike don't forget okay let's get it put back in the vise and get the torque wrench out he who dares rodney he who dares do them evenly make it look professional that wasn't too bad phew cool here i'm just going to wedge a bit of cardboard bit of a trick from mountain bike stuff is this where'd you put a car ball between these two brake pads for now because they keep falling out and there is a risk i noticed of getting some of that copper paste on the actual there we go look on the actual friction material so by doing that it's just going to keep everything snug where it should be for now so we can move on so the next job is going to be installing the pivot now it gets a little bit technical now it's not over technical but it's a little bit technical i have marked which is top because like an idiot you could put it the wrong way around i suppose as a guide the split pin the hole here for the retainer for the uh for the pin has a little split pin down here this is the original honda part how cool is that so this needs to be greased obviously otherwise it's going to wear and again i've searched through the service manual and i can't find any indication of what grease to use on this so i'm just going to use some normal grease i don't think it's going to get over hot to be honest i think we should be okay with some regular grease in there i could use copper paste but you tend to find the cup paste will actually go a bit hard over time and it doesn't lubricate that well as it compares to normal grease so we're going to go with normal grease and see how we get on also there should be some little o-rings that fit in these recesses one at either end again to retain the grease in that pivot now unfortunately newer o-rings turned up in the parts kit i just want to double check on the screen to see if we can get them if not i'm going to have to revert back to a generic o-ring now this is a website called partzilla they're not a sponsor just actually a really useful website where you can get lots of parts for your old hondas and stuff and so you can just just do a google search on partzilla.com the address is up there look and this is for the k2 and this is the diagram of that front caliper or the bracket should i say and you can see the two halves here now 24 is the o-ring and there's one top one bottoms if we scroll down on here to 24 there we go look ooring 10 by 1.7 not available not available twice that is the part number 91259-300-000 but they're not available and that's why i didn't get sent them because you can't get them anymore it's too old so we're going to rake through my o-ring box and see if we can find something that'll do the trick whilst we're here you'll also notice that 19 appears top and bottom as well and these are really thin little shims if we look up just scroll up a little bit there we go look uh there's two different sizes uh this one where's my pen this one here is 0.1 millimeters and the bottom one it says they're both classed as 19 which bit weird but the bottom one is 0.2 millimeters now we did get sent a 0.2 millimeter shim we didn't get a 0.1 so we'll see if we can fit one of those i imagine that they're to be fitted if needed if there's any additional play to be removed but we'll find out so let's get some get these o-rings matched up out in the box if we've got any and then we'll see what it's like once it's soft dry fit before we put any grease in it here we go o-rings so we'll get rid of that for now it seems like such a small working area this is a box of o-rings that i put together quite some time ago and it was supplied by this chap actually luke west up in auckland very very helpful guy if you're in new zealand needle rings he's the chap to go on c so i don't know what we got to use my little screwdriver because i can't fit my fingers in those holes well that's a little bit small let's try a bigger one came out of there i think let's try that one there's something that's got a bit of meat to it oh there we go look does it sit proud well not really but it is gonna seal against the pin yes it will oh look at that perfect so that will create a seal good job okay so we need two of those there's one we've got a few spares as well which is good news that's two they look the same oh that one looks a thinner section i reckon that's out of that box let's try that one hey come back are they both the same yes perfect right we'll stick them on the lid we can use that to keep them nice and clean okay so we're gonna do we're gonna do a dry fit so we'll leave the o-rings out for now let's see if that's right top top if we need a shim in there or not so if we can get a shim in there so pop that pin in let's stick it in the vise we'll clamp it in the vise here and then we'll see how much movement there is right she's all mounted with the vise pins in there's no grease in there there's no o-rings in there obviously and i've set another d i'll set a dti up just to sit on the end just to give us a rough idea of how much vertical movement there is due to you know clearance on that pin so we're at zero at the moment now each increment on that dti is 0.01 of a millimeter so every 10 is 0.1 of a mill so let's see what we've got that's pushing it down well so we've got basically half a millimeter yeah i'll just yeah about half a millimeter of movement which is about as good as we're gonna get i think based on the design and this is why they don't use this kind of thing anymore because it's not very good to be honest but we have got the option of shim and they did send me they did send me a shim this i've written on there because i measured it it's a 0.2 millimeter shim so let's see if we can fit that shim and reduce that movement as per the manual look really darkly it's a very old shim it's even a bit rusty look so i can always you know clean it up and end up being a bit thinner if it's a bit too tight but we'll see if it's going to go in there or not first so i think we can leave the pin in and see if we can get it in the gap is there in fact any movement vertically oh man there really isn't there really really isn't i don't think that's going to fit in there i don't even think a 0.1 shim would fit in there and i'll honestly i can't even see a gap in it so it's gonna go in as it is we'll save that shim we'll put it somewhere very safe so when this starts to wear a little bit then maybe it can be fitted to try and reduce that movement but it's not really the the proper way of doing it is it to be honest it's it's a shim in the wrong place it's not movement up and down that we're trying to stop it's moving side to side on this pin this is really just a well that doesn't work in my book so we'll stick him over there somewhere safe that'll go in our little parts bin and now we can pull this apart and we can grease it up to fit the o-rings try and get them both at the same time fun fun fun where's my rings going there we go right a bit of grease stick some grease on the old pin first there we go look a bit extra then well i thought let's get that first o-ring on because that's gonna sit oh through there we can't i can't wait it's got to be in it's got to be in hell let's just back the camera off a bit that's better hopefully you can see what's going on now not too close you can get too close sometimes okay a bit of grease in there i know most of it's gonna come back out again okay now o-rings one in there and one in there all right it could be a rag okay right top don't do top oh yes all right let's go with excess grease lots of excess grease get it now before it migrates over everything okay right that feels really good actually really really good okay so the next job is to align the pin so we can see the hole through here that's a close-up i think maybe your eyesight is better than mine so tell me when we're there if i can turn this and pliers on okay trying to do this without my hands getting in the way right can you see down that hole there probably not let's see if we can get it twizzled around it's the right place geez it could be a trial and error here's my little poker stick thing if i just hold that there as i rotate it it should drop in when it's in the right place look at that right oh brilliant i couldn't see anything there right so this is the outside that's the inside so we want that that way around julia okay where's my see if we get that bent over now point of no return now isn't it there we go i'll get those nice and flat done bloody good right should we get one more test to see if the grease has made any difference probably hasn't not really a very accurate test to be honest because the grease isn't yet pushed out of the way as soon as any kind of force on it but let's have a little look so basically doing the same as it was before uh maybe we're down to that point four of a millimeter a little bit less it's just a weird design isn't it not perfect right so we're going to save that little shim for another day because it doesn't fit if i had the 0.1 of a mil i might just be able to squeeze it in there but there's no way this is going to go in so we'll keep it somewhere very very safe in fact i put it back in the big bag that it came in that's right they didn't want me to lose that one did they okay so we've still got a fair few new parts left we've got all the mounting bolts although two out of three mounting bolts to hold um the bracket onto the forklay and we've also got uh that pin a little bolt special bolt and the spring to fit which they call adjustment uh that's to adjust i suppose the position of the caliper relative to the disc based on pad wear that's my take on it all okay so let's get this slapped back on the bike and then i think i've also got a new brake pipe to make up because i wasn't very happy with the old brake pipe we're gonna have to reuse the unions i think i don't think i've got any of that particular thread size no idea what it is but we'll we can make one up that's not a problem and then we get the brakes bled up our brake bled up and then it'll have a break again which would be nice but that's going to be about the last bit in this particular episode i would say okay and of course all bolts that hold the bracket to the fork leg must have thread lock it's a brake component you don't want it falling off okay to the bike i'm going to pull the front wheel out just to make it a lot easier to film a lot easier to get in and it does actually say in the manual to have the front wheel out when you're fitting the brake caliper so i'll do that give me a second now just before we come to install the caliper on its new bracket front wheel's out by the way um i just want to double check which bolts go where there are three bolts that hold this bracket onto the fork we've got one through this hole one through this hole and one through this hole i am missing one of those three bolts but i don't know which one so let's take a look at that parts diagram on the on the laptop and see if we can work out what the length is of the missing bolt right so look at the diagram this is 16 is the bolt that uses the little spring for the adjustment so we can ignore that for now we've got one of the main mounting bolts here 26 another one 25 but for the life of me i was searching around the diagram and i could not see maybe i'm blind but i could not see the third bolt however looking down on the parts list here we've got so where's 25 we've got an 8 by 40 that's 8 millimeter metric obviously by 40 millimeters long so we've got two options of those different part numbers depending on the frame serial number uh we've then got 26 which is this bolt here that one and there's two options again depending on frame both the same price which is nice uh that's an eight by fifty so there's an eight by forty an eight by fifty and then the third the third one which is 27 that's not shown on the diagram again two options that's an eight by thirty 35 so let's go and measure what we've got because i don't know which ones we've got let's um whichever one we're missing we should have a 35 mil a 40 mil and a 50 mil buy some weird camera angles on today isn't that okay we'll get our verniers let's just zero that there we go okay these are the two bolts that we've got and this one is doing it with the camera how cool is that all right that's got to be the 40 hasn't it there is damn it so we've got a 40 this one's longest this is gonna be the 50 hasn't it come on focus damn you right yeah okay so we're missing the 35 mil so we know that the missing bolt needs to be 35 millimeters long excellent so we've got bolts 25 and 26 they're the two longer ones and well i don't know where do they which holes they go through it's this on modern diagrams you have a little dotted line and it shows you which hole it goes through but that one 25 seems to line up with that hole there the top hole and 26 seems to line up with that bottom hole but i could be wrong to be honest it's very hard to see on here however what's more important is the washers that need to go on we've got 32 and 31 so jeez long way down okay 32 so 31 is a plane washer and 32 is a spring washer right so we know where those those washers that are in the bags go as well and it's going to be the spring washer first and then the plain washer correct right let's do that it's good to get things double checked isn't it to make sure we're right okay there's my pick picks are good for when doing stuff open up bags right so we've got spring washer we've got fiddly a plain washer so spring washer first then the plain washer we'll find that either we'll find or make up a 35 mil bolt once these two are holding it in place i don't know where you know where it goes anything i'm pushing the look here there we go okay so spring washer again and then the plain washer right we're good to go okay 40 mil bolt first a bit of thread lock there we go now pretty sure that i got well i am certain it goes in this hole here so offer mr caliper up pop that through and just start winding that one in there we go right stay next you're going to be asking me for talk setting with these aren't you again don't hold your breath i'll have a look but i don't know right so we get those welding a bit further so looking good it's always nice to fit new parts isn't it actually on such an old bike you're good to buy these now because later on you might be able to get them so it's sort of future-proofing the bike isn't it really there we go okay so we still need a 35 millimeter long m8 bolt that's got a shoulder on it to fit in this hole with another oh they didn't send me extra washers did they doesn't they did that's weird because these are available very strange so let's have a hunt around for some flat washers uh our a flat washer and a spring washer as well and then we can get that one bolted up get them torqued up then we can install that adjuster screw excellent it turns out 35 millimeter bolts are pretty hard to come by extensive searching found one that was the right size the right length right pitch right thread and not in bad nick to be honest so we're gonna use that one and that's as good as it's gonna get unfortunately it's a shame that they didn't uh supply the right ones although it's the third bolt with the job because i'm pretty sure it must be available really um so super job right we see a talk setting for those now as i thought nothing in the manual so m8 we're going to do it 20 newton meters it's pretty standard for most m8 bolts on motorcycles it's 20 newton meters so there we go that's one two three if you know what this should be and you've got it in a manual send me an email with a link or something or an extract to the manual could be good to know but i couldn't find it anyway right next job is this little adjustable because you can see the whole thing swings around at the moment helplessly and that's just about with the spring just helps to control the position of this caliper relative to the disc and i imagine it would need to be adjusted you know as the pads wear but um i don't think this bike's going to get enough riding for that we're not far off at all so what did honda senders because of car tire motorcycles by the way as regards the bits we've got very few little bits left over actually so we've got the bolts and now we can open that up so we've got the special bolt which is this one here look and i think good in the old bits box yes actually had the original bolt but it was a bit worn it'd been chattering around in the old brackets which is just in there look you see that hole is slightly ovulated it's sort of like a teardrop it drops down at the bottom another reason for changing this bracket actually sorry that way around drops it goes up there's a peak in it there look upside down so you've got that you can see on the light yeah pretty cool eh okay so that is knacked that's what we've replaced anyway so we're going to use a nice new bolt and they sent me a single m6 nut which is not a nylock but it does have little serrations can you see that one there look on the back just to dig it in and of course a nice new spring but they also sent two washers which are the same upside down yes same part number so we've got two of these so i imagine that one of these goes on either side of the fork you don't want the spring sat against aluminium because it's going to chatter away and dig away at the aluminium see there's a nice steel seat to sit against so we'll use one of the washers for that it shouldn't make any difference if it's wrong because the end of the day the spring just it's variable length isn't it in today and then we've got the other one which i think should sit on the side with the nut because you don't really want the nut digging into the aluminium fork because you know again it's not going to last very long so i think we've got what we need let's go and check the diagram on the parts catalog and see if we're right okay so 16 is the bolt that just sits directly against the bracket and then the spring sits directly against the other side of the bracket so there's no washer between so the pivot bracket and the spring ah will that move like that it will want it um now obviously this bolts to the fork directly it doesn't show the fork so it's not really too much help but i they're only showing a single washer which is washer 30 washer plane six mil quantity one well they've sent me two so i wanted you i really think we should use both of them put one on the spring side against the fork i don't think it makes any difference at all so we'll do that okay that's as good as it's going to get isn't it really to be fair we're dealing with some pretty crappy diagrams uh does it say anything in the service manual i don't think it does it doesn't really give you much help does the old service manual so it'll scroll back and see if there's anything on there you see there look if i zoom in on there sorry about the picture quality again that's the the bolt there look straight into the recess on that bracket so if we come further down there might be another diagram there we go so again that doesn't doesn't tell us anything anything at all it's completely useless hmm i think that that's about it i think just tells us stuff yeah okay management decision let's do what andy thinks is right right hopefully it will keep focusing it's a bit fiddly this one so bolt that needs to go in oh this is a special one looks like a little little groove for your screwdriver it's pretty cool isn't it right so that needs to go in there now we've already seen on the diagram the spring goes directly against the aluminium which goes against my grain a little bit because we've got two washers i want to put one on the back side here another is one on the diagram but that's where i like to go and maybe we should lubricate those threads a little bit as well i think we should bit of oil yes let's get some oil okay just a drop is all we need cool mr oil can you can do it has been used on my island again nope there we go that'll do [Music] get that in the threads don't want a big blob anyway anyway right good old trousers okay in there she goes just going to sort of nurse that into the there we are into the thread hole come on you can do it flat screwdriver required okay threads are good it's nice and you can see now the purpose of it so the pads don't rub on the disc all the time basically i'd like to meet the person that designed this i really would i mean yeah i suppose you can lock that off because that's threaded inside here so you have to hold this with a screwdriver and then use a spanner obviously lock it off and just so it maintains position but of course it does allow the caliper when it's applied because the piston is going to go that way because it's on this side the claw this side of the caliper is then going to go that way so essentially the caliper is going to do that so that's why it has to have that movement but when it's in the rest position the brakes have been applied you don't want either the brake pads to be rubbing on the disc hence this adjustment bloody good i like that i like the idea how to solve the problem they shouldn't already have that's why we have sliders on modern day calipers you know sliding calipers not fixed calipers obviously um but you can also see the problem is that the caliper because it's pivoting from here it operates in an arc so your brake pads are going to wear a bit weird to be honest yeah anyway such as life okay well we can't tighten that up until the front wheels back in and then we can set the final adjustment so i reckon that's probably next isn't it now with the aim of trying to be efficient i think now will be a perfect time to refit the front mug guard before the front wheel goes back in because to fit it with the wheel in position is a bit of a ball leg to be honest so i'm seeing it hanging up from the ceiling i've got all the nuts and bolts for it somewhere so i'm going to fit the front mug guard and then carry on with the video so give me give me two minutes whiz off and get yourself a nice pot of cider a little bit of ice i'll see you shortly as if by magic the shiny front mud guard is back on the cb 750 k2 as is the front wheel installation all done so what we need to do now is adjust that caliper using that little adjustment bolt as per the manual's information so let's do that right now right brake caliper adjustment this is what mr honda says the brake caliper must be adjusted so that there is a small clearance between the fixed friction pad that's the inner one and the brake disc this adjustment is made in the following manner figure 14-15 which is i don't know just over there look right 14-15 and it's got a little window here so it says raise the front wheel off the ground it is using a suitable prop it is uh it then says loosen the caliper stopper bolt lock nuts that's the big screw turn the stopper bolt in direction a which is clockwise until the friction pad contacts the brake disc right so it's going to swing the caliper towards the disc until the friction pad contacts the brake disc when this when the when i'm off screen here um when the wheel is rotated some resistance should be noticed so it's dragging basically whilst rotating the front wheel turn the stopper bolt in direction b well that's not possible because there's spokes in the way mr honda until the front wheel rotates freely but we can do it in steps can't we turn the stop bolt in direction b anti-clockwise i don't know why they couldn't just say anti-clockwise uh an eighth to a quarter turn further and tighten the lock nut that will set the clearance okay that seems easy enough off we go right this is the best sort of shot that i can get you here that where's my little pointer that is the stopper bolt adjustment bolt here look with big flat head so at the moment wheel spins freely notice you can't adjust that bolt with the wheel turning because well we've got spokes in the way haven't we mr honda okay so we're going to turn it in clockwise as it says we'll do it in quarter turns that's quarter of a turn no not really dragging yet let's do some more i choose quart return because you know it's easy ah okay it's changed notes but it's still not really dragging yet it said some drag has to be noticeable some resistance right eighth of a turn all right well i'd say there's definitely some resistance there now it doesn't spin as quickly it is definitely dragging and it said to back it off until it stops dragging so i'll do it in like eighth turns that's pretty good that's pretty free isn't it okay and it said to back it off another another eighth to a quarter of a turn so we'll try an eighth first that's another eighth i reckon that i'll do don't you it's quite rudimentary really i think this style of break is always going to make a bit of a noise it's always going to have a tinkly noise isn't it on the when the wheel's rotating well that'll do i used a gn250 that used to make exactly the same noise all the time every day every hour every minute of riding even when it was parked not really okay what's left to do i've forgotten actually i jumped the gun i forgot to tell you to tighten the lock nut on the adjustment screw jeez let's go and do that now so there he is we can wind down the nuts what we don't want to do is disturb the position of the bolt because we've set that now so we're going to use a little flat screwdriver in there i suppose you could adjust it from the outside while it's turning maybe that's the idea and then you could do it with the wheel spinning but there's not a lot of perches on this you can see it's getting rounded off pretty quick i think we did the right way right so i'm just holding the bolts positioned now with my little bitty screwdriver whilst just tightening up the lock nuts there we go done right next job is the brake pipe this particular bike doesn't have the flexi pipe running all the way to the caliper it has a bit of hard you know brake line for the last sort of well what's that eight inches about last eight inches basically which is a bit of a crappy design in all honesty because don't forget that caliper does actually swing and it moves slightly when you apply the brake only a little bit but you know this has to flex every single time you use the brake that's not ideal is it because it does work harden after a while it should have if anything just like a pig's tail on it like we used to have a little suzuki jeeps but it doesn't so anyway um so one of the problems that i noticed when i took this whole thing apart is that the um the union what we call in england the union uh didn't really screw into the caliper very many turns it was like two or three turns and it came out and i was like that's not a lot to be honest and i don't have any more of this thread type union unfortunately i've only got the final the firemetric ones but if you look here okay can you spot the difference i'll try and give you a bit of a background so you can see it there look what's the difference well pretty obvious the difference is this one has got about a three mil extension of no thread so of course that's a you know half your threads have already gone when you try and put this one in so i'm gonna have to modify this i'm gonna have to just cut off that uh that lit that extra protrusion uh and then just put a drill bit in the end to give it a little bit of a bit of a chamfer to accept the flare of the brake pipe basically wait actually that that one hasn't even got it look maybe it should have i'll just do that one at the same time so i'll get those cleaned up modified and we've got a bit of new to me ages to find this and then brake pads for a long time um a new bit of conifer we call this which is a basically like a it's not just copper is it's like an alloy stuff uh it's very good i like it a lot it cleans up really nice and shiny and so it looks good on your bike and then we can get it made up and get the ends put on and everything and then get it bent into position and hopefully it'll look nice when it's all finished once that's done then i can bleed the brakes up and i can use dot four fluid in it because it's backwards compatible with the dot three that the bike originally had uh and then that's the end of the job so let me do what i need to do to these i'll show you how to flare up the brake pipe even though there's a video already on the channel about flaring brake pipes what the hell you might as well join me my new and then we get it put on the bike i can get it bled up and um well that'll be the end of the video but i finished it by the way it's usually quite an easy way of doing stuff when you've got a lathe it's normally using the lathe no other way oh that'll do nicely good job all right let's get rid of that one see look at that it's pretty good in it that'll work well that was brilliant super quick and it achieved exactly what i wanted to do so we've now got two cleaned up modified unions that we know gonna fit the bike and give us the maximum amount of thread possible into the caliper and into the actual uh the flexi pipe end as well okay trying to put some flares on [Music] not use this for ages i won't say since i last made the last video which was years ago i haven't used it for a while right option one only got three possibilities uh it's that one and you wanted to find out now these are a concave flare so we've got two processes to do and you put the pipe until it's level there we go you want a close-up diet all right we're close with me getting it wrong right so the plan of attacking is first of all make sure you get your nipple put on your bit of pipe first or your union on your pipe before you start this because sometimes you can't it's a bit harder to wiggle them all the way down the pipe but if it's a long pipe right the pipe should go in and be level with the edge of the die i suppose you call that crank that up right option one in we go here we go i help maybe it's that one yes it is right plonker okay so just in you go until it's yeah there's a bit of resistance there and then we're going to flick it around to option number two to turn that into a concave one there we go right it's all girls to plan i won't have to redo this bit of the video oh not bad where are we where the hell is the camera there we are look i reckon that'll work don't you yeah it's not bad at all don't do me this is turning out to be a much longer afternoon during doing allen's bike than i actually anticipated it is now half past five and i've been going since noon the joys of making a video everything takes so much longer but that's all right because i enjoy doing the videos for you guys and girls um so we've got the pipe we'll go over to the bike now we're gonna just wind this in temp you know temporary into the flexi and then we'll sort of just get an idea of how long this pipe needs to be because i need to cut it down and obviously put the flare on the other end not forgetting you've got to remind me because i do forget sometimes you've got to put the other union on the pipe first before you flare it otherwise you get to start all over again right to the bike [Music] so the pipe comes around the back of the fork to the tire well let me god and the actual fork which first of all makes it quite tight so it needs a bit of a bend in it so we'll just do that this what i like about this copper pipe is you can actually just form it with your fingers we need that to straighten up again look i'm not the best at doing this it's an art which is what it is all right it's a lot more of a step okay bear with me and the trick is to give it not one bend in one place but to curve it my thumbs are quite good at curving things i don't know you've definitely got enough on there now without blocking the camera too much there we go right let's see if we get that wound in there just to we should find him quite happily oh there we are look it's already in right so some minor adjustments on that one required we're not far off obviously it doesn't want to touch anything that's the important thing otherwise it'll chatter so we're going to bring that in a bit more so it's like missing everything now and the goal is to get to here now we could come straight across like that which will probably look a bit crap so i think we need to come down along and in and again oh there we go sorry we're going here aren't we that's not too bad right so i'm going to bend that down now we can't put the last bit of bends on because we need to put a flare on it so i reckon if we cut it about there we get a pen let's mark it with a pen now don't make it too short so i'm going to come down and then we're going to have a straight going down i reckon probably about there we can always lose a little bit i can always make it shorter you can't make it any longer that's the problem right let's get that whisk it back out again cool right let's go and cut this pipe off now when you cut in brake pipe you've got to use a proper pipe cutter otherwise you get burs and all sorts of crap and they're not expensive so get one you'll thank me one day and you want to allow about an extra five mil for the well three mil for the flare maybe i did allow for that before so we're all good much better than steel pipe to be honest there we go you get a nice a nice finish on the end you see look perfect now what we've got to do we've got to put on the other union before we forget now all we need now is another flare on there easy [Music] jeez it's getting late now i'm getting hungry when i get hungry i get grumpy and i try to rush things to get finished it'll take me about an hour to pack up so it's going at least seven o'clock before i get any food now i'm not doing lunch here either so i'm really a bit grumpy right that'll do she's gonna be rusty as his old tool sat in his box doing nothing okay right so option one three sixteenths in we go hello option two done let's hope it's right because you know this is the more critical one what have we got oh i think that'll work i reckon that'll do the trick somebody's gonna tell me off for that but i reckon it'll work right oh it'll whisk a look that's all right not in the way to the bike now i have no idea how much this footage i'm going to use it all depends how well how professional i look doing this because i'm not the greatest like i said before uh so make sure you're not catching on anything at all okay so really need to come a bit more something a bigger bend on there don't do that you stay in there mate i want to sit about there really so okay then i just need to lose a bit of the length that's what i'm trying to do at the moment well that's really good almost we're just about to touch this bolt here so we need more bend on there you see we're about half an inch too far so we really need to bend move that bend a bit further up i know you can get tools for this but in all honesty i find this a lot easier do it around my fingers you see we're coming together now i can see some editing coming on with this hang on where's my special toy there look point bendy thing so i think we're on the top one memory right hang on a minute hang on a minute i've used this for years you see it all the time in fact i might be able to do it in half actually there you go i'll bring that back out again i'm just going to move the bend a bit further up oh we're nearly there look i think we'll whack it in get this end fixed oh look it's looking really good right it's really a 11mm spanner right so it's going to carefully wind that in a lot more turns now notice on the threads much better that should do nicely right and just some final tweaks to this oh yes very neat i like that i think that's i would give that 90 percent it's not perfect but it's about 90 percent right this one tweaked up right we need a spanner for that now 17 i think hopefully i'm right yes just one more how do i do right cool here and it's not rubbing on anything i reckon that i'll do grommets i think that'll work just nice okay breaks to bleed up fat shall i give you a little close up there you go then bit of a close-up the focus is gonna be a bit weird because it's all very shiny stuff and phones don't well cameras don't like shiny stuff i think that's not bad for a first attempt on one of these bikes i think it looks pretty tidy you can definitely tell what the hell is leaking is it watermelon it is there's water behind there where's my screwdriver because there's always something in there nope let me put it away hang on tour of the workshop now yes there we are bloody water cylinder what's that under here wow look at that that's not good give that a dry out later on okay so it's not brake fluid anyway it's leaking right so there you go we've got a nice gap just trying to get to focus for you down there look if we come around here you can see running through that gap there between the mud guard and the fork we've got a gap all the way around under there so yeah hey not bad and then you know it's all been polished up my fingers while i've been working it so double double bonus okay time to get bled up that'll do right just before i sign off the video let's do the same test we did when we had the old bracket on the bike and i would spin the wheel and you would see about five millimeters of lift on the caliper it would ride up on the disc because of all the movement on that on that pivot so we'll do the same test now with the new parts and we'll see if there's any noticeable lift whatsoever right back to the bike so what you're looking for is movement of the caliper in the upwards direction as i apply the brake it was horrendous before and i can't really see from where i am can you see anything look pretty good from where i was so there you go it looks pretty fixed to me it's a million times better than it was when we first got the bike i'm telling you that now if you don't believe me go and check the video it was quite a shock in fact it was so bad i i had a gut feeling that it was it just wasn't acceptable but i had to speak to quite a few people before i really got to the bottom of whether or not it was okay um the feedback i got was oh well they're all like it that's just how they are andy just let it go and it was niggling me away and i couldn't let it go i mean once we found that that brackets where it was him once we found the bracket um that aluminium bracket had been running on the disk this bit here you know and there somewhere there look you see that shiny bit there that ridge that's the disc that's cut into there because there's been so much movement on that arm that's absolute proof that it wasn't acceptable and there's nothing really in the manual to say how much is it is too much as regards movement on that pivot so anyway it's done now we've rebuilt the caliper not popped the piston out because it was all working fine i didn't want to go down that road if the caliper is working okay you know retraction's there and everything just leave it alone um parts are getting hard to find and what you can find takes bloody ages to get to new zealand so i tried to minimize the number of parts and cost for this repair anyway it's done mud guards on wheels in and we've made up that brake pipe and we've even been on the lathe today i never thought we'd actually get on the lathe during this video but it's amazing how how useful a piece of kit like that is and it only cost me 1500 new zealand dollars and that was i don't know nine years ago it's done a lot of work it's more than paid for itself many many times over anyway crew we've got one more step closer to getting alan's cb 750 k2 back on the road very very happy the next video is going to be tackling the wiring specifically the ignition wiring we've highlighted so many faults with the ignition wiring we're going to make some modifications put a relay in there give it a direct feed to the coils we need to get the best possible spark we've got some brand new dana coils to go on we've got electronic ignition to fit to the bike we're going to bend those old crappy points and condensers we are it's going to be bloody awesome when it's finished

"JfwTLNqnQ4I": "welcome students welcome to yepmaster the school foundation program i am your chemistry teacher dr sripad so in the last class we have gone through the introduction part of the foundation program so today let us start the what is exactly the topic which we are supposed to start ok so here we are going to look into the physical classification of matter first so we start with the the basic concepts so that you can easily understand what is chemistry we have learned in the previous classes ok i think by this time we have a complete idea about the science as well so what is science exactly so when you look at the science we generally define the science as the continuous human effort to systematically understanding the nature ok so chemistry is one branch of science where we are going to learn about the atoms and molecules again atoms and molecule their composition their structure their chemical and physical properties we are going to learn so again it is taken in terms of matter ok so what is exactly the matter is so which is called as matter how to classify the matter in a physical sense how we are going to classify the matter in physical classification so all these things we are going to learn in this particular class ok so what is matter is we know that matter is anything which has mass and occupy some space for example i am a matter i have some mass and i can occupy some space similarly you are also matter you can occupy some space and you can you possess some weight that is mass ok so anything which is going to has mass and which is going to occupy some space so occupying some space and possessing the mass is generally considered that particular component or object is taken as matter for example air if you take air air whenever we as we open the door what happens air will come into the room ok i think whenever somebody is using a very well fragment scent or deodorant so as soon as the person enters the room so we people start feeling that smell so here the fume a perfume that we have used there the air component of the perfume or the the gas that is used as a perfume spreading throughout the room so it is going to occupy some space and generally we know air is going to have mass how we can determine the air has mass take two balloons let us say to a stick we are going to tie two balloons ok so if one of the balloon has a big size automatically that side that ah stick is going to be tilted ok so that side the stick will move little downside it indicates that here we are using air and here also we are using air so two balloons are filled up with air ok and air is going to occupy the space available in that balloon ok so it is going to occupy some space and it has mass so its a large size balloon way more compared to the light sized balloon ok so small sized balloon so automatically the large sized balloon has mass when compared to this one and of course this is also has mass so air is going to occupies the space that is provided to it and it is going to exhibit a weight also exhibit mass it is going to possess some mass so anything which has mass and occupy some space is matter so aries matter food for example so if you are preparing rice dal chutney etcetera if you take their weight therefore they are going to have some weight ok the pulses that we have used the food grain that we are using they are going to have some weight so the weight they are having weight and they are going to occupy some space they are going to occupy the space in the bowl right so food is best example of matter stones i think i have seen so many stones in your school ground ok so the stone is going to have some weight when have you taken the stone into your hand i think so right so the stone has some weight and ah it is going if you throw it on the ground what happen it is going to occupy some space on the earth so stone is taken as matter ok similarly clouds clouds will occupy the space right and they are going to have some weight as well because it is a water vapor water vapor means it is going to have process that is going to ah have some weight that is mass so clouds are also has mass and they are occupying some space so cloud can also be considered as matter for example if we take stars stars are present you can i think you can enjoy the beautiful stars that can be seen on a summer night when you sleeping on the terrace right so you can see the beautiful stars there ah grouping of stars into different structures you can imagination imagine different structures over there so stars are also for example sun sun has mass sun is going to occupy some space so star can be taken as matter animals like us ok human beings the cows animals buffalos dogs cats rats etc all the animals they will have some weight and they are going to occupy some space so animals are taken as matter a drop of water for example if i am taking a a glass of water water will have a weight if i take two glass of water weight will be more if i am going to take three glasses of water weight will be still more so as the amount of water increasing weight is also increasing so water is going to have some mass and it is going to occupy some space it is going to occupy the space of the glass in which it is stored so water can be considered as matter so of course we can take so many examples simply observe that anything if it is has some mass ok if it is weighing the under it is going to occupy some space then in that case that particular object can be taken as matter ok so all the for example book the books that you are using or you are taking in your bag so of course you know the weight of the books that you are taking to the school right so the way the book is matter it has some mass it has some weight and it is going to occupy some space if you keep the book on the table it is going to occupy the space so book is a matter the pen that we are using pen will have some weight ok and when you keep the pin on the table it is going to occupy some space so pennies i matter ok and the lunch box that you are taking the box will have some weight and it is going to occupy some space so lunch box can also be considered as matter so everything or anything which has mass and which is going to occupy the space can be considered as matter of course feelings like anger hungry sad all this cannot be considered as matter why that does not have weight that does not occupy some space so anything which has weight or mass and it is going to occupy some space is generally taken as matter so all these are examples i think you got an idea clear idea about the matter ok right let us move on to the properties of matter how we are going to look at the matter what are the properties of matter so let us see of course if this is the first one they are going to possess both mass as well as volume it is going to have mass and it is going to occupy some space it is occupying some space means it is taking some volume so matter is going to possess mass as well as volume for example if i take pin and let us say penny is weighing let us say 0.5 grams ok and if i am keeping the pen on a table what happens it is going to occupy some space similarly table will weigh let us say it is weighing 500 grams let us say small table ok ok and it when you keep it on ah in a room automatically it is going to occupy some space so it is going to occupy some volume so matter will possess mass as well as volume ok right this is the first property that we can observe from matter right and when you observe how the matter is made up of matter is made up of very small particles and of course we will come across how the matter was classified how it is made up of and what are the particles were known all these things we are going to learn in the next classes ok let us present scenario just observe that or just understand that matter is made up of very small particles and in these particles between these particles what is present intermolecular spaces are present so matter is made up of very small particles and between these particles inter molecular spaces are present ok and these particles attract each other and are in continuous random motion they are going to attract each other ok under they are in a continuous motion for example if i take this pen this pen will have has a mass and it is going to occupy some space so it is matter it posses mass and it is going to occupy some volume so the first characteristic is property is found out and when i look into this one the combination of so many components resulted in this pin ok so what are the particles that are present the small particles that are present in the matter are responsible for making this pen and what is if i look deep into this particular pen what happens i can see that between these particles inter molecular spaces are present so intermolecular spaces are present between the particles and one more thing that is that the particles will start attracting each other therefore the pen is in a tight position otherwise it will eat the particles if they are not attracting each other then the one particle will go this side other particle will go that side so automatically the pen will not be in a correct position so we cannot consider it as the matter so generally the particles will attract each other and see in that process they are not sitting in a silently in one position as you people sit in a class ok so it is will be in a continuous random motion if i am giving the matter to occupy this particular room automatically what happens the particles will move in all possible directions so the moment is continuous so they are continuously going to move with one another let us say for example if we are going to take a cubical box ok and within this cubical box if i am enclosing oxygen gas let us say ok oxygen gas oxygen gas it has mass ok oxygen gas as mass and also it is going to occupy some space it is going to take some space it is going to take some volume right so within this cube if i am going to ah enclose the oxygen gas let us say i have the oxygen molecules i am representing with the circles ok let us say these circles are present as oxygen molecules within the cube and when you observe when you observe these components or when you look into the complete picture of the matter what is happening there are some spaces for example if you observe each and every circle is separated from some distance so the distance that is present is generally taken as inter molecular space so intermolecular spaces are present between the molecules and the molecules are not in a silent position what they are doing they are moving in a random fashion so one molecule is moving downward other molecule is moving upward so all these things you can clearly observe in the matter that the particles are present of course the oxygen gas is made up of some small particle and these particles are present in the ah given space and they are having some distance between them and the empty space between them is taken as intermolecular space and moreover the particles are not continuing i mean sitting silently they are not silent at all they are moving in random fashion they are moving in one direction one particle is moving upward other particle is moving downward what happened during this motions of course the collisions are possible for example in your class if you are not all the students are not sitting in a silent position and in a particular position and if they are running in a zigzag motion from one corner to other current what happens the students will collide with one another the same thing is going to happen in the case of this matter as well so here they have taken gas so the gas molecules are colliding with one another during their motion so continuous motion random motion that too it is not a particular position what do you mean by random motion random means the moment is in all directions irrespective of direction it is not only along the x axis not only along the y axis not only along the z axis it is in all the directions so it is going in a zigzag fashion this way that way so one molecule is going this way other molecule is going that way so one molecule is coming from top one molecule is going from that bottom so all these particles are moving in a random fashion there is not a fixed position it is not a fixed motion it is not a fixed velocity moreover one molecule is moving with high speed one molecule atom ah the particle is moving with the slow speed so different speeds are present its not exactly all the molecules are having the same speed no different molecules are having the different particles will have different speeds they are moving in random motion so we can say that when you observe the properties of matter they possess mass as well as volume they have mass that is weight and they are going to occupy some space unprovided ok example books and pens you can clearly see and when you look into their internal structure when you go into the deeper structures of the matter you can see that they are made up of very small particles ok and moreover the particles are separated from one another and there is some space present between the particles so that space is taken as intermolecular empty space that is present ok i think we have seen how the a building is built for example you are living in a home right how your home is made up of your home is made up of ah the bricks right i think your home is containing one bedroom one hall one kitchen and one dining room etcetera right how these components are made through one small particle that is bricks so bricks are present so so bricks are responsible for making your beautiful home right so how the bricks are attached with one another the bricks are attached with one another by using the cement and other components right so the similar fashion matter is also made up of a small particle that particles are separated from one another and the empty space that is present between these particles is taken as intermolecular spaces and moreover of course the bricks will be in a tight position they wont move at all right in a for for a building when you take the bricks will not move if it is moving then the home will not stand for long time here in this case if you observe in the case of matter the particles are not continuously in a constant position they are in a continuous motion that to a random motion it is not a particular direction motion all particles are not moving in the same direction with the same velocity they are moving in a zigzag fashion one one molecule moving that corner one molecule moving this corner one molecule is moving upward one molecule is moving downward so the particles are moving in a different directions and of course since the particles are coming to near to one another how they are coming near one another because of the attractive forces that are present and some molecules are moving away from one another how they are going away from one another because of the repulsive forces that are present so inter molecular forces or inter atomic forces are in the inter particle forces are present which are responsible for keeping these molecules in a near position and moving them with the one another because of the repulsive forces repulsive forces attractive forces all these forces are operating and ah because of these forces the particles are present in that particular matter of course when we go for the physical classification as we divide the matter into different portions how the particles are arranged how the space is present how fastly they are moving all these concepts we are going to learn in the given concept this particular topic matter okay right let us see how we can classify the matter so generally we can classify the matter into five categories first one is solids i think we have come across so many solids in your daily life you will come across so many solids in your daily life from the beginning morning to evening the brush that we are using is solid ok the bucket that we are using for the bathing purpose is a solid material ok and the mug jugs are that we are using the plates that we are using for tiffen is a solid ok and the food that we are taking is of course it is a half solid cooked one ok automatically that is also can be considered as a solid so the the dress that we are wearing all come comes under solids ok liquids we are going to use so many other liquids as well water we have to use for drinking purpose we have to use it for cleaning purpose we have to use nowadays sanitation sanitizer alcohol based what is alcohol alcohol is a liquid a sanitizer we are using in a liquid form right so sanitizer is a liquid so matter sanitizer can be liquid so matter we are taking here as a liquid gas is one more the classification physical classification of matter gas if we observe the air present around us is a very good mixture of gases so it contains nitrogen gas the main portion of air is nitrogen and then we know oxygen is required oxygen is the second major component of air ok oxygen is required for existence of the life on the earth so gas is also i mean here the gas is one part of matter that is matter can be physically classified into solid liquid gas and we are going to see some more classifications one is a plasma of course what is plasma we are going to discuss all these matters and their compositions in our discussion so plasma and then we have a bose einstein condensate of course these are recently added matter classification generally in general whenever we say or if you observe the components present around you if you if you look at the component that are present around us we can clearly say that matter can be solid form or it can be in liquid form or it can be in a gaseous form so we can see the different solid liquid gaseous forms of matter in our day to day life ok plasma and the bose condensates can be seen at a particular conditions of temperature and pressure there we are going to explain what are the conditions that are required for the existence of this matter classification okay right let us look at a solids how we can explain the solid ah how to identify the solids you know the solids will have a definite shape and definite volume as well they are going to have different mass ok if you observe here the particle if you look at the arrangement they are orderly arranged and we know the small particles are arranged in a neat ordered fashion these are the particles of the solid ok as i just we have discussed matter is going to possess some mass this cube let us say this cubical form is going to has some mass it has some weight and when i put it on the table it is going to occupy some space so it is a matter and it is made up of constant particles so i am taking the inner ah v of the solid and if you see the particles are arranged in a ordered fashion and if you observe the particle here so you can clearly see the particles are separated there is a small gap that we can see here that is taken as inter molecular spaces inter molecular spaces are present so distance is present between the molecules you cannot make the molecules come closer rather than this ok and moreover how these particles are sitting side by side because of the attraction that are present so because of the attractions they have they will come closer and they will pack together so this is the case in the in in case of solids we can observe this kind of arrangement so matter can be classified into solid liquid gaseous plasma bose einstein condensate and first of all if you observe the solid solid can be clearly seen here as a beautiful ah explanation through the video you can see that they are going to have a shape as well as volume so you can see the shape and it is going to occupy some space as well okay so you can see that the particles are arranged in a beautiful neat arrangement the particles are very small and they are fixed they are fixed in their position they are not moving at all so this is the case of solids ok so if you observe these particles the particles are separate from each other and all the particles are arranged in a beautiful ordered fashion the reason is that they are going to have some attractions so attractions are playing a major role in the case of matter the two specially in the case of solids ok let us look at how we can take the solids properties so the same thing i am representing here if you observe here all the particles of the solid are arranged side by side and you can see here the gaps are present so intermolecular spaces are present so all the particles are sitting side by side in the case of solids and between the particles we have some spaces so the intermolecular spaces are present within the solid ok so here if you observe the atoms are packed in a neat orderly arranged pattern ok and it is going to possess some weight it will have some mass and it is going to occupy some volume as well space as well ok for example if you take the crystal sugar sugar crystal sugar crystal if you observe cleanly it is in cubical ah fashion or cubicle pattern and if you observe it internal structure of that one sugar crystal one sugar crystal if you take and if you observe the internal structure the particles will be arranged like this ok so in the case of solids what is going to happen the molecules are closely packed together they are closely packed packing will be very very close in the case of solids ok you can see here the packing is very very close so autumn all the molecules are all the particles of this solid are arranged in a ordered fashion that too with a closely packed manner closed packed and ah because of the closed packing can we expect a more amount of empty space within the particles for example if i am arranging the particles this way ok we cannot get any i mean space between the particle this space between the particles is very very little ok but if i am going to take the particles in this fashion what is happening the space is large now and you can also divide it of course we are going to see the arrangement of particles in the case of the solids as well as liquids as well as gases we come across the different arrangement of these solids liquids and gases so if you observe here the molecules are closely packed together with a little empty space very very less empty space is present between the molecule let us assume these balls are molecules and they are packed closely ok and when you observe the space the space present the intermolecular space or the empty space present between these particles is very very very small its very less ok right molecule cannot move freely in this case since they are packed tightly this particle can it move because here upward downward left side right side all particles are present so this cannot move at all so molecules cannot move freely so the moment of molecules is not possible in the case of solid this is a solid particle if i throw it here on the ground it will stay there only it wont move anywhere ok so the particles are arranged packly and the space empty space is very very less in between these particles so we cannot expect them to move in a random fashion so the moment is very very very less so they cannot move freely so free movement of particles is not possible in the case of this classification of matter especially solids ok hence they possess because of the arrangement and little space between the particles and since they cannot move they are going to possess definite shape they will have a particular shape and they are going to have some volume for example if i take this remote so this is having a particular shape and it is going to occupy some volume if i take this pen this is going to i have a particular shape ok and it is going to occupy some space so it is having a definite shape and as well as definite volume best example if you take rubber salt glass remote pen ok the powdered components ok sodium chloride crystals sugar crystals rubber the food grains ok all can be con taken as solids so they are going to occupy i mean they are going to have the arrangement of atoms in an ordered fashion closely packed together with a little empty space and the molecules cannot move with the freedom and because of that they are going to possess definite shape as well as definite value so solids process definite shape definite value ok of course there are so many examples you can cite with respect to the solids right students i think we have enjoyed this class today and we are going to come up with the some more concepts in the", "HbR5_Z4OpHw": "[Music] um gg all right cannabis marijuana frickin review time everybody that's what i'm talking about it is 11 30 in the morning it's time to get that first smoke on um it's the first time this product has been in canada in the legal market it's been out for a while but i have it now we're talking about the premium 5 live resin cartridge i've had a live resin cartridge in the american market in colorado and vegas both were the number one top cartridge because of the terpene content and the effect and it's not like a distillate cartridge which is probably the most common cartridge out there in the canadian market distillate is about 90 thc it varies so there's no terpenes there's no other cannabinoids in there that give you that full entourage effect when we're talking about the live resin cartridge we're talking about everything that that cannabis flower has to offer inside of this cartridge now one thing about these cartridges is thc will crystallize inside that cartridge it's very hard to smoke at that point i'm ready to smoke this cartridge when you need that hit but you can't have an intrusive scent around you well cartridges are very convenient for that we have a sticky fingers live resin cartridge 79 thc they have it in a nice little chromed out hockey puck here too very canadian of ya there it is that is a very nice consistency actually that looks very smokeable very ready to go what i'm hoping for and there's no way to actually tell is this is an actual half gram so overall happy with that little cartridge all you need to smoke this is a simple battery like this so i got this when i bought the cartridge this cartridge cost about 60 on the canadian market for a half gram with the biggest additional price on there is your federal canadian vape tax 20 vape tax on top of cartridges if it's a top product that can be worth it that's justifiable but if it's a mediocre product and i'm paying vape tax this better be [ __ ] banging just turn that in that's all you need to do so on initial hoop first hoot just hold that button give it a little bit of a preheat the oils have to come into that cartridge there you can see it's smoking a little let's just try it that hit a little harder than expected honestly but that was delicious one second [Music] whoa i was not expecting it to hit that hard that's what happens when you have a fresh battery on a fresh cartridge it tastes a little more on the fruitier side i'm actually not sure what strain that is that's in there super happy with it though because this is going to ride around with me wherever i go it'll probably going to last me five days i hit it throughout the day three four times a day that's how my cartridges go very smooth and the effect the effect is almost immediate i'm feeling jacked right now i'm feeling very good this may not last five days this may just work its way through the day this might all be all i smoke good job premium five on hitting with the cartridge i know they have several others dabbable concentrate products i am gonna get after them if you know anything about smoking the ability to blow it out your nose like that and have a smooth smoke not burn the inside of your nostrils that means that's a perfect concentration i'd say get this cartridge try it out great for family arrangements um just go and you're back to the party nobody knows what just happened the vape is gone in a matter of seconds live resin this is probably the only cartridge i'm to carry around with me [ __ ] the distillate straight up i'm all over this thank you whoa we almost forgot about the rating what are we talking about when we're talking about rating on this product this is simply delicious this is coming in high this is an eight eight i believe we are going to get better with these this is an eight eight this is a rebuy [ __ ] vape tax though big tax [Music] [Music] [Music] ah", "KTYl0Haa1SE": "Natural Stuffy Nose Remedy! Ingredients: Water, 2 handfuls dried chamomile flowers\n(or 10 tea bags). Instructions: Bring 2 quarts of water to a boil. When it boils, turn off the heat and put in\n2 handfuls of dried chamomile flowers. Cover the pot after you put in your chamomile. After 15 minutes, carry the pot over to the\nkitchen table, and put it on a hot pad. Get a towel and a box of tissues. Remove the cover and hold up the towel like\na \u201ctent\u201d over the pot of tea with your head under it. Breathe in the steam. Keep the tissue handy because you\u2019ll have\nto blow your nose every so often. Keep this up as long as you want. Breathe through your nose and through your\nmouth. You can reuse the tea a couple of times before\ncomposting it. Spicy Herbal Vinegar! Ingredients: 3 tablespoons minced onion, 3 tablespoons\nminced garlic, 3 tablespoons grated fresh ginger, 3 tablespoons grated fresh horseradish,\n3 tablespoons mustard seeds, 3 tablespoons black peppercorns, 1 or more whole cayenne\nchiles (or 1 teaspoon dried chile flakes), About 1 cup apple cider vinegar, 1/3 cup honey. Instructions: To make the herbal vinegar, mince the onion\nand garlic and put in a 1-pint jar. Grate the ginger and horseradish and add them\nto the jar. Add the mustard seeds, peppercorns and chiles. Stir them all together. Pour vinegar over the mixture to fill the\njar. There should be about 1 inch of liquid space\nabove the other ingredients. Cap with a plastic lid (since the vinegar\nwill corrode a metal lid). Let the mixture sit for 2 weeks, shaking the\nbottle daily to mix the herbs and the liquid. After two weeks, strain the mixture using\ncheesecloth so that you can squeeze the herbs to extract all of the liquid. You\u2019re almost done with your herbal vinegar\nat this point. Add the 1/3 cup of honey to help preserve\nyour mixture. Pour into a clean bottle, and label and date\nit before storing it away in your cupboard. Hyssop Oxymel: A Cold, Flu and Bronchitis\nHome Remedy! Ingredients: Hyssop (fresh or dried), good quality honey,\napple cider vinegar, jar with a plastic lid. Instructions: To make your hyssop oxymel, fill a jar lightly\nwith chopped fresh hyssop herb. (If using dried hyssop, just fill the jar\nhalf way with hyssop.) Next fill the jar about 1/3 of the way full\nwith honey. (For a sweeter and thicker preparation, fill\nthe jar half full with honey.) Then fill the jar the rest of the way with\nthe vinegar. Vinegar can corrode a metal lid, so you\u2019ll\nneed to cover it with a plastic lid, or place a barrier between the metal lid and the liquid. Place a label on it and let it sit for 2 to\n4 weeks. Strain it well. Label and bottle! Oxymels can be taken in teaspoon to tablespoon\namounts. If dealing with an acute issue, it is generally\nbetter to take smaller amounts more frequently, rather than larger doses only a few times\na day. If you have a congested cough, take this bronchitis\nhome remedy 1 to 2 teaspoons at a time at least every hour. Oxymels will keep for a long time. You can keep this in the fridge for longer\npreservation. Hyssop is safe for most people to use. It should be avoided in pregnancy and extremely\nlarge doses. Large doses of the essential oil have been\nknown to cause convulsions. Elecampane: A Natural Cough Remedys! Elecampane Honey! Instructions: Slice the roots in bite-sized pieces, not\ntoo small. Fill half a jar with them. Fill the entire jar with honey. Turn over the jar a few times a day for a\nfew days. In a few days, it\u2019s ready! Keep it in the fridge. When you have a cough, simply eat the honey. Honey also feels good on the throat as well. Also, eat the pieces of root. They are candied. If you don\u2019t have fresh elecampane root,\nyou can use half as much dried elecampane root to make the honey. Elecampane Tea! Instructions: Boil a quart of water in a saucepan. When it comes to a boil, add 2 tablespoons\nof dried elecampane root. Turn down to a simmer and do so for 20 minutes. Add honey to taste. Honey heals and soothes as well. Add a splash of lemon juice as well if you\nhave it. Strain and drink your natural cough remedy. Herbal Cough Drops! Ingredients: 1 tablespoon dried sage leaves, 1 tablespoon\ndried hyssop leaves, 1 tablespoon dried thyme leaves, 2 cups organic sugar, 3/4 cups organic\nblackstrap molasses. Instructions: To begin, prepare your hard candy moulds for\nthe mixture or lightly grease a cookie sheet or casserole dish. If you don\u2019t have a candy thermometer, then\nyou\u2019ll need a small cup of cold water nearby. Next make a strong brew of tea by combining\nthe sage, hyssop and thyme with 1 cup of water. Let this steep for 15 minutes (covered) and\nthen strain off the herbs. Use 1/2 cup of this strong tea. Next combine all the ingredients in a medium\nto large saucepan. This includes a 1/2 cup strong herbal tea,\nthe sugar and the blackstrap molasses. If you are using a candy thermometer, attach\nit to the side of the pan. Turn the burner to medium high heat and stir\nthis mixture constantly until it reaches 300 ??\u00b0F. If you aren\u2019t using a candy thermometer,\nyou can periodically test the mixture by dropping a small amount in a cup of cold water. When the mixture solidifies when dropped into\nthe cold water, it\u2019s done. It takes about 15 minutes for the candy to\nget to 300 ?\u00b0F. Once it is ready, pour into the hard candy molds (or greased cookie sheet). If you are using a cookie sheet or casserole\ndish, you\u2019ll need to start cutting the cough drop squares immediately. If you wait too long, the mixture will solidify. Keep in mind how big a cough drop generally\nis. You could also try using a knife or a pizza\ncutter. This takes about 15 minutes. You\u2019ll notice that the pan you cooked these\nin is now coated with a super hard candy coating. Once the mixture hardens, you can store your\ncough drop pieces in an airtight container and keep them in a cool place. Herbal Cough Syrup! Ingredients: 1/2 cup dried elderberries, 1/4 cup dried\nelecampane root, 1/4 cup dried plantain leaves, 2 cups water, 1/2 cup honey. Instructions: Place the herbs and water into a medium sized\nsauce pan. Bring the water to a boil, then reduce the\nheat and simmer for 20 minutes, uncovered. Strain off the herbs. You should end up with approximately 1/2 cup\nof liquid. Return the liquid to a clean saucepan. Add the honey and stir until well combined. If necessary, apply very low heat to warm\nthe honey to allow it to incorporate. Pour the mixture into a bottle, label and\nkeep in the fridge for up to one month. For children above the age of 2, use one teaspoon\nevery hour as needed. (Children under the age of two should not\nhave honey. Use an alternative sweetener for children\nunder two.) Adults can use a tablespoon every 30 - 60\nminutes as needed. Sore Throat Pastilles! Ingredients: 1 tablespoon powdered rose petals, 1/2 tablespoon\npowdered sage leaves, 2 tablespoons powdered marshmallow root, 1 1/2 tablespoons warmed\nhoney, additional cinnamon and rose powder (optional). Instructions: Mix the powdered herbs together. Warm some honey over really low heat. Add the honey slowly to the powdered herbs. The end result should be a soft doughy mixture\nthat is not too sticky. You can adjust the honey and powder as necessary. Once you have mixed the herbs and honey together,\nyou can roll them into balls. These can be used immediately or stored in\nthe fridge for a couple of weeks. Besides being great as sore throat remedies,\nthese pastilles can be used for a variety of other situations as well. Remember they are cooling and soothing, making\nthem great for hot digestive problems like ulcers and heartburn. Once you understand the basic concept of making\nherbal pastilles, you\u2019ll see there are many variations. The herbs you use can vary as well as the\nliquid that holds them together. You can substitute maple syrup for the honey\nor even use a tea as the liquid. When using water as the liquid to hold them\ntogether, you either need to consume them quickly or dry them out completely before\nstoring. Sore Throat Spray! Ingredients: 35 grams finely cut and dried cultivated Echinacea\nroots, 25 grams dried elderberries, 3 grams dried sage leaf, 5 grams minced fresh ginger\nroot, 3 grams dried licorice root, 1 tablespoon honey, about 1 2/3 cups vodka or brandy or\n1 cup vegetable glycerine and 2/3 cup water. Instructions: Place all the herbs and honey into a pint-sized\njar. If using alcohol, add it to the jar, leaving\nabout a 1/4 inch headspace.

If you want to simply make elderberry syrup,\nyou can now add honey or sugar to your taste preferences and keep it stored in the fridge. The amount of honey/sugar you add will be\nthe determining factor in how long it lasts. The more you add, the longer it will last. General recommended dose: We recommend kids\ntake 1 to 3 teaspoons a day. Adults can take 1 to 3 tablespoons per day. Step 2: Make the gummies; measure out 2 cups\nof the above juice. Add more apple juice if necessary so you have\nthe full 2 cups. Reserve 1/2 cup of the juice in a Pyrex measuring\nglass. Put it in the fridge until it is cold. Once it is cold, sprinkle the gelatin over\nthe juice and let sit for 1 minute. Bring the rest of the juice to a simmer. Then pour the hot juice over the cooled juice\nand gelatin, stirring briskly with a whisk. Continue to whisk swiftly for about 2 minutes\nor until the gelatin is completely dissolved. If desired, add sugar or honey. You might find it is sweet enough already. Pour the mixture into silicone molds or pour\ninto a glass pan. Put them in the fridge to harden. Once they are hardened, they should remain\nhard. Remove them from the molds. If using a glass pan, cut them into cubes. Store in a closed container in the fridge. They should last several weeks. We recommend eating 1 to 3 small gummies a\nday.", "1NGh8PkjoZM": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music]"}
