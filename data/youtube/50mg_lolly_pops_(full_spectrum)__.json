{"1x8QHyBSoOI": "[Music] [Music] [Music] hey I'm sorry kids and welcome back to star cash babies oh wait we're bout to getting something a little different it's legal doesn't get you high but definitely has the possibilities to make you feel better health-wise but don't hold me on that if you're under 18 I don't know how you got here because this review is eight restricted let's go so I want to give a shout out to creating better day to get it CBD for allowing me to sample their piece pops and these are CBD infused lie pop cycle would I don't know what that count is it edible I don't think it's a candy yeah whatever but um it's 50 milligrams CBD infuse high potency 100% natural so uh what a texture it's weird just where is a weird texture oh babe one second it's a weird texture ingredients okay I can look at we talked about that later once again this is lollipops you go weird in your mouth then because the texture feel weird mm-hmm okay okay yeah Wow I'll talk to you about that later uh-huh it is piece pops from creating better days 50 milligrams CBD infuse now I understand why it's packaged like this I'm in the beginning you saw you know it's like you know there's a texture on it and but once you get past that that it's like oh it was a rough texture but you suck past that a bit and you get to the extra lollipop now I think is this is porn ain't never lied it says high potency a hundred percent natural industrial hemp it is potent now I've seen the reason it's not like a real a little you know blow pocket it over the wrapper and you throw it away or you have a collar lollipop this is like a resealable there's not a lollipop that you eat in one go I ate it in one right well it's a real under an hour I mean it took a while because it's rather thick and you feel the effects of it to me it was just a relaxing feeling but I know it you know again it's 50 milligrams of CVD so sucks up now put it back in the package that's why they send this resealable I understand now because it's not a lollipop to eat in one setting it is effective it's not what it's not this is the second product from them it's not one that I really want to because and it's a sour apple you get the idea of Apple I'm not really so much getting a sour forget the Apple and you're tasting the CBD so it's for me it's not the most pleasant of taste but again it's not a lollipop that you will have like a regular lollipop where you just suck at it continuously this is get your dosage put it back in there and seal it up go back for some more later on so is this something I recommend yes because again this is like a candy you're gonna sit and just eat it till it's done what again maybe it depends on where you're sitting where you are you could just be kicking at home and have the whole lollipop but I understand the packaging because it's again not for you to consume in one sitting I'm ingredients my glasses on I see if I can read this you know I have my jaw amplified of the CBD oil sir or for the health service for the Merrimack natural apple natural apple flavoring this product has not been on yeah hey we know that and if you wanted to get the whole lowdown on the piece pop I love it you have the bar code you can scan it and you know everything that is going on with this again he's a piece pops and it's a good name piece pops because again it was very relaxed and I was out driving loose I was headed I think I was all about the place yesterday but it was very I felt it that was like oh this really works so yes I would definitely definitely recommend it but if you do remember it's not a lollipop of regular lollipop people assume in just one sitting that's why it is packaged in a sealable package it sucks um now suck some later and no dad no guys I'm out", "NzYJBYx0w58": "spritzee my doing guys I'm in the bathroom but don't mind me I'm just it's quite at least I am like halfway done with the hemp bombs jolly bombs good Apple 40 milligrams CBD labor I feel relaxed it's really smooth you don't you can't really taste the CBD it just tastes like a lollipop but I'm calling I'm chill like yeah I really like it ten bombs one of my favorite bc bt brands i first tried it went ahead like a massive headache and cramped when i was working at the Crofts you know like yeah i went to an ABC store and just bought the dummies and it helped so i wanted to try the lollipop but now I just know I just babe CBD illiquid but I have recommend that this flavor so good if you like green apple it's okay yeah but our perpetuates aren't the perpetuates love but if you love being be loved peace out guys", "3y4TTMbD2tI": "okay so the last time I was sitting here face to face with you guys I was talking about Coco dogs do you guys remember what that stuff was that was a weird chocolate like candy that kind of looked like actual little green dogs in a glass jar if you guys don't know what I'm talking about I'll have the link right up here in the top right kind of give you up to speed but I need you more recently I actually got something else in the mail and I want to talk to you guys about that because other than the coconuts which are actual candy this stuff you're getting that camera guy this is just CBD stuff and I actually have another packaging tube that helps matter of fact the company of this the acronyms in the name so look at that so this stuff is actual CBD infused gummy candy and unlike the last stuff that I talked about that this stuffs are actually kind of real it's not it's not just like 100% candy chocolate that's made to look like you know a green ugh the stuff in this little plastic jars actually I mean if you want to want to get technical is somewhat of a psychoactive unlike um that that chocolate stuff that I talked about before so here's the funny and ironic part about all of this you know you look at these two things these two jars full of you know it looks like simple harmless can you buy it like the supermarket and you think about the last thing I talked about which was the coconut one looks like something that you could get arrested immediately for for just having a jar on your person whereas this this stuff right here looks like something that you could waltz into any preschool and you start handing them out to kids without anyone batting a single eyeball and that's the funny part about all of this like it's just the way look how innocent this stuff looks it's crazy it doesn't it doesn't make any sense because it will in the state of Florida you got to be 21 at least from from what I recall but actually by this stuff even though it's completely harmless so we got here is uh neon poppers and everyone's favorite sour gummy worms i realistically they both taste almost exactly alike it's just they're different shapes from the shapes and sizes you can I don't know if you're getting that camera move but there are a whole bunch of little smiley faces there don't worry it on ecstasy but before I begin guys I'd be remiss to not kind of show you some one of the basics that you need just in case you guys don't really understand is where it comes from well what it's actually all about so many of you probably know about the stuff but maybe this is your first time learning about stuff like what is it I've never heard of this before CBD is that like LSD is it gonna like make me see pink elephants and ceiling fans with built-in swimming pools so let me explain really quick just exactly kind of the gist about it is got my handy-dandy whiteboard here perfectly by the way before I begin I'm not a medical expert so don't take my advice as I'm some sort of doctor or something yeah I totally left that field I mean I know I have the Asian face and everything but don't be alarmed because I definitely left the medical field I left to pursue a YouTube career where I rake in around $13 a month honestly the age of 40 is right around the corner and I still have absolutely no idea what I want to do for the rest of my life so for all you outgoing recent high school graduates that are kind of freaking out about the whole real world thing and have absolutely no idea what they want to do yet don't worry cuz my book - way worse so I'd say a majority of you guys watching this video are probably more familiar with THC not too much can be said about CVD like I said earlier and there's still a common misconception about this kind of stuff especially the top of gram of certain psychoactive effects THC as everyone knows is the most active ingredient in the Disco salad this is the stuff that gets you intoxicated or is in simpler terms hi as I'm gonna do my best to try to avoid super confusing medical top of big science Awards because trust me there was a whole rabbit hole science terminology that this can all really boil down to alright so let's try to understand just exactly how THC you know gets you up there by the way before I begin try your best to not be offended by this little placemat behind here just in case you're one of those type of people basically everyone has in their bodies two types of cannabinoid receptors so let's just call these guys CB 1 and then CB 2 THC only binds to one type of cannabinoid receptor or CB so the cb1 receptors are usually found in the brain unlike the nervous system lungs liver and kidneys and the cb2 receptors are usually found somewhere in the union system there actually might be other CB receptors but that's totally not the topic here by now you probably can guess which of the two receptors THC binds to and that's actually this guy the cb1 receptor so THC see th see why not so THC is basically something that activates or stimulates that receptor and that causes like that cool rewarding effect or like that happy feeling that sometimes people get sometimes too much of it in some cases can get you was seeing like really weird like pink elephants magical dragons or like ceiling fans with built-in swimming pools and unfortunately for some people that cb1 receptor can be blocked and that euphoric feeling that many of groans so custom - just really doesn't work out for them but if you're one of the more majority lucky bunch then well Cheers now one like it's a brother ii cv receptor deals more with things like inflammation and pain management you know these can usually be found in like the gastrointestinal system and this is probably why CBD has a potential to help out people with like PTSD anxiety or other types of weird inflammation that goes on in the digestive tract or like around the body so okay let's break it down in a simpler example and this is lifted from green relief by the way they put it this way just imagine you consume cannabis and the THC and CBD are like a whole bunch of keys which are you know and searched for a lock to open those locks being the receptors these guys they click together with the proper key isn't different messages or scent you know all throughout your body so I'm like THC CBD doesn't exactly bind well with the cb1 receptor so really you kind of just almost don't really feel anything and if you really wanted to you have to take way more in the suggested limit but the worst thing that can honestly happen is like a slate rosiness or an insane state of calmness okay back to the talking Asian you really want to be careful with buying some of this stuff because a lot of the people that sell this kind of product aren't really will informing what exactly they're selling you so like last week before I actually got these things and you know the local vape store looking around for you know products that were similar the only reason I didn't is because the prices online are vastly different than what they are on stores they're actually kind of cheaper online to be honest and the stores are a little over there something like this and a store would probably cost you around 70 bucks online these things are like mid 50s or mid 60s so I walk into the store and I'm like you know I'm asking about him you know I'm asking about this type of stuff and I was asking like what's the whole thing about this almost immediately he just goes yeah bro stuff is totally worth the dude I'd like three or four of them and I was like totally gone in like five minutes dude I was I was I was surprised I was I didn't even know what to say you know before I even go in the store I kind of knew what the stuff was it wasn't well it's not exactly the most complicated thing to understand when he when he said he was gone he was like gone like with like 17 E's that's how gone there's this like his description was and I was you know I was taken aback I was no surprise you know so like three or four seconds after that there was like this like dead silence in the entire store and the only thing that I thought to myself was like dude I really hope this guy does not smoke weed because he's probably the first person that'll overdose on marijuana don't go into these stores thinking that you just found like an insane goldmine of like magical stuff because it's it's not it's not it's not that kind of stuff especially if you're in a state that still doesn't have fly solid recreationally illegal because it doesn't matter if you do that stuff and if CBD does get you like that I sure hope you don't take anything with THC unit so yeah this video is made way back in 2019 so I'm sure 10 years from now we can probably take a look at this kind of video and have a good laugh at it considering the fact like how strict the laws were on like you know this kind of stuff especially the ones regarding disco spinach because those right now even in states where it's legalized that's still federally illegal and it's classified as a schedule 1 drug okay so one of the part that probably wouldn't have you fast forwarded to the the actual product I was able consume a good amount of the bag well in the jar in the past 24 hours I didn't exactly read up on the recommended dose but I guess I should have since this was sort of a hefty sized jar at 300 milligram over 1000 1000 milligrams total so according to the little jar thing here it says that it's approximately 72 pieces you guys can read that there so thousand milligrams 72 pieces you do the math what's a thousand divided by 72 so you're looking about 14 milligrams per little candy thing well this guy this one's I think this I think there was a I think there's more gummy worms was there this had 142 pieces this is the smaller so if this stuff is still closed this has 72 gummy worms in here Oh this one had 148 smiley faces so 1000 divided by 148 okay so about 7 grams 7 milligrams of CBD and you show these little smiley face gummies usually the recommended daily doses I think it was between 15 to 25 milligrams for the stuff don't quote me on that I'm sure everyone's body chemistry is a lot different so in order to affect someone else it could vastly depend on like your size in your weight so my guess is the gummy worms here that have yet to be consumed will be a little bit stronger so I have to eat these in moderation because these guys on the other hand I kind of was just popping in like candy I forgot this was a CBD candy thing like I actually started eating them like as if there were something from like the candy aisle at Walgreens so you pop these in your mouth obviously consumer eager and they literally it's candy there's no hint of like you know when you have like the actual edible stuff from the other stuff you can get a taste of the good stuff this Kandee complete freaking candy so those a bit skeptical at first and how this helps with certain problems like anxiety and pain and you know while I didn't really have the laddering his idea was something that was pretty salient especially when driving around like the state of Florida some of you know me and the majority of my content in this channel is usually you know automotive related useless content right now while I've totally loved cars I absolutely despise driving on public roads that's that's a given fact I love cars but I hate driving and again I live in South Florida so this is kind of known as God's waiting room this is a place where older people move after they've realized that they're too old for other old people they hung out with but you know here's the thing it's not just the elderly which which are kind of terrible at driving a majority the people that drive here I feel like more than half of them have gotten their driver's license from a happy meal and because of this driving around in the state of Florida it kind of puts me on a weird edge the things I can definitely say that this stuff helps me out like like immensely I can't tell you how how much this stuff actually kind of works especially driving it gives me the nice reliable feeling that I'm not gonna get sideswiped by like a Corvette every 13 seconds anybody comes in a whole different types of forms you can get it as popcorn tinctures like something you can drop into say if you don't want any candy if you're someone that's trying to lose weight don't want to delve into the whole unhealthy candy eating process you got chips even got like CBD beef jerky and so they they put CBD and like act like a lot of things nowadays and I know this might be a totally unpopular opinion but I think edibles of anything is the most safest and best way to consume any type of whatever the help no matter what anyone says I think the whole inhalation of smoke and everything really messes with your whole body chemistry you know scarring of the tissue and the lungs and all that weird stuff so hopefully guys this was able to give you a sort of introduction of the whole alternative world of CBD let me know in the comments below it sure not only helped me but it helped anyone else that's trying to you know figure more stuff about figure out more stuff about this stuff other than that guys I got nothing else for you if you guys wanna help support my channel or visit my website it got merged stickers hats and other things literally out here calm and click everything yeah I don't I'm not a very good salesman I just had to say that at least the bare minimum I'll see you guys in the next video in the next vlog in the next whatever peace [Music]", "-LJbTRZHAPs": "hello hi it's ritzy I'm

visit our website or follow us on Facebook and Twitter to keep up with the latest UC TV programs I'd like to welcome everyone I see a few new faces out there I see a few new faces out there so I'll just give a brief history of medicine of cycling and the mini medical school we started medicine of cycling with a very simple mission to improve the health care and the quality of care that cyclists receive as it's turned out that's been a very complicated thing to achieve but the mini medical school is a really important part of that because we've met so many incredible people over the past few years that are experts in their field they also happen to race bikes or ride bikes on the side and they're very passionate about the sport and the sport as we all know is very unique in the sense that you know you're moving you're out it there you know in in the wild and on the roads a lot of unique challenges facing medical professionals that are that are dealing with the sport of cycling so and there's lots of different ways to get involved with us we have some research projects that are ongoing you can join our mailing list which has all sorts of interesting tidbits that we send out from time to time and I certainly encourage all of your medical professionals that you work with massage therapists physical therapists MDS etc to you know if they're interested in cycling definitely have to them reach out reach out to us we also have a website where we publish a lot of guidelines and publications that would produce concussion guidelines and concussion assessment cards there's some articles about hip pain knee pain lots of topics that you know we've been covering in the medical school we have articles on our blog at medicine of cycling calm and the slides for this evenings presentation will be posted tomorrow morning by the office of CME and I guess the last bit before we get started is you know please give us some feedback you can reach out to us on twitter we're met of cycling or reach out to us either via phone call or an email address which is available on our website we really want to make this better in the coming months and years and having your feedback is a really important part of that heather schwartz is a registered dietician who earned her undergraduate degree in nutrition at cal poly san luis obispo while on a soccer scholarship she under MS and nutrition from San Jose State and completed her internship at UCSF for the past seven years she's worked at Stanford with a heart and lung transplant team executive health program and is the lead dietitian in the nutrition clinic where she provides medical nutrition therapy to prevent and manage health issues like diabetes and weight management she also provides nutrition counseling and health coaching to athletes of all caliber from amateur to professional with a special passion for cyclists so let's welcome Heather Schwartz good evening thank you so much for joining us tonight I'm Heather my last name my new last name is Garza but I haven't updated it professionally yet I'm still getting used to that rolling off my tongue so if you google me Heather Garza Heather Schwartz both of them are are out there and he mentioned a passion for cycling and out of all the sports and athletes that I work with cycling is the first thing that pops up because I got engaged on a commotion tandem in Monterey so that's a big part of it but it certainly started a lot before that I used as transportation and in grade school living out in the rural parts of San Luis Obispo and college I did a lot of cycling for fun and volunteered with the Cal Poly cycling team and also with the triathlon team doing a lot of nutrition coaching and then that kind of morphed into getting a great group of friends around we did a lot of the more cyclists and I ended up meeting my husband who was actually a pro triathlete but cyclists to start with it UC Davis so cycling kind of runs in my veins and it's something that we talk about every single day whether I want to or not um it certainly is a big part of our budget I can tell you that much mine and his um and so that's a little piece about me I'm quite the casual speaker I would like to take your questions while we go but I've been informed that due to some time constraints and some efficiency we're gonna take questions at the very n so if you could please write your questions down for me I very much would like to answer each one and at the end I also have my email at the lot on the last slide and we'll get to that too all right so to get started I've got a couple objectives for us tonight my first one is really to give you some handy tools we can walk away with tonight so I want you to actually be able to sit here and calculate your true number so you get to walk out of here tonight knowing how much fluids you need on a daily basis but also during rides and I also want you to be able to walk out of here with an approximate number of calories that you knew on it that you need on a day-to-day basis but then also during rides so that's my goal for you tonight and we're going to do that we're going to accomplish that by first looking at hydration which is probably if you had to choose water over food on a ride I would hope that you'd choose water and so we can talk about how much you need when you need it and how to get it in what kinds of fluid your body needs and when during your ride and then also of course after you ride for repletion purposes the second objective is really focusing on food and fuel again same idea when how much how it's how we're going to get it in and before during and after your ride and if we have time we'll get into supplements or ergogenic aids I did not include that in my slide presentation but I can certainly answer any questions and tell you what the latest and greatest literature has to say so first nutrition in and out of the saddle really different concepts in the saddle you have extremely high calorie needs based on Mets or metabolic equivalents you might need 1213 up to 18 times the amount of calories on the bike then you do off the bike just to throw out some numbers there so you can appreciate how different your body and your body's fuel needs are for most of us sitting in this room we need a diet that looks something like 60% carbohydrate and carbs are those starches and sugars like fruits and whole grains dairy products your pastas and your breads about 20% protein eggs fish chicken beef lentils tofu about 20% fat hopefully most of those being healthy fats from plant-based foods a little bit coming from animal products but then when we look at race day needs or ride needs not necessarily R in a competitive event but even just a leisurely ride your needs change so they go from that everyday macronutrient distribution to something quite significantly different and that's because when you are doing aerobic activity such as cycling no matter what speed or cadence you're pushing your body prefers to use carbohydrates as its fuel so it looks at that it looks at protein and goes add those are way too much work to break down and deal with right now we're gonna do carbs carbs are quick and easy and we all know that right hard day you drink the beer you chocolate almonds whatever you know the baguette whatever it is you know it's the quick up picker-upper right and that's what your body is craving when you're cycling ideally for everyday nutrition you also want to distribute your calories pretty evenly throughout the day and there's more and more research coming out that's really promoting this as the most healthful way to maintain your weight and or lose weight if you need to and/or gain weight if you need to so we're literally looking at distributing your calories pretty evenly throughout the day so not crescendoing which is what most of us do right we diet at breakfast and we're going to start our diet and Doug Fister right we're going to eat a small bowl of cereal and a little milk and a giant coffee right and then lunch job we're going to go out we're gonna be really swish still good we got all this willpower we're going to be pretty good we're going to half the sandwich and then holy schmoly three o'clock comes around right and what do you do you go for the snacky stuff the crunchy stuff this week more salty stuff and then you have a giant whopper of a dinner and maybe a top it off with a Ben and Jerry's right so your calories kind of crescendo unfortunately most of us do most of our exercise in the beginning part of the day either morning or mid-afternoon so we're burning our calories we're expending our calories in the beginning the day but we're taking in our calories at night which really causes the body to go into this feast and famine situation and let me tell you we're real good at surviving right we've been around we've started a long time ago we're still around the reason is because we're so good hoarding extra calories so when you go into that feast and famine mode it puts quite a bit of stress on your body and generally we are excellent hoarding so any extra calorie you eat you hold on to and lastly I put on or your hunger and thirst up there because we can talk numbers all night long but when it comes down to some of the best cyclists in the world have no idea exactly how many calories I need exactly how much fluid they need I'm sure their trainers are throwing it down their throats but they don't actually know the numbers none of us here I don't know my exact numbers they're all estimates upon estimates upon estimates so really if you listen to your body meaning that when you feel hungry you eat when you feel thirsty you drink we find that that in combination with eating healthful foods in a nice even distribution tends to promote the most health all right we've looked at studies where people know exactly how many calories and grams of protein and grams of fat they need and those people don't tend to do any better or worse than people who have no idea and are just going by their instincts so I'm not up here trying to tell you that you need to know your numbers and what I'm hoping to do is show you what kind of numbers your body might need and then I want to translate that into food right so I want to give you something that you can work with last time it lasts the excuse me on the slide is changing possibly changing your diet and hydration for cycling needs worth it you know it sounds like it's a lot of work especially if you've done something for a long time you're satisfied with your performance maybe you're like now you know what do I need to worry about it well let me tell you let me tell you why I'm a pretty good car salesman I do this all day long with patients so let me tell you why you might want to think about changing your habits a bit first is is quantitatively most cyclists even creational cyclists you want to go faster you want to go harder you might want to go longer right even the novice cycler those are kind of are a lot of our aspirations then of course as you kind of move up the ranks you're looking at you know kom so you've got Strava going on you know you're racing your next-door neighbor to work what have you and so then you eat so there's these quantitative things that we put a lot of value into and nutrition can certainly help you meet all of those goals meaning going faster going harder and going longer on the qualitative side it can also make you feel better it can make you enjoy your exercise more you can might be able to enjoy your surroundings more you're certainly going to be more aware of cars or people around you and you'll recover faster and if you're well hydrated and well nourished in a ride you actually do more good for your body I mean that your body actually gets more out of that than if you go into it dehydrated or under fueled or / fueled where you can actually do some detriment to your body so adequate hydration nutrition is just absolutely in my biased viewpoint and paramount to to enjoying your your ride and doing satisfactory on your ride as well and then is it worth your time I should have put money to because that's a big driving factor let's be honest so this is a discussion that I have with my husband who's not a dietitian and but it has our living room as bike so I'll just say that we don't have art we have bikes on the walls and it's a constant discussion we have is that he drops you know a small fortune on you know the latest the latest helmet that just came out we've got you know a toe a it's all over the place we've got you know seat posts that are 30 grams lighter than the seat posts from last week right to shave off 30 grams I once showed him in sugar cubes what 30 grams was and he was like I paid that each sticker cubes like 300 bucks and like yeah right maybe just eat less sugar I don't know but um so certainly there's a financial advantage to to put in putting a lot of effort into your hydration nutrition before you go out and you spend the big bucks on the aero equipment not knocking aero equipment whatsoever and there's some great research that suggests that having all the best Specht out gear possible in a time trial of about 40k or so in a wind tunnel with a highly you know fit athlete and endurance athlete if you give him all of the best aero equipment out there you might be able to shave off five to six minutes off of a forty K alright if the person goes in same person same wind terminal same conditions a decent bike but not fully specked out and you give him no nutrition or very poor nutrition poor hydration he might be up to 12 minutes off his time so very significant or you can appreciate that in all the research that we have is actually a meta-analysis done i suggest that nutrition and hydration actually saves more time on the bike then does the best aero equipment money can buy so you know in the flipside my husband is like yes but if i combined both right that's where that gets me oh and this was actually picture of one of my husband's bikes when i first met him and i just thought it was the funniest thing because he has it on his scale everything goes on the scale everything's like how much does it weigh right and he got this bike down i think was one of his rode bikes down to 14 pounds right which is ridiculous um but yet he had gained about six pounds in a time that I'd met him I'm a really good Baker I love baking and so I was like ooh I don't know how that works out in the long run so moving on a hydration and that's where I really want to do a lot a lot of focus and I and hope you get some good information out of this and again every day hydration uber important every day hydration certainly Trump's hydration just on the bike if you go into a ride dehydrated no matter how much you drink on the bike your body is not going to be replenishing it tissues properly you will be in a deficit and you will be chasing that dehydration probably for the next day maybe up to the next two or three days so certainly you want to go into your rights hydrated and how do you do that well you start with around 30 to 35 MLS per kg so if you take your bodyweight divide it roughly by 2.2 for those of you have devices or smartphones on you when you multiply it by 30 to 35 MLS per kilogram and you get a nice big number somewhere around 2000 my guess would be somewhere between 2,000 and 3,000 and that would be your everyday fluid needs and that's enough to meet you know our bodies are over 80 percent water so that is it's enough to kind of keep your body in equilibrium so you stay nice and cool you can also stay nice and warm it allows good tissue perfusion so your mouth isn't dry your eyes aren't dry your skin is nice and hydrated and our brains float in water so you can appreciate what happens when there's not enough water for the brain those are your office mates or your friends or family they get really grumpy and offer them some water next time it does wonders actually quite quickly and there's great research study about three years ago done on both amateur and also professional athletes and athletes of all different calibers and all different sports actually most of it was done on basketball players but it's also football players cyclists and triathletes and what they found is that just a slight change in your weight from before your ride and after your ride just a slight weight change reflects a dehydration that can result in a significant decline in your performance performance meaning not just physical performance not just you know how many Lots you're pushing how many how many Mets you're pushing but also your your qualitative performance when how much did you enjoy a ride when did you perceive that you were getting tired - the perception of fatigue significantly declined so example my husband weighs about hundred 1765 pounds which is roughly 75 kgs so if over a two-hour ride he comes back and he weighs about 3 pounds less his performance probably suffered by about five percent so over a you know to have a ride probably about six minutes he suffered if he's looking at his at his time and that's his marker and I can spot right away when he comes back when he's dehydrated generally cuz he's very grumpy and in his his walk over to where he lines his Garmin with his Garmin software whatever that is how they talk to each other he usually comes by and gives me a kiss and then go straight to the Machine if he's dehydrated I get no kiss so that's how I figured it out so let's talk individual hydration needs on the bike so let me back up the last slide which is everyday nutrition everyday hydration you need about 3035 MLS per kg every day on average give or take every day and so for him that's about almost three liters so those liter water bottles I think someone has been up there it's about three of those a day and when I say fluid I mean I'm sorry it doesn't have to be water it can be fluid and I mean much to the chagrin of many health care providers out there we now know that coffee counts so all of you Phil's fans can-can cheer and because coffee now counts Oh coffee tea count as fluid um and you know your juices your soups all of those things count as well probably one of the best indicators of hydration since I don't want anyone to go home and count the milliliters or fluid that they drink is the color of your urine alright the lighter it is the better the darker it gets the more dehydrated you are if you have a kind of lemon colored ear and you are probably dehydrated then probably have been for about 12 to 18 hours already alright so take a look in the bowl that's a really good barometer of your hydration status and that includes when you come back from a ride your urine should still be very nice and light colored it's a great barometer so let's talk a little bit of numbers there to help you figure out exactly what you needed on a ride best way to do it as a sweat rate that's something that you can do at home and it's not this is something that you don't have to do if you're out there for recreational rides less than an hour but if you're out riding for more than an hour if you're riding at high intensities if you're doing some hill hill climbing if you are in heat or if you're doing a mall if you're multi-sport athlete I do recommend doing this wet rate just to kind of get a grasp but on how many cages you need and what kind you know if you want to space out if you're going to use fluid on the course to see how many miles apart the aid stations are this is a really helpful really helpful tool so you take your pre ride wait wait let's say you're going to ride at 8:00 in the morning before you go eat breakfast you hop on the scale and you look at your weight all right come back from your ride you check your weight and I've got two numbers you subtract those ones from each other and you multiply it by 16 ounces which is approximately um how much fluid is in in one kg then you take that number which is probably pretty darn small and hoping and you're going to add all the fluids that you drink during your ride so if you had two water bottles you have two cages on your bike each water bottle is generally 20 ounces all right there are some water bottles that are up to 28 or so but most of them are 20 ounce bottles so we're 24 if you can fill a model way the very top but for spillage and whatnot we say 20 just to be safe but if you can do it go with 24 and so you add those two together and you get how many ounces you've had over how many how long even riding and it's based on hours not minutes and so then basically do a little divide dividing so you do a plus B you get that total you divide it by the hours of ride that's how much fluid approximately that you need per hour so an example here my husband goes out on a two-hour ride he lost a pound a kilogram and a half and we multiply back by the fluid that's going to take to replace that we get 24 ounces he also and then he drank 40 ounces so he drank two bottle bottles of water on this ride so over two hours he's had 64 ounces left his body in the form of fluid and he's taken in 40 ounces so we have a total of 64 ounces divided by two hours so 32 ounces per hour right so what this is telling me is that he comes back dehydrated right and this is the what's recommended by the ACS mmm-hmm and there's some insensible losses as well so based on this you can kind of come up with how many how many ounces of fluid that you need to take with you or that you need to find on your ride right temperature change generally increases your fluid needs and we don't have a set calculation so there's not necessarily a positive correlation between temperature and fluid needs and that we can actually quantify so to speak but generally absolutely and you'll see that but because you'll probably losing more weight right on your ride and so certainly if you're you know writing in the Bay Area to temperate climate and you and you're going to go to Colorado Springs and do some riding and you're certainly going to want to do your support you can recalculate your sweat rate anytime you like so this is just a sample of the hydration schedule that's been recommended by the ACSM which the American College of Sports Medicine for cycling one or two hours before we're hoping that you get in at least two to three cups of fluid again it doesn't have to be water two to three cups of fluid in a first and an hour two hours before you ride then right before you ride thirty minutes maybe in the car ride to the parking lot where you're going to ride or while you're getting ready you want to sip on another at least one to two cups of fluid or eight to sixteen ounces if you're planning on going on a long ride again long ride being defined as over 60 minutes you probably want to look at maybe substituting that water with some kind of carbohydrate source so you might be wanting to do half juice half water you might want to switch to a Gatorade or something with a little bit of carbohydrate again that only applies if you're going to be riding for longer than an hour and then again if you're going wrong or for an hour you probably want to be sipping on something every 15 minutes on your I know this is a really tough number to swallow on the bike it's very hard for me to do that and I can appreciate how it's very difficult to UM add this new habit but it certainly is a habit that can be formed and but it does take effort often times you recommend using I'm like if you have a site kilometer every five miles is generally about 15 minutes or so depending on how fast you're going but about every five miles on your site kilometer is a good way to go up ya need to drink something I need to have a gulp or two of water right and then within an hour after you come back from your ride we'd like you to have another at least three to four glasses of water or flew it again and it sounds like a lot and I can appreciate that and water is weight and most cyclists don't want to carry a lot of weight on them and I know that's a big barrier as well and but I think that if you tried it if you were a guinea pig on yourself just about two or three times I think that you would want to continue to have it because again you'd feel better you'd recover faster and you'd certainly be able to go faster harder and longer so how to hydrate so I just mentioned some barriers there general rule of thumb drink four to six times an hour it's a great way to get an adequate amounts of fluid and so sports drinks versus water drinks on the ride versus water on the right excuse me and so it's quite controversial and I think at the end of day it comes down to personal preference and flavors a lot of people don't like a lot of the sweetened beverages out there and they rather do it with food right you can either eat your carbohydrates or you can drink them again this mostly applies to cyclists who are riding for longer than an hour and if you are running longer than an hour a CSM and every other sports body out there does recommend some kind of fluid that contains carbohydrate all right so switching over to a Gatorade or Powerade and accelerate some of hammers drinks out there you can make your own there's plenty of websites out there there for pennies on the dollar you can make delicious homemade tasting carbohydrate drinks but not only do you want to replace the electrolytes that are being lost through your sweat and that your muscles are using but also the carbohydrates and some of the electrolytes and those drinks actually help your body absorb the fluid that you're trying to drink that actually grabs the fluid and helps get it into the gut into the tissues a little bit faster than if it was just water by itself and we find that the energy distribution to the cells in the tissue increases significantly so practice hydration proficiency aka try to form a new good habit around hydration it takes time it's not easy you're not going to get it every time in fact I've gone out and rides and completely forgot water bottles I think most of us have done that at some point but you know certainly again try to be a guinea pig for yourself and at least a couple times really try some of the guidelines that I'm recommending I think that you'll find it extremely beneficial so some of the things we talked about doing with it with some of the triathlon teams that I coaches we talked about practicing you know grabbing your water bottles during rides especially like on hill climbs or in peloton's it's not easy it takes some scale to do that you're certainly not going to drink if you don't feel comfortable grabbing your bottles and switching them and what-have-you switching hands that can be a tough thing and swapping cages use of jersey pockets if you have hydration in there and then timing is really big so we try to say drink before you're thirsty if you wait till you're thirsty on the ride your urine is probably already getting dark you're probably already dehydrated you're certainly not at peak hydration during your ride so along that line which sports drinks are best and there's some really narrow guidelines that that research has given us to choose our carbohydrate enhanced fluids and those are that if you're riding between zero to three hours we really want you to have a carbohydrate source that's mixed in the type of sugars it contains so we want a carbohydrate source that has glucose fructose sucrose maltose dextran or other kinds of glucose polymers we find that the mixture of carbohydrates greatly enhances energy distribution in the body and also fluid or person so when you look on the back of the of ague or you look on the I'm sorry not goo a Powerade scoop or if you look on the back of Gatorade it will actually list the ingredient label and now what I'd like you to look for and the next time you put one of those things up if you do is to make sure that there's different types of sugar so shouldn't just say just glucose or just sucrose or just high-fructose corn syrup it should be a mixture of different kinds of sugars we also want to make sure that it's about a six to eight percent carbohydrate solution and does it say that on the label absolutely not which is why I've listed some examples here for you we'd also like it to have some sodium in there 75 milligrams is really a drop in the hats not much whatsoever and the other types of electrolytes like potassium chloride are even smaller generally in most of these foods but you don't need much if you're going between zero and three hours again and certainly depends on intensity temperature hillclimbs and those things but as a general rule of thumb some of the examples here all fit the bill I've kind of done mostly work for you I there's a lot of marketing clearly there's a lot of marketing involved in sports supplements sports drinks sports foods and most of them have advertised with the mindset that more is better and that is certainly not the case when it comes to carbohydrates and fluid and take more isn't not better on the bike and I'm sure many of you have gone out for the belly busting burrito and then hopped on your bike and found that out very quickly so we know that more is not better and that's the case with carbohydrates it's the case with sodium and potassium some of your electrolytes even in the fluids I'm moving on if you're an endurance racer or if you're a multi-sport racer and doing some of the longer courses the same idea applies with ingredients you want the mixed carbohydrates till you certainly want some sodium in there because your sweat weight excuse me sweat rate is probably greater and so our parameters change a little bit and so our examples also change a little bit and a key to look at packages and on the foods is what they're going to start saying endurance on them or long lasting energy and those are some good signs that it's probably geared towards the more endurance athlete if you take that when you're doing the 0 to 3 hours is it going to hurt Jen no but it's probably not going to optimize your performance by any means in fact it could slow you down a little bit the 0 to 3 M in the 3 hour and greater drinks tend to be a little bit more concentrated and so they can cause a little bit of GI upset if you're not adequately hydrated with them and generally the people that are doing more than three hour rides our folks that are paying attention to their hydration levels beforehand but are they going to hurt you probably not if you do have those at home and you want to use them for shorter rides I'd recommend probably diluting them maybe 50/50 with water and then half of the concentrated version well there's more everything there's going to be more carbohydrates there's going to be more electrolytes and there might be a little bit of protein added absolutely and we'll get that into that end in the fueling portion in just a moment good question all right so let's switch now from hydration over to fuel and so how much do I get to eat every day so we're going to do kind of the same idea with fuel as we did with with fluids the first is what's your everyday calorie needs alright and it helps to be able to contrast and compare your everyday needs versus your needs on the bike and keeping in mind that your everyday needs most of us spend 90 plus percent of the time off the bike right so you can appreciate that you're paying attention to your everyday needs is significant and much more so than the time spent on the bike certainly if you're looking for for weight management and weight loss or weight gain but I'm so that 90 percent of plus time that we're spending off the bike our calorie needs are much much less right there around 3035 which summer number the fluid calories per kilogram all right that's a really simplified version if you're looking for a little bit more in depth numbers things that take an account your height your weight your gender your age and your activity level then you might want to look at a couple other equations I didn't list them here but harris-benedict is his you know was was is an equation that many of us are familiar with it and what a lot of fitness applications use or I smartphone apps a lot of websites use it the kind we put in your information it spits out a number really quickly they're probably using harris-benedict personally I don't love harris-benedict that's been proven to be have about a thirty percent error in it certainly if you're an outlier so to speak so if your weight is a little on the high end or your weights on the low end or if you're a little too tall or if your age Evon for bid is on either side of normal I'm Harris pen if you might not be a good fit for you a better fit would be something called the Mifflin st. G or or msj um a lot of websites are now starting switch over to using that equation if you know your percent body fat there are other equations like the Cunningham equation if you know your Mets if you know your Watts there are other equations for that so there are many different calorie expenditure calculations that exist in harris-benedict or 30 to 35 K Cal's per kilogram it's kind of the most popular ones out right now so for example if you're 75 kilogram person and you do 3035 you get roughly 20 to 25 to 26 25 calories a day if you did harris-benedict on the same exact person who now were with headers benedict we actually use height you some other anthropometrics we get 2,400 calories which is pretty much smack dab in the middle of 3035 and it's just an estimate right these are just rough estimates to see where we're at so on everyday basis what kind of fuel do you need again meaning most of your time when you're off this when you're off the bike what kind of fuels do you need sixty to seventy percent carbohydrate if you are an endurance athlete I don't know how many of you are or if you are competitive cyclist or a competitive multi-sport person or perhaps you're a swimmer or what-have-you you're probably looking at the higher end there so at least 70% carbohydrate up to 80% so you know um Tour de France some of those cyclists were toured in California we're really pushing 80% carbohydrate so if you've got a plate 80% of that plate is carbohydrate all right that's different than the everyday person who needs closer to 50 to 60% again carbohydrate being the per for you preferred fuel source for aerobic activity so if this person here were to come into my office I'd recommend around 2400 calories 360 grams of carb 55 grams of fat under 20 grams of protein spread evenly throughout the day and what I do is give them a meal plan so that they don't have to count numbers but they can kind of interpret it into fuel food so moving along I also get pre ride fueling and the goal here is really to top off your natural stores of energy in the body which come from your liver and your muscle glycogen glycogen is really stored carbohydrate it's instant energy that's available to your muscle tissues when you're doing replica activity so 3 to 4 hours before a ride you need around 800 calories that sounds shocking to most people most people are like Heather my events at 8 a.m. I'm not going to wake up at 5:00 any 800 calories shocking I'm Gary I can guarantee you competitive cyclists do this my husband annoyingly wakes up at about 3 a.m. for Wildflower and scarfs to giant he's half asleep he drinks two glasses of orange juice he drinks he eats a giant bagel with Jam all over it and usually a coffee or something like that and to try to get in enough calories to kind of fuel up and top off his glycogen scores he goes back to bed we're in the car we're camping we get up in the morning he eats another and about 300 calories so generally like a bowl of cereal some milk and he usually starts doing some some gels and goos at that time but your focus before your rides is high carb all right you'll leave the the high fat that all the Mediterranean diet set that's out in the news right now you'll leave that in the wayside and you you know let dr. Atkins turn over in his grave because you're going carbs you're hitting carbs hard before your pre ride right you're topping off your fuel sources if you're going only for an hour or less do you need to go out and do have giant bagel for morning no you don't but you're going longer for an hour or if you're going a really high intensity you do want to hit the carbs you know while you do that you want to stay away from fiber you want to stay away from a lot of fat those things tend to sit in the stomach break down very slowly cause you to feel very full may be bloated may be gassy on your ride very uncomfortable so here's a quick example again kind of based that off of my husband he chooses accelerate he just likes the flavor and so I I should say that no one is paying me to put their products on here and I tend to actually make my own so I don't usually use products just a flavor preference but here's just a quick and dirty rundown of of carbs protein fat and nice example at the bottom and it's basically fuel choices are you going to put you know 89 into the Porsche Turbo probably not right and so 89 these are some decent food see alright even included cookies and candy and whatnot in there those are kind of our everyday foods but when you're looking to kind of improve your performance or improve your enjoyment on the ride you want to switch over and use kind of 91 all right these are kind of heart-healthy kind of heavier and carbohydrate a healthy carbohydrate foods that also give you a lot of other nutrients so you know again yes we're focusing on calories and numbers but the big picture is overall health and we're trying to make sure that you deliver adequate vitamins minerals antioxidants phytochemicals to every cell in your body but on and off the ride so you really want to choose that I knew one fuel column there so how much fuel for your ride this is going to be extremely different based on every person in this room based on your needs and based on your Mets Mets is really based on your basal metabolic rate one Met is your body at rest so when Strava or when training peaks tells you your Mets its estimating based on your height your weight your age your activity factor and is basically suggesting when you're going to ride how many um how many times how would I explain this I'm sorry and how much more work are you doing then your basal metabolic rate so when you're just sleeping when you're at rest you burn let's say a thousand calories if you do five metz you're burning five times that amount at rest does that make sense if you're pushing 19 Mets you're working really hard you're pushing 19 times the amount of energy to do that work then the work that you are doing it just at rest and so that's Mets for you wats are a little bit different so this is the one of the quickest ways to figure out how many calories you need during the ride not during the day but just during the ride you take a number that's based on that the compendium of physical activity I included it as a resource on my last slide you can just google it's a free public access and what it'll tell you is based on miles per hour that you generally do so you do 12 out 12 miles per hour and it'll give you the Mets that are associated with that based on large studies that have been done and they figure out approximately how many how much energy that requires you multiply it by 3.5 and then the and then your weight you divide it by 200 and at the end you get kcals per minute so I typed in and my husband's needs and let's just say at 12 minutes which is about 15 and 19 miles per hour I multiply it by 3.5 then by his weight divide it by 200 and he basically needs 15 almost 16 calories per minute multiply that by 60 he's approximately burning 945 calories per hour and that's for a hundred and sixty-five pound man right and again that's just on the ride that's not every that's not when he's off the ride but just on the ride so he needs to replace ideally around I mean you can't read can eat I'm not going to ask you guys eat calorie for calorie on the bike there's no way you're going to eat a Big Mac on fries and a shake when you're on the bike for an hour wouldn't want you to do that and just to show you how many how many how metabolically active your body is when you're on the bike so for a two-hour ride let's say he does let's say keeps that pace up approximately for two hours he needs about 40 290 calories when I add the ride on to his normal average day because his average day again was around 2400 right so for ride days he needs around 4240 300 calories a day on non ride day is 2400 so you can see the significant difference there but I'm again bringing it on or your hunger first calorie second because certainly I'm not going to be like oh you'll need Steve you'll need 3200 calories you still need you know another thousand and he's like I'm not hungry I'm so full not gonna eat it that's not gonna happen right so you need to honor your hunger and you'll notice that on days when you're really riding hard you're not going to be that hungry often times are kind of queasy a little nauseous maybe you know hungry right after the ride you need a couple hours to cool down then maybe the hunger app kicks in alright so it's not it's not that you need to pack all of those calories in into a finite period of time your body works in averages right it doesn't work in a 24 hour spot it's not like oh you know where thousand calories deficit in this 24 hour time period so we're going to lose a half a pound it doesn't work like that right everything's kind of spread out over averages I know I'm running short on time so I'm going to get through next few slides here so fueling in the saddle just like hydration we have some guidelines that we try to follow if you're writing for less than an hour you generally don't necessarily need water we recommend it it's always good to have water there you never know if you're going to flat or who knows what it's nice to have some water there but do you absolutely need it no because your tissues need it are you going to bonk no but that's assuming that you're going into your ride semi hydrated if you're going your ride dehydrated then yes you're going to want to consider taking some water with you do you need carbohydrate in those sixty minutes no sometimes I need caffeine on my ride to work so sometimes I'm the rider with like the coffee but I'm not doing it for an energy purpose and I ride a sixteen certainly more than 60 minutes here and so if you're writing for about one to two hours we recommend about replace 30 grams of carbohydrate and being replaced through some kind of fluid or food you could do it either way right can drink it and the shape of orange juice oh you could dream it in a sports drink or you do with water and then eat 30 grams of carbohydrate right which would be approximately one gu or sport beans or it could be half a bagel right so you can choose which way if you want to drink it first those eat it if you go for a little bit longer you can see how the numbers actually double don't go up by 50% excuse me and it just given you some samples on the side again there's people that are very loyal to engineered food foods or sports foods but I'd also given you some examples of how to do it with just net normal foods and it's certainly based on tolerance which leads me to my next slide that tolerance is absolutely king of the mountain when it comes to eating and drinking on your rides yes I'm giving you lots of numbers but if you can't tolerate it it's not worth anything right and again this is something that needs to be built up you need to try you need to do some trials and tribulations with your hydration and your and your nutrition on the rides um to see what your body can tolerate there's a lot of folks that can tolerate orange juice on an empty stomach when they're riding for two hours and there's certainly a lot of folks that can't and do much better with with accelerate or Powerade or one of those drinks because we all know we I think many people if you if you've gone for longer than an hour so it's common to get GI distress I think about 15% of cyclists generally experience some kind of stomach discomfort on their rides largely due to either dehydration over nutrition eating too much or drinking too much also under nutrition eating too little or drinking too little so again just like hydration where you need to build into as a habit we recommend kind of practicing nutrition on the bike and for the professional athletes that I work with it is one of the toughest things to do is to practice you never want to M sacrifice your performance by trying to do a new food but I'm certainly recommend it before certainly before you join a competitive event and so lastly feeling for recovery we have a mantra in my office that your workout is not finished until you've refueled might as well get off the bike we've done with that let's go on with the rest of day I'm sorry you're even if you're an amateur cyclists what you're looking to gain performance you're certainly not done until you've refueled and refueling generally means that you're eating a couple hundred calories you're eating some sodium you're eating some carbohydrates and maybe a little protein a little bit of fat to replace the lost energy that you expended on your ride and giving you some some examples at the bottom again Whole Foods vs. engineered foods I'll let you read this on your own time with the slides tonight but this is just a example of what approximately forty three hundred calories looks like in food so there's no numbers here just foods and it has hydration built into it and I have the use of engineered foods and also the use of natural foods in there for you and lastly I have listed some of my favorite nutrition cycling resources and websites how to find a dietician near you a dietician you met with them can give you absolute numbers a meal plan specifically based on your food preferences and your cycling practices a couple great newsletters some books and also some cookbooks to go along with it and this is my dog wearing cycling glasses and but I appreciate it I know we don't have too many time too much time for questions I can probably just take one or two and but if you don't have a burning question please feel free to email me and i didn't include my phone number but i'm please please feel free to call me and call me email me anytime and I'd be happy to get to get back to you absolutely so it's pure physics so you get more water in when you gulp and so generally in about you can usually golf about two to three ounces and so generally a couple gulps every 15 minutes is a great way to do it good question uh-huh yes generally dehydration generally not always yeah absolutely easy it's right there you fill it up and the only problem would either with that Camelbak is it's hard to know how much you drinkin whereas the bottles okay so you know beautiful the question was that she's heard very different advice about sodium and I think let me know if I'm saying this correctly but you can actually kind of train your body to need less sodium in exogenous sources like in food or fluid over time is that correct to be honest with you I don't have much experience with that I haven't had any athletes that have reported that to me I think that that comes along lines with the theory of periodization which is a very hot topic and cycling another endurance activities right now and to be honest I am not familiar with that I apologize okay well I need to get going in it hydrate bring some come but I appreciate your attention and please feel free to contact me", "EryXmbiw4bk": "[Music] whoa what's going on guys welcome back to five 10 vaping each year yeah so I have reached 900 subscribers thank you very much everyone I put up a couple of videos last week in the week before my phone just buzzed on the sotnik lemon tart de ladies and their pods as well as the candy treats from Ethos vapors which a few people have purchased through that link and emailed me to let me know how nice it was so thank you very much to the people who've done that the main winner so far is the peach the the candy peach rings has sold the most that you guys have bought anyway so yeah that's very good to saw I have another liquid review today I have loads of liquids to review I've got to get through them and today has come from our good friends I've reviewed them before over at i VG I've actually had this pack for like three months now but yeah kind of got busy and these were the newest liquids out before these were the new I shed them on my Instagram if you don't follow me on instagram at 510 vaping the new black currant millions and the strawberry millions as well as they launched their blue raspberry slush and their pardon me Kiwi cool fruity menthol and a jam roly-poly dessert so I'm going to review these today artists reworked some of my drippers first stop is the Kiwi cool because I like the color of the bottle it says fresh Kiwi blended with a hint of lemon and I'm judging by the fact that it's ivg menthol it's going to be cold so let's see what this effect like it smells weird yep definite was a Kiwi whoo so straight way to get really nice called throat kick not too cold not overly overpowering but called enough that it's enjoyable and it is cool almost tastes like one of those traditional throat sweets as well nightly on a seedy licorice ones but I think that's just the Kiwi Kiwi in the menthol taste a bit weird the lemon that's what it is it is like the little like the lemon Stremme sue there's very nice it just reminds me of it throat sweet slightly so yeah I definitely recommend this if you've got blocked up Nozick I've got a slightly blocked up nose with here fever at the moment it's a bit of a palate cleanser I'm definitely feeling quite cleansed after that and it's not a bad flavor actually Kiwis not my cup of tea but because the lemon and the menthol in this it balances out quite nicely yeah the Kiwi call gets a Kiwi Kiwi cooler thoughts cue Kiwi cooler the Kiwi called gets a solid mark out of ten he would get a six not my cup of tea pour yeah good solid six maybe a seven out of ten on to the next one which will be the blue raspberry and judging by the look of it mouth-watering fresh blue raspberries treat with a salsa Lucia FEX so I'm going to quickly burn off and read rip and I'll be back in a second so just dripping this up the bottle is it smells incredible and yeah it basically states on the bottle that it's a blue raspberry slush this excites me because I do like the raspberry slushies quite a lot especially during this lovely glorious you kiss from a heatwave basically turned into a foreign country at the moment heat with yep so let's try this it smells very fruity oh that's very very nice I've still got a bit of a cold throat from the Kiwi cool of one book the blue raspberry and this is really sweet and sugar lips and Mauritian the weird thing about this is it doesn't actually taste like a normal slushie it tastes like when it's been melted and you've got that syrup at the end and yeah this is a stonking flavor I really like this this gets a really high eight out of ten for me if I had a little bit of coldness to it and that would be amazing but I think that wanted to move away from the coolness because everyone's doing called slushy spot to make my nose run which is positive that it's a decent liquid the blue raspberry flavor is is really really nice and yet just tastes like the syrup of a a slushy at the end of a slushy hats it's a really positive I like that looking forward to the million ones now because the blueberry one just wowed me in fact if you took the blueberry millions that they've done and made that into a slushie so kind of what this tastes like it's quite pleasant so I'm going to quickly burn off again read rip on I'm going to try in the brand new strawberry millions or the black currant I'll probably try the black currant first so be back in a jiffy Oh so we now have the sweets range again so I've done the blueberry millions in the past and these were their brand new ones at the time that were launched black currant and there is a strawberry and the first one I'm gonna try is the black currant another blue rush pavilions is still one of my favorite sweet flavors I've got like four bottles and they've got one of them's even got a bit of CBD and it's just such amazing sweet range like an actual sweet flavor that I just vape it quite quite a lot especially if I want something a bit different but through hand a bit sweeter because normally I just desserts um but yeah this still has that same Millions Candide had candy smell that the blueberry one did it just smell amazing so I'm gonna jump straight in and try this for the first time for the first time in forever oh yeah smashed it we're now doing it well so the blue recipe millions that just tasted like the blue millions and this one just tastes like the purple one I don't know how they do it or who creates their liquids but my god these millions sweets range is just in the hard candy sugar Rochelle the this the fruit flavor to them the aftertaste which makes me wanna lick my lips it's just so accurate to the sweets and yeah I've not I've not had a flavor like this for a long time but that's a stonking 10 out of 10 for me how wait try the strawberry one now I'm back I've just spent a whale off-camera trying to open this god damn bloody boggle I have dripped it and I'm ready to try it it smell different it doesn't not quite smell like a strawberry flavor that I'm used to but this is a sweet candied strawberry not the fruity or desert a strawberry that I'm used to with custards or with creams or with just menthol or whatever so I am excited it does still have that hard candied flip them just put me full and I'm gonna go chill it does still have that hard candied flavor like the others so let's see what a sheave it's like now a mouthful of liquid metal it's dribbling off the side of the bottle right should we try and do that again without getting a mouthful of liquid initial thoughts for the mouthful liquid actually quite pleasant so the hard candy shell the fruit everything tastes the same as the last one and the blue raspberry one it's the same base flavor it's just the actual fruit they've changed which is clever I approve however the straw but just isn't tickling me right now I don't think I like candied strawberry it's just not it's just not wowing my taste but it's like the black currant on the blue raspberry one this the candied strawberry just isn't giving me much of a flavor at all which is a shame yeah not enjoying the struggle as much it's still nice and it's still got the candied flavor everything but the strawberry is just not strong as the black currant or the blue raspberry just my personal taste buds store-bought yeah I'm gonna have to give that one a slightly lower mark maybe it's a six maybe a seven however I have just realized I have one liquid left and it's from their eye desserts ivg desserts range and this is the gem Rolly up early so I'm gonna go on maryberry Oh find out I've got a soggy bottom after this well that smells really nice see that's the kind of story that I like strawberry jam it's not sweet it's just very berry ish mmm another quick finger dab oh wow instantly after smell I get a lot of Polish [ __ ] I got a lot of strawberry in the jump but what I wasn't expecting then on that finger dab was an insanely moist pastry dough we kick flavor if that fits the word tear then this is going to be mmm money may be my new favorite second favorite dessert oh wow there's like a little bit of cinnamon in there there's like a bit of cream there's like a moist bit pastry there's Jam ah damn it that's just I was not expecting that the cinnamons a little bit overpowering on it but then again admit that works well with the actual door that's in there and like it's a little bit the I don't know if it's raisin of what if it's just cinnamon but there's an in create like a crazy amount of doing there the strawberry jam a little bit of cream that just tastes like generally poorly behind as a kid well that just needs some custard and it's warm on the trip oh ah yes that's really taking me back to being a kid and getting generally pulled Balilla take to this really takes me back to being a kid and getting jam roly-poly at school lunches I didn't manage to get tongue-tied there yeah that's that's good now I've not had many of the M ivg desserts making my nose run I've had a couple of the menthols about some of the normal fruits and there sweets ranged the millions which is kind of the the were not being going new now they have the macaron range which I've not tried they've got the desserts range which has a lord of different desserts in I believe the props from other sweets to fountain our mom menthols but I said this is this should have been done three months ago I just got really busy but yeah what a cracking set of juices these are this ivg some releasing some really good liquids at the moment and they're being won in loads of awards since I've received this I'll put the link to their website where you can find out all about their awards and everything in the description box below however I'm gonna sit and rip some of this jam roly-poly I'm going to enjoy it and I'm going to prepare for the next video that I'm going to film which will be on the web duty free liquids that was sent to me the other day it's just really nice and well-balanced I think this were generally poorly I think that's why I'm enjoying it you have to taste the jam and the cream the door it's just a really nice aftertaste you know you know you

a wicked day and I'll see you guys next time [Music] [Music]", "hmgcM2Gxc5Y": "Oh [Music] haha what's up folks so I'm at the grocery store I'm going to show you the ins and outs what to look for what to get what's not yet when you come to the store because a lot of y'all don't know I didn't know so let's go figure this out first and foremost I want you all to realize that this is not going to be a short video as you can see it's almost a half hour long because there's a lot to go over I'm a personal trainer first and my personal training heart wants to show you the ins and outs of the grocery store so let's do this together and let's do it right okay first things first is fruit you can't go wrong with roots you can't go wrong with anything that grows up out of the ground to be perfectly on it when it comes to watermelon comes the cantaloupes when it comes to melons when it comes to apples you cannot go wrong with these things just like berries there are so many different uses of berries you can just freeze them and people for a long time they're fibrous they're nutritious each of some berries also onions onions the benefits of onions are just endless I eat onions every single day and then there's things like corn make sure you're getting good corn not just corn from a canned pineapples especially after you work out if you need a splash of sweetness in your smoothies pineapples are great tomatoes gotta love them tomatoes are something that eat at least five out of the seven days every week and if you're having salad cherry tomatoes they are so good they give you that splash of flavors flavor that your body actually craves garlic oh the benefits of garlic are immense and then these little halos like oranges tangerine tangelos all these little things your body's craving sweetness instead of going for a candy bar go for these kind of fruits even great they're sweet they're good whether they're red seedless like these or the green grape they're good stuff bananas bananas are a wonderful thing to wake up and eat they're a good source of carbs they're also something to eat right before you go to sleep avocados there's many uses out of hock avocados just like guacamole avocados are great it's a great choice potatoes they're sweet potatoes there's yams there's all sorts of things little red potatoes they even sell these potatoes individually wrapped if you just want to have a baked potato asparagus goodness I love asparagus put a little bit of butter stuff on there there's green beans Brussels sprouts if it's green it'll get you lean straight up I'm telling you now I mean you just walk through the grocery store and you will see a lot of different things in the vegetable in the fruit section and if you go to like a more local food store like this one is Bueller's in my town you'll see so many fresh vegetables locally grown support your local farmers support your local grocery stores because stores like Walmart are really lacking in the quality now talking about lacking in the quality let's get into fruit juices these things like naked drinks and baths out farm they're all sugar sugar sugar stay away then we got these little things called hummus this is something you should gravitate towards there's a lot of fat in hummus but it's a healthy alternative snack something that should absolutely stay away from birthday cakes pastries these sorts of things anything that's cooked with sugar on top of the sugar inside of it sugar sugar sugar yes it looks good I'm a cake lover I used to love donuts eat this stuff all the time years of my life gone and wasted but folks this stuff isn't good for you it's simply not good for you just keep passing it up and I'm going to keep showing you things that you need to pass up in these grocery stores folks so just so you know another thing you need to pass up is pop get alone diet pop any kind of pop normal pop has a bunch of sugar in it and high-fructose corn syrup if not both but Diet pops has asked the change has a lot of bad things just like Gatorade you really need to stay away from Gatorade to be perfectly honest if you want to drink something to give you those electrolytes drink BCAAs honestly just buy a top of BCAAs stay away from fruit juice if you want real fruit juice you need to be looking for the fruit juice in glass bottles they usually at the end of the aisle but they're more expensive because it's legitimate fruit juice not some processed sugar based garbage but they're in glass bottles if you want some kind of juice to give you flavor kinda like a water like thing these buy drinks they I I don't know how to say it but those drinks are something I would gravitate towards because it's a little bit of flavor about ten calories now obviously chips there's a lot of the things in this aisle it's just chip aisle you need to stay away from plain and simple but one thing you can have is skinny pop these boom chicka pop these kettle corn they're sea salt there's all these different flavors they're vegan friendly they taste great in their calorie great like go get some of that go get some kettle corn in your life and if anything go make some make your own you don't need to buy this processed garbage in the stores just make your own in the end of the aisles normally there's these nuts like bold sriracha Blue Diamond nuts go get some that'll get you some flavor in your life so you don't need all these chips and pretzels and everything I mean look - look - honestly let's look at the back of a pack is a pretzel rod right here there's one gram of fiber there's 22 grams of carbs with just not a good ratio and then there's 110 calories so honestly you're not getting much fiber in there so all of that all those carbs you going straight to your bloodstream don't you don't really need prep books if you really want a good snack go get some pickles in your life now I just picked up a jar bread and butter pickles there's five grams of sugar in there so you need to be careful look how much to consume they might want to go for like a more natural like brand like that but pickles are a good alternative if you need something different in your diet something to crunch on a little bit something something sweet even apple cider vinegar I'll link that video up above there's endless benefits of apple cider vinegar make sure you have two tablespoons without a day at least you can use that for a lot of things I know a lot of people have mayo or mayonnaise or Miracle Whip I personally choose just Mayo because the ingredients are right the macros are right and the taste is right it'll be less calories and less fat for your soul another thing you can use honestly in a lot of different ways is mustard now let's look at what mustard actually has to bring the table besides zero calories zero carbs here of protein plus or zero fat the only thing that's in mustard is sodium in a very minimal amount now honestly look at a honey mustard like this is Dijon honey mustard French's and it's flipped out around there's only five calories there's only there's there's nothing in there there's less sodium in the honey mustard and there is a normal mustard so if you need something to flavor up your salad or to flavor up your life go get some mustard don't go towards salad dressing now no high fructose corn syrup in ketchup that's something that a lot of people didn't even realize that's in ketchup but it is so make sure that you're getting ketchup out the hyper good corn syrup in there's only 20 calories in ketchup anyway it's not that bad but even this ketchup that says hey I have no preservatives and people like oh it's gotta be healthy then let's look at that horrible thing that's on the ingredient hi corn syrup that's something that you need to stay away from like the flag folks and it's in a lot of salad dressings too but if you're one of these people and you eat there and we need then there's these salad dressings like you want like this Greek yogurt salad dressing this is one that you need to go gravitate towards there's only 60 calories only two grams of sugar there's only 5 grams of fat which is actually really low for salad dressing there's only 240 milligrams of sodium that's a really good salad dressing to grow towards but let's compare it to another one let's just say wishbone ranch is great for dipping the calories are more than double the fat is more than double the everything else is almost more than double the sodium's about the same but goodness gracious you can go get the same flavor for half the calories now one thing since I'm vegan I don't get meat dairy eggs that sort of stuff in my diet so I go for gluten-free pancakes because usually there's no eggs in there there's nothing in there that I can eat and guess what it tastes great and guess what the calories are actually comparable if not less every single time than like any other pancake brand so if you are like me go for a gluten-free pancakes if you didn't know what to do or those recipes just haven't been working out because that's been my baby this you trying to find a vegan pancake recipe that doesn't say sandy now soups we all like soup right a lot of us like soup it's quick it's easy this is just a can you can eat the whole thing but you got to be careful everything that says no preservative preservatives added it might have to actually be careful of 890 grams of sodium when you only see having 2000 2500 per day that's not good that's going to keep you swollen up that's going to just do some wonderful not so wonderful things to your heart to your kidney stay away from anything with that much sodium gravitate towards more things that you can make if you want to make soup then go buy black beans go fine if it means kidney beans beans beans beans the more you eat the more you poop yes the music the musical root huh we're getting off track I hate beans every single day another thing that I eat a lot of the time is rice there's nothing wrong with white rice there's nothing wrong with brown rice go eat some rice the difference is the flavor and the difference is a little bit of a fiber there's going to be a little bit more fiber in the brown rice in the white rice but nevertheless it's a great source of carbs have at it and actually take the time to make it because when you get into these little pockets right here then you just add water you just warm up what you're going to be doing is you're going to be getting into high sodium one of those little packets obviously you're going to use more than one serving so more than one serving is that you're going to be getting at least a thousand milligrams of sodium which is just crazy like this uncle print Ben's Minute Rice right here look at this one it actually focuses in come on camera there's seven hundred and seventy milligrams up just a half a bag of sodium in this thing because we both of that and you eat both servings in that bag you're done for the day like I said go actually make the stuff by normal rice by normal bean by normal things take the time to cook it that's what a crock pots for you make all you mix all this stuff up do it overnight do it before you go to work so you come home and you actually have good food to eat especially because what most of us don't have a lot of time get some teen wall in your life does anybody actually ever made quinoa salad with vegetables with beans it's so good look up quinoa salad recipes on Pinterest it's good stuff jazz Motty rice up yes get some please now you got to watch out for sois because yes it's low in calories but look at that sodium that is incredibly intense and most of us use multiple servings of that try to go towards coconut secret coconut aminos it tastes just like soy sauce I don't even understand how they do it but look at the sodium only 90 milligrams that's phenomenal even the calories are cut in half go get yourself some coconut secret same thing for teriyaki sauce because that is something that holds in a lot sodium as well this is the pasta that I recommend to everybody in this whole wide world dream seals I'll talk about this before I really have in multiple videos now let me get these calories and proteins and all this stuff up on here 190 calories 1 gram of fat there's 5 grams of fiber and you got soluble and insoluble and you've got 7 grams of protein industry and all of the different kinds that they have is the same it tastes great it doesn't hate healthy you know what I'm talking about something tastes healthy they got lasagna let's see they got macaroni and they got routine E it's so good I would recommend it to the world now what do you put on that kind of pasta obviously you put pasta sauce got to be careful because there's a lot of hidden sugars and pasta sauce and you're like sugar now because people put sugar in their pasta sauce and make it taste better like this 9 grams of sugar now mind you I know for a fact that this pasta sauce tastes great but there is 9 grams of sugar in there so just be careful I'm not saying you should completely stay away from it just be careful how much is of it you're consuming because that's 45 grams of sugar if you eat that whole jar by your bag on self Newman's Own this is my favorite brand it has a little bit less sugar that's 3 grams of fiber they do have organic kinds in this brand and all the donations that you will all the money that you put forth to buy this brand is actually goes towards charity honor percent of the money goes for its charity that's cool going through the cereal aisle with other granola bars and uh this is something I see people buy all the time something that snaps seeing people buy since I've been a little kid these little crunchy bars look at this though there's 11 grams of sugar within that thing most people to eat this for breakfast when they're walking out the door or they take it to school with them and if you're a kid you have just consumed almost half of the sugar that you should be eating every single day just in that moment right there so you got to be careful you just got to be careful what we're feeding our kids what we're feeding ourselves that's not a good choice it's really not just a normal bolt meal if you need something like that in your life to be perfectly honest now let's get into cereals you want to link that video called serial killer above I'll talk about this in deeper context so go check out that video but cereal like Lucky Charms has trisodium phosphate aka something that you stain your deck with to preserve it you shouldn't be putting it inside of your body no matter what the FDA they're lies they have to tell you see this is what General Mills does we don't have all these things in there but we adapt Rises sodium phosphate and no one's saying a daggone thing stay away from this like the plague unless you really want to increase your risk of cancer to be perfectly honest it's that deep and we overlook it and it's in our favorite cereal we know Lucky Charms in Cinnamon Toast Crunch is good but we need to stay away from it like the plague pop-tarts another thing there's really no nutritional value in pop-tarts - oh let's go eat a candy bar there's 18 grams of sugar per pop-tart 210 calories per pop-tart high fructose corn syrup um there is no reason to ever eat a pop-tart there's just there's just not for the sake of your long-term health there's not pure maple syrup if you have to have syrup go pure maple syrup straight from Mother Nature if you have to but if you don't like that kind then go for log cabin no high fructose corn Seraph brand whether you want to delight in or sugar-free or just original go for one of those because normal like Aunt Jemima for example when people focus high fructose corn syrup corn syrup those are the first two ingredients there's no protein there's 32 grams of sugar and Lourdes mill you have like four or five serving to that oh my gosh not worth it pulley not worth it and let's go down the healthy aisle in the freezer section like with all the little microwave meals and stuff and let's just check out a Lean Cuisine meal yes yes yeah you eat these all the time key word used but especially when I was trying to lose weight these things are great because there's only 230 calories there's 7 grams of protein in this there's a lot of there's actually 3 grams of fiber there's 37 grams of carbs you know what this isn't horrible they're 66 or 640 milligrams of sodium so you gotta be careful you got to be careful with how much of these that's you actually eat now I used to eat these little healthy choice bowl with little cafe steamer steamer bowls got me through like I literally lost weight by eating this consumer Bowl because they're like 200 to 300 calories and that's it and there's like almost 30 grams of protein in there so if you're somebody that eats that kind of thing then go get it if you're trying to lose weight but you got to watch out for the sodium now if you're somebody that doesn't really honestly have time to buy these fresh vegetables and cook them up just buy frozen just buy frozen there's a lot of different options of every kind of vegetable you can ever think of all you got to do is warm it up and you're golden now I again being vegan there's a lot of different options for eating things that tastes just like me I don't even understand it but beyond me I'll tell you - the day I die is amazing it tastes and has the texture of just like chicken and beef and all these other things go try it out also if you're on my way of life quinoa burgers there's a lot of different brands there's a lot of different things for like a lot of meat products that you would normally eat like in your former life I'll just go and try them out I highly suggest these Aimee California veggie burgers they are phenomenal I don't know how they do it they're just really good I would never recommend to you anything that tastes best I'm not about that bad tasting food like not at all ice cream speaking of non bad phasing foods freakin ice cream I was just talking to one of my friends in the gym about enlightened ice cream if you have no idea what enlightened is go hit it because it's light its left calories for full flavor just like halo topics sometimes they're on sale like they are and my grocery store and then there's also things that you don't eat dairy products like soy and rice and almond space ice cream there's a lot of different options just kind of go got to go look for even at so delicious brands it's good stuff you're going to pay for it you're going to pay for an end but even Ben & Jerry's has non-dairy selection and they're obviously their normal stuff 7:49 dad gone that's crazy expensive it really is why is the almonds Ben and Jerry's the only ones not on sale y'all notice that stuff what is this how much was the ice cream apparently a sign from God told me I'm not anyways bread I'll tell it to you till the day I die Eureka organic so we bred is the best bread in the whole wide world and I buy it every time I go to the grocery store cuz I'll always in need of it there's a lot of fiber a lot of protein la not so much fat and honestly not so much carbs compared to other bread it's good stuff go get it and tell me how you like it now they put on that grab you know I like missing peanut butter and jelly Smuckers it's right here from my 15 minutes away that's where the main smokers factory is got to support our local this and look at that if you're jelly or jam doesn't have just those ingredients strawberries and sugar and pectin then you need to get a different brand because it's a lot of in there that's why I go for these Naturals specially smokers natural they know what they're doing like the only ingredients in this Smuggler's natural peanut butter is peanuts and salt that's it is 8 grams of protein or off experience of carbs it's not bad for you you just got to watch out how much you eat because it's easy to overeat on peanut butter and jelly it's very easy it's very easy there's a lot of different comparison videos online and oh the peanut butter company Oh have at it that brand is so tasty and speaking of tasty Oh get away from my life Oreos and devil the devil get away from me there's a lot of cookies and there's a lot of things in the cookie aisle shocking that you just need to stay away from planning something there's there's really no need unless you're having a cheat meal that your planned out to eat these cookies even these crackers these cheese's these club crackers these saltines they hold no nutritional value but there's things like Triscuits that we need to take a closer look into because these are deemed more healthy now look at this there's only 2 grams of fiber that ratio between vibrant carps are good one gram of fiber per 10 carbs is a good ratio Triscuits are solid I would read go eat some Triscuits there's a little bit of protein in there the first ingredient is long grain brown rice and whole grain wheat are the two first ingredients go get it go get some brown rice red roasted red pepper Triscuit stay away from Ritz crackers oh it says roses vegetable roasted and their vegetable let's go no no no there's no fiber so all that's going to hit your bloodstream real quick and there's a ton of stats too ton of fat in there so you're eating sugar and fat plain as simple as that you just might as well just go eat some fruity pebbles be perfectly honest now let's look at the butter a lot of us have butter toast in the morning we put butter in our oatmeal we put butter in our rice there's a lot of uses but er but we have to make a good choice because this is a big calorie dense object now there's only 80 calories in this earth dollars there's only 9 grams of fat there's full-flavored it's a good option it's organic even so I don't know why you would stay away from it there's a lot of benefits to it I personally use the Smart Balance brand there's Omega threes or olive oil it helps your cholesterol levels and let's just look at the actual macros of this all honestly it's full of flavors I recommend it to anybody in the whole wide world I've talked about this multiple times only 80 calories only 9 grams of fat only 90 milligrams of sodium have at it to be perfectly honest have at it let's compare that to a local brand from around here heartless dairy hundred grams of fat are 100 calories 11 grams of fat but ton more saturated fat a lot more sodium just like milk milk there's a lot better options for milk if you for calorie wise for protein wise for the macro wise to not just taste between a hundred and and in only 30 calories you can't go wrong with almond milk with coconut milk with not milk with soya milk and perfectly honest compared to normal milk and might have all these supporting factors in there might be organic but under 30 calories 5 grams of fat 12 grams of sugar dude stand away from milk at all top honestly if you literally just compare it to almond milk let's look at this just normal almond milk 60 calories there's only 60 calories in there now you might not get as much protein in there but you're going to have less sugar less calories less fat I don't know what you're doing now let's ground this video off with juice because juice is one of those things a lot of people have growing up even possibly right now on your frigerator it's basically drinking a milkshake to be perfectly honest you might as well just go buy a milkshake it's all sugar it's just plain sugar and this one in particular 23 grams of sugar 23 grams good night and that is where we end folks there's nothing else I have to show you in the store about to talk to you in my car here in about three two one the rap vote mount rocket science for the same time it's a huge learning curve I went three years of my life and had no idea of any of these things it's aimlessly buying just looking at calories protein fat and carbs those things and mind you you will lose weight if you just follow protein fats and carbs under a calorie based diet like a advocate of macros like things but you got to look for other things for the sake of you overall health like your sodium like the sugar like fiber these little things matter in the long run because if you're only in it for the short time yes you will lose weight but yes your heart rate will increase yes kidneys will have issues yes cancer it will increase the risk of it I'm saying you got to look at the ingredients you got to actually know what you're putting into your body and got to actually know what you're doing to it long term it's not about this short term it's not about just living for today it's about trying to live 90 years from now healthy and not having regrets thinking man I wish I wouldn't have filled my body full of crap and you know what half the stuff in the grocery store is crap that's why I wanted to go to the store and show you this stuff so that you know what to go to want to stay away from it'll cut your grocery shop baton down in half and you can thank me later honestly but I hope you love this video please share it with those ones that you love because you want them to be wolf on this knowledge to like and subscribe this woo

Nevada side so we came up here originally to my sister Eden because we're not certain on all the Utah laws regarding CBD oil now it doesn't mean that you can't take it in Utah they do sell it I think some people say like hey you need a card from a doctor it really just depends because we were uncertain about the laws we decided to come out to Nevada so anyway yeah because we were uncertain we just came out to Nevada my sister lives out here in Reno so we came up the mountain to Tahoe she's gonna meet up with us here and give you guys a little bit more information I also want to stay in fatica Lee we are not legal counsel you are responsible you do your own research find out what it is you need to know and your local laws hi my name is Ian Wakefield and I am a full-time cannabis consultant and I also run a cannabis coaching business on the side yeah and why are you here what are you doing well I'm Robbie's oldest sister and I'm here to help with Ian's issues that he faces with his autism with some CBD oil okay and what kind of this can you pull it back to your face love it yes this is the harmonious brand CBD it's a full spectrum that's different from a distillate in that this contains all of the compounds of the hemp plant versus distillate which would only contain the CBD itself so this is better than what I just said find over the shelf at like my local mall or like that absolutely also because you may find full spectrums here and there in that way but you won't always have somebody who has put their lab testing next to the product online there is always going to be current lab tests for every batch with the bottle okay and in full disclosure we are using this for free thanks to the generosity of Ian sprint Eden's friend at harmonious I'm Eden Eden Ian we screw it up sometimes so there they're gonna offer this this to us for free so we could try it out yeah so that's nice yeah very nice of them yeah anything else you want to say about it or huh you know I stand by a hundred percent i I tell everybody about it that I can and especially people who are afraid to try THC or you know any of the heavier products this is a really really great alternative well and that's another thing too so THD THC versus CBD why don't you tell us maybe just very briefly the legality involved but also you know how THC is a neurological inhibitor or that kind of thing yeah THC has many medicinal benefits that are we're still exploring in science and the legalities kind of put a damper on that because federally it's not legal to actually perform lab testing on actual cannabis in the United States this is from the hemp plant cannabis is cousin and it has all the other medicinal medicinal compounds that you're going to want but yeah as far as something that has higher THC in it that's going to be where you're going to need to be in a legal state and and deal with it on your own make your own decisions accordingly mileage may vary no this is fine this is this is over-the-counter type stuff yeah yeah you can order this this is this is legally able to be shipped throughout the United States without problem including Utah including Utah yeah so we just found out about this recently and sorry if my voice is a little bit muffled behind the mic but we just found out the laws change so rapidly that Utah has legalized CBD oil over the counter I think it's okay to give it to minors in Utah we were unsure so we came out here to Nevada because I knew my sister would know better than most in accordance with local laws and customs and things like that yeah this is completely legal to give your kids the FDA is trying to step in and stop CBD from being able to be given to pets and kids and things like that and we're working on fighting that because CBD isn't regulated though that's why I prefer to go to this brand because he does things through state regulations so even though it can be shipped Internet you know anywhere you wanted to go it's still above board for a product that you know is going to be regulated you know that this is going to be factual okay awesome yeah was anything else you wanted to say I'm just really grateful to Brandon and Anthony and the guys over at Harmonia CBD for being so generous is to offer us this opportunity to see how we can help Ian with CBD oil okay how long I'm gonna do another Tong three drops one two three that's it hmm three jobs three jobs to start yep sweet drops looks perfect oh good it's better than a half one because a half one makes my likes crazy I just like your spirit on does how was it taste I taste a low flame a little fight yeah what would you say to people who just say you're judging your kid you're just making them passive and zombie like that would you have to say about that well at first I'd say that's not true that's not what happens I mean Ian's as talkative and has as much of his personality as ever he's he's a bit calmer and I'd argue that this medicine isn't really for us the parents it's honestly more for the kid they're less anxious they're able to sleep better they're able to concentrate better on the tasks they have at school and the tours they have at home and whatever choose for their mind - I think it's highly beneficial yeah and that's been for a spiritum so we think so far of the oil well I'd say the biggest difference I've noticed between risperidone and the CBD oil is that risperidone immediately makes in sleepy and he is actually more tired and more lethargic on her Sparrow dome than he is on CBD oil although the CBD oil has a more calming effect yarr that may not be true for so much my understandings of you in facts so I'm trying to get through this it affects people differently based on their um their body chemistry and their neurological I'm not sure why that is so it's really nice to see and reacting well to it it's still too early to tell if this will be a permanent replacement does it risperidone but again whether it's perd\u00f3n it's just there's too many side effects that long-term we think what could be detrimental especially how it makes him a little bit sleepy to begin with and then that is kind of like pacifying him not that we want him to behave that way it's just how he responded to it and so as many people have mentioned online with medications there's a kind of a cocktail that people go through where they try risperidone and that doesn't work so they try a belif and vilify abilify and they just kind of go down the list of different medications until that wears off then they go on to the next thing and we want to try something that's made available more natural a little bit more long-term the Ian can take and not have any major side effects so far the only side effect we can see that I guess you could say was major was that he woke us up at 4:00 a.m. and he goes daddy I'm hungry so he he had the munchies for a lack of a better term so one of the things we did want to mention is we're starting out small and we're working our way up so we started a very small dosage and we monitor Ian's heart rate and things like that so I put my hand on his wrist I did a stopwatch and he was about 75 beats per minute so he did well in the middle of the night I checked his pupils made sure that they weren't dilated or anything like that and they reacted just fine another thing that is nice is the cost it's about half as much as risperidone how did you feel I feel I feel good I feel good what was the word you said fantastic you felt fantastic a little bit fantastic well that's good yeah do you still feel fantastic yeah cuz I've done a lot of I was playing with my freak imaginary friends they're right they're directors it's crowded there are there's a lot of them there's a lot of your imaginary friends yeah they're all come to a party with me and us nice dear hey everybody we're back in Utah right out here walking with Ian you can probably hear him say hey hey guys yes you are so I just want to do a quick little recap here kind of a summary of the week in Nevada where basically ending Ian's dosage on the CBD oil I'd love to continue it actually I had some pretty good results it doesn't last as long as his or spare at all but I like that it doesn't have as many side effects especially the drowsiness that comes with her spear at all hopefully it doesn't get too loud we're heading into a construction area I would have done it inside the house but the kids have been super noisy so I come out here and there's construction everywhere what do you do so anyway um basically the the Utah laws are such that we can't continue the CBD oil to the best of my understanding you guys can correct me in the comments section if you want let me know more but as I checked the last bill that was passed in 2018 was like 200 pages long I don't have time to read it most people don't and it basically covered things like epilepsy in terms of getting a medical card and autism wasn't even on that list so yeah you basically need permission from a doctor or a medical card saying that you know your child needs CBD oil I forgot to mention too if any of you are new to the channel it's been well documented that ian has autism you can see his paperwork there just because we get that question a lot because he is more or less high-functioning now and you can talk a lot of people are like is even autistic should you be giving him medication yes he is but anyway aside from all that we would have loved to continue using CBD oil and you know many people do no matter what the laws are I don't think anyone's going to come after those people we want to be careful because we're putting on YouTube and inevitably you get one or two zealous parents who are like that's it I'm gonna call Child Protective Services on you you're torturing your kid you're a terrible parent blah blah blah long story short you know they're they're calling people and just making your life miserable because they've got nothing better to do we're trying to do the best we can for our son that's the honest to goodness truth we really want Ian to be happy and healthy and when it comes to more severe autism and he's not very severe but the further you go down the spectrum the more difficult life becomes just doing basic things just feeling like you can go outside without being overwhelmed and he has a difficult time with that kind of stuff he gets overwhelmed so it helps him yes it helps us to that's an added benefit but the the first priority is to help him out so he can go to school you can go to church you can go to public places and not be overwhelmed and just make it through the day without tons of problems so we appreciate my sister and her friends for letting us have the oil for free I'm very nice of them it doesn't reflect anything on our review we just tell the truth you know how it is it's not a magic bullet it's it's been great though so far I would recommend it to those who want to try it of course your mileage may vary just depends on the person everybody's chemistry is different so yeah I hope that was helpful and if you guys of course have any comments questions let us know appreciate all of our supporters and we will see you next time", "1-tYudrj3Oc": "[Music] this is sandy Krakowski and welcome to a real change hey everybody I'm so excited I can't even tell you how excited I am I have a guest today with me Nadim al-haj son the CMO of bangbros we're gonna have fun and just jump into it and just have a conversation here and see where it goes but you are my cannabis expert who converted me to using more edibles and different things without even knowing it amazing good so you know I was typically using what most people would with cannabis and that is inhalation and all that so my first question for you why did you choose watermelon okay so that's my favorite candy yeah okay yeah there are absolutely my favorite candy I mean it's already a gummy in the market that people love yeah yeah let's make it better with THC we did yeah but what's so amazing is I've used other gummies and like I've been using cannabis for three years weaned off of all kinds of medication and it's just changed my life but I've had other gummies where you know like two and a half hours later somebody needed to peel me off the floor you know I was like okay I'm fine I'm waiting for it to kick in goodbye lips right I don't get that with that it's real smooth and I go to sleep one of our core values is consistency and that is that is true to its core and and and so you know it's the infusion method in which we do this is the small batch method that ensures the consistency also the vigorous testing that we do so if you're following the initiative right now testing is something that's going to be coming into the market by next year right very very important think about that testing has not been required the entire 10 years that medical cannabis has been in Arizona I hope that is very that is very concerning yeah very concerning concerning and we were testing long before there were even facilities you know there was one group that was doing it a lot of ambiguity if it was you know even accurate or not but sometimes the expression that any data is better than no data you know and so so through different trial and error methods different mixing methods different implementations you know we would test this batch test this batch and fast forward to here we are today we're testing you know hundreds of batches every single month Wow so I don't I'm not sure if you know but this little green tag right here or on the back of the package there's a white label you can skin or you can enter that batch ID on our website and they don't pull up the test results oh wow yeah so we call that on-demand testing yeah and it's you mean your fitness yeah so just like with supplements transparency is key yes you know if I want to know what I'm consuming the hello from food to supplements to anything ya know and that's something that Thomas and I share him even more so you know sometimes I might dude you're such a geek so check it out though this does this and I'm like well that makes sense you know okay let me check that out so we've wanted to apply that same motto or model and to our products and it should be transparent you should get exactly what is in it you should know that there are no microbe eels in here you should know that the potency is accurate and that leads to your original question the potency right so we have a plus or minus and it is always going to be within two to three milligrams rather - yeah and and if it's not we don't put it out there yeah we district we pour bleach over the batch and throw it away Wow you know and it's we've learned a couple lessons but by doing that because you can't do that too many times no no and we've got a very very meticulous method and that ensures our consistency and that way you can go into any of the 85 dispensaries that we're in in the state get the same product anywhere you go congrat thank you thank you that's incredible I'm not even 30 yet almost my mom\u00eds hearts just like that kind of accountability is what gave me the confidence cause like when kovat hittin that and being used to inhalation and even micro dosing with inhalation throughout the day with a pen I wanted to make sure my lungs were stronger I knew my liver is okay for you know the edibles but you know I don't think people pay attention to if you run a company I don't have time to wake up right and have a cannabis hangover right you know I mean I don't have four hours in the morning to wake up at the dose was wrong absolutely you know and you were in the medical realm of all of this even when they had like medical marijuana farmers market I just moved here three years ago I was like what [Laughter] yeah tell me about it so early on so it became legal in 2010 I had moved here from Oklahoma went to school in Missouri with school in Oklahoma yeah came out here because it it helped a new and dear friend of mine a coach and my mom lived out here and so I was like I gotta go somewhere where I can learn about this and my intention was not to come out here and start an edible company not buy anyway no it was i-i've always been in love with the plant itself ya know yeah it was definitely you know using cannabis at recreationally back in school it wasn't you know wasn't Mike I'm gonna be a you know cannabis you know animal owner some day it was my mom bless her heart I love her she's a total hippie you know so she always just cultivated this this healthy relationship you know was never like it was never very strict mom you know but it was never like there was always an explanation with why it was wrong yeah you know or how to approach the relationship with whatever it be yeah so I'm thankful for that you know it and particularly with with in particular with cannabis you know like there were some times I kind of caught on where she found out I had cannabis and she was like you're gonna have to give that to me and I was like I hit like you know seven sixteen seventeen I was like aha you know and so that opened up and we became very just communicative with each other and I always had this I don't want say hippie but just healthy relationship with cannabis it wasn't ever like seen as a drug you know in my eyes were used as a drug you know and I I grew up wrestling so cannabis is really big and martial arts it's it's it means are up a really wrestling yeah we're going there in a bit yeah but eight or nine I about eight years old I started wrestling and got into it at an early state and there's a lot of story behind that too as to why you know my parents divorced and you know was on ritalin for a long time and it just a sport like that just really kind of you know hold me down and humbled me they say you know when you get put on your ass a couple of times you get humbled let's just say that and so I came to came to Arizona in 2000 into 2008 and I started growing right away you know I had a little closet grow yeah nothing big then just getting familiar with the plant and yeah there was no information out there in the early days nothing not like today like today where you go to like bake grows a column and you're like I'm making tasty drinks yeah and and there there were only forums available online so you dig yeah yeah you know and how to make cannabis butters and how to grow cannabis what medium to use to grow in and all this information a lot of it a lot of it out there and so had an early start into growing it passed in 2010 yeah and so that's when the ball started rolling right I you know got in with some friends that you know helped me financially get into a little bit of a bigger grow and yeah here's the thing though from 2010 to 2011 2011 there were no dispensaries so you've got almost two years that this has been legal but there's no dispensaries but so where do people get their medicine exactly so do you show your card - exactly so there I had friends that were caregivers and I myself as a patient would row I could cultivate and so I would be a cultivator and I could give you your allotment you're two and a half ounces every two weeks right so you would give me your grow right so you would give a caregiver your grow rights and then they could then their grow your play okay now I got two right so you weren't just my deal or I could exit right and it was and that was how it worked right now is a donation base you know I'm donating my grow rights to you and you can cultivate for me well what do you do with the excess you know and so I wasn't a big proponent on dealing and some I didn't yeah a very great area yeah yeah so you have these farmers markets right it's exactly what it sounds like if you go to the uptown farmers market over off like 26th Street in Bethany the biggest farmers market here it's yeah beautiful and lots of food all kinds and stuff it was just like that except indoors you've got 40 vendors that are been in all kinds of cannabis products I'm talking anything you can think of from capsules the cookies to cake pops to popsicles - we made it all we made it no you know and this is still around the time when we're trying to figure out dosing yeah and and that was a that was a real propeller in in Thomas and i's journey which which is about three years later because I'd gone to Washington and come back which maybe we'll get to and so those farmers markets allowed an opportunity to really start building a network you know like the other vendors and the other people that had these the caregivers and stuff like where some of us are still friends you know a small small group there's a lot of them weeded out but some of us are so contented [Laughter] no it's good some are now managers within dispensaries and so it's it's cool to see how everybody's evolved you know and Thomas and I we had met at the end of 2008 became friends we had no idea we're gonna be doing an edible business we connected over the similar interest yeah yeah right you know he had he'd recently lost his mother was you know kind of finding his life you know he went yeah did a five-year term in the Navy um it awesome you know he was a submariner so now yeah that can you know so we stayed connected the whole time and when he had come back from the Navy I had just left for Washington and then I had returned not too long after okay and that's when we were like hey cuz he you know he just got back he was taking a break he wanted to go to school to be a doctor still does and still will actually yeah very very very again he's just that mindset so be amazing yeah he's he's fun to talk to and so that's when we really connected because I came back and and while I was in Washington the Denver High Times Cannabis Cup in 2013 that was the first year it had ever come to America it all had been in Amsterdam oh wow right I had no idea yes so that and it was in Denver Colorado mmm was a big deal because Denver had just passed Connor creational that's it so you've got this event that has 50,000 people because it's recreational right and it's the first recreational cannabis event bigger than what stock saying it is it is it is contact hi - oh my gosh the whole city of Denver was lit let's just say and so and so I went as a just as a participation I was like I'm not this is history like I'm going yeah yeah the following year is when I'd come to Thomas and I was like let's enter the High Times Cannabis Cup it was like you're high yeah let's enter the High Times campus we can do this yeah and you know he you know crack jokes on me he was like no dude you're crazy he was going to school at the time and I was like listen dude we can do this and he was like all right find out the information let's at least Leslie see what's up you know I somehow got ahold of Rick oosik which was the editor at High Times during that time yeah contacted him phone call phone call phone call and he basic said Nadeem listen cuz I'm like well how much do we bring how many edibles does it how much do we make he's like it's gonna be the biggest cannabis farmers market you've ever been apart harbor's but I was like got it so make as much as I can like anything that I can write and so then we got the booth okay yeah so now I'm like hey yeah we can do this and I was like hey we should enter our products to join win he was like dude you're just pushing the limits and I'm like yeah let's try and do this and so we were making gummies at the time we were making brownies at the time which we don't make um hey you know baked bros 2 2 2 2 different directions either we make baked goods or we're baked right right so we're making cookies brownies gummy cereal bars all that stuff the gummies were really they've always been our niche and we get to there before we leave III said hey let's let's enter the cup and hmm you know he gave me some smack for it and then he said I tell you what and I believe he was joking at the time yeah he said if we win the Cup I'll drop out of school and I'll go full-blown bake oh my god I didn't hear this story yeah he goes I'll commit full-blown bake gross oh my god definitely so I said okay deal and you're the first contest oh yeah oh yeah oh yes and this is 2014 so I'm like okay cool man like I didn't really take it that I could use the help well fast forward we won the cop so our sour kick-ass which are still on the market today they had won the cup they won People's Choice so that means the people voted for our products we didn't even enter that product we entered a medicated baklava yeah yes yes when my mom comes to town I'll have her make some I would absolutely deliver something because it's a 45 year old recipe only the women in my family habit and she just so happened to infuse it oh my word it is fantastic it is fantastic and so we wanted to enter that into the medical cup and we're like yeah let's another medicated baklava it's a unique product like yeah yeah but he's got any didn't even make that make the charts you know yeah so again sour cush kids got voted by the People's Choice so we're at the award ceremony and we're like hoping to hear you know we didn't get it and then the following award was the sour kush kids and we're like taking my surprise yeah so it's like all of a sudden something just set in to us and were like oh [ __ ] like what does this mean I think we just broke through oh so that's what that was the beginning of what really brought us married yeah you know so I came back to Arizona with that under our belt started writing proposal letters of dispensaries got picked up by a dispensary and up north we were working there fast forward a little bit and you know we've been with true med dispensary now for going on about a little over three years yeah now we're in 83 dispensaries and rocking and and to close the loop on on Thomas he did he show me that I was going off to Denver yeah and the day of the cup he had a final so he finished the final okay the final yeah and then he had come out they come out to either finish the final or he had gotten approval from the professor to do the final when he got back and he told his professor like what he was doing and she was totally supportive like which is really cool because I could have gone any way could have gone any way of that happening super cool won the award I looked at him and like you know he said he finished out the semester and now going strong it's been really cool that story's just so incredible and in since then we've now got upward of 40 employees Wow we've got a strong leadership team a strong team marketing team production team packaging team distribution team and let me take a breath because let me say it has been a challenge oh oh while it has been wild yeah building I never thought that building people along with building myself would be something that I was doing ya know leading people and leading people as a group you know like I'm I'm finally finally after five years of actually being baked grows me in a business settling into my role you know which is a CMO which let's talk about labels right yeah we talked about like see chief ma officer it's like no man yeah I don't know like I'm not I don't know it's a it's a it's weird hierarchy it's yeah it's weird goofy it really is it's like it's you have to have this title so yeah you can get certain speaking engagements right it's it's because people see that yeah and then they're like oh oh my goodness you know it's like I should take you're serious I'm just yeah right right like I'm just a person just like you you know what I mean and this is what I happen to be really good at yeah and and want and impassionate about so I want to continue to be good at it and get her and I guess this is the label that I have to take on you know so Thomas and I always joke with each other we're like we're not CEOs weirdoes you know but you know from the outside looking in from other people we are and we have to own it you know it's a part of our ego my ego at least yeah yeah well aren't you play the role something you know says says you know yeah you want that title you want that title and then the other part of me like my soul self is like I agree yeah we care about titles no but it's it's got me to where its it's a part of what's got me to where I am today and and like I said finally settling into the role of who I am and what I'm to do now you know we've if we want to talk about the organization we can and so we brought on a director of business development a year ago right we recruited him well he worked at Apple for a very long time about 10 plus years and he built sales teams that's what he did he built sales teams good fine so an apple is a culture everyone admires I'm going to say we're a lot of people it's obviously absolutes right Amazon Costco Apple you know Nordstrom's like model yeah yeah yeah right these these these cultures that they have and so he really brought that you know for us right in the right time because Thomas and I were maxing out you know it's right we can't be the smartest people at the table anymore I'm not a CMO I don't have these answers yeah yeah you know right and so we needed somebody to to come in not necessarily to teach us how to be a CEO or teach us how to be CMO or CFO or any of that it was just the competencies yes on how to level up right coachup coach up coach out you know and and those competencies are what you know Dell is his name brought to the table for us so um some of the company's been like communicating effectively right what does that mean you hear it yeah right yeah yeah skilled version of communicating effectively look like yeah it is an unskilled version yeah yeah kidding effectively look like right and so in the moment you know he would call it out if we're talking or arguing or which we don't argue anymore we just know we could you know each other's love languages and an apology languages we've got to talk about absolutely absolutely a big component yeah you know and everybody needs everybody has to anybody that comes onto our leadership team they have to do their languages because to prevent arguments yeah to allow to communicate effectively like talking to different languages yes yeah you're talking Italian and I Chinese totally I don't hear you I'm just waiting I really like you I'm just waiting to give myself that's it you know and we need to actively listen to each other you know so having somebody that came onto the team like Dell was able to bring a component of radical candor and just man it hurts when somebody calls you out on your [ __ ] [Music] that component of radical candor and being able to receive that type of me vacuum in the moment you know runs congruently with you know learning these different competencies of just how to be a better person yeah yeah it's and it's not that it levels just our communication up in the business but life yeah like my relationships are better for sure my family relationships are better my friendships are better I mean you sign me up someday someday yeah I look forward to that that's um that's really my goal with one of my goals within the company is to you know be a thought leader and a thought speaker for this information because I know how impactful it's been again for our organization myself yes you you know yeah to be able to communicate here today with you yeah like it is wouldn't it happened before cannabis no way no not not where I was huh and you said you came from from now I'm interviewing right you say no best format you said you were from Kansas City I was there for a couple years okay Kauai I grew up from Detroit area that's right okay got it so Midwest area yeah yeah I grew up in Branson Missouri right yeah Branson Missouri is where I was in Leawood oh cool yeah yeah my babies live in downtown Kansas City buzzer awesome like my family's there right now my parents were there there my stepfather does like he builds businesses we'll just say that and so he's over there building out of business right now yeah and so she's like come on we're at the casino I'm like no get out of the casino what do you do it out man I don't know what's going on right now she's like nobody's here it's great yeah first time the casino didn't have smoke [Laughter] so just having having somebody come onto our team at the right time this is a little over a year ago again call it call it divine if you will you know I will and I was like I had met del from from the cannabis industry he built a dispensary here and then let's just say we recruited him right the best people already have jobs yes most people already have jobs absolutely you know they really do go get them yeah I'm learning this the hard way so you know he was making a transition and we were able to get him onto the team right at the right time and he brought a couple other people from Apple and it was just like did we manifest this happen we're doing submit my resume yeah it is every single day every single day it is his growth yeah it is it is seriously growth and I I don't portray it a lot I don't think on my own my social you know and and it's it's because people only see what you want to be like we only show people what we want to see yeah you know yeah I guess it's figuring out how to put it into a format you know and yeah with that I guess why I'm sharing that is because again someday I hope to teach people this these things you know and and and and it started from a drug yeah yeah started all because of an illegal drug Wow a beautiful plant I know that is our mission to eliminate the negative stigma associated with this beautiful alternative that is so good right which is why I'm super excited to be with you because like you know me I'm just a radical out-of-the-box spiritual girl who loves God and and I really feel like God asked me to break shame off that plan amen you know and the cool thing is is just where we connect because I'm the same way if I got to put on my CEO hat that's where my inner [ __ ] comes out way too much you know okay I gotta be bossy you know but you really a label I'd love to put on you as you are such a prophet and you are so apostolic in activating things in the realm and those are churchy words and we don't typically hear in business but that's the realm where I live right because God didn't call me to the church realm but I see so much healing in what you did I want to backtrack to when you were like in wrestling in that because you can see going from a tough childhood into a sport having such empathy and even awareness and being exposed to this concept of cannabis for pain because of your coach yeah and look but it's but that should be the new normal right that as you chased that it opens that up so tell me like you were not just playing around with wrestling I mean you were at okay I've got notes here but Oklahoma State cuz I didn't know there's like that's when you go when you're like the Olympic level make me blush so so I I went I got a scholarship to a school called to a college in Tulsa Oklahoma called bacon college and that's where I wrestled okay for a year and then I had gone to Oklahoma not Oklahoma State but Norman Oklahoma University and I had spent about a semester there okay I didn't actually go to school there I didn't like you know spend a whole I didn't go to school I ended up dropping out I'm an I'm um call a dropout but me too I spent a semester there and then I had moved to Missouri to to Arizona because I had met my coach and the assistant coach Matt and in Oklahoma and he had Crohn's disease right nobody knew what it was however he would smoke a joint yeah and cannabis helping him is again what led me to come to Arizona and I was fortunate to have my mom living here California was course an option right it's so sad it was so saturated yeah already been legal for I think almost 20 years yeah so there's like I'm just a I'm just a pee going there yeah Arizona's pushing to go legal for the third time that led me so immediately when I came to Arizona though I I got into just the wrestling crowd you know I got a job at Applebee's some lady saw my tears and she was like oh you have cauliflower ear and I was like yeah she's like do you fight cause like no I wrestled and she's like my husband teaches jiu-jitsu and I was like I've never done jiu-jitsu she's like we'll come over he trains out of the house garage and they ended up living a mile away from me and and this man has been a mentor of mine for 10 years now Wow yeah and and his name's Bobby's I love the men you know and we talked a little bit you and I offline about your story a little bit on you know being on 140 milligrams of was an oxy cotton 140 milligrams oxycontin and 90 milligrams prednisone every day yeah and so a very similar story with him his health took a decline so I started training jiu-jitsu and got an MMA in cage fighting and his health started to take a decline and my family had a restaurant we're you know so I was working at the restaurant and that closed just a series of events and we lost connection Bob and I and that's how it just really started taking a bad decline and we reconnected about three years ago he reached out to me I had reached out to him a few times I have this I'm leaning into this more now than ever is like when you think of somebody it's not by coincidence no it's you should reach out to him okay so I would I would unknowingly I would just you know unknowingly of that thought I would just reach out to my came in Miss you hope everything's well you haven't seen you for a long long long long time right and finally I think it got to him and and and he had reached out and he said I'm done like I'm hanging in the coat like I'm done I'm done with these opiates and tell me about this yeah you know tell me about he's familiar with cannabis smoking and stuff but I think he'd just been watching and seeing what we're doing and he came over and Thomas came over and I think Nick came over to is another you know one of our buddies yeah we all talk cannabis you know in three four hours later he ate one of these watermelon slices after 3-4 hours of me explaining the processes he ate the watermelon cuz he's like this is [ __ ] delicious yeah that you should start yeah yeah and you know from there I mean he was on I think 90 milligrams of oxycontin and I think like upward of like 60 milligrams of morphine yeah yeah together yeah and he was doing those you know simultaneously hmm put together and troubles with insurance yeah travels with the doctor is trying to travel yeah he said he said I'm done yeah no yeah and he made the hard switch and this is what breaks my heart though is that the regimen that we were able to provide for him I don't want to say it's impossible to scale it's very difficult to scale yeah because everyone's gonna be a little different everyone's different and yes the amount of milligrams that he needed yes is not affordable in the dispensaries yeah no no I get it yeah I mean we're talking to 300 milligram bottle of our syrup a day yeah a day right you know and yeah you're talking like $1,000 a month absolutely yeah absolutely you know and so I was very fortunate you know in our situation to be able to it got to the point where like we can't do a 300 milligram bottle every single day like this man needs like a hundred milligrams you know periodically stretched out throughout the day right know upwards of 500 milligrams so that's one distillate came into the picture correct distillate hash oil right it's a refined process it's a distal ated process of hash oil right and a whole other conversation yeah yeah because there's so many different hash oils yeah yeah but what that did distillate is it gave us a it gave us a base for accurate dosing karere and so you're taking something that is in a flour form right which may be 10 to 15 milligrams per gram right and you are taking this bulk cannabis flower you are concentrating it you know through using certain solvents that can extract the THC correct other components of it Reds and then you can clean it up there's many different ways of cleaning it up you can filter it you can distill it so distillation again removes primarily all the lipids and strips primarily the the the the profile of cannabis but leaves behind the THC right okay so now you have something that is upward of 900 milligrams per gram yeah okay huge difference is that similar to like I used RSO quite a bit when I was winning yes yeah yeah RSO is a little different yeah that was that's a horror so changed the world changed my life changed a lot of people's worlds yeah so RSO preserves that full spectrum profile of the cannabis plant yeah so distillate you remove a lot of that except for the primary cannabinoids of THC and a couple others right there's like trace you know yeah amounts however that is what gave us the the foundation to be able to help him you know so we would make capsules right you know I would make capsules for him now he makes them himself yeah yeah you know and this is again years ago so now we can make whatever we want we make 50 milligram capsules we make 100 milligram capsules 200 milligrams yeah however I do believe and Derick our former director of education now our creative director has found some information out there that like your receptors can only take so much THC pressure for it's just it's like taking too much vitamin C for sure yeah yeah so there is an optimal yeah right and so he was using this hundred milligrams periodically throughout the day and you know it's he's completely pharmaceutical free now you know I think he's yeah he just came out of surgery so he's had to use you know some steroids and South but that's all right beyond that I mean it is it's changed his life again absolutely and people don't get to hear these stories no you know or they don't understand that this is not side of the road Cheech and Chong right okay I didn't want AXI so now I just want to be high as hell and I'm getting out my medicines and that's it's fascinating too it's fascinating that it heals yes you yes mine and body yeah and body yeah it provides the amount of alleviation that you need yes to feel yeah and you feel how to feel what feeling good feels like right people have forgot what feeling good feels like so then when you have a little taste of it again you're like this is what feels like you know same with food you know yeah let's get what it feels like to feel good eating food you know and it's something especially like right now we're living in what I will call the group single greatest love a trauma to hit globally then that I've ever experienced you have so many people now walking around who've been literally traumatized by kovat and all the other different things and my journey started because of awareness of trauma crazy thing I don't know how many stories you hear about this I had no interesting cannabis like using cannabis when I was in high school was the drug I didn't want you know what I mean I didn't enjoy the munchies I didn't enjoy the cottonmouth I couldn't stand the paranoia why do I want to sit around like a vegetable going hmm and and yet I began to study what happens with the endocannabinoid system and the plasticity of the brain by using the full plan yes to help the brain release trauma to restore plasticity how the endocannabinoid system can you speak into that because I think a lot of people who are hesitant are just like no I don't wanna be high but I was higher on opiates right do you get what I'm saying I was nor out of it well yeah the dissociation that happens in the numbing I believe that's the word right there's a disassociation that yeah and that's what I was I guess trying to say with cannabis is like you you you all of a sudden get to feel what it feels like to feel again yeah right you are not disassociated from your mind and body alright and and and that is a concern of people they're like I don't want to get high well yeah of course a lot of people don't want to get high no and and it's I find it fascinating I would love to hear your your story or experience with the to the patients that we've worked with that require high milligrams more that are winging off or transitioning right they don't often get high yeah and I'm talking they're using high milligram doses yeah I take 50 milligrams I'm speaking cursive yes now I am with which is so wild that I could use super high dose right and now it's five telegrams maybe 1020 in a day or just 120 milligram coming at night and when I have my Remicade I might use some plant or something because of the pain in that but after a day or two I'm iron and so and so that could be associated to the enou cannabinoid system yes right because is a system in place that is its its primary purpose is to help us meet homeostasis right right right so if we're on all kinds of these pharmaceuticals we are way out of whack way right we're requiring high doses and effort transitioning we're requiring high doses of cannabinoids right to fill these holes right yeah homeostasis and then as we begin to heal that lessens right yeah that lessens and so that's that's how we did it with Bob - I mean we titrated him up we titrated him down yeah staggered his dose that's a tie in and that way it wasn't just like 300 milligrams all at once so it was you know every four hours yeah a little to prolong that experience or that that relief that he would get from it and you know we've had success with it's been a roller coaster ride yeah but we've had success with it well and the other thing is people are so used to just okay my doctor said I'm supposed to take my pill at this time mmm that you're not paying attention to what's going on with your pain like first thing I did is broke the percocet that was used for breakthrough pain so instead of a full percocet I took a half a percocet and a little bit of RSO under my tongue and what's fascinating though is I remember when it began to really heal and I had been off all the opiates for about a month or so and I'm now really micro dosing way down because I'm not using as much because my big high dose was to prevent I had no side effects that's also when I wound off everything that's that that's I had to work with that but I felt like I took a limitless pill like a Baba sudden it was like 30 days in and I would be just like whoa I haven't felt that part of my brain since I was two that's not why that was actually a level of clear yeah endocannabinoid system do that like what is so I'm not scientist my body so healed I don't get that anymore I would I would encourage it's because the endo cannabinoid system is meeting homeostasis more optimally right and so that could very well be it and that that feeling or a moment of clarity is against something that you have not had an experience for the however long you know you were on the pharmaceuticals and so now your body is like whoa yeah I see color I taste I see I smell I can't cry and feel and get a relief right it's crazy how much cannabis heals and this is where you know some of my fellow Christians are like oh you're treading on dangerous land but who created it there's a there's a funny opens you there's a funny meme out there that said God created gave us cannabis and then man made it illegal yeah hello yeah and yeah I grew up I grew up with the Muslim father yeah and a Christian mother yeah how's that work yeah well they divorced yeah and I moved to Missouri they from Texas redneckville oh yeah I'd y'all smoking oh my god you bringing it out of me if you've ever seen the movie or the show Ozarks yeah I lived in Ozarks yeah pretty damn accurate you know and so careful who you choose to be friends with you know and and yeah exactly and so my father remained in Texas and he's still there today remarried lots of siblings beautiful wife all that and my mom got remarried as well and however when we moved to Missouri so I was seven we moved in with my uncle which was I don't know if this is a politically correct term but bible-thumper I'm talking I'm talking Baptist alcohol can hand on the table this is how it goes yeah you know and I spent the next three years living with him and it's I put a lot of I put a lot of thought into this and and over the years because it shaped me um it shaped me it traumatized me it scared me it also established a lot of morals mm-hmm and values I'm so grateful for yeah you know I was having this conversation not too long ago I mean it was his house that I learned the proper manners you know yeah just manners are for other people that's what it's for yeah and in structure right I I learned a lot of structure from this from this man and I mean it was church every Sunday every Wednesday sometimes even Saturday's my Bible studies and all that jazz and and I just remember you know I so vividly the the pastor just smacking the the podium like you're gonna go to hell if you do not believe Jesus as the Son of God yeah and that put that put the fear of God in just a little bit so I'm thinking I'm like doesn't lead you to a great relationship yeah just a fear and I'm like wait a minute my dad's Muslim and so I'm bawling my eyes out you know and he took the opportunity to it was my opportunity to be saved you know and right I'm glad that's the reaction I got I didn't know the difference my eyes out and he's like you know read this verse and you know you've been saved by Christ and you get baptized and all the stuff and I didn't know what it meant you know I mean like okay yeah well I mean I went back and forth I went to Texas I went to Missouri because that always was my dad I went overseas many many many times they'd always joke hey what's your religion you know do a half and a half and I'm like well you get it I'm milkshake yes and so it was always kind of a joke in when I got into college I took a world religions class yeah that's when I'd open the door was I started I learned about different religions and yeah I have a very passionate interest about the answer and and learned that Christ is arguably one of the most influential people of our time that what he did he was and there's so much to talk about right Christ Muhammad Krishna Buddha Native American wisdom there's no are all religions are they all against cannabis no whoa devil's lettuce the devil's lettuce right I remember I got my grandma to try a sour cush kid once and she tried it and and and and then the following day she was crying and she was praying to God to ask for forgiveness but but she has no problem taking or xanax every night so I was just like gosh dang it grandma are like oh you know what's something though is that like I want to open up the conversation of self-control mmm because like is it the tequila is it the cannabis is that that this is that the better is it self-control that when our spirits are not governed by all these rules but we operate with that understanding that power that we have to just moderate how do you have self-control if you've if if your surrounding doesn't really encourage it you know like yeah like growing up in Missouri right I mean this is what you did this is how it worked there was no outlier that was like no that's actually not right yeah you know that's not true about cannabis all right that's not true about medicine or religion or whatever there was none of the I think it was from hell right right right I smell a skunk that must be a demon my mom when we would because you know Missouri and she would smell a skunk I never understood yeah yeah she's like oh she likes love that smell like you're weird mom now I totally get it yeah I'll loop back to self control but you would ask is cannabis you know wrong in all religions and so that brings up an interesting interesting points because it's encouraged me to learn about this and so cannabis originated in China okay that's where that's the beginning of time that we that we know of fine they weren't using it to get high now they were using it for medicinal purposes and they would use the roots okay and they would they would boil the roots and they would make tea out of it okay not gonna get high from that but there are vital cannabinoid and you know other other components EBD know so the cannabinoid to my understanding cannabinoids will not be in the root okay of the cannabis plant and it's more vital cannabinoids components right and they would use that they would make topicals out of it they make teas out of it Wow okay so this is we're talking almost three thousand years ago a long time it transitioned into India that's when I started getting a little okay gotcha psychedelic yeah yeah they started using the flower in the plant right and so we were yeah and so we were talking about this yesterday actually so it's really fresh right now that's when cannabis was used for started began to be used for you for purposes and spiritual purposes and India has a festival called Holi festival and during this time they would sell preparation called bong or Bank DHA ng okay and this is a drink it's it's a it's a it's a drink it has different forms like a yogurt form and different forms and they would sell it during this this festival and it had you know you would get high from it right and they're still out there today like if you were to ask if you would be in India and ask them about cannabis they would kind of look at you funny right if you said bong leave it go yeah you know yeah and it's interesting it is and so that's when like the food preparation of cannabis you know came and it transitioned to Middle East which is still so crazy that there's very few plants you can actually bake and put in something and it maintains its structure totally that's just so freakin miraculous that that took yes God to create that yes can't do that with other players plant is an alien plan resistant and from there it made its way into the Middle East and that's when it that's when it started getting really strong yeah you know in a lot well a lot of people will say because of the growing conditions yeah right that influences how the plant grows rain you know altitude and soil and conditions all of that has a big role to play in it but I wanted to close the loop on on do all religion see it as as wrong but some religions or some cultures such as the Indian culture and new culture they they see it as a spiritual practice you know and it can be there there are there are people today who have cannabis ceremonies yeah you know and that is a high dose experience yeah yeah and I've been there you like like yeah unintentionally yeah no oh yeah like when I ate when I had a sucker yeah last week that you I did ask you then oh dear God that's when I was praying I can't god help me come this way what happened right and you can have a borderline out-of-body experience you know I wanted to always being your an out-of-body witnessing what is happening and it's like what is going on it's crazy lemon juice just put lemon juice in water and it was okay that's awesome for my listeners I I didn't intend to get that high I for some reason there's not thinking and I didn't know the suckers were just for licking for medicinal i literally chewed the dang thing in a minute and a half and then in about 20 minutes couldn't feel my lips and was i live by myself was laying over my counter and i got some lemon it's wild though how you can use lemon or you tell me even pepper hmm so there's I'm sure there's a terpene within the lemon juice yeah Dee limonene or or somewhere probably one of those that helps same thing with pepper so beta carry off a lien is another Fein that is a common terpene in cannabis but just smelling it you obviously don't want to you know inhale no no it's kind of smell it a little bit and that can help reduce the nausea right associated to being high right beyond that I mean buckle up so many people like like when I talk about cannabis I've been building business obviously I talk about God openly and I love all people so they thought I went off the deep end and yet I'm gonna make a radical statement if I had to have surgery I'm not against opiates mmm that was never any work well here's the deal I was never addicted I was tolerant my body was tolerant I did not you know thank God because of all different kinds of thing was not psychologically dependent but physiologically now in retrospect we're talking 2004 to 2017 I was on opiates Wow so I find it more demonic what the opiates did to my mind my inability to heal my inability to process when I say cannabis opened me you know I don't know how many stories you've heard on that that's what I wanted to ask you where it was now time to feel and I felt like as it healed and for me it's just physiology at science I didn't get high and then I felt my body was healing and my brain and my heart and my soul could operate together men and I cuts they're driven yes and I could process and some of the feelings were so much that the cannabis actually helped it not get too overwhelming right when you're healing and and that that that healing that being able to feel is really what I think the the root of it is is because these opiates or pharmaceuticals can condole you down and and I want to be clear because you had said you're not against or I'm not against opiates and the proper usage thank God if I have to have surgery you ain't touching me without a so just for the audience listening right now I'm not saying that pharmaceuticals are all bad no work for some it's just that the long-term use yeah and the side effects that can that accompany it are are detrimental to your health like your bad is what I mean like they can hurt you you could use half the dose even after surgery by using your gummies and whatever pain medicine they give you and you'll use that yeah I mean I have friends that have had surgeries and use none yeah absolutely I had all four wisdom teeth pulled out and they gave me a bottle of them and I was like I'm good I got syrup Yeah right I didn't touch it awesome no you know and and have quite a few friends that are like that and them just again being able to feel again is what is the healing come is one of the healing components of what cannabis does right cannabis Jason Silva talks about this a lot and I love it because it couldn't be more true is that canvas has this innate way of moving our mind from the past removing our mind from the future and just allowing us to focus right here and now and some people experience that and and unintentionally and they don't even understand and when you can be here and now you can feel you can process you can rationalize you can think logically you know that's why you know you use cannabis or smoked cannabis eat it whatever and you start wondering how things work ya know right right it didn't it instills one curiosity and you're wondering yes yes yeah yeah it instills wonder back into your life right I think wander is is is maybe something that a lot of people lack now you know because wander could be correlated to perspective yeah you know it's like to be to have a proper communication I have to be able to objectively commute perceive objectively you know like yeah if I disagree with something that's okay yeah yeah you fishing that absolutely right I still need to wonder where your perception is coming from yes right yeah and and try at least to see that at versus being so close-minded to it okay you know and I'm just like no that's not how this is how it works you know and so little tools like cannabis being one of those right we there are there are plant induced modalities or plant modalities there are non plant modalities right meditation right and absolutely competencies and that can again instill wander right and that wander again is what can lead to healing right because I truly truly feel of all the practices I have done I've used cannabis for 15 years okay I've done other plant medicines I've dabbled with psychedelics we're going to talk about that yeah and and and very all are very powerful tools I do not think any single one is the answer not only they are all tools toolbox right if I have a screw I can't hammer it in maybe the proper tool exactly right so good and and so of all of those what I believe they boiled down to is awareness and love so combine those you have love you know right I cannot love you if I'm not aware and I cannot be aware if I do not have love for the other person and so what all of that compiles into is integration right conversation conversation is the integration of all of this work because when we can talk about it when we can rationalize and see each other's perspective that's where a lot of healing can come and yeah yeah we're not I mean I read a statistic recently that married couples I don't know how many people was done but like they talk to their spouse on average 28 minutes a week and I'm like what no that's insane you know right yeah and so it just that one statistic just goes to show how disconnected we are yeah in a time where we are where's my phone more connected than ever yeah right yeah they're so disconnected yeah you know that that human interaction and and again being able to comprehend the communication that's happening that in itself it's it's talk therapy you know that in itself is extremely powerful which leads to cannabis use or psychedelic use because there are if I may open the door on using psychedelics yeah yeah so and we're talking micro dosing Vitamix which is something I mean well let's back up for just one quick sec because one of the things we were talking about is that the number one thing that changed my life as I started sleeping hmm so like I'm 56 today 52 and a half years old and I'm now sleeping through the night okay that's why sometimes I'm like okay was it the sleep and the cannabis healing the endocannabinoid system that actually gives you the awareness to go deeper even in your own life to go into the stuff that might have been scary because like two weeks of I felt like all I wanted to do is sleep for a month initially and then you wake up and you have the exhilaration like you used to when you were a kid when you wake up because you wake up rested yes and then you're open to different things now going in is psychedelics go ahead into that on sleep there's a book called why we sleep by Matthew Walker he's a sleep expert and K is fantastic okay it will dynamically change your priority list for sleep you can add anything you want of mine oh my don't touch my yeah and there's a large there's a large contribution to healing health healing to sleep ya know when we sleep we heal right we have to and so what what's happening when we use cannabis is and there's there's there's some articles out there on this that talk about this we skip the REM State yes okay we skip um rapid eye movement that's where that's largely associated to where we dream right okay right and we skip this rim sleep also during if you have a lot of rim your sleep isn't always the best because people who suffer from PTSD yeah it may fall in that that that ever stay deep right that stage of sleep there's four stages I believe there are awake light rim and deep right and so when when we in like you said we go in cycles those cycles repeat itself three or four times a night light REM deep light REM d you wake up feeling exhausted yes if you don't get enough sleep or if you wake up in the wrong sleep state yeah wrong stage of sleep by skipping rim a lot of people who use cannabis don't dream often and if anybody who has used cannabis for quite a while and then stops using cannabis yeah if there are listeners right now you may be shaking your heads about to know what I'm gonna say you have very vivid dreams very married yes and and they can be bad they can be good I mean I had dreams of riding a motorcycle through the Amazon with Joe Rogan once I was like wow yeah so it's a sign what's up Joe very very vivid very real make you feel exhausted when you wake up you know and so you using cannabis you skip that and you go you go into deep sleep and that's why sometimes we feel a little bit more rested yeah you know however you know Matthews Walker Matthew Walker's book really highlights the importance of all the stages and rim in deep sleep and and and I may have this wrong or backwards but rim is more of a hormonal healing sleep state right our deep sleep is a physical yeah in sleep right yeah you may have that backwards but I believe that's correct and so there's this Acadian the circadian rhythm so there's there's a there's a there's a you have to go through all the cycles right and so that's why people who use cannabis will get really deep rested state and they feel better and yeah and and but we still want to shine light on that on that REM state and so going back to the endocannabinoid system we have endo cannabinoids right and then there are exogenous cannabinoids can I have annoyed czar in many things not just cannabis right food really Whole Foods and so there are two primary endocannabinoids there's two AG and an and amide okay Amanda might Ananda in Greek means bliss so they coined it as the Bliss molecule hmm really really we're alive and so if you've ever been working out yeah I had that runner tires oh yeah yeah that's an animai yeah I'm gonna run for president so working out or like that runner's high or entering flow state Remo with Marshall larger yeah we talked riding even riding even getting into that flow State yeah that's an and amide and that'n and amide you're literally getting high on your own supply so for people listening that have ever experienced that it I've never used cannabis yeah you've experienced the euphoria that comes with cannabis yeah that is it exactly one of the billing is the out-of-body experience but your body was still doing everything listen yeah you know that that runner's high yeah that I know a lot of people can relate to that is a component of what's happening so when when we use cannabis were we're if we aren't sleeping well or there's something in our body that we're just not healing for mind or body we're lacking a certain cannabinoid that's one component of it yeah yeah we're lacking some type of cannabinoids so we either need to change our diet or we can use other modalities like cannabis right that we are now bringing in exogamous cannabinoids right and so when we bring those in or in no cannabinoid systems like yeah and so or energy that laughs yes it doesn't go up and be like oh my god I'm gonna die consistent yeah right you're giving your body what it wants know what it needs you know and and that will then contribute to better sleep as way you know and that's that's a component of it and so from there we'll we were talking about psychedelics but sleep is so so so so important well and you know what's crazy too is they talk about the health of the gut and sleep and you know I battle Crohn's and I'm grateful for Remicade but even using like the gummies and stuff like that from baked grouse I'm excited to use the syrups because you can really titrate down to small amount of milligrams but my last Remicade I didn't even use any inhalation I've had two Remicade since all this cop\u00e1n nonsense and craziness has started but what was amazing is I actually felt better two days in because my number one objective with Remicade which is a lot of people with like chemo and stuff is to sleep mm-hmm I need to sleep for the night you know the doctor says I need you to sleep as much as possible when you feel like crap you're like oh yeah thank you very much for that because I haven't been sleeping for six weeks you know but you use that and you literally can feel your body the only thing I can say pharmaceutical wise is like when you feel horrible you have pneumonia you take an antibiotic and a week or so later also do you feel like quote-unquote yourself again but what that what the cannabis does with the deep sleep and with restoring the in the endocannabinoid system restoring itself right that is self healing right there gosh there are I feel we're gonna have to do another episode to talk about self healing and self-love yeah because there's a lot of healing that comes from that self-love and and and the cannabinoids that you get from products like these right so yeah yeah let's talk about the syrups okay so the syrups I can't wait to try them it's a great product and these are indica so these are indica do they come in both yes they do okay come in indica and sativa these are so there's a green tag on them and they'll tell you so this is granddaddy purple okay this is the unflavored syrup what's unique about the the syrups is that they are they it's a very health conscious product yeah okay we're talking primarily organic brown rice syrup no flea are no colors no artificials at all Wow real fruit extracts you know how in our flavored ones diabetics safe sugar free I mean it's that we made this product for that reason for sure yeah and micro dosing it is is how I encourage people to begin with it yeah if you do not know your dose yes so also on this tag there's a couple dosing I think we do one milliliter five milligrams teaspoon is 25 milligrams per tablespoon is 75 milligrams and they act fast because the first thing I can put it under my tongue correct they act fast and and and and so because of primarily because of the oral administration right so we're not chewing this we're not ingesting it right it is a oral application we have the buccal and mucosal lining of the mouth and the arterial glands of the tongue right help get it into the system much more quicker so in short the bioavailability is superior no no is that the same reason why inhalation works because of going through the mucosal in you know obviously it goes into the lungs I believe I've heard Derek speak about this and and I think that is one of the reasons why cuz right that's why a lot of people use smoking because it's quick yeah five minutes you know and you if you if you don't have enough in your pains bad you can actually just take a little bit more and and we'll help right but then you run the risk of getting like raspy voice and coughing I'm in the gym five six days a week and I can tell when I'm inhaling totally I don't have the resistance as much totally and so that's something that the products like edibles will help mitigate right right and so when you smoke it on sets fast and only lasts about an hour and a half to two hours right you so the the the conversion is different how long does the syrup last so anywhere from four to six hours depends amazes yeah this is because of the conversion so when we eat inedible or let's say the syrup for this for this purpose it it it it the liver converts THC to something to an active metabolite called eleven hydroxy THC right and this is arguably three to four times stronger than THC right so take that into consideration and eating that so yeah and so with the syrup what we always recommend is to use a oral milliliter syringe okay right a lot of people have them you can get at Walgreens yeah yeah I'll give them to you a little baby right one milligram or one milliliter is five milligrams okay gotcha now the psychoactive threshold of THC is two point five milligrams anything below two point five milligrams that's a CBD but likelihood is you're not you're not gonna have a psychoactive effect no so for the people that are concerned about getting high right start low for sure you can take two point five milligrams of this syrup wait I would say 15 to 25 minutes right assess how you feel yeah take another two point five milligrams you know and that's the glory of the restrictions being lifted and us being able to provide products like this for sure right so yeah now we can we can get into micro dosing right not just psychedelics but micro dosing cannabis absolutely you know and yeah and that's how I use it now other than like I go to bed it's just one gummy but if I need it during the day I'm micro dosing that's awesome yeah I think that's absolutely fantastic I feel a true micro dose of THC would be 2.5 to 5 milligrams okay and and and and we're seeing 10 milligrams as the common ground for a single dose of THC across the nation right and I I would I would beckon that that should and will change as it becomes federally legal because in the recreation states were seeing restrictions like yet that edibles cannot be more than 100 milligrams and they have to be able to be dosed in 10 milligram increments right okay all recreational right exactly I've seen five milligrams put somebody over the edge period and I accidentally got a hundred milligram attaboy showed you that I was that I was at getting my order which I do have to tell you guys this bake bros converted me from mostly I mean I'm I haven't even don't use inhalation as much as I use the syrups and the gummies in that but I accidentally I thought I had because no no Kofi do you have to order it online and then you go to the curb and you throw the dude your money and he throws you your bag kidding kind of answer you gotta go up there and then they've got a pre ready and I'm looking in my bag when I got home and I thought it's 100 milligram gummies yeah and how am I supposed to slice right you don't know you're making me nervous looking at it it's still in my bathroom I felt I felt a little bit of the past I mean I'm like okay so how long does this last is it gonna go bad no look well no I mean if I have this at home let's and I thought well at least I can cut it in fours or something how long would a gummy last how long do gummies last for efficacy I guess is the word like is this gonna last for six months so they're gonna start to do rating so we have a year on our product okay products which is amazing plant turns into like totally CBD after a while and so that's one conversion yes THC particularly converts to something called CBN okay I am over time I'm talking a long time yeah I'm talking a long time a long time for it to convert unless it takes a long time for it to convert unless heat is being applied okay so let's let's use the analogy of example of smoking a joint Blount okay we're smoking this joint and we're smoking it and they you know it's getting shorter and shorter right order and then we get to the the last half right the roach right right yeah yeah yeah and let's say we put it out halfway okay we come back to it the next day and we smoke it again well we are just ripped now okay yeah it's like what on earth happened with us yeah this is this is not the same feeling I had yesterday I'm like way more sedated more hi what's happening is that THC because of the heat is converting to CBN and and that is that's acts more of a sedative and it makes you more tired and it makes you more stony and so no wonder I only needed a hit just one little I had to sleep all night there's I'm coughing in my sleep yes yes yeah yeah and to that point though there's there's so much that we're still going to be learning about this plant and there are so many restrictions that we have that prevent us from being able to do control trials right you know or double-blind trials I know like we just can't do it like they can't be done you know I think sue Sisley is doing some of them for cannabis and PTSD but the restrictions are very like it's very limited to what we can do and how we can study this and so a lot of this has been trial and error and people's testimonials and people sharing their stories of yourself that have a large reach like this what we have to do is provide this type of information and so going back to the to the syrups you know being able to microdose it that and it that that is arguably anybody that is new to cannabis is the number one way I would recommend using cannabis is if it's not the syrups if you're in a state where we're not you know I would I would highly encourage using something that is a oral base right and dry yeah it has a test result yeah you know that way you have some type of base that you're starting with yes many milliliters equals this many milligrams right and I need to start with two point five milligrams and assess how I feel yes everybody will feel different to known this when I first started I was like you know well I remember thinking okay I'm really not fond of that not a drug I even wanted in high school and blah blah blah blah and so here I am the other side I'm a grandma you know I haven't I hadn't driven in three years when they put me on the higher doses when I was on lower doses okay but out of respect for myself and everybody else I hadn't wasn't driving and as I weaned I started to drive and nobody you know I studied a lot I had a couple coaching calls with a few people who knew and my advice to people is what happened to me was I didn't realize how much a potentiated the opiates yeah so I was literally high for two weeks three yes and I remember thinking okay I'm supposed to be a social-media influencer and most of my fellows are Christians and I'm upping up my phone going no how do people do this certainly they're not high all the time and I'm wondering if this sometimes this is what people think when I say I use cannabis they just think I'm high all the time I remember saying to somebody when's the last time you met a high on who runs a company works out six days a week and hello I can't even do that when I'm tired let alone what was I totally but the body begins to adapt which is amazing mm-hmm cuz like you can hit your tolerance and I've done that in learning how to use it and weaning but then you just wait a day or so you use lemon waterway today this is not like oh my god now I got a wean for six months to get back to my dose No right how incredible that the body would readjust it like sixty it really sixty out you know hours it's like two three days you're fine totally yeah that that's and you can go back to your small dose again that is that is something that is really unique about all psychedelics yeah right is that we some have some you can build a tolerance you some you don't really build a tolerance who's gonna hit you how right it's you you know and though there's there are so many plant medicines that that we don't even know about III I mean there are so many cacao ayahuasca ibogaine yeah cannabis you know mushrooms my favorite psilocybin you know like there are and I speak of all of those psilocybin well let me start with LSD okay that's not a plant medicine it comes from a it's it's synthetically created in a lab typically as how LSD in the controlled trials but it comes from a fungus called ergot it grows in which your God grows in rye correct kay and Albert Hoffman is one who discovered this brand and it Elysee has more white paper studies than any other medicine yeah any other medicine we have today besides caffeine wait until I open that topic with you we I really want to do another episode because I never and some of my my listeners are like what the hell did you just say but my doctor my gastroenterologist said to me I think you have trauma trapped in your gut and there are proven not spiritual although it will affect you certainly there are medical studies showing hundreds of these he believes that that will be part of you getting me off yes Remicade yes so now I'm pursuing EMDR with an incredible therapist and I'm open to doing a clinical trial on now on doing that my only hesitancy is not that it's mushrooms or you know a micro dosing people understand you're talking a very [Music] naltrexone has been historically used for ms so tell trucks don't gets people off of heroin addiction different things like that is used for a variety of ways to cause people to come off of opiates or whatever eighty milligrams or something like that versus point five right for ms so we're talking a very mystical dose now the crazy thing to me my only hesitancy is Willa s mess up my SSRIs in my gut because my SSRIs are very like when they had me on antidepressants years ago no no I don't I don't like Cracker Jacks and II but the stabilizing is very different than ketamine it's very different than other things used clinically for PTSD to help the parasympathetic nervous system reset yep will you talk to me just a little bit about psychedelics and PTSD and releasing trauma yes so LSD and psilocybin particularly have been studied well a lot of these that all that I've just mentioned have been studied regarding PTSD it's one of the most fascinating topics you know sue Sisley here in Arizona is leading a study for with cannabis and veterans who have PTSD also MDMA so using MDMA treat pts yes you know and there are Institute's out there you Sona which is I think out of Wisconsin where psychologists and psychiatrists are being taught how to do psycho assisted their therapies therapeutics right yeah and this this was happening this was happening in in 1930s to 1960s almost 1970 right 1967 is when all this got shut down yeah by the government absolutely you're getting too well stopped little literally yes yes and so like Johns Hopkins was was leading this and and they're they're the psilocybin psilocybin is the active ingredient in mushrooms okay just as th yeah is the active ingredient in cannabis that's what psilocybin is to mushrooms okay no mushrooms I get violently ill from so I may have yes something different yes rooms and and and I won't get deep into it now but there is a purpose for micro dose and clinically what is labeled as a heroic dose right that is that is what Johns Hopkins will refer to yeah as a heroic dose and and stanislav grof he's a pioneer in this you know he's led over 5000 psycho assisted their therapy yeah you know where they I saw it a New Amsterdam and the TV show Oh incredible like incredible that they were doing it this is and my listeners need understand we're not talking about a bunch of unicorn no in a room pink enough had somewhere you're talking John Hopkins Duke Mayo yeah and so I'll run you through what that process looks like a little bit you using psilocybin or LSD what they will do is they will you'll get very familiar with the therapist right typically 2 8 hour sessions with the therapist right because the two most important factors one of the two most important factors in any psychedelic micro or macro will say is your set and setting yeah so your set being your mind set exactly mindset going into the experience right if you are terrified and just you know neurotic and just likelihood is it's not gonna be good for you and it's not the right time and there's other things we need to work on before this is interesting if so mindset set and then your setting alright I've been in in experiences where I'm at a festival and I've had friends I'm truly speaking friends and I'm not saying this is me because I know better but I have friends who have taken psychedelics LSD and MDMA at music festivals and they just freak out the setting is not conducive for that type oh no components not it got it all you know anxiety and fear and all these things can set in and so set in settings so John Hopkins providing these controlled settings right it's a very it's like living room here you know it's beautiful yeah you know therapy chairs music you trust you know you've built trust with this therapist yeah that you've spoken to and yeah anybody who's been through therapy knows how the process gonna talk and the answer that's it yeah I'm an unbiased point of view hopefully yeah and so you you establish this relationship you establish this trust and then the third component so set setting the third component is intention right very and this is such a fastest T important word because prayer intention they have they have am I in my heart a large correlation to each other means right in prayer prayer I've always felt is you're putting it out right you're speaking to God or speaking to the universe you're speaking to source your yeah your our words have a frequency yes we can measure this we can know that this is science aside you can see words just have in a lab you're not a hippie house exactly exactly I are and I encourage people to listen and learn about this like yeah our words have a frequency and when we put them out there whether it be through conversation like this yeah or it be through prayer and more intention exactly we can alter the energetic space our auras around us it's the it's the conversation that helps build context okay context is what you need because when we are under the influence of these altered states psychedelic and yes if we don't have the context what's happening right it can be terrifying yeah anxiety absolutely yeah but if we have the context to deal with the experience yeah then we can then make sense of what's happening right and so you you patients will relive the experience which can sound very terrifying but it can also help bridge the gap in the parts that were blacked out or missed yeah right and then you speak to the therapist about that and again integration yeah that conversation is where the healing occurs and so in and so maps maps dot-org is is leading the world in psychedelic studies and anybody listening wants to go there you can go to resources and you can there's a link for or a page for all the studies that have occurred yeah all of the stage and you can see psilocybin or al a psilocybin used for addiction right right being able to break people who have smoked for thirty years right right PTSD depression yeah you there's so much out there and so that that is the that's the king of resources right there they're leading the world and in these studies and so that's where I would want to direct anybody who is fascinated by the science of this and you can actually read the the controlled settings that occurred yeah it's and and I mean one session for some from any one session yeah what I'm gonna take their whole life right yeah and so there's a joke like I see a couple of your books over here Titan and and tribe of mentors Tim Ferriss who really is uh who really started my personal development growth today but he talks about an ayahuasca experience that he had yeah and he jokingly but seriously says that had I known that I could go do this 8-hour experience and get fifteen years of therapy dello I would have done that hell you know yeah and that's what happens yeah I heard about it so many times fifteen years of trauma and in therapy in an eight-hour session yeah like what yeah right cuz and that's where dr. Joe Dispenza mm-hmm speaks about what's happened he gets into the science I know is you are a see wiring your brain very much so you wire very much so and it is incredibly fascinating yeah I I'm I am a big proponent I love the science of it me too and me too Thomas takes to do it Thomas is being about yeah yeah yeah I'm I'm more in love and passionate about the metaphysical side of it so yeah yeah chill side of it yeah also understanding yeah there's a scientific side to this yeah so when you have someone like Joe Dispenza who bridges the gap between the metaphysical the spiritual healing yeah things which has occurred for thousands of years shamanistic approaches they were doctors shamans were technically spiritual doctors and then you bring this component of science to it you're like oh that's what's happening it's fascinating they're both happening yeah this manifold side is happening yes but neurologically in your body this is what's happened we're tripartite beings yeah so we're body so spirit you can't rest connect right the trinity yes absolutely it's incredible and and I I love Joe Dispenza because he really metaphysically and in spiritual practices it's often that breath is a big component we it's an autonomic process we just automatically do it we are either right because if you don't you're dead yeah uh-huh and we also breathe on consciously right we shallow breaths right words and when you're on opiates you cannot take deep breaths oh wow cuz it's a massive cough suppressant Wow I that was one of the first parts I had to learn is how to react so Jen ate my lungs Wow yeah and and so when we we connect mind intention mm-hmm with heart yeah yeah hate love yeah with breath life yeah something happens in cross something happens yeah right that these practitioners figured out thousands of years ago yeah and have used for thousands of years yeah however someone like Joe Dispenza has dedicated his life to figuring this out Sam Harris these these individuals yeah I have all their books they have measured it and they have the monitoring it and they are sharing it that hey when you connect mine heart and breath yeah this is what happens yeah right incredible and you have all of a sudden these miracles mmm you know people wouldn't consider them to be miracles like it's incredible yeah it's it's I am one it's really awesome and and I I really do I'm very passionate about it I can tell very an incredible human who would have thought a watermelon dummy could bring cannabis I need him to be in watermelon and then I need him this is where he's gonna grow people sometimes ask me what's your purpose you know and it shifts shifts you know that that's I think I think that's a difficult question for a lot of people and I save quite a bit of time on it yeah and right now my purpose is to be here now right Rama das be here now yeah and because if I can be here now I can serve whatever purpose it is I need to serve right here and right now yeah right and I try and apply that because trying to figure out my life's purpose yeah can get overwhelming you know it's gonna change if I'm too tired if people that were in my life and circumstances or maybe I lose a family member and that purpose is gonna change yeah if my dad is sick then my purpose is to go take care of my dad my purposes right right but my purpose is to just be here now so gonna be a blank sheet like sheet of paper yeah you know and and that's that's the that's the karmic way of looking at it right is just to allow what's happening to happen right and yeah that's always been that's that's always been something that I've battled with people with and not like I don't say battle maybe because I don't argue about it but try and get people to talk about it and understand you know because I have friends and family that are like no like you just rainbows and butterflies you know this and that no and and it's like that's a component of it yeah you know I think it's a skill oh yeah yeah very much you know it's not that what's happening if something bad this Cove is happening right mmm-hmm you could perceive it one way I can perceive it the other mhm the same stuff is happening exactly sucks it does it's my choice to deal with it the way I deal with it yeah you know and and that's that like that's my purpose right now is to be here now I think you also have a purpose of helping people be wide awake yeah thank you very much and I'm just so honored that we've been able to spend this time it feels like it was like 20 minutes and yeah I think oh my gosh and I'm excited about opening up more topics but I want to make sure that people can find you we're gonna make sure we put links by the videos in the podcast episode they can find you as Instagram your favorite yes Instagram is my personal primary platform okay you can search Nadim al-haj I guarantee I'm probably the only one on there that'll pop up but it's a latin word called unit iose you have two stands for unity yeah and that's that is my instagram handles you nati yes i'm on facebook but instigated my main platform you can always check out bay crows calm yeah vapors are calm is our baby

podcasts though yeah a couple different pages out there it's been amazing my friend you have how I felt they came for sharing your light your wisdom and knowledge and yeah thank you for watermelon come [Music]", "X4Mr3BU7CdA": "Welcome back guys, I'm Gus, the African\nPlant Hunter, and this is the second episode I'm doing on this plant,\nLemonbush, Fever tea, \"Zumbani\" in the local language,  Lippia javanica, part\nof the Verbena family. Very well known in traditional medicine in southern Africa\nas a general pick-me-up, tonic. It's drunk as a tea. It's called \"Fever Tea\" because, when you have a fever, this is the plant you go to.\nLet me tell you a little bit about some of the chemistry in this remarkable\nplant. It's got an essential oil and in the essential oil are a number of\nvolatile compounds, mostly terpenes, and these terpenes are very \ninteresting, and there's a lot of similarity with cannabis, in this plant.\nNo THC but..... First one I'm gonna talk about, as a terpene - so terpenes as you\nknow, (or maybe know) are naturally used by a plant as a defense against\ndisease and against pests. Always interesting from a medicinal point of\nview, pharmacological point of view. So, the first tirpene in this plant that is well-known and very interesting is called Myrcene. Myrcene is found in \ncannabis and well-known, documented, to treat pain and inflammation. In cannabis\nit also is known to expedite the uptake of THC. Myrcene is found in mangos - the\nmango myth is the story that, if you consume a mango about 45 minutes before\nyou then consume cannabis, the THC will be enhanced. And, in fact, that is true and\nthe reason for that is the Myrcene in the mango. Next compound in this plant,\nLippia, of interest is Linalool. Linalool is the compound that gives lavender\nit's very distinctive odour. Lavender has been used for hundreds of years to help\nyou sleep - little sprigs of lavender under your pillow at night, and that's\nbecause of the Linalool. Now Linalool is a powerful anti-inflammatory, it's a\npowerful analgesic, insect repellent. Linalool is used in prevention of fleas and ticks. Linalool also has antifungal and\nantimicrobial properties. So that's the second compound - second, very\nremarkable, compound in this plant, similar to the lavender.  And then the\nthird one is Caryophyllene,  or sometimes known as  Beta-Caryophyllene. It's a terpene. It's found in clove oil cannabis, hops. Caryophyllene is the compound\nthat gives black pepper it's very distinctive spiciness, and it has the\ndistinction of being the first known dietary cannabinoid that has actually been approved by the FDA for use in foods. So Caryophyllene is one of the\nfirst cannabinoid compounds, other than THC, CBD, CBN, to bind directly to the\ncannabinoid receptors. But what's really interesting about this is that it\nselectively binds to the CB2 receptors. So you get CB1 and CB2. The CB1\nreceptors are the ones that are responsible for the narcotic effect and\nthe CB2 receptors are the ones associated with atherosclerosis and\ninflammation. Caryophyllene is therefore a compound that is very useful in a range of medicinal applications, because of its ability to bind directly to the CB2 receptors. It's used in the treatment of anxiety, the treatment of depression, it's\nalso used in the treatment of diabetes. And it also, Caryophyllene also has\nknown and documented tumour suppressing properties. So I think that's it guys.I've gone through the compounds that I know of in Lippia javanica that have been found by science. This plant has great potential in the treatment of cancer, in the treatment of diabetes,\ngreat potential in the treatment of depression and anxiety and is known for\npain, inflammation, as an analgesic and is the go-to plant when you've got a cough\nor you've got a cold, in our part of the world, in southern Africa. As I said\nbefore in a previous episode, sadly it's not technically legal to be sold in\nEurope or North America. It hasn't been through the regulatory processes. If\nyou're in Southern Africa, of course, you can drink it all the time. It's called\nZumbani, or Fever tea, or Lemonbush. Just go and get yourself some next time\nyou're feeling sick, as it is magic, magic stuff. Alright, I'm Gus, the African\nPlant Hunter, it's been fantastic talking to you guys and I really look forward to talking to you again. I'll catch you later, bye!", "ynEn89i2gVI": "when growing cannabis there are usually two common species your farmer is looking to harvest sativa and indica the effects of a sativa dominant strain are

this morning entitled what's in my food deciphering food labels with ahmed is a registered dietitian with over 10 years of experience working for a health core health care organization as well as a as a nutrition instructor at a local college she holds her bachelor's degree in psychology from the university of california los angeles and her master's degree in public health specializing in nutrition from loma linda university she specializes in weight management for adults and children and chronic diseases linked to nutrition she's also a certified personal trainer she's active in the muslim community serving on various boards and committees including our own she is a board member for the rahma foundation she's passionate about all aspects of well-being and just as passionate about a good cup of tea so without further ado we welcome ruriki for the next webinar in our series on health and nutrition welcome everyone thank you so much sister father well for that intro i'm so happy to be here i'm really excited about this session actually and um we're going to really get into the trenches here and we're going to just decipher food labels and i'm also going to be talking about supplements so we're going to kind of you know dive in as much as we can here and this is roughly a two hour session so you know get comfortable take your stretch breaks as needed um but we're going to go the the roughly the full two hours and that's also going to include some question and answer at the end so feel free as you're you know thinking up some questions you can put them in the chat box i'll get to them at the end of the the session here all right so as sister fedora mentioned i am a registered dietitian been doing this um for over a decade and food labels is a subject that a lot of people um you know find to be very complicated so i am going to really simplify things you know as much as i can here um and kind of give you the main points that we should be looking at and focusing on all right let me get to my next slide here we go all right so our agenda for this morning so why even read food labels like what's the point um so we'll talk about that common pitfalls so we have to remember everyone that the label is a commercial and food companies want us to not only buy their product but continue to buy their product so there's a lot of interesting stuff that's included on label so we're going to kind of sort through that to see what's real what's not another big question i get all the time organic yay or nay so we'll kind of dive into that as well i'll break down the different definitions of you know organic whether we need everything organic whether it's more nutritious or not then we're going to actually get into the nutrition panel itself and the ingredients so as sister father mentioned um the beginning of the session here if you have any labels that you're really curious about grab them um it's really nice to kind of look through things so as i'm you know presenting this information you know you can kind of see what's going on with products that you're purchasing and um again at the end of the session you know i'll open up for for questions so if you're like oh i don't know i had this label look good but i'm confused if it really is so you know we'll take a look at that and then last but not least at the end of the session i'm also going to be talking about supplements vitamins and minerals and protein shakes there's just so much um in the marketplace and especially now with with the covet era you know so many different um ads that we see promoting different products that are going to help us beat the virus and and so forth so we'll also take um a look at that as well all right so why even read food labels in the first place well first things first this really helps us to improve our diets and we as the consumer really um need to be proactive you know in our health and when we are looking at the food labels you know by law the nutrition panel does have to include certain information um and whatever we see is the truth so i know i get this a lot from from patients like oh well how can i believe you know what they're saying is really what they're saying and you know the nutrition panel itself there are certain guidelines um that the fda has put in place that manufacturers have to abide by so there is laws behind that now as to the front of the label as we'll talk about in just a moment that is a little bit more um uh pliable i guess you can say um so we'll talk about that so basically reading food labels is going to help us to improve our diets we're going to be able to really delve deep into the different nutrition information on the back of the food label ingredients are listed and that's really important in case we need to avoid something so of course as muslims you know certain ingredients we need to avoid like gelatin and lard and and things like that and um you know as a kid i'm sure a lot of us grew up you know reading food labels you know kind of looking am i allowed to eat this or not and i was telling sister photo yesterday that one of my favorite memories actually from childhood is and i remember this very clearly is when oreo cookies finally took out lard because before that oreos used to have lard in it and we couldn't eat that and we used to just kind of get by with hydroxy and as a kid i really wanted to eat oreos like all the other kids and when they finally took lard out it was you know a cause of celebration with a packet of oreos so we as muslims again we many of us already are looking at ingredients anyways um so that's good but also for those that have allergies we are definitely seeing a rise in allergies so that's really key too um to see you know what is in the ingredient is there anything i have to avoid for those that have um allergies to nuts um manufacturers even will list on the bottom of the label even if there's no nuts in the product itself the list on the bottom of the label that you know manufactured in a facility that does process nuts because some people are very highly sensitive to even the dust of nuts so that's really key also what we're going to dig deep later on is certain nutrients we need to look at because we do have to cut back and kind of limit certain nutrients as much as possible like saturated fat trans fat sodium especially those that have high blood pressure are really cognizant of sodium but actually all of us should be you know looking at sodium and i'll be explaining further why that's the case and sugar that's a huge one huge so we'll get into that in detail and um really quickly i earlier this wow we're already you know almost at the end of this month but at the beginning of the new year here actually on january 1st i did do a session on nutrition 101 that actually talks about these different nutrients what is saturated fat how much do i need portion sizes so if you didn't get a chance to check that out i actually really recommend that because i really kind of laid a foundation on a lot of things that i am going to be talking about today so the recording is online so feel free to check it out soon um where i'm again going to explain different nutrients you know and you know kind of talk further about what their role is in in the body all right all right okay so very key for us to be aware of is that the nutrition label especially the front is an advertisement right manufacturers companies really do what they can to make that label look very enticing to draw us in there's a lot of psychology actually behind us a whole field called industrial psychology that really kind of looks at okay like what catches consumers eyes their interest even where products are placed in the grocery store is very strategic if you ever um you know take note like for example the cereal aisle notice where do they usually place children's cereal has anyone ever noticed that it's usually eye level to the child right so child's you know with parent at the grocery store they're you know walking along they turn over and right next to them they see oh my gosh you know tony the tiger or whatever you know um cartoon or a mascot for some of these products and then right the it starts i want this i want this i want this right so yes of course where things are placed it's very strategic and even at the checkout stands right those are impulse buys if you notice right they'll have candy there gum tabloids you know nowadays i know it's a lot different obviously because of covid but you know even pre-covet people usually are on the phone so a lot of times that's not being looked at um but those things are there and i remember once i was um in a in a county uh further south from here and in that neighborhood people are a lot more health conscious so i noticed i was at the checkout stand and i looked to the right and usually where candy is i found like a refrigerator case of like individual servings of salad and i was like wow i wish i took a picture of it this is a couple years ago because in that neighborhood since people were more health conscious they weren't buying those like candy and things like that impulse items so that's why they put these healthy stuff uh in that area so again just be aware where things are placed or very strategic and the best thing to do when at the grocery store is to try to shop the perimeter so for example you enter the grocery store go all the way to the far right usually what does one find right depends on your grocery store but usually like produce right um and then you round around the corner you'll find you know the dairy the meats the seafood you round around that corner and then you get into like the breads and yeah the bakery you know so it's not always great but it's the essentials that are on the perimeter so that's really ideal it's just if you're in a rush which i know a lot of us are these days because of the current um situation so you know just go around the perimeter grab your things and and get out it's the inner aisles that a lot of times have those foods that are a little bit more enticing and then even like the music that's played in the grocery store they've done research on this it's like slow music because they want people to kind of peruse the aisles um so again there's a lot of you know psychology you know behind this and as we get um deeper into the food labels i'll be talking about that um so i'm actually going to turn my camera on really quick and i want to actually show you i have like this whole collection of food labels and actually have more um at work that i don't have with me but for example and i'm not endorsing any products by the way i'm just showing you oops sorry guys let me go back to my previous slides okay so again i'm not endorsing any products i'm just showing you guys okay so this is pizza it's called cauliplower caulipower crust made with real cauliflower pizza your favorite vegetable right so again they're kind of like drawing us in they pull on our heart strings like oh my goodness pizza is vegetable now i'm gonna buy this wow it's gluten free certified so there's a lot of things which we'll look at you know to to get us in another one here organic chickpea puffs vegan white cheddar usda organic right healthy snack here um peas peas lovin giving back i had another one um i don't have it with me but um on that label it was um for crackers and it was ancient grain crackers and um with probiotics and then if you purchase this product you would help the peruvian children one percent of proceeds would go there so it's like again they're pulling on our heart strings they make it look really good sometimes when you buy these products and you make them at home you're like how come it doesn't look like how it looks on on the front of the label because again just remember this is you know marketing they want us to be you know really dedicated to their product right so let's go further here so keep that in mind labeling now a lot of times they put what's not there in the first place so for example gluten free all right this is a big thing right now huge i mean it's been a big thing for a few years now so let me just break this down to you so gluten is a protein and it's found only in wheat rye and barley all right so only wheat rye and barley products have gluten other products for example like oats might get contaminated by gluten if they're manufactured again in the same plant or they're processed in the same plant so they'll indicate that on there but truly only wheat rye and barley will have gluten now what's happened over the years due to genetic modification cross hybridization is that we are seeing higher content of gluten in these grains than we did previous so wheat of today is not the wheat that our grandparents ate it is different right now gluten we hear a lot about this like oh gluten's bad and this and that and again the jury is kind of in and out about this um some people legitimately should not be having gluten and those are people that have celiac disease so people have celiac disease gluten essentially mounts like an allergic reaction in a way um to their body so they cannot have any gluten and there's also gluten even in like cosmetics and you know lotions and things like that so for people who have celiacs they have to be very vigilant about any gluten then there are those that are maybe sensitive to gluten right and the best way to know whether you're sensitive to gluten is you know try cutting out gluten try cutting out wheat rye and barley products and see how you feel do i have more energy am i not as bloated how about headaches things like that right but not everyone has this and there is research looking at whether you know this gluten um is inflammatory for some people and again you know the jury's out on that there's still a lot of research that is being done on that um i know a lot of people that kind of take it easy with gluten and and that's fine it's your personal choice but the reason i'm bringing this up is that just because it's gluten-free does not mean it's healthy because a lot of these gluten-free products what they use is they use tapioca starch they use you know potato flour rice flour right and those are processed and a lot of times you know those things that they use are not necessarily healthier and better so again just because it says gluten free is not you know automatically telling us this is healthier and purchased this all right and a lot of the times they put gluten free in products that don't even have gluten in the first place i've seen you know gluten free on yogurt i'm like yogurt is not wheat rye or barley product why is this on here but it's done it's not a lie right it is gluten free they're not lying to us but it was never there in the first place so people are on this gluten-free like everything is gluten-free is good for me and then they're going to say oh as gluten-free yogurt let me buy this it might not necessarily have been as better as just a regular yogurt that was next to it so just keep that in mind cholesterol-free this is another really big thing so cholesterol is only found in animal products all right so only animal products if it has a mom or a dad it has cholesterol all right now our human body does not use animal cholesterol to produce human cholesterol all right our liver so our all of our livers are producing cholesterol we need cholesterol in our body it is a component of the cell membranes it's a component of hormones it's a component of bile which breaks down fats so we need cholesterol so we never want to have like we never want to see our lab values zero cholesterol then i don't know how we're surviving we have to have some cholesterol in our body so our liver is making it and some of us have very efficient livers that are making a lot of cholesterol and the raw material that our liver uses to make our cholesterol is actually fat especially saturated fat so for those who have high cholesterol you need to focus on fat not necessary cholesterol when you see cholesterol listed on the label that indicates dietary cholesterol and dietary cholesterol comes from animals right so when i'm eating you know chicken and fish you know i'm getting chicken you know cholesterol fish cholesterol it's all coming in it's adding to my overall bundle of cholesterol but that's not what my liver is using to make human cholesterol it doesn't even make sense to do that so um again if there's a mom or a dad it has cholesterol but we're more concerned about saturated fat and saturated fat comes from animal products but we also find saturated fat also in tropical oils so i refer you to my previous session the nutrition 101 where i talk more about saturated fat so i've seen this on labels i've seen this on like corn oil you know other oil labels cholesterol free and i'm like wait a minute this is not even an animal product it didn't even have cholesterol in the first place but again they're pulling on our heart strings so keep that in mind another thing that i see a lot is all natural natural so the fda the federal drug and food administration um considers all natural to mean that the food contains no artificial or synthetic substances such as coloring agents but it can still contain potentially harmful substances like antibiotics growth hormones pesticides etc arsenic is natural is that not right arsenic it's a poison but it's natural we find it in nature it's an element right so just because it's natural doesn't mean it's necessarily good for us um sugar and high fructose syrups are made from beets corn and sugar cane all of which are plants all of which are natural right another thing for those that like red velvet i hate to break this to you but it's not all red velvet but the dye that they use in some of these red velvet you know cakes and things like that it actually comes from a beetle extract and it will list on their natural flavoring natural coloring okay it's not beetle blood don't worry but it's like an extract of beetles so that's natural so a lot of times when you see natural flavorings and natural colorings you know again there's a lot of room for imagination there um it is coming from nature but it may not be the nature we might necessarily want per se so just kind of be aware of that just because it's natural doesn't necessarily mean this is um you know good for me per se other sketchy terms um no sugar added this is another big one all right so my friends milk fruit yogurt i forgot to indicate that on the slide so milk fruit yogurt um are carbohydrates and they do have glucose lactose fructose these are natural sugars that our body needs right especially glucose this is our body's number one source of fuel so natural sugars that are coming from milk fruit and yogurt starches grains this is fine okay we're not concerned about natural sugars that's already in the products if i look at plain yogurt i am going to see some sugars there it's coming from lactose that is fine those that are diabetic have to be concerned about their overall carbohydrate intake and you know for diabetes that's a whole other realm i'm not going to get into that because not everyone here has diabetes but for diabetics they do count their carbohydrates and so on the label they will be looking at carbs right so they will take into consideration okay how much milk they're having fruit so on and so forth but for the rest of us that do not have um diabetes you know don't be worried about those natural sugars all right what we're worried about is the sugar that's added and if there's concentrated sugar which for example we find in juice so think about juice if you had an eight ounce cup of juice how many oranges would we have to juice to get that eight ounces of fluid a lot right maybe i don't know it depends on how juicy the orange is five six i don't know but a lot can we eat all those oranges in their whole form no we can't so that's why it's always better to have fruit in its natural form like god gave us so juice i am not a fan of juice for anybody the only people i tell to drink juice is diabetics if their blood sugars are low that's the only population i tell to drink juice everybody else really should try to avoid it it's very concentrated sugar just have the fruit itself the fruit has the fiber and other components in there even the little filaments and everything everything has um you know those are prebiotics and antioxidants and phytochemicals that we can't replicate in the liquid format so keep that in mind even smoothies and a lot of people like oh smoothies some of these are nice and everything the only smoothies i'm okay with honestly are like the green drinks where you're like throwing in more vegetables and you're pulverizing it and then maybe one serving of fruit is in there then okay fine but when we make smoothies and we throw all these you know fruits in there protein powders and we think we're doing good and you know it's fine whatever but the thing is is that when we drink things versus eating things the satiation point is really affected so we feel more satiated when we're eating we're chewing we're giving you know our receptors in our body time to really you know absorb uh the nutrients and so forth whereas when we're drinking things it's not as satiating and again we end up getting more than we normally would have been able to eat like think about how much fruit you throw in there and i'm not saying fruit is bad you know actually you know having fruit at every meal is a good thing but sometimes one can go overboard so that's what we have to kind of be moderate um so beware of juice it has concentrated sugar sometimes as much as soda so when you see no sugar added you see that on the label or you know as we see here made with real fruit there's already sugar in there all that's indicating is they didn't add in any of their sugars sugar-free also just be aware of that usually sugar-free indicates that a non-nutritive sweet sweetener and artificial sweetener was used we'll talk more about those a little bit later on fat free so most of the time when they remove fat they remove flavor so they then substitute it with sugar so a lot of times fat-free products have actually more sugar and just as much calories if not more sugar-free products when they remove sugar they remove flavor so they usually add more fat to buffer it so usually we see higher amounts of fats so it's always better sometimes just to have like the real deal and just have less and enjoy it because this also happens to us psychologically is when we're having sugar-free or fat-free or light psychologically we think wow this is really good for me so i'm gonna eat more like we're not like consciously like thinking of it but it's like subconsciously it happens we've seen this in their research where like you know people these hundred calorie packs that came out a while ago those are good and everything um but sometimes people are like oh it's just a hundred calories i'll have another packet so we sometimes let down our guard because we're thinking it's good for me because it's sugar-free or fat-free or light when that's not necessarily the case light we see that on a lot of products so that can sometimes refer to flavor not necessarily the ingredients so for example light brown sugar it's just lighter in color doesn't mean it's better for us light can also mean reduce fat or reduce calories but it can still be high because they compare it to the original product so for example low in sodium so i've seen low sodium soy sauce because soy sauce is actually very high in sodium and then when you see low in sodium soy sauce don't think that it's the right amount of sodium it's just less sodium than the full version so we still have to be cognizant of how much we're using all right another huge area is organic now i had a friend once was like yeah so i bought organic potato chips and then that place has organic coffee so it's good for me right and i was like look just because it's organic doesn't necessarily mean that it's going to be healthier for us so just keep this in mind all right so organic when you see this term organic we see it on processed foods we see this on on produce so basically what this indicates is that when this item was grown or processed they did not use any synthetic fertilizers or pesticides so there's there's actually very strict measures here in the u.s i know some of you are here internationally welcome um but here in the us we have really strict measures and actually to be honest other countries especially in europe have even more stringent measures so you guys in in in europe are doing actually really well sometimes compared to us here um but in any case um so yes farmers cannot use any synthetic fertilizers or pesticides they're not genetically modified foods now the research yeah so far the research has shown that gmo products genetically modified organisms are okay but you know there's still you know a lot that still needs to be looked into further but as of right now gmo you know allegedly is fine i'm just saying what you know is out there but i feel like there's a little so still a lot of room to look into so i personally am not a fan of gmo and i try to avoid that as as much as possible and there are actually apps that you can download that will tell you what products are genetically modified in this country that's um usually gmo products that are produced here are usually like soybean um corn um rice sometimes and even tomatoes um can be gmo and gmo just basically means that they'll kind of like you know um kind of cross-link genes i guess you can see say so that you know products can like for example like last longer right so for example if you look at tomatoes like i grew tomatoes this past summer it was fun um versus tomatoes that you find in in the grocery store right you can drop those tomatoes you can maybe like roll the tomato across the floor and it won't bruise right whereas like the organic like you know natural non-gmo um ones are not like that so that's a whole separate um you know area to talk about also organic foods are not irradiated that's another really big thing um usually they irradiate products um you know to uh decrease like uh or prevent even growth of microbes uh bacteria so on and so forth um and so things don't spoil as as fast that's another big thing and also um these organic products uh there's no sewage sludge fertilizer used as well now organic products have their own fertilizers and pesticides that are used that you know are allegedly better but you know again this is a constantly changing field that needs to be looked further into so when we see organic on our u.s labels here so the us department of agriculture there's a stamp of organic because the usda and the fda they kind of manage different areas so usda manages like all you know agriculture livestock or as fda manages other products so when we see 100 organic on the label that means all of the ingredients must meet the organic criteria so what i was mentioning before so there there's no synthetic fertilizers pesticides etc etc we see usda organic or certified organic so what this means is 95 or more of the products are certified organic but the remaining five percent of the ingredients may only be foods or processed with additives on an approved list so they may not be organic made with organic this indicates that the ingredients must contain 70 or more organic ingredients but the remaining 30 of the ingredients you know might not necessarily be organic right they may be on again another special um list and the usda symbol just can't be used anywhere on the package right so there are stringent measures um for this to to be used now organic meat and poultry so what this means is that there's no growth hormones or antibiotics that are used but they might use other things but um that are that are certified but overall no growth hormones or antibiotics they're fed organic feed with no animal by-products because it's really interesting and sad what a lot of our livestock especially here in the u.s um are are being fed right they're they're fed grain to fatten them up faster and this is also what we're seeing is that when they're fed grain we are seeing more of a higher composition of omega-6s in in in their meat and again i will refer you to my previous session on omega-6s but the problem with omega-6s is too much omega-6s can actually instigate um inflammation so we don't want to have too much omega-6s um in our body we want to have more of the omega-3s so grass-fed actually which is what they should be eating right grass um we do see more of the omega-3s does that mean it's grass-fed it's healthy for me no we still have to be cognizant of how much meat we're having especially red meat um you know the saturated fat amounts the cholesterol amounts you know and again it is a a big source of inflammation for a lot of people so we want to be moderate um in that but if you are going to be purchasing you know red meat which is beef and a goat and lamb you want to try to get you know the grass-fed variety also when you see organic meat and poultry this indicates that the animals have some access to outdoors not necessarily they're living out there they might just be out for a little bit at a time and then brought in um so in this picture right they're out right the cows are out but they're not freely you know roaming around and and so forth um also this uh indicates that at least thirty percent of the cow's diet is from organic pasture during the grazing season so again stringent measures here now organic dairy now i actually do suggest that you know especially for children and for those that are you know elderly mature um to try to get organic and even us as well you know to be honest everyone should be getting organic dairy so this indicates no growth hormones or antibiotics for cows what had happened some years back is um due to a particular hormone that they had actually injected into these cows because think about it these cows grow in very close quarters so they can get each other sick so that's why they're giving them antibiotics they are trying to get them to constantly be lactating right so we're getting their milk and you know then they try to you know pump them up so you know for the meat and this has to be done in a short span of time right to to meet demand so this is why this is happening to to all these animals and you know again this is a whole separate you know subject of the ethics behind this um but what happened several years ago is they actually started they found that a lot of young girls were hitting puberty at a young age and they were able to trace it back actually to some of these hormones that were that were used which you know they've banned they don't use them but you know a lot of this stuff does trickle down to us so you know just food for thought um organic dairy indicates also that the cows are fed organic feed with no animal byproducts cows again have some access to the outdoors same thing as the previous at least 30 of the cow's diet is from organic pasture and then the cows themselves have to be or gay um raised organic for at least a year before their products can be labeled as organic and organic eggs now eggs are very confusing right it's like free range and you know cage free and this and that it's very um very interesting here so i'll break that down for you guys um so organic eggs this indicates that no growth hormones or antibiotics were fed to the to the heads or injected to the hens the hens were fed organic feed with no animal byproducts and the hens have some access to the outdoors all right so some access so on the right hand side if you guys see this on the right hand side of my picture here this is actually considered cage free they're not in cages right but i mean this doesn't look like really um humane practices you know to be honest so when you see cage free oops sorry guys sorry cage free that may basically indicates that the eggs come from hens that weren't confined in cages they may or may not have access to the outdoors though right so just you know something to think about and when we see free range or free roaming for poultry or eggs what that means was again the cans weren't confined in cages they have access to the outdoors but the outdoor area might be covered with netting for beef that's considered free range or free roaming that means the cows weren't confined in feedlots they have access to the outdoors so ideally we would like to see you know free range you know organic you know eggs um would be ideal so again organic um eggs i would also recommend as well for everyone to be honest definitely makes a difference you can even see it in the color of the yolk oh my goodness my whole slides are gone guys um so i had more to this slide uh than this apologies um so in any case so should i eat organic it's there's it depends is the bottom line and what it depends on is first and foremost what is the organic product that you're having so if you're like i bought organic chips or i bought organic cookies there it's still a chip it's still cookies right yeah the the products that they used in there um you know were grown with those particular set standards but it's still a chip it's still a cookie right for produce just because it's organic does not mean that it's necessarily higher in nutrient value it is not the vitamins and minerals that we find in organic is the same as that we find in non-organic so i'm not going to find more vitamin a and c and so forth in um you know the fruits and vegetables the the nutrient value is the same the only difference again is that these fertilizers and pesticides and so forth weren't used and there's a lot of research looking at what are the long-term effects of these fertilizers and pesticides what are they doing to our body for example um you know one of the the pesticides you know roundup that's used on a lot of our produ produce and grains right i i remember reading about a couple i think in the midwest that actually sued monsanto um and uh actually won because they both got cancer and they're blaming it on you know one of these fertilizers or pesticides that they were using on on on their crops so again the whole food industry i mean i should have a whole class on like food politics because food is very politicized the lobbies behind food and food companies is is huge huge and that really affects our dietary guidelines um so we have to keep that in mind i know several years ago i think oprah had made some comment about beef and everyone at that time used to listen to oprah and that the beef industry actually sued oprah because they're like you affected our sales so you know the lobbies behind all of this are are pretty pretty huge so you know just keep that in mind um that you know these these companies uh conglomerates really the bottom line for them is is the dollar right or you know whatever currency you're in so um the reason we would be eating organic is again to avoid that exposure to those fertilizers and pesticides and so on and so forth um but it is more expensive right so i mean sometimes it's painful you go to the grocery store you're like oh my gosh right i can get this for 299 or you know 5.99 for the organic version right and it's it it can hurt sometimes right and especially for those that are you know you know watching the you know their finances and so forth for what i would suggest is take a look at how often you're eating that product right if you're eating it like all the time then maybe you want to purchase organic and um here in the u.s we have um the environmental work group this is a consumer group that actually will evaluate um you know various produce and every year they come out with a list it's called the dirty dozen so have 20 20 30 dozen lists here on our slide 2021's list is not out yet but this is a list that they put out of produce that we should try to buy organic if we can because this is the highest amount of pesticides that we're seeing in produce so for example strawberries is always on that list i always see strawberries on that list so strawberries is number one highest amount of pesticide value we see so yeah if you're buying strawberries often the recommendation would be you know to try to get organic especially if you have young children or you know elderly or those that are immunocompromised spinach kale nectarines things like that so if you take a look at these items that are on the list usually these are thin thin skinned right you will never see bananas on this list bananas have a pretty thick skin so like you never really need to get organic bananas right avocados right same thing that hasn't been on the list i think from from what i recall so you know certain fruits and vegetables we don't need to get organic um but certain we do now blueberries is not on the list this year but it still has high pesticide amount but these have more and again this list is is for the us i'm not sure about other countries um again other countries like us especially europe a lot more strict in in in their in their policies which i actually really appreciate um so anyways so at the end of the day it really depends on you i would suggest personally getting organic um dairy getting organic meat um and then trying to you know follow this the dirty dozen for for for the year um and trying to get those that are organic um and what i was doing um previously with my adventures in gardening which didn't go that far um is i was actually like you know what let me actually try to grow some of the foods that are on the dirty dozen list because at least i know how i'm growing it right so um i tried didn't really work but it wasn't an attempt but as for other products like organic potato chips and cookies and things like that yeah if you want to spend the extra money and get those organic that's fine um again because the pesticide and and fertilizer residue and and so forth but i don't want you to psychologically think it's better for you so that you're eating more if that makes sense oh wow i do have everything okay never mind friends my slides kind of went all over the place today anyway so here's my slide so yes organic produce is not higher in nutrient value but again less exposure to pesticides all right now if you haven't already go grab your label and let's take a look at the ingredients so the ingredients usually are in very microscopic print sometimes um and they can sometimes be hard to find on on the label but it's on the side there somewhere um so you will see that on there let me turn my camera on here all right so they should have it again in small it's either like on the back of the label itself it might be on the side of the label all right sometimes you might need a magnifying glass to take a look at what it is you know but it's very key to look at the ingredients and especially when you're running into the store um you know and you don't want to spend too much time in the store obviously one of the best ways to triage a product is first look at the ingredients what is going on in this product because by a lot of manufacturers have to list what is in there and um the label by the way is is slowly changing i'm going to be talking about that um coming up but our us labels are changing slowly the formatting and so forth i love the european labels so reason being is in the european labels what i love about their ingredients is we have to remember that the ingredients are listed in order of weight so whatever is the first ingredient is what is the most of so for example if you pick up a cookie usually the first ingredient is sugar because that's what's mostly in that product so they list them again in order of weight the reason i like the european labels is because in their ingredients they will list the percentage so for example you know you know 47 to whole grain 46 enriched flour and when you see things like that if you look in our u.s labels it'll just say whole grain flour or whole wheat flour and then it might say in rich flour and they might be back to back next to each other and it might seem like there's more of the whole grain item for instance right but we don't know how much more of so that's why the european labels with their percentages and and that's hopefully going to happen here at some point um that will tell a little bit more um to the story but we'll do it with what we got right now here so when you look at the ingredients ask yourself do i want this in my body and this is why i always tell kids and teens i'm like read the label read the label of your flaming hot cheetos right read the label of some of your favorite foods do you even know what that is can you pronounce it do you want that in your body because we you know we are what we eat literally we are what we eat foods can affect our genes right so is a whole field of nutrigenetics and epigenetics you know how our lifestyle can activate genes on and off or i can express this so foods can do this again a lot of research this is again a whole separate session um but we have to keep that in mind and i know we think oh it's okay once in a while and that's fine but how many once in a while do we have right and i'm all about moderation everyone you know that's our cinna is is to be moderate and i'm all about that but you also have to be you know smart about what we're consuming as well so the less ingredients the better honestly if you've picked something up and it's like a paragraph and you need that magnifying glass that's a lot of stuff going on there and that's a lot of processing the less processed the better that should be our mantra and that's what we keep seeing in the in the literature and the research the less processed the better keep it real right um so always ask yourself how many steps from farm to table right earlier i held up these this hippies organic chickpea puffs and you know the ingredients for this actually let me read this again i'm not knocking any products apologies to the manufacturer here but the ingredients here are chickpea flour rice flour sunflower oil tapioca starch pea hull fiber brown rice flour salt cane sugar onion citric acid garlic rice concentrate lactic acid canola oil natural flavor which of course again has a very vague terminology there rosemary extract then they even have little asterisks and it says organic ingredients right to get us again um pull our heart strings here so when you read that because when i look at the front of the label it's it's just basically it's indicating that it's you know it's it's it's coming from chickpeas but when i look at the back of the label that's a lot of other stuff going on right so it is pretty processed so we have to just keep that in mind right um i have you know patients that tell me oh yeah i bought chips they're made from quinoa and black beans and i'm like all right so why not just have the quinoa and black bean you know just by itself um and they're like but it's not a chip okay that's fine you know that would be better than like the you know white potato chips and things like that so we have to kind of look at you know where we are in this journey of wellness and my whole mantra is like baby steps just small things just you know keep moving but the idea would be honestly less processed you know more wholesome foods and their whole form would be the ideal so when you are picking up a product if a product has more than six ingredients everyone take a look at your products does it have more than six ingredients if it does then what i want you to do is especially pay attention to the first three ingredients all right now the reason i'm saying that if it has six ingredients or more then this rule comes into play is sometimes we pick up products and they have like one ingredient so for example if you pick up oil the only ingredient you're going to find hopefully is just oil right that's fat so that's fine right we know what we're getting into um but if you six ingredients or more you know take a look at the first three ingredients and try to avoid any form of sugar fat salt or enriched flours within the first three ingredients so this is why i'm saying if it only has less than six ingredients sometimes this doesn't work as well so again if i pick up that oil i'm going to see oil and if i was following this rule i wouldn't buy it because that first ingredient would be fat right so that's why it doesn't apply for less ingredient items but this is a really good rule of thumb this can really help us triage when we're in the grocery store right you can immediately be like oh sugar first ingredient okay i'm not buying this bread right so really important there are yes my friends there are breads out there that abide by this right because think about everyone for those that make bread at home it's pretty basic i remember um pre covered once my mom had texted me she's like i'm at the grocery store and i found this bread what do you think and she sent me a picture of the ingredients i'm like mom what is all this random stuff in there like bread should be pretty basic right like how do you usually break bread um it's only got a few ingredients so what's all this other stuff um so in any case um just kind of keep that in mind right the less ingredient the better and again if you see any form of sugar fat salt or enriched flowers try to avoid that and i'm going to delve in deep about different terminology that they use for some of these things so when we read the ingredients this is an example all right so we'll say ingredients and then um the list them and sometimes you see that parentheses pop up so when you see the parentheses pop up ignore that like don't count that as part of your three first three ingredients because the parentheses indicates what's in that ingredient itself so for example enriched flour here this indicates it has wheat flour niacin reduced iron folic acid so when we're counting the first three i look at enriched flour skip the parentheses next one sugar next one semi-seed chocolate chips okay well the second ingredient is sugar first ingredient is flour so ideally this isn't a product that i want to have all the time if it's like a once in a while like you know kids want to have a little you know movie night they want to have this cookie okay fine but this shouldn't be something in our regular rotation also this has partially hydrogenated i'm going to come talk about that a little bit later but this indicates trans fat which we definitely want to try to avoid all right here we go now our u.s labels are changing so on the left hand side is the old label in 2016 we were supposed to start changing by 2018 we were supposed to have this new label on the right hand side in play but it's a very slow motion transition happening you know because of the previous administration things got a little slow there um so hopefully by this summer hopefully i've been saying this for a while um the right hand side here this new label should be what we should mostly be seeing out there but this uh old label on the left hand side um still lurks out there um again it's not too bad but there's been some improvements and you know myself and my fellow dietitians at work we're like such nerds when we first saw the new label come out a few years ago we were so excited we were so nerded out because we were so excited about the new label because it has something that we were waiting for for a while and it added added sugars so if you take a look at the previous label it just says sugars it just lumps them all together natural added everything just thrown in there we don't know what's really going on but the new label it has added sugars which really is going to give us a lot of important information also what we see a change up is the formatting so what pops out when you look at the new label bam calories in your face right bold um serving size so they kind of flipped it bolded it um they added in um you know the added sugars also what they're doing is they're making their serving size more realistic they standardize this across the board so i think previously the ice cream serving was like i don't know some small amount and then they kind of made it a little bit more realistic now serving size doesn't mean this is how much you should be eating it just kind of gives you the guidelines of what the the numbers are that follow so we'll get into that in a moment here also what happened is they took out vitamin a and c because we as a population are good with our vitamin and vitamin a and c amounts and they added in vitamin d and potassium because these are definitely nutrients of concern now many of us do not get enough vitamin d many of us are very deficient in vitamin d i just got my vitamin d done the other day and i take a supplement i'm still on the lower end and i was like oh my goodness so we know we really got to work on the vitamin d again this is a whole separate subject because vitamin d is a very key nutrient a lot of research looking at its relationship between covet and vitamin d and the severity of symptoms um so a lot of interesting things coming out about vitamin d and potassium also very important we just don't get enough and potassium really um kind of uh how do you say it bypasses i guess some of the effects of sodium so for those that have high blood pressure you know it is important how much potassium that you're having those that have kidney issues you need to be very worried about how much potassium you're having so follow your doctor's orders of course um so certain populations as you can see right have to be cognizant of certain nutrients okay so everyone let's take a look at your label and let's everyone let's take a look at your serving size so the serving size is indicated on the top right and here my example actually is of the previous label but it'll say serving size on the on the top and that tells you that all of the numbers that are underneath the calories the fat the sodium potassium the protein all that stuff is in that amount so in this case it's one slice so what do i do if i'm eating two slice slices i'm gonna have to double all those numbers what if i decide i'm eating the whole container i'm eating all this i don't know why um but then you would be having 23 servings so you would multiply this 23 one servings one slice i'm having 23 slices i got to multiply all of this times 23. now usually that's not the case usually we don't go that overboard but be aware because some products do have small serving sizes and they do it on purpose to make these numbers look good to us like oh wow it's it's only five all right i'll have this not realizing we eat five times that amount for instance so soup cans i see this a lot in soup cans the serving size is like half a cup but when people open crack open that soup can usually they eat the whole can right so then they would be having two servings so then they gotta multiply accordingly so in my um cauliplower pizza here the serving size is half a pie and the servings per container is two so if i decide i mean the whole thing i'm really hungry today i'm eating it all then i got to make sure i'm multiplying all of this accordingly i got here some snap peas original green pea crisps look how nice it is it's a little farm there um and the serving size is like 22 pieces right so if i decide i'm watching a movie and i end up eating a lot more again you gotta accordingly um multiply so just always keep that in mind and the serving size is not a suggestion that this is how much you should eat it's just again it's arbitrarily decided with the different manufacturing companies just as a set standard all right so here are some guidelines and we're going to dig deep on these different guidelines um so i'll go further from there so some of the things that we should be looking at is total fat right especially those that have high cholesterol right you need to be looking at the fat uh sodium is very key especially those that have high blood pressure but to be honest we all should be looking at sodium ninety percent of our population will have high blood pressure at some point in their lives ninety percent hopefully later on in life or never but this is a huge public health issue fiber we gotta bump up the fiber fiber think of fiber as like a broom for our body it just cleanses us out it provides good fodder for our gut microbiome i have a whole session on the gut microbiome um so it eats fiber that's like a prebiotic so we want to bump up the fiber um total sugars we got to be careful about how much sugar we're having there is no nutrient value to sugar sodium has a nutrient value right sodium is an electrolyte it's a mineral that we need it's a micronutrient that's very crucial but sugar is not there's no benefit to sugar it's just there it tastes good and that's about it um so we got to be cognizant of that saturated fat also very important again especially for those that have high cholesterol carbohydrates total carbohydrates this is what those that have diabetes and pre-diabetes should be looking at total carbs because we do carb count we do recommend carb counting for those that have diabetes usually for for women we recommend about 30 to 45 grams of carbs per meal for men about 45 to 60 grams per meal it's really nuanced because we have to also count in you know fruits and grains and things like that so carbohydrate total carbs is not for the general population it is more so for you know diabetics and pre-diabetics all right so calories now i'm not a big fan of calorie counting and obsessing over calories and oh my gosh i had this many calories i am more concerned about what is the quality of that calorie right where is it coming from this is what's crucial so if you had like i don't know a 250 calorie protein bar and look if you have a protein bar in front of you please look at those ingredients it is very interesting sometimes all the stuff they add in there soy protein isolate p protein isolate usually are there forms of protein that they're adding that's very processed right and then coconut oil and this oil and you know uh you know these type of sugars artificial sweeteners i mean a lot of this stuff is it's very chemically you know just to be you know honest so just kind of look at that some of yes there are better versions of some of these you know nutrition bars and granola bars you know but a lot of them are like candy bars with chemicals to be honest so if you had like a you know protein bar such as that or you had like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich right whole grain bread natural peanut butter and natural peanut butter what that means is when you read the ingredients the only thing you should see is peanuts maybe salt if you're getting the salted variety but that's about it nothing else nothing else keep it simple and then maybe has some like fresh preserves right and let's suppose that peanut butter jelly sandwich is a little bit higher in calorie value which would be better for you chemical protein bar or p b and j it would be the p b and j because at least our bodies understand that so that's the thing you guys is look at what am i eating the quality of what i'm eating that is more important than just straight calories looking at the label all right now calories are important though i'm not negating their importance they are definitely important you know but use them as reference points so for examples meals we should try to keep roughly to 500 600 calories per meal give or take you can go plus or minus just don't double it so don't have like thousand calorie meals right that's not needed even for those are very active you do not need that boost of calories like that so 500 600 give or take is is a good reasonable amount um snacks keep them to about 100 to 200 calories and again in my previous session i talk about you know just like the quality you know if you're gonna have a snack a fun food like really be a snob about what you're picking um but this is very helpful especially when we order things or when we buy things right if you're picking up a snack like oh this is gonna be my snack oh wow this snack is 500 calories well that's a meal so then don't have it as a snack maybe have half of it right so keep this in mind um when we are purchasing things now percent daily value is also included on the labels i am not too much of a i mean i'm like i don't get obsessed with looking at that like i'm glad it's there that's nice but i'm i'm more um i more encourage people to look at the actual grams and milligrams that we see in the actual nutrients themselves the percentages are nice to look at but just keep in mind the percent daily value is based on a 2 000 calorie diet um which not everyone is on nor should everyone be on so a lot of times they're not 100 accurate per se but again these are good to see if a food is high or low in a nutrient so for example if you pick up something and you're like whoa this is 100 total fat that's a lot of fat for that product right so like fat cholesterol sodium carbs we should actually be more seeing on the lower side i never want to pick something up and see 100 of those nutrients of those items because that's actually uh you know too much the ones that we do want to see high amounts of ideally would be the vitamins and minerals yeah it would be nice if i saw you know more than zero percent vitamin d you know more than you know five percent iron and so so on and so forth so these are just there just again just to kind of help guide us but it's more important to actually look at the the nutrients themselves all right so let's get to it fats so overall everyone we should roughly give or take aim for about 50 to 60 grams of all fats per day this is all fats good bad and ugly all right and for more petite women you would probably aim for like 40 grams more on the lower end of the spectrum for men 60 grand maybe a little bit more but not way more but fat is a big issue we're getting a lot of fat in our food so we're just going to do our best and do your best as much as you can to keep to 50 to 60 grams of fat um and again in my previous presentation which i keep referring to i talked more about like serving sizes you know like oil like one teaspoon of oil is five grams and you know nuts like uh six almonds or five grams so that i go more in depth in there but um we are just inundated with by fats all over and i don't want to get into the keto diet and this and that you know talk about that previously as well um but we are concerned about the quality of fats all right so if any of you are doing keto which i'm going to be honest i'm not really 100 a big fan of for long term at all just make sure you're picking good quality fats you know just be aware of all the saturated fats because again too much saturated fat does cause the over production of ldl bad cholesterol so we gotta be aware of that so and anyways on the label you'll see total fat and it will be in bold print and underneath indented you'll see saturated fat and you'll see trans fat now by law manufacturers have to put saturated fat and trans fat those have to be on the label there are also other fats that may not be included there so for example you see here one gram of total fat but you're like wait the zero saturated zero trans like where's the rest of the fat there's also other fats monounsaturated fats and polyunsaturated fats that they don't have to list on the label that might be where the fats also coming from and these are better fats actually um so when you see total fat we ideally want to aim for 3 grams or less per 100 calories so you look at the health calories so in this case it's 109 calories so ideally i would want to see three grams or less so i look over oh yeah total fat yeah one gram i'm good so for every 100 calories i can have three grams um so in my caulipower pizza here i have 330 calories so that would be roughly so again every 100 calories 3 grams so roughly about you know 9 ish grams of total fat is what i would like to see but on my label i see 15 grams so yeah a little bit higher than i would want to see now does that mean i can never buy this and i can never eat this no i'm not saying that but if you're buying a product that's going to be again part of your regular rotation a bread a cereal what not then you would want to try to stick to this as much as possible all right now saturated fat saturated fat we want to aim for 1 gram or less per 100 calories so good for me here i got zero awesome now i don't have this label with me but i had this i had a patient once in one of my classes and she was actually snacking on banana chips and then we were going through labels and then when i got to this point she was like oh my gosh she raised her hand and she's like i have 13 grams of saturated fat you know on the label and for saturated fat just to kind of give you guys an idea try to aim for about 15 grams one five of saturated fat for the day all right so of the 50 to 60 total fat grams about 15 or less can come from saturated fat we do need some saturated fat in our body again for cholesterol production we need some not too much more but some so um so yeah she had her banana chips and i was like whoa banana chips you got saturated fat in there and she gave me the label i actually kept it but again i don't have it on me at the moment but the ingredients for those banana chips were organic bananas organic coconut oil and i think is organic um cane sugar so her banana chips were actually deep fried in coconut oil and coconut oil is a saturated fat so therefore half a cup that was a serving size half a cup of banana chips and i think she ate the whole pack as she was sitting there so she definitely got more than half a cup it had almost a day's worth of saturated fat so just to be aware of that it sneaks in in very random places um so yeah we want one gram or less per 100 calories so here in my cauliflower pizza again i got 330 calories um so i should be aiming for 3 grams of saturated fat i got 5 grams of saturated fat coming from cheese so usually saturated fat is from animal products and those tropical oils now trans fat this luckily has been banned allegedly i'm saying allegedly because it's taking a long time for it to get transitioned out hopefully with our new administration things will move along a lot quicker um with fda mandating these things and getting um food manufacturers to to follow through but trans fat is a really bad fat it's a franken fat it's a it's it was a fat that was created to extend the shelf life of product because take a look at some of the baked goods that we have right you look at some of these baked goods i was looking um at some of the cookies that we have in our cupboard somehow and the expiration dates like 2023 i'm like wow right this cookie's gonna last a long time right so previously they were able to do this by basically taking polyunsaturated like okay fats like corn oil vegetable oil and what they did is they hydrogenated it they added hydrogen odd atoms to those liquid oils to solidify them and to make them more stable and this was great back in the day when they did this they did this like i don't know i think in the early 1900s and it really sped up during um you know after the world wars um because they wanted to get products again to have long shelf lifes right because bread if you make fresh bread right that's why we have that same day old bread it goes bad after like a day or so it gets more stale but whereas breads that we buy in the store right they can last creamers right creamers usually you would have to refrigerate but a lot of versions of creamers we didn't have to margarine i remember as a kid margarine being very very yellow and this was what everyone was saying to use that was hydrogenated um corn oil right and this was what was recommended but then things really turned very sour in terms of that they found that trans fat actually increased our bad cholesterol production decreased good cholesterol production increased total cholesterol increased triglycerides like everything bad so basically increased risk of heart disease and stroke so it was added to the food label i think in 2006 and then um you know different states started to to ban it because this is what they used to fry french fries in right over and over and over because it was again a stable oil um but again it's not a good oil it still lurks out there so i've seen it in like ready-made frostings i've seen it in like um you know cake mixes and things like that so you basically read the ingredients section because whenever you read trans fat on a product it is going to say zero it's always going to say zero because this is the thing there is a law that says that if there's 0.5 grams of saturated fat or 0.5 grams of trans fat in a serving they can put zero so for example if you have chips let's suppose the serving size of chips is like i don't know five chips let's just say and let's suppose those five chips have point five grams of trans fat they can round down to zero but let's be honest some people may not be just eating five chips right especially if they got their guac guacamole or salsa right five will become 25 and then you gotta multiply accordingly times you know 0.5 times 5 you got 2.5 grams of trans fat that you didn't even realize you had in there and there is no safe amount of trans fat none so that's why we would look on the ingredients panel and if you see partially hydrogenated just throw it away just throw it away fully hydrogenate is okay but anything that's partially hydrogenated or hydrogenated do not consume so this brings up then the subject of margarines and and butter and which is better and things like that so let me just break it down so if you are buying if you're the grocery store and you pick up some of these margarines which by the way they've now changed the name to vegetable oil blends right it sounds so neutral and so healthy right i'm having a vegetable oil blend um so it's not margarine anymore sometimes in some of these products so if you take a look at that look at the ingredients all right if you see hydrogenate or partially hydrogenate that is worse than butter put it away but there are some versions of blends out there that are made with olive oil it might be maybe avocado oil right that would you know just again look at that if they don't have partially hydrogenated then that would be a little bit better than butter but even then everyone these different spreads you still need to be moderate in how much you're using right i would rather you use almond butter or peanut butter or even like smear some avocado instead of like butter and margarines but if you want to have a little bit then have a little bit you know and just you know just be cognizant of what you're you're purchasing and how much you're having so here are some common fat names remember when i told you read the ingredients we want to try to avoid fat within those first three ingredients if that product has more than six ingredients so if you see any type of fat so obviously for us of course as muslims we're not even having lard that's not even on our agenda anyways um butter any type of oil so coconut avocado etc if it's the first ingredient in like a product you want to try to avoid it now obviously you guys again in like margarines or vegetable oil blends and things like that you are going to see these fats in the beginning ingredients that's normal because that is the fat at the end of the day so in that case you want to look at the quality of the fat right so for instance if it's like corn oil versus you know avocado oil the avocado oil is going to be better it's a monounsaturated fat so that's what we need to look at and again once again i'm plugging my previous talk that talks more about this shortening shortening is essentially partially hydrogenated oils right so for example you know vegetable shortening is usually just you know hydrogenated partially hydrogenated vegetable oil margarine hydrogenated oils partially hydrogenated oils mono and glycerides we see this a lot interesting we see this a lot these are all again common fat names okay moving along let's go to sodium now sodium my friends again this is a public health issue we see like fat-free products we see low-fat products we see sugar-free products we see low sugar products we don't see low sodium as much as we should be seeing so this is really an issue especially if we're buying packaged foods and processed foods because sodium is a preservative think about the pioneers back in the day or you know early civilization that didn't have refrigerators right what did they do to to preserve their meats right they would salt them cure them right so we already find sodium in foods it is again it's in mineral we need sodium in our body it's important for our heart contraction and so forth right so essential electrolyte so all food is going to have some sodium anyways right we're never going to see zeros we don't never want to be zero sodium the general population we want to try to keep our sodium to roughly about 2 400 milligrams per day this has gone up and down over the years right it went down to 1500 a couple years ago and they're like wow that's really low we can't do that so 1500 is actually the recommendation for like heart patients um you know it's very low in sodium um then they did 20 they kind of you know played around with 2 300 milligrams for for a while so between 2 300 milligrams to 2 400 milligrams is what we should be aiming for as a general population and just to kind of give you guys a heads up of what this looks like now remember sodium is in salt salt is not sodium sodium is in salt right salt is sodium chloride right with some iodine in there as well so it's nacl so you know don't use those words you know synonymously because they're not the same so sodium is in salt so just to give you an idea a teaspoon of salt has 2 000 milligrams of sodium you're like more than you're like almost there so again when we're cooking at home that's not the problem the problem is again we're buying process and packaged foods and restaurant foods it's crazy the amount of sodium that's lurking out there so just to kind of make life easier what we should try to do is try to aim for about 600 to 700 milligrams per meal all right per meal and then the rest can be you know for your snacks now let's suppose you pick up a product and you're like i don't know like is this going to be my meal or is this going to be part of my meal whoops so um for example back to my cauliflower pizza all right so my cauliflower pizza has in half of the pizza it's got 470 milligrams of sodium so this is my whole meal if i'm like yeah half the pizza is my meal then i'm good but if i but if i have the whole pie then i gotta double this so that's like what a thousand sorry i can't do math really fast 950 milligrams so that's quite a bit right but let's suppose this is part of my meal what if i'm like okay i'm gonna have my caulipower pizza and then i'm gonna have some garlic bread i don't know i'm gonna have some salad and some dressing and then oh wow we're going to have appetizers all right then so if all of a sudden things start to add up then what's helpful is to try to aim for 140 milligrams or less per serving so for example so again if you're at the grocery store and you're like i'm purchasing this bread i don't know how i'm going to eat this bread is am i just going to eat it by itself i'm going to am i going to make a sandwich am i going to make it with eggs so in that case when you buy individual products try to aim for 140 milligrams or less per serving but if that product is going to be your meal then you can bump up to 600 to 700. so i don't know if that makes sense i i don't usually get feedback with this um platform that we use but that's okay i'm gonna assume it made sense but just kind of keep that in mind right so if you're buying breads and things like that try to have 140 milligrams or less if you're buying like a you know like a tv dinner or something like that then you would bump up because it would be a meal to about 600 or 700 milligrams now cup of noodle right a lot of these ramens that are really popular ramen noodles that are really popular check out those labels it's like easily a thousand milligrams at least right that was like freshman year of college that was always our go-to right if we like ever missed lunch or dinner in the cafeteria we're like okay i guess it's a cup of noodle type of day so it's a lot of sodium in there but usually that sodium is in the seasoning so you feel like i'm just using the noodles okay fine you know it's gonna be definitely less sodium um but just you know even the the noodles themselves just remember that's enriched flour and we're gonna talk about that in a moment so some sources of sodium on the label you'll see it uh salt sodium chloride monosodium glutamate saline sodium benzoate sodium bicarbonate sodium nitrate a lot of these are used as preservatives and additives um but if you see it as like again the first three ingredients of a six ingredient product or more just you might want to rethink that and then double check the the label itself and look at the sodium amount i'll give you an example i wish i kept this label but i had a um a few years ago for thanksgiving i had bought this turkey brine so there's like all these different seasonings right and usually these brines are mostly sodium and um so i remember looking at it and like the serving size was like 1 8 of a teaspoon i'm not even kidding 1 8 or something 1 4 very small amount and then it's like servings per container it was something crazy like 2 500 servings and the reason they did that was because the sodium was so much in that product so i like of course you know as a dietitian i'm like let me calculate this out i was like whoa this whole thing if i use this whole thing it's going to be 20 000 i'm not kidding guys 20 000 milligrams of sodium going into that turkey i was like no way i'm going to use less and i'm going to use other stuff but it was really interesting because on the label they purposely made the serving size so small so it didn't look as bad but when you calculate all that stuff out it can be scary sometimes all right moving on to fiber now fiber everyone we just do not get enough um here in the u.s typical consumption of fiber per day is about 11 grams and the recommendation for females is about 25 grams or more per day this is for adult females for males about 38 grams or more per day um so you know and there's different types of fiber there's soluble fiber there's insoluble fiber so soluble fiber this is actually and both of them are good this works more in helping us to reduce our cholesterol it reduces cholesterol absorption and it also helps us to reduce blood sugars so that's how soluble fiber works and soluble fiber we find in like oats and apples and beans and things like that then we have insoluble fiber and insoluble fiber kind of is the fiber that kind of goes straight through because soluble fiber gets absorbed with water so it becomes like this gel almost that's kind of like oozing through our body but insoluble fiber kind of goes straight through and that helps us decrease risk of diverticulosis decreased risk of certain cancers keeps us regular so decreases risk of constipation so we get that from like whole wheat and beans and grains and things like that fruits and vegetables so both fibers are good and on the label they'll just list dietary fiber and so we only find fiber from plant-based foods so you're not going to find fiber in meat we're not going to find fiber in fat like oils are not going to have um you know fiber and that's the thing with this keto keto diet is that we're not getting as much variety of fibers as we might normally get and so that's why we actually are seeing a difference in the gut microbiome and a lot of you know i'm like a gut nerd like major like i'm obsessed with the gut um and fiber really we want to have a variety of fiber different types of fibers coming from everything fruits vegetables whole grains legumes all of that because these different fibers are fodder for you know the gut microbiome for these different um bacteria and viruses and yeast that proliferate in our gi tract especially in our large intestine so much research i can't even tell you how much research is coming out on the gut microbiome and how it not only affects just you know digestion but even our mood and brain health again whole separate subject there i do an update on on my gut session because a lot more hot informations come out so we really want to make sure we're getting in sufficient amounts of fiber and we want to have a variety of fiber and it's always the best through its whole form right like yeah you can buy like you know you know metamucil and citrus cell and some of these different fiber supplements and stir them into your your water and just drink that but there's something about food itself we have to always remember that everyone so it's always better to get things through foods and ideally first good sources of fiber ideally would be three grams or more per serving but not everything is like that like you know i have some breads here with me and you know some breads are like one gram of fiber um this one i have here is is three grams of fiber um some grain products they they've been adding supplemental fiber functional fiber into there like you'll see numbers like six grams seven grams um so they are adding you know different functional fibers in their inland a chicory root um illegal oligosaccharides uh fructo fruitoligosaccharides so they're adding a lot of these things to foods to boost the fiber amount which is good and these are considered prebiotic food for our gut microbiome but just one side note is that remember our body does not have the digestive enzymes to break down fiber so it remains relatively undigested then it hits our lower intestine all these microbes kick in and they try to like break it down and then they're fermenting it and as a result you know people get gas and bloating i've had patients tell me i think i'm allergic to fiber i'm like no no no it's just because your body's not used to all this fiber if you've been living a relatively low fiber life and all of a sudden you're like oh wow i'm going to have all this fiber stuff then our body is going to be like what is going on here so as a result you know our microbes it takes some time for it to get used to this fiber increase so when you're increasing your fiber do it slowly have lots of water get in physical activity and just be patient because it takes time you're not allergic to fiber you'll be okay but a lot of these functional fibers that they're adding into foods to kind of boost the fiber content just be aware that you know you might get gas and bloating because of that as well so just you know be patient in the process now whole grains whole grains are a really good source of fiber and um i'm really big on people getting some sort of a grain like i'm not really big on like grainless existence unless you know your doctor is recommending it for whatever reason if you want to stay away from wheat that's fine um but at least try to get the ancient grains in like barley you know burger things like that you know i always consider these are considered you know these are sunnah foods they probably some he ate you know barley and a different grain so just for that reason at least get some into your into your body um so when we're picking grains we ideally want to have whole grains all right so whole grain so on the left hand side this is what a whole grain looks like it has three layers so the outer layer is like this brown layer so it's like a fiber filled layer it's got b vitamins and minerals then the inner layer is like the germ it's this is where the seed basically can sprout from this is a nutrient-packed core it's got b vitamins which are very key for for energy metabolism vitamin e a very important um antioxidant phytochemicals healthy fats so that's in the germ and usually what manufacturers do is they actually remove the bran and the germ so that's why we see oat bran that's how we see wheat germ sold separately because they remove them a lot of times because because of the fats and things like that it can cause the grain to spoil a little bit quicker so a lot of times manufacturers remove those and then we're just left with the endosperm which is just a starchy carbohydrate middle layer it's got some proteins and vitamin vitamins but not what we lost in the brand and the germ and then what they do is they grind this up and then this becomes wheat flour wheat so just because this whole wheat sorry just because it's wheat does not mean it's a whole grain so if you're like yeah i'm doing good i've got wheat sub wheat sub sandwich yeah you're doing okay but it would have been better if you got whole wheat or whole grain or even sprouted grain instead so then they take the wheat flour they process it more becomes white flour they can bleach it or unbleach it and then they enrich it it is the law here they have to enrich the grain and so manufacturers they enrich it they add some folic acid they'll add some of the b vitamins you know um what else iron things like that that they have to but we can never replicate what we lost in nature so that's why it's always best to try to get you know the whole grain itself so the same thing with like brown rice and some of these ancient grains they are the whole intact grains that's why brown rice takes so long to cook because it's got three layers to to cook versus just the white rice is just you know it is basically refined it's just one layer so ideally we want to get whole grains whole wheat you want to see the term whole so these are the type of whole grains that you will see out in the marketplace and a lot of these are ancient grains as well um so amaranth barley buckwheat corn which includes the whole corn meal and popcorn okay not kettle chocolate you know butter popcorn just like plain natural popcorn millet oats including oatmeal but not instant oats instant oats is is processed they pulverize that down to make it a smaller granule so it cooks faster quinoa rice both brown rice and colored rice's rye sorghum which is also called milo taft triticale and then wheat and wheat itself has different varieties like spelt emmer ferro einkorn kamut durham etc bulgur cracked week wheat berries so for those that are you know gluten-free have celiacs and whatnot then you need to keep in note that these are also actually considered wheat and do have gluten and then wild rice also so when you're in the store this is what you would look for you look for whole grain and the name of the grain whole wheat whole whatever the other grain's name is stone ground whole brown rice oats oatmeal wheat berries so these contain all parts of the grain so you're getting all the nutrients of the whole grain itself and also sprouted that should be here sprouted grain apologies sprouted as well now these are maybes so they might be whole grains might not it really depends um so when in doubt don't trust these words so like wheat wheat flour semolina durum organic flour stone ground hit or miss multigrain this is always very interesting multigrain means these are multiple grains they may not all be whole grains so just because it's multigrain doesn't necessarily mean it's necessarily better i was at the store the other day and i saw a multigrain kind of like cheerios that they're like a store variety of of those and it said multigrain healthy this and that and cholesterol free and all this good stuff and then when i look at it i was like it was like white flour and there was like whole wheat flour as well and there's like sugar and like corn and yeah it's multiple grains but they weren't all necessarily good grains now these are not whole grains so enriched flour is not a whole grain so this is a this should be ideally a nice new year's resolution um it's just maybe you don't want it you want to stop eating as much enriched products enriched flowers degerminated you'll see this on cornmeal and bran and germ so brand and germ are components of the grain remember they have their nutrients but they're not a whole grain because they're just a component all right moving on to sugar all right my friend so let's take a look at your labels again so in the previous label it would just say total sugar or just sugar and that would mean natural sugars and it would mean added so in the previous labels if you have the old label when you see sugar ideally try to keep to less than 10 grams per serving sorry 10 grams per meal and less than 5 grams per serving so sugar has you know it's five letters that make up the word sugar so that's what we should try to aim for less than five grams per serving this is for the old label when they just lump them all together the new label differentiates added sugars so ideally we want to see zero all right zero is what we want to see the american heart association recommends for added sugars ladies uh less than 25 grams per day which is about six and a half teaspoons gentlemen less than 37.5 grams per day that's about nine and a half teaspoons this is added sugar so this is not the sugar that's in my fruit this is not the sugar in my plain yogurt this is not the sugar in my plain milk this is not that this is added so if i'm having chocolate milk right if i'm having i don't know a caramel mocha macchiato right all that syrup that goes into there right this is my dessert this is my you know um what else you know am i adding my nutella to my my toast right all those are added sugar so all of those combined together we should try to keep to this quantity now how can we calculate out teaspoon so this is what you do so when you see grams of sugar all right so you see grams of sugar divide that number by four all right so let's suppose let's pretend this was 20 grams i know it's just two here but pretend it's at 20 grams you would divide that by four that would tell you how many teaspoons consuming that is really eye-opening so let me just i'll come back to this let me show you so here is a this is a real yogurt that i just ate the other day anyways um so it was in our fridge and i'm like you know it's almost expiring i better eat it but anyways if you take a look right so the serving size was the whole container here it looks bigger than it is six six ounce um actually i have it here so i'll show you guys so just a little regular yogurt here about yeah five and a half five and a half ounce um zero percent milk fat um anyways so uh serving size is the whole container so take a look at this the sugars here are 14 grams all right and of this of this 14 grams 11 is added sugars all right so meaning 3 grams are the natural sugar that's just coming from the lactose so even plain yogurt plain yogurt will even have sugar just itself it will say sugar on there and then people freak out oh my gosh there's sugar in my milk their sugar and my yogurt yeah that's lactose that's fine it's these added sugars we're concerned about so take a look it's got 11 grams so 11 grams they added in separately so then divide this by four so that's like what um oh my gosh you guys i can't do math all of a sudden i'm like blanking out oh my gosh two and a half almost two and a half teaspoons of sugar here so think about that so when i read that i was like oh and i read this after i ate it um so i was like oh my gosh there's two and a half teaspoons of sugar they basically spooned in here and and put it in here that's a lot right so it's better honestly for yogurts because our yogurt aisles are crazy here in the u.s right it's like overwhelming there's so many varieties so my recommendation is just get like plain yogurt this actually what i had purchased was was vanilla yogurt which is fine i'm okay with vanilla i'm okay with you know the flavored ones like that but anything extra like creme brulee yogurt um you know key lime pie yogurt it's a lot of sugar so it's better sometimes just get like the regular yogurt and then you can doctor it up right add your honey add your your fruit because then you can control what you're doing even if you want to add in sugar go ahead it's probably going to be less than two and a half teaspoons that they added in here so very eye opening when you start to convert the added sugars into teaspoons and i recommend this is a really good activity to do with kids right if your kids are like oh i really want to have this cookie or maybe when i have this you know dessert or juice or whatever you know sodas hopefully not hopefully kids are not having soda but when you look at the amount of sugar and you put it into teaspoon form it's very eye-opening right if you have like sugary cereals at home that your kid like insists on having be like let's let's look at how much sugar actually is in this because there's no benefit to sugar my friends like nothing nothing now another thing we see a lot of is artificial sweeteners this is being added a lot in like light foods sugar-free foods you'll see a lot of these artificial sweeteners and um the thing with artificial sweeteners is they're not absorbed by the body so that's why there's zero calories so this kind of goes straight through and there's you know some research that's indicating that these sweetener sweeteners might actually negatively affect our gut microbiome we're seeing that some of these sweeteners might actually increase insulin levels so it might even work in a different level for those that have diabetes and pre-diabetes and actually for everyone insulin and blood sugars are an issue because we have rapid rises and dips of blood sugars this can actually be inflammatory for the body so long term this is not good for anybody um you know that the rapid rises and falls of blood sugars so that's what we're seeing with some of these artificial sweeteners is again they might actually be affecting the gut microbiome you know negatively and these artificial sweeteners everyone they are like 250 to 10 000 times sweeter than sugar i think neo tame here i think neo tame is like 10 000 8 000 i don't know some crazy amount sweeter than sugar so imagine how this is affecting our taste buds every day you're putting in your nicotine actually you can't buy like you know as a packet i think it's just used in industrial format um but for example you know stevia and splenda um are like 250 times sweeter than sugar so imagine how this affects people's taste buds i had a patient once and um really out of control diabetes and um so i was talking to her and i'm like okay well what do you eat like what's going on um so she was telling me yeah actually i had i had fruit that was my dessert you know and i added sugar and i was like why are you adding sugar she's like oh it just didn't taste sweet to me i'm like you had strawberries it's like peak strawberry season of course this was in my mind i wasn't saying it to her in person but in my mind i was like whoa you're adding sugar to strawberries and it turned out she actually was doing a lot of of artificial sweetener because she was she's like oh i i thought that's good for me as a diabetic so she was adding like lots of it to her coffee and stuff and it really affected her taste buds negatively so i do not recommend artificial sweeteners to anybody except diabetics but even diabetics i recommend small amounts like be moderate maybe like you know max a couple of packets and then you know even like the diet sodas and things like that those are a diet soda has it has a sulfame potassium usually added in there and there's a lot of question marks about ace acelframe potassium aspartame i know aspartame for me personally if i ever have aspartame gives me a bad headache um so sucralose even commonly known as splenda there's a lot of question marks about potential disease risk cancer risk later on i mean again a lot of research looking at this so again those i would not recommend so right now maybe stevia is is neutral right now because stevia yes stevia comes from a plant but just remember everyone the people i hear this from people oh stevia it's coming from a plant it's healthy i'm like look how would you eat stevia in in real life like for people like populations that had stevia they would take the plant and put the eat the leaf they would not be processing the leaf making it very concentrated and then cutting it with sugar alcohols which is what some of these stevia sweeteners are doing so yeah it's coming from a natural source but it's very concentrated that we would not have been normally consuming so again so right now stevia is neutral fine whatever um but just be moderate and then sugar alcohols these are components of sugar they're not well absorbed so they actually have a laxative effect in the body because they're not well absorbed so they're not really digested broken down they hit our lower intestine and then our gut bacteria have a party and so you might actually have like a laxative effect um so they even put that on the label they even will list it it may have a laxative effect so some examples of sugar alcohol sorbitol mannitol xylitol so you'll see ol at the end um a very a very popular sugar alcohol right now that actually is pretty neutral it's actually pretty decent it's erythritol so that's being added to a lot of things it's pretty neutral right now we don't see this this effect um and again it has more of a slower absorption it is still sugar a component of sugar is but it's more slowly absorbed and we'll usually find this in like chewing gum sugar-free foods and things like that so just be aware um and actually let me go back i forgot these are some common terms for sugar and this is the most common question i have people ask me all the time what's a good sugar i'm like nothing there's no good sugar there's no good sugar sugar is sugar sweetener is sweetener my friends it's going to have basically the same type of effect on our body those that are a little bit more higher in fructose value for example like agave fructose is metabolized a little bit different in in our body it hits our liver in a little bit of a different way so you know i wouldn't really recommend agave um for that reason but all sweeteners are sweeteners and there is over this is like a handful there are 70 different types of sugars that manufacturers use that are added into our products 70 and i'm sure that list is growing day by day so many different types so anything with ose at the end sucrose dextrose maltose lactose that is sugar honey now i'm always partial to honey because of course it's a sin of food and honey actually is a prebiotic so there's actually good fodder for our gut microbiome antioxidants in there so you know i do recommend honey as a sweetener but even then use it moderately and try to get local organic honey there's some research looking at whether it could help with allergies because you have exposure to the pollen so you know very interesting to just to see um you know evaporated cane juice we see this a lot in foods uh cane juice we see this a lot in foods brown sugar i love this i have people text me all the time um so is brown sugar better than me for me it's brown and fiber is brown i'm like no my friend brown sugar is brown because of molasses so it's not fiber that it's making it's making it brown um so again there's no good sugar you know yeah we see some you know some neutral things about monk fruit sugar coconut sugar date sugar you know but just whatever you're having pick the one that you're able to use less of all right so if you're like look i put a little bit of brown sugar in my tea and i feel good but if i use white sugar then i put two teaspoons and okay and use brown sugar use the one you use less of and try to train your palate to use less uh we just finished a sugar challenge i did with some of my buddies and i think it's a lot easier this time around and basically our sugar challenge was 14 days no added sugar and my rule was if it tastes sweet don't eat it minus fruit and again it really retrains your palate and when i was on the sugar challenge i accidentally yeah it was an accident i accidentally had um one of those hot cocoa bombs and i know i hadn't had a momentary lapse of memory and um i had that and oh my gosh i just it really affected me so negative it has a horrible headache it's made me really feel sick to my stomach because i just wasn't having so much sugar so that's the thing we can train our palates now also we see additives and preservatives added to food and again there's reasoning there's research looking at a lot of these additives additives and preservatives um you know what are long-term effects that's why we ideally want to you know just be moderate in our processed foods but preservatives will keep food from spoiling help maintain freshness and color or flavor foods they're often added to baked goods meats jellies and beverages and here's some common preservatives that we see so ascorbic acid a citric acid you know sodium benzoate calcium propionate you know vitamin e bha bht we see this a lot they're usually used in breakfast cereals to prevent change in color odor or flavor so again these are all neutral these are fine right as of now but of course we don't want to go overboard with anything so you know ideally you know less processed foods the better additives according to the fda this is any substance added to food including preservatives food coloring flavor enhancers thickener stabilizers nutrients and sweeteners so some examples you know these dyes and uh leavening agents like baking soda calcium carbonate a lot of research is looking at this you know carrageenan xanthan gum you know for their long-term effects so again let's be moderate dies we want to kind of you know really try to decrease the amount and they're looking a lot of research again looking at dyes and and children's mental health and so forth i'm going to actually skip food date terms actually let me do it real quick so i might go a little bit over guys sorry um just i have two more slides left so expiration dates i'm a big one on expiration dates um i find many things in my cabinet i'm like whoa it's expired in 2017 and i forgot about this should i eat it or not so this is the thing you guys and a lot of times people do this they're like let me taste it let me smell it let me see if it's okay a lot of times there's microbes you guys that we can't see or taste that can make us sick so don't taste it or smell it and think it's okay because it might have proliferation of a microbe in there um that can you know then cause issues so i am really um also an a big geek on food safety microbiology changed my life when i took it in college um so that's again a separate session we can talk about um but yeah expiration date you know it's just their safety dates they're usually found on fresh foods or even dried goods you know if it's like something perishable and it's beyond the expiration date i would toss it especially right now with you know covet and everything you know going on um and you know if you use food past the date you know there is a risk for foodborne illness so again there is a risk you know like dairy you can do a couple of days you know here and there best if used by this indicates when a food quality or freshness may start to deteriorate so it might not taste as good as it did earlier but it's not necessarily going to be unsafe and sell buy this is usually for manufacturers the guys sell it by a certain date so if you you know are at the store and you see something that the sell by date has passed i wouldn't buy it you know it's not recommended to purchase that but if it's at home and it's past that it should be okay and just you know sometimes just err on the on on the side of caution and just you know toss things out sometimes okay and last but not least now this is a whole separate talk i'm just going to like you know touch the just dance on the subject right here i'm not going to go in depth on it because again it's a whole beast in it of itself and this is a supplement industry so one thing i have to really emphasize is the supplement industry so this is like vitamins and minerals and like herbal supplements and like you know things like that which can not only come in pill form but also powder form and liquid form just remember everyone it's the wild wild west out there here in the us with those supplements because they're not as tightly regulated by the fda as medications they're not it's actually up to the manufacturer to do these tests to test their safety and then put them out there and then if you know if someone got sick or things like that then it's up to the manufacturer to pull them off the shelf i mean fda will come in and and of course you know mandate that and so forth but it's really actually up to the the manufacturer and a lot of times we have found products that don't necessarily include what they say and they can be tainted with other things as well i know a while ago they actually had um found in like a very uh common protein supplements they actually found traces of arsenic and some of those supplements they had to take them off the shelf um so every so often random stuff happens so just keep that in mind so when you're buying supplements you want to try to see the usp symbol or the nsf symbol these you know are basically verify their quality has been verified by an outside group consumer group that whatever they say is in the product is in the product and even what they can write on the the products you know they have to be very careful like you know they can't say that this product is going to cure you you know from kovid right they can't say stuff like that they might say things like you know might help immune system it might support you know this system so just you know be careful and some of these supplements you know run it by your doctor before having it because some of these supplements could have contraindications to medications or even conditions so for example like turmeric right a lot of people like to do turmeric supplements just be careful especially those that have gallbladder disease um or kidney issues it might exacerbate the situation so you have to really be careful about some of these things omega-3s like fish oil for instance are not recommended for those that are on blood thinners or those that have are taking hypertension medications because they're thinning the blood out so always run it by your doctor um only take supplements if you're deficient in that right because you know if you're like oh yeah i'm not feeling good i think i'm low in iron let me get some iron supplements all these supplements all these vitamins and minerals have upper limits and upper limits can actually be toxic so for example iron iron has upper limit too much iron can actually be toxic or it can affect the brain so we've really got to be careful how much worse we're taking so when you're reading the vitamin mineral supplements if you see like 10 000 percent of what you need daily value be care i wouldn't do it it's always better to get things through the foods they did a study on smokers you know um some time back where they gave smokers mega doses of some of the antioxidants vitamin a and c i think e as well and they actually had to stop the study because it actually backfired because there's something about food we can't replicate in the supplements so let's say with supplements just be careful especially right now with cova you see a lot of things they take this supplement do the supplement you know it's going to help you it's going to cure you i mean just be careful you know so talk to a dietician i'd be more than happy to help you talk to your doctor about contraindicated indications talk to pharmacists you know definitely um before adding any random stuff um you know to to to our diets all right guys we did it we made it at the end of our session here and let me take a look at some of the questions in the chat box so let's see okay so yes we will have the recording online for a limited time so if you're not on our mailing list i highly recommend getting on our mailing list we don't we won't inundate you with too many messages um and i think if you just do a search on youtube i pop up um so let's see okay i eat a lot of home baked beets how much is too much so i'm kind of curious to know how much a lot is because this is a thing you know the best thing is honestly just try to have a balance right of everything because remember there's so many nutrients antioxidants and phytochemicals and vitamins and mineral and all these different nutrients that we want to have a variety so you know for our vegetables we should try to keep our vegetables to about half of our plate these are the non-starchy vegetables which are all the vegetables except peas corn potatoes so for beets you know have a right don't just like just be focusing on beats right add in other things as well so i would just recommend maybe like i don't know if you want like an amount per day maybe like a couple of cups max the thing with vegetables um is that it's hard to eat a lot like i've never seen anyone overdose on vegetables because there's so much fiber in there and they're so filling it's hard to get a lot a lot but you know just for the sake of balance and moderation and variety you know i would recommend you know mixing it up all right so how many servings of beets should we eat per day considering it has sugar so this is natural sugar so remember it has got natural sugar it's got fiber so it works differently in our body so um you know for again like i said you know couple cups max i'm saying max max um i would try to you know get the variety in i'm just trying to you know think i don't know if if if the sister is still online i'm kind of curious how much you're exactly having per day um so i i kind of respond accordingly i want to know what you're what you're doing and what else you're eating because remember also it depends on what else was going on all right should you let us know about diabetic and uric acid gout yeah i'm not gonna go into separate diets um in this session um you know they're really nuanced um so i'm gonna i can answer that question maybe you can email us email um our rahma foundation and i can answer those personally um once i get more information on on your end our liquid amino is good yeah yeah that's fine yeah you can use it instead of soy sauce yeah for sure if we buy milk products that are not organic but clearly state no growth hormones yeah that's fine um but just remember that you know they might be injected with you know antibiotics and then what they're feeding the animals you know um that's also um another issue but you know if you're not drinking that much milk you're not having milk products that often you know and they're not organic again that should be okay overall all right if the gmo claim is greater yield wouldn't that mean that the nutrients absorbed from the soil is split between a greater yield wow that's very fascinating deep question um so huh i think it's the way that the the the plant is grown right and whether it can withstand like pesticides sorry we can withstand pests and um you know nature's other effects um so i'm not really familiar with like the farming practices and terms because i know farmers have to rotate their crops right so that the mineral value um you know basically we see a variety there we don't want to deplete the soil so i'm not really sure too much on on that level so apologies in reference to banana and avocado what about pesticides and soil that would be taken up by plant roots and moved to other plant tissues including the fruit so it's organic but yeah that's again that's a really good question that's really deep question um so remember you know yes they're spraying things and yeah it does get into the soil it can get seeped in but it's going to be a lot less exposure than when they're directly spraying them and absorbing so overall if you're able to get everything organic organic then go for it you know um so that would be fine um i was wondering okay yes thank you for bringing that up sadia okay um you're wondering if we peel the skin off non-organic fruits does that minimize the pesticides in terms of desi stores how do we know where the produce okra etc comes from that's a good question in terms of and ask them where are you getting this from um you know it could be locally grown it could be from other different parts of the country you might even be international so yes great question and i forgot to actually talk about that so for these organic foods if you're like yeah i can't get everything organic it's pricey or i don't know if i even want to or what not so what you can do is you can always soak the fruits and vegetables in a solution of vinegar and water so like i think a very little bit of vinegar you know and water and just let them kind of soak that kind of helps you do a salt solution that could help a little bit um you don't need these vegetable oil sorry these vegetable sprays and washes you don't necessarily need them we haven't seen that many benefits or help from that but just washing them really well yeah if you want to peel some of the skin off you can there are a lot of nutrients in there as well um but yeah that would be fine but yeah you can do like a like a vinegar soak to help remove some of the the pesticides is it necessary to get organic vegetables if we are fully cooking the vegetable oh that's a great question too um i get the need for organic food if we're cook eating them directly yes now organic vegetables yeah you're right you know if you're cooking them yeah you might uh see you know decrease in some of those pesticides that have seeped in there or maybe they come might come out in the water again a lot of we still need to look into that um but if you're getting the vegetables and you're eating them in a salad then yeah you would have more direct exposure but cooking decreases a little bit but again remember they're grown in that they seep in so just keep that in mind what oil do you recommend for cooking yes so i um we talked about this in the first session the nutrition 101 so i recommend like olive oil or avocado oil olive oil ideally the extra virgin olive oil but that burns pretty quick so you know you wouldn't want to cook it at high temperatures for a long period of time um so yeah like cooking olive oil or the avocado oil would be my two preferences canola's okay i kind of hesitate when i say that i like gut wise don't have too much fondness of it um it's okay we in in the research it's so far been okay um but you know then we see other things about it being processed but all oil to be honest if you think about is processed all oil is processed we don't naturally find oil in nature you know cooking oil so just keep that in mind how do we know the food label for fruits do we go oh that's a great question so yeah all the vitamins and minerals and nutrients yeah you can google that and to see the nutrient amount um and you know the the you know the sodium and things but those aren't things like i wouldn't worry about sodium and things coming from fruit for sugar remember it's natural fructose right and so then you want to just stick to the serving size amount so i had recommended about three servings three or four three to five servings per day so if you go to my previous session i actually talk about serving sizes for fruit in there actually all the different food groups i talk about serving sizes so serving size for fruit would be like half a cup cut up fruit like a small banana apple or orange is about size of like a tennis ball would be considered one serving and one serving of fruit for those that are diabetic um is you know 15 grams of carbs which is one serving of carb why do they put gelatin in the fiber supplements i don't recommend any brand of fiber because i prefer we get fiber through fruits vegetables whole grains beans and lentils like if you're having issues with you know constipation your child and this and that then you can do some of these fiber supplements look for like soluble fiber ideally or a mixture of soluble and insoluble fiber i'm not sure why they put gelatin in there it doesn't really make sense um so maybe it's just look for different brands the brands that i've seen um usually don't have gelatin in there all right what do you think of red or brown raw rice is that a good grain instead of white yes that would definitely be a good grain although i don't know if you want to eat it raw but yes cooking brown rice red rice black rice wild rice those are actually considered ancient grains they haven't changed those through the years how do you know if you're getting enough fiber oh that's a great question um so i would honestly the best way is look at your digestion like are you using the restroom you know regularly you're having regular bowel movements um that's a really good indicator and then um you know you can go online and check this out but you can even look at you can even evaluate how your stool looks right there's a whole you know science behind that um you know if you have like you know stool very hard like pellets then all right you need to bump up the fiber um so yeah you can actually look online they'll even show you pictures of what your stool should look like and that's that's a good indicator whether you're getting enough fiber um honestly if you do half your plate as a vegetables for every meal and you should be doing really good on the fiber front what is your opinion oh i love this on collagen peptides i love it um another question so the jury is out on collagen so some studies show some benefits other studies are neutral so we haven't really seen in in the literature anything to really um you know suggest that everyone should be taking collagen so collagen again very important for you know tissue bones muscles um but one thing i want to point out is the precursor to collagen that helps with collagen protection is vitamin c so we got to make sure we're getting good amounts of vitamin c um in in in our body and again ideally through foods um and so anyways i was really curious about the collagen supplements so i know a few years ago i actually took collagen supplements i noticed absolutely nothing um and then um recently i i've we found this nice you know halal legit um collagen powder and so i was taking it outside my mom take it so i was actually asking my mom the other day i'm like did you notice anything she's like no she's like i was hoping my hair wouldn't fall as much and um and i asked she's arthritis and i didn't know the same thing in your joints and she didn't notice anything i didn't notice anything so i don't know i feel like i don't know we just don't know you can try it and see how you feel um but we haven't seen you know anything outstanding um in in the literature and honestly if you're having like you know bone broth if you're having you know chicken broth things like that you'll get collagen there as well and just when you're eating meats and things like that okay i heard only water-soluble vitamin could be should be consumed great question so water-soluble vitamins are all the b vitamins and vitamin c and choline so these are the water-soluble vitamins meaning that our body doesn't like whatever excess we consume our body removes all right and then we have the fat-soluble vitamins vitamins a d e and k and those need a little bit of fat to be absorbed and they also get stored in fat meaning we can go overboard so vitamin a d and a k we wanna you know i wouldn't take you know i'd be careful about the supplements how much we're taking and so on and so forth um but we should be consuming both water soluble and fat soluble we need both of them because like i said vitamin a d d i was i could have a whole session just on vitamin d's benefits um vitamin e and k k is very important for clotting so we need those vitamins as well so they should be consumed but all of these should be consumed ideally in in their food form are there processed foods that is not as bad for you what about vitamin expiration dates so great so no no so so processed foods there's different definitions of processed foods because like i said you know like oatmeal if you're buying oatmeal it kind of is processed right like it's not just raw oats coming from the gr field straight into our box right they processed it a little bit right they clean it up and then there's ultra process where there's like you know a lot of ingredients this whole huge process they've gone through so just ask yourself how many steps from farm to fork like how many steps did this have to go through for this to get where it is um so again not all processed food is bad for you because again it depends on the level of processing but those ultra processed foods like i don't know like the processed meats like you know hot dogs and you know you know the beef sausages and all those things like that's way way way processed um but not all are bad and yeah vitamins do have expiration dates just be aware of those you know usually this is a pretty long expiration date you should be fine with that um so yeah so uh you oh so you're mentioning how many beats you have one or two beats oh yeah that's fine one or two beats per day is totally fine yeah you're good you're good and then someone asked the question yeah what is your opinion on collagen peptides and i just answered that all right so any other questions comments i am now looking at the chat so i can answer so hopefully this was helpful everyone um there's a lot again i can go on so many tangents so we can have a whole day long session on just nutrition itself um one more question popped up my bones are a little weaker than previous years do you recommend calcium or daddy okay great question so yes um usually we depending on the age we recommend about 1000 to 1200 milligrams of calcium for women um so this is a thing is we also don't want to go overboard with calcium either so your calcium supplements including the calcium that you're consuming so dairy is a good source of calcium and you don't have to have cow's products to have you know calcium because in like almond milk soy milk all these different milks they are adding calcium anyways so you're good to go on that um so all your calcium combined you want to try to stick to about 1200 milligrams i wouldn't go beyond that to be honest um and then for calcium supplements themselves you want to space them out because we our body can only absorb you know you know a certain amount of calcium at a time like maybe about 500 600 milligrams give or take at one time so you want to space the calcium supplements out and you do not want to take calcium with iron calcium and iron compete and actually calcium wins but then iron loses out so you want to kind of space things out so yeah you can have calcium supplements that's fine if you have a multivitamin usually i'm actually okay with people having multivitamins you know like a few times a week to kind of cover basis like i'm cool with that and there are certain supplements that you know i do recommend like i think for women as one gets older especially in osteoporosis um you know runs in the family or you just never really had a lot of dairy when you were younger um or calcium when you were younger then you know a little bit of calcium supplements would be okay um and i i also really recommend vitamin d vitamin d helps calcium get absorbed and you know for vitamin d about a thousand international units iu you know spaced out during the week would would be good would be fine um so yeah you have calcium but just make sure you don't go overboard so 1200 milligrams um with with supplements and um food yeah old-fashioned oats is fine so you want to get the the oats that take time to cook they're not like the 30 second let me just microwave it and and leave um oats so old-fashioned slow cooked um you know steel cut oats all of those are okay yeah all right so i think we're good thank you everyone for attending photo if you want to give a little plug for rahma that would be awesome but thank you everyone for your time and giving me a portion of your sunday morning here so hopefully these um this was helpful and you can

I'm going to show you how to easily open one of these 100 or 120 milliliters chubby gorilla bottles how's it going everybody this is Andy with a sommelier XCOM and you might notice the background does look a little bit different here I actually did move my filming set up and I do have it at the office now which is why there's just a plain white wall behind me I'm gonna work on that and hopefully the audio and lighting is still pretty good on this video I did some tests earlier in the audios a little bit different I do need to work on that then I'll also fix the lighting issue as well but for now we're just gonna roll it at this channel it's about helping you guys out and I have been getting a ton of ton a ton of questions about how to open these 100 milliliter 120 milliliters chubby gorilla bottles whether it's Jam monster cloud head some custard shop which is the new line from Jam monster the chubby Bowl of apes line or like this new line from sqn so if you've been having some trouble trying to open one of these bottles here don't worry you are not alone they are pretty hard to open at the moment but chubby gorilla is working on a fix for them right now dive into the close-up here real quick and I'm gonna show you how to easily open these bottles alright here you guys can see this is a cloud heads bottle this is a hundred mil bottle just like the jam monster and all those other flavors that come in the chubby gorilla hundred milliliter bottles so what the issue is you might be turning twisting like this and noticing that's just not coming off no matter how hard you do try to get it so what's happening there is the security seals not being broken it has the childproof measure in place that pushed down squeeze and twist method but since some of these seals are so strong it's not actually breaking it and you're just twisting the top over and over again so if your seals are not breaking like this bottle right here what you do need to do is you do need to break them yourselves I recommend using a dull object and you can just sort of wiggle it back and forth so what you're gonna want to do is you're gonna want to get an object in here and if you just wiggle it up and down in there it'll snap the security skills I would not recommend using a sharp knife because as you can see you're gonna be cutting right here and that can be pretty dangerous but even just like a butter knife from your kitchen should work because you just need that force in there because when you twist it it's not getting that force required because it has the childproof feature on here if it didn't have the childproof feature on it would be quite easy to just push down and twist it off it would break without a problem but with that in place these seals are just a little too thick so for this right here I don't want to show you it with like a knife or something because I do not recommend using a sharp knife and you don't need to use a sharp knife you see that little security seal right there so what you're going to do is put your PIN in there and you see it just broke just like that it was as easy as that I pushed the bottom down a little bit and that seal snapped right off then you ever want to find the next seal which is right here you can see this one's already broken but you just do the same thing stick it right next to the seal pull up it's gonna break that seal and all you have to do is just break those seals one by one it takes like 20 seconds tops like I said I would not use a sharp sharp object this pin right here works just fine dole butter knife will do the trick but you can see I have broken all these seals now and all you're gonna do now twist down twist voila your bottle is now open the seals are broken now that you have those seals broken the bottle is gonna work just how it should it's still childproof give it a little squeeze there top comes off screw it back on give it a little squeeze again top comes off get it back on there and you can see if you don't do the squeeze that's gonna have that child lock feature on there it's not gonna come off let's go ahead and bring it back up top real quick alright hopefully now you guys do know how to get your bottles open nice and easily and then you'll be able to open and close them without a problem now if you guys want $10 off for one of these jam monster bottles custard shop which is the new line from the folks over at Jam monster very very good stuff this is the black bear there's black bear butterscotch and then a raspberry custard pie flavor or any of the cloud

"I believe we can now officially say good afternoon this is an exciting moment today but thank you all for being here today and most importantly thank you to Sarah thank you - Celeste for helping out our entire medical faculty with a session on opioids there are as many of you probably have read and thus the reason you're here a eme requirement for those of us who practice in Maryland and so while they have been a little bit cryptic about the needs for those there's no indication that they are not asking everyone to have that one-hour CMA opioid requirement so you need to have it by the end of this month and so that was the rush part of it and so thank you again to both you all and to anesthesia and also to the med ed group especially dr. Otellini for helping us out and for Rachel for getting this all figured out so I'm going to turn it over to Sarah thank you very much again for for doing this and off we go so I'm Sarah Reese turns on I'm one of the pediatric acute pain management physicians here along with Celeste Martin one of my colleagues and we're here to talk to you about pediatric pain management with kind of a focus on opioids we have no disclosures to tell you about we wish we did that would be awesome but no not really we do talk about medications in a way that are generally prescribed I don't know that we're really going out of FDA guidelines with any of our discussions here but we're not going to be focusing on anything crazy or not fda-approved for our populations what we're going to do is kind of the outline of stuff is I can't start telling you about pain management what's going through something without going through some definitions and sort of an overview of how we look at things and then we're going to jump into some case discussions I'm going to talk about abdominal pain that's our post-op posterior spinal fusion patient for comparison and discussion of lots of opioids and then dr. Martens canna Club and talk about PCA use and and then additionally the setting about narcotic overdose what are we looking for our objectives here the reward we're going to review the commonly use non-opioid analgesics because i feel like we have a lot we can be doing with those who can be dosing them better giving them in a better wage or by baseline analgesia so I can't talk about opioids without talking about those and then we want to hit on specific opioids there's indications of the special populations or in special circumstances and I look at how metabolism of these different opioids may affect our decisions to choose them or help with our evaluation when something doesn't seem to be working we decided we have four main pain pearls we wanted to let you know about so this you can read this remember and you can leave now this is basically what we want you to walk away with but one thing we see very frequently when we are composted or when we're we're writing orders for patients is we really really really want to have an around-the-clock medication given for patients I would say if you're ever thinking about using an opioid for a patient make sure you have them on around the clock something first whether that's an NSAID or whether that's Tylenol I recently had a kid I took care of just a three surgical procedure from an inpatient at four different PRN medications Koston acetaminophen oxycodone and morphine I was bewildered I wouldn't even know if I was a nurse what to give the kid if I was a parent I wouldn't know what to ask for nothing around the clock and that's kind of a poor way to approach pain management just based on asking for medication waiting for the nurse to give it giving it waiting for a level-two to come up so I would advocate for definitely using and around-the-clock approach with most of your with most of your pain medications I have to talk about coding because then sort of practice change I'm seeing now where people are not using it anymore which is great I'm going to go through some of the reasons why we shouldn't be using coding as an analgesic for kids and then along those same lines codeine is almost always given with Tylenol which very much limits your ability to optimize tell ml dosing and optimize your opioids so we also advocate for not using combination products of acetaminophen with an opioid and we'll go through a little bit more of that and also we want until you clean call us if you have questions something does it make sense as a patient you're starting to escalate you don't know what to do you have a brief question about a patient we're happy to kind of do 30-second curbside consult guidance over the phone we're happy to see patients do and need it so give us a holler our acute pain management system here at Children's is run by six of us or a McKee's anesthesiologists we often have an anesthesia 50s pediatric anesthesia fellow with us we often don't so we're just kind of flying solo our console pagers right here or the iPhone is right there but feel free to give us a call we're here to help you with your inpatient service our outpatient pain medicine care complex is headed up by dr. Alexander one of our colleagues the other practitioners there right now are dr. Raven dr. Lackey the zucchini and then we have two teen psychologist dr. Fletcher and dr. gray who have not met that is brand new this is my favorite definition of pain I can't find anything better it is the one that this the iaf he came up with 1979 they still stand by it I think I've ever worked at the end if you wanted to look at it but they M they what I like about this definition of pain is it is acknowledging the emotional experience that we see with pain and we see with kids that that emotional distress can be the primary problems that were that we're dealing with so it's a really nice definition and I like to use that when we are when we're talking brief review a lot of this that I'm going to go over is is review should be reviewed but I feel like it's stuff we talk about a lot so let's let's get it in here when we're looking at pain we talked about somatic versus dis real pain these are the kinds of pain problems that we we treat with our and says with acetaminophen whether opioids when they're needed referred pain we see a lot of in our post-op patients after positioning for surgeries after insufflation with gas or laparoscopic procedures and that is or i mean individual population you see this with cardiac ideologies but it's something we deal with and have to do a lot of explaining to with families when patients have had laparoscopic the futures now a perfect pain is a whole other piece that we're not really going to get into today with its own set of patience that we used to treat that mostly not opioids but this is team that starts in a nerve itself and it just keeps going without ongoing disease or ongoing trauma to that nerve even if centrally generated neuropathic pain and you can appropriately generated neuropathic pain we seem to see a lot of the chemotherapy induced neuropathies here very very challenging to treat so certainly if you are worried about that with a patient call us right away we're happy to help start some early really things to get that going or if you suspect neuropathic pain in a patient that's something we definitely want to know about on the acute inpatient pain services we can start some medications early on to try to prevent progression to that acute versus chronic pain I like these definitions from a really nice textbook of pediatric pain that we like it comes from Britain but we still like it but what I like about this is idea that it gives us this definition for chronic pain pain is really without a parent biological value it's not alerting you to tumor progression to nerve entrapment it's that pain is still there at least three months after it started and it's not it's not helpful it is not related to tissue damage then it should be still causing pain so again we tend to when we talk about chronic pain have sort of a three month timeline that we're looking at which is difficult because a lot of times we have patients presenting after two weeks three weeks of pain and you sense that this is sort of a pain syndrome not necessarily of a pathological disease processes going but it's hard for us to give them a good diagnosis until they have met sort of that timeline criteria and to throw this in here because we get takuya about this a lot when dsm-5 was revised I guess last year the year before they really kind of revamped their their definitions in terms of substance abuse previously they had talked about the tendons in addiction and you'll find we all still use those terms a lot but now they've lumped at all into one kind of continue I'm talking about substance use disorder it's again it's I would defer to some of our dietary colleagues sometimes in terms of making diagnosis but certainly we all deal with kids are we worried that this is becoming an issue unfortunately none of us here on our pain team actually have any special training in addiction medicine and this this specialty field really have the doroth of pediatric practitioners if you do any searching for a pediatric specialist someone that actually has training a lot of expertise in dealing with this they are few and far between I think there may be someone at Hopkins who deals with adolescents some inpatient chronic pain rehab programs can incorporate some of this but for the the kids that are developing that substance use disorder related to opioids related to something else it's really unfortunately not our area of expertise but we can certainly kind of help guide how to go from there and who else to help refer to so I'm jumping into assessing pain and I don't know if anyone else's kids like this movie as much as my kids do but baymax has a fabulous pain scale I don't think it's been validated but I would love to use it here he's an inflatable nurse that just pops up in an ass kids how their pain is and then gives them either a lollipop or a band-aid he doesn't give narcotics I don't think that that would be better so anyway I really like this I need a t-shirt when I'm on pain service I talked about this a little bit cuz I was I looked into this about a year ago wondering where this idea of pain as the fifth vital sign actually came from it you know it's it's a weird thing I think a lot of people look at this kind of with some resentment we talk about our vital signs being heart rate blood pressure temperature respiration things that we can measure and then we have pain which is totally subjective but this is a Jacob mandate and where were obligated to treat it with the same gravity that we do our vital signs and part of this came from an American teen society program that was in the 90s I think this was an anesthesiologist pain doctor who made this bold statement that we need to treat this with the same zeal to do other vital signs and then someone actually listened to him and decided that yes we do need to treat it that way the VA system was the first system to actually embrace this and make it kind of a mandate for them the Jayco started in the early 2000s to mandate this as a flawed that we need to pay attention to and to treat I looked long and hard looking for some studies of the relevance of this idea of treating pain with you know a number of scale calling it a vital sign I cannot find anything saying that our pain management has been more effective more efficient better patient satisfaction since we started doing this but the one thing that's really scary is if you look at number of opioid prescriptions dispensed it was already started to go up in the late 90s but it really skyrocketed after that luckily by 2010 in feces from the pinnacle is starting to come back down but as a kind of an unintended consequence of saying that pain is a vital sign and then treating it very aggressively with the opioid prescriptions of skyrocketed and I think dr. Martin is going to go a little bit into kind of why that's a big problem but luckily we're sort of I think on a downswing now nonetheless were still stuck using pain for to to treat patients and it kind of makes sense but it's very very challenging I had a four month old I was consoled it on recently in the dentists point-blank asked me how can you tell when my kids in pain and you know it was hard that could have been the hospital multiple life so I couldn't do that well you know your child best because I don't know that anyone knew how this child acted yes to anything but for neonates and infants in particular is is tricky we have a couple of scales use a lot of the NIP scale we don't use here what's a little difficult using this one when you're comparing it to other scales is it's not on a 0 to 10 scale so for most infants here at Children's I think in our NICU we use still use the flack scale this is pretty consistent we will use this also for kids that are a little bit older up to maybe about three or so are sort of default scale for that preschool to early elementary school kids is our faces scale this is the one down at the bottom here with a picture of little guys I feel to be replaced with baymax I think we have recently here gone to a slightly different renditions whereas in the patient room the other day looks a little different but it's the same basic thing we're going from zero to ten and trying to come up with a No that we can chase that we can treat kids that are young can you tell you when they have pain that they can't really describe it very well as you've all seen you're trying to ask a four-year-old about neuropathic pain very very difficult because older than eight generally are fine using visual analog scale or just going from a kind of a cure zero to ten teen most of them can do an okay job with that so the problem here is if we're using our pain scores to drive our prescribing practices and what are we giving kids if it gets really confusing I'm currently in Cerner this entire list here are possible ways to read order a PRN pain medication so if you want to have three or four different appear on P medications it gets pretty tricky what are you going to call your paints or if you have a savvy teenager who realizes he can get dilaudid get seen for six but you're going to even tylenol this means for the floor going to quickly understand that and ask for specific medications that they need but this just kind of illustrates how difficult it can be to really use our peer inducing and have that correlate with Ford's I would argue team four or five to me is me crying that's really really high that you notice a lot of our scores and for a lot of the stuff we're giving we want to Kadapa pain for six which to me is very very high again this is a individual choice by the kid and they are making this work up for what is their preference in general Daria's of pediatric pain control these were kind of identified almost 15 years ago and a really nice paper put out by the AAP and the APS which is American teen Society 2001 they have not actually updated this yet they have a new one out for infants in the units and one for treating anxiety and things related to emergency situations older kids but they haven't actually read about this I think it's still really relevant and it's a nice article if you're looking for sort of a good review article from our perspective we love to take a multi-modal pain approach medications are what we're here to talk about today so we're going to stick with but from our acute pain sort of standpoint we love to do regional anesthesia always endorse a non-pharmacological techniques you look like that as well so jumping in for Keith's number one this is a of the patient that we have all seen multiple times so 12 year old kiddo comes in she has a two-week history of abdominal pain it's crappy it's sharp she can't really describe it very well she's not vomited but she feels a little nauseated she's taken and Tylenol she's taking ibuprofen nothing nothing nothing seems to help review of systems well pretty much negative in the IDI her exam is pretty benign but she is very very distressed in crime the initial lab work you do is normal ultrasound is fine she doesn't have an ovarian torsion she doesn't have an epithet to me brewing for her in the future when she comes in to tell European for 7:00 to eat he feel fatter like we don't know what's going on we need to give her something to give her some morphine for about a 50 kilo kid three milligrams of morphine works pretty well she feels pretty good her peon score drops to three as she sits there while they're waiting a lot to come back if anyone else need to do her pain kind of goes back up to a seven and then her family because I can't take her home like this medication works what are you going to do for her so they would like the patient to be minted in it maybe seems reasonable her pain 7:8 she's crying you don't know what to do so of course is emitted of a hospital service which is really excited to take her and we're going to obviously focus a hug can control what our where our options are we're going to do things are kind of as needed for this scene are we going to do around the box are we going to use opioids so we and I think everybody here is on the same page for a patient like this whose ultimate workup groups ki- we're really going to want to focus on our non narcotic analgesics and without you Dominicans who which is a medication we don't really know how it works the way that says which we know work on the Cox pathway we literally have nothing else so we get a lot of these consoles you tell us this is what you're doing we're like great we don't have anything else we go see them we say you know teams doing a great job this is what we would do but this is kind of the bread and butter of pain without a diagnosis so acetaminophen I'm not just going to review quick quickly here I'm dosing for the amount of penances because we very often see that these are jokes we seen American is great we use that first line certainly as an analgesic we get it mostly peel rectal I want to remind people this is more of a nursing practice I think that a physician practice these definitely need to be given whole you can't split suppository we had a patient four or five years ago came up with a cleft palate repair left the post up being one or two I can't remember have it have haven't been giving I think rectal Tylenol around-the-clock parents kept giving it when he went home he came back four days later nearly dead from from liver failure it was really really eye-opening we learned that some suppositories have been flicked while he was in the hospital so we don't know how much telling all he actually got and he very nearly died so that to me was hugely eye-opening and but I tend to be a little bit of a OCD kind of person when I'm looking at acetominophen given to kids so Rexel we don't seem to use that as much anymore because again we're limited to 120 or 325 milligrams IV is a great great great medication how it is so very very expensive we order this year limited to a 24-hour run of it and the patient really needs to be NPO for you to justify using us we use it in the Oro block that is difficult with our pharmacy manpower they send us down a 1 gram file when we really just need 30 milligrams and then we have to throw that all away because we can't draw it up scarily input that so it's a very expensive drug it's really great but I think we're still kind of wrestling with how to balance cost and efficiency err guidelines for dosing enemy that acetaminophen varies depending on the source you look at our formulary here actually gave much higher neonatal dosing guidelines than I've seen elsewhere most things I had looked at which is pretty exhaustive literature search when we have this safety event a few years ago but a lot of sources suggest limiting dosing to kids that are under six months for about for you makes 14 per day so a 10 milligram per kilo dose every six hours works really nice and I would stick with that pediatric dosing again you can go up to about 75 MiG's per kid per day from our pm standpoint we prefer that you give this if you're using and analgesic around the clock it takes a while for an oral dose to reach a level and if you are waiting for pain to appear then you're calling a nurse so the nurse has to get it done our best to bring it and then the patient finally takes it you're you can have quite a delay in terms of what a patient actually gets analgesics so easy way to remember this ten MiG's per kig every four hours or 15 expurgate every six do it around the clock if you're using it for pain strike you're worried about fever then you may need to do at Piron but like impressive fevers through it rather positive so again our major side effects with this really is hepatotoxicity there are several case reports including on that we did in the literature of kids who have had significant powder toxicity for things that you thought would be in the therapeutic range so I always very closely look at a kid's tylenol dosing when we're console demonic kid and often recommend tapering it once it's been on for 10 to 14 days I think is on it's much longer than that but it should worry pee as I mentioned before I see the benefit is a really good drug so good analgesics but when you give it with a narcotic you're really limiting the amount of narcotic you can give because they're worried about giving too much as you Dominican or you're worried about the if you're optimizing your acetominophen dosing you're giving too much narcotic or if you're worried I don't really want to give them that much oxycodone you're really short changing them the amount of speed of medicine you can get so we advise not using combination products separate them out give your acetaminophen around the clock and if you're giving your narcotic around the clock stagger it's those kids getting something every few hours around the clock it lets you optimize your dosing on both of those and says generally you know we usually think it's greater than six months so there's there's certainly some areas in the world where they'll use it occasionally sparingly and kids as young as two months we just tend to not do that here these acts peripherally but they do have some central action as you're open you can get a pretty high maximum daily dose for tea mix for kick if you're dividing that up ten MiG's per Jake every six hours and ketorolac you know we like to limit that to about five days so a lot of times we'll see kids then rolled over to pretty high I'd be broken dough and I would I would have urged caution with with doing that way or using that much ketorolac layering a lot of ibuprofen on afterwards as well again our side effects for these everybody knows E as well I need to consider certainly using some gastric protection if you're if you're using a lot of n sets let it get on I don't know whatever is on formulary here it's just super check their GI system we mostly on our surgical services defer to our surgeons in terms of whether or not he'll let us use n fish in the setting of a broken femur or something but go back to our patient we really really urge kids that have non-cancer non-surgical pain especially those when they don't have a diagnosis to try to limit your therapy to not opioid medications and nonpharmacologic strategies this kid I would alternate acetaminophen Couture walk every six hours around the clock transition to Pio coorporate certainly child life distraction things I'm learning acupuncture I would go hit her with a few needles and I can do work really really well as it is kind of scenario but do other things before you jump to opioids narcotics if it is an extra miss you don't know what to do is at night you know judicious always be reasonable use the lowest effective no dose that you have and really set the expectation of the family that this is a short-term option as we're trying to figure out what's going on we're looking at our non-pure opioids which I think like to start with tramadol is when we recommend and pacer they recommend it to if you look at their website oh wow it literally like want to order this online and I was like nope no thank you so but tramadol is that is a is a good option it's considered a weak opioid it also works against a whisper tone into northen Efrain it does undergo some metabolism and it needs to be metabolized first to dry I would even know how to say that leave it variable and that has more effects on the opioid system the tramadol itself that you're giving has more of an effect on serotonin and norepinephrine but it's sort of a weak opioid it may be a good first line being to try when you don't want to give a kid something a little stronger and by the way this opioid metabolism article there at the bottom is fantastic it's nicely written I could understand it and I'm not like a medical student pharmacology anymore but it really lays out sopia by opioid how they're metabolized and how that may change what your what you're doing terminal we test typically those 50 to 100 MiG's per kid q6 I don't have a lot of experience josean smaller kids but we typically do it when kids like 10 to 12 year old age when you're not necessarily doing things on a paper cake basis who a would use caution when there the history of seizures may unmask that it should precipitate seizures and someone has never had one and concurrent use of other serotonergic meds of kind of urge caution though we do have kids who are on SSRIs and they do use occasional tramadol I just wouldn't have tramadol being around-the-clock medication someone who's already on something that has increased serotonin available new gain we we use this a lot we hear about it used a lot and the reason people like this in certain areas is because it's a mixed opioids agonist antagonist so we use it from a pain perspective when we have no axial induce varieties we've given narcotics into the CSF and epidural space which is really the time that we we like to use it however we see that use a lot in the inpatient setting with abdominal pain you hear that is pure effects oh my god one thing I would mention about this is that it's not kept on the floor and picks the patient's and I hear a lot from patients that Vanessa views as a PRN medication it takes really really long time for them to get it because the nerves have to call to pharmacy and actually have it deliver so this one you have a patient after and maybe an hour before they even get it given when they are at when the patient initially asks for it so this one well Mikey and I don't necessarily like to jump to around the clock arkhat X you may consider a very low dose of you doing this around the clock so that is available in the Pyxis when the patient needs it I would recommend always using this as a single opioid agent I would mix this with other Shore opioids oxycodone morphine because it has this antagonistic effect it'll block action of the other opioids I wouldn't put like dilaudid around the clocks and add new gain PRN reversal I would have moving around the clock and then oh the pains really really bad let's give them else they don't work well together and you can precipitate some some withdrawal symptoms so that's that kid you know how to treat them right okay case number two which I'm going to talk about just because this is a kind of situation where we use a ton of opioids kids coming in for posterior spinal fusion decisions like a foot long in their back it's bloody it's intense a really really big surgical procedure this is a 15 year old guy list day he's on our pain service sort of automatically after his surgery and this kind of pain we see gets better every day wery sure the patient's very hard for some day one it's going to get better it's going to get better and every day they do there is less and less opioid this kind of patient we would give them intrathecal morphine is before maybe they made incision be a low dose morphine it works fabulous in the final space and then we was sort of on a morphine TCA right away we would start off cold on the first day and then we would give diazepam Karen Steeda medicine and ibuprofen are around the clock we expect these kids to need a boatload of narcotics it's a huge surgery a lot of times these kids are using 50 to 75 milligrams of morphine the first 24 hours next 24 hours we add oxycodone post-op day one but by the time they go home these kids on post-op day three they're literally getting oxycodone to fix around the clock little bita diazepam and I'd be broken by day seven to 10 they're using very very little opioid I think there's a home like maybe five days worth of oxycodone given around the clock and a lot of them don't even they thought that so this is an interesting scenario where these kids have a huge amount of pain use a huge amount of medication that they taper very very quickly oxycodone is the medication if you look at its indication we talked about it being good for moderate to severe pain we advocate here for really just using it it's immediate release form oxycontin is it's longer one after about 12 hours and we tend to avoid now using everything as I like as purpose that real tough acetominophen built in again we don't necessarily want the acetaminophen so if you limited by your oxycodone and oxycontin is really kind of rarely reserved thanks and certainly forever thinking of using attitude call us and we'll help you sort it out oxycodone is metabolized via cyp3a4 and 2d6 to two metabolites but most of the opioid effect is just from oxycodone oxymorphone by the way it's a very very strong opioid antagonist it's actually an opioid you can give non-formulary here it's not used a lot in pediatric practice but it's just a minor metabolite of oxycodone for for oxycodone you know we we give it to little tiny babies if they need it I think there's definitely hesitation there's a larger group about using it in tiny infants obviously but we're not the way I look at it with kids if you have a two-year-old who says I don't know something very very painful happen to them and they need something they'll be afraid to use it you can always cut your dose down I usually recommend with our Kotik so I'm always preaching twice all those residences start small we can always get more once you judge a kid's affect from a medication you can you can decide where to go with that you can always incrementally increase your dose or make it every four hours the other two drugs I wanted to talk about the orally used ones are coding and hydrocodone which thankfully is not on our formulary here codeine is a lot of press or has been recently because of its metabolism is a pro drug it itself has no analgesic effect and a half to metabolize so if patients rely on a few IP 2e6 metabolize them to chew this up into morphine there's a subset of populations the u.s. population 40% that are ultra rapid metabolizers so they end up getting way more morphine and you are aiming for there's also a nearly a third of the u.s. population do not metabolized it very well and they get little to no analgesic effect so you're looking at a drug that for a third of the kids are giving it to are not going to get analgesic from it and then nearly 10 percent of them are at risk for getting too much too much analgesia with all the tendon side-effects and respiratory depression type issues this is such a big issue that 2012 FDA identity reports and identified three kids who had died and one that had nearly died after receiving cooing after an LFA or for OSA after a tiene these are all little kids there was some question about they didn't give an oxycodone with it there's been a problem too but it's hard to say by 2013 however FDA put a black box warning on it for its use in kids after a tonsillectomy and for other pain problems you really should only use this the benefits or anticipated outweigh the risks we have other medications that are you or better and our cleaner and don't rely on it erratic metabolism the the European Medicines Agency and the Canadian Ministry of Health both form kind of our FDA equivalents actually restricted to kids that are older than 12 and the w-h-o removed it from its clinical analgesic ladder for kids in 2012 and they specifically took it they also don't like to use tramadol because they say we don't have a lot of evidence for us using kids cover and out our community yes let's call the WHI because they removed coating yet also say we can use tremor all but I think it just illustrates that coating this is not a good drug for us to be using vicodin or hydrocodone we don't have this on formulary some studies that have been looking at replacement with codeine like what do we do this has been sort of our routine sort of mild to moderate pain medication for kids or no longer using it now what do we do some have suggested using hydrocodone but it also is mostly a pro drug it's that it is metabolized to hydromorphone or dilaudid it probably I think hydrocodone does have some analgesic effect on its own but we don't have a lot of data about this and this medication and codeine in the last two years had recently together last two years has changed their DEA classification to schedule two previously these medications were prescribed a lot because it was a lot easier for you to do so you could fax in a prescription you could potentially call in a prescription they did not have the same restrictions on how to prescribe them as our schedule to medications this puts it up there with fentanyl oxycodone methadone etcetera so these are now more difficult to prescribe both coating and hydrocodone and we would kind of argue that they're probably not great drugs I've never actually referred either of them here I prefer oxycodone for short-term use just because it's a lot more predictable so that is about all I think I have to about that you just wash work themselves again my head no one else you know anyway so I mean Pearl's here that we would love to kind of instill if you is again skill for it around-the-clock approach either with your non-narcotic analgesic stuff which again we don't have a lot of options see the benefit in tenses or it can be good they're much more effective if you use them around on the clock in your patients aren't waiting and waiting and waiting for a nurse to bring them medication so he is codeine oxycodone will be a nice substitute at this point also stagger your acetaminophen with your opioids don't give them at the same time and definitely call us if you if you need our help we are happy to to give you some guidance this is my list of references I think the less is going to continue on here how are you guys doing hang in there and it's a lot of information that we're trying to condense in a short period of time but I'm going to quickly go through because I'm running out of time okay okay so two cases that I'm going to present today on case number three there's going to be a brief overview of patient controlled analgesia or PCA and then we're going to wrap things up with the a prescription opioid overdose epidemic I think this serves as the impetus for many states such as Maryland actually requirements under the open education for medical relicensing so that we as healthcare practitioners to be cognizant of this epidemic and prevented from further progressing insulin we're going to get started now so case three we have Sam who's a thirteen year old male with a history of sickle-cell disease presents a panel attend pain of the right lower extremity it started about three days ago after returning from a school trip to the zoo he took several doses of his prescribed oxycodone and ibuprofen prior to coming to the emergency room didn't really seem to help but he denies any trauma or any recent analysis he is frequently admitted for pain crisis his last position was about a month or so ago he has experienced painkillers in the past when he was admitted to our vehicles of crisis a physical exam there's no slowing or deformity to the leg there is however tenderness to palpation of the extremity in your emergency room he has received all three doses of Morphin more morphine and Hispanic only down to nine out of ten start attending Delta nine when you see him he's extremely cheerful and writhing in pain in refusing any oral intake he subsequently admitted to your service for the management of his pain so typically when a child comes in for a vo see the typical relative pain management is by giving out PCA is also used for opioid delivery in kids older than six years old for acute severe pain and also some bills experiencing chronic pain from cancer it allows for a regulation of opioids in a controlled fashion so a child can push a button and get medicine delivered this avoids the delay in receiving medication compared to fear inducing that a nurse might administer because they might be tired of wasting care of other patients and may not necessarily come you know quick and very fashion to administer medication and assess this discrete decreases anxiety because the child know they can give medications of not passively and painful medication to come and also the previous results in patient satisfaction and it's important to note that a PCA does not necessarily decrease the overall opioid use and most kids in most cases actually increases over their use okay so at our institution only the pain medicine service can initiate and make modifications to a PCA the only exception being is hematology service which can start in more three t CA and a patient's is admitted for VLC and you first want to make sure is you ask us a child for the ability actually user-pc effectively um so one of the things we look for is candidate push a button and one of the things that we look at and see if they can play a video game at home as we know they can play a video game I mean I just happened wrong when I said actually playing a video game and maybe winning we know that they may have the cognitive ability to actually feel the PCA effectively so what our institution reviews aged 6 to 7 ever cut off because we feel like the kids have the cognitive ability to use a PC appropriately knowing that they're in pain if they push the button you'll get meditation and as a result be comfortable so you will plan assess the level of pain if pain is mild mildly control the PCA may not be necessarily advantageous in that setting you want to look at the type and quantity of medication attempted prior to requesting a PCA it's not uncommon that we get console openers or service for a kid who's getting a sub optimal dose of morphine and they required maybe five or eight doses of that and they're asked you know PCA but then when we actually look at the quantity of medication in losing you tell them that they can further be optimized and maybe a PCA is not really necessary in a setting so when we started dosing we actually use on the patient weight as a guideline to start dosing of PCA and it's important to English individualize the TCF parameters based on the child's medical issues and our history of TCA use if it's available so for example if you know that a child might be sensitive to opioids and they may have obstructive sleep apnea their opiate requirement of a lab so there are those my passionately less than the recommended starting dose and conversely if you know patients open your tolerance they're starting to learn actually of somewhere greater and yeah recommended starting dose you also want to ensure that you educate a child and attorney regarding to you because there's might be available that that's right and be a helpful reminder to push the buttons but in the same token you know on the patient's parents actually pushing the button because that can lead to situations of over sedation so we typically from use to opioids for the PCA morphine is the most commonly used agent qualified the lot is for those who might be intolerance and a side effects of morphine and agent selection cheesy days or efficacy to tasks use if that information is available and the ability to tolerate the side effects so morphine is a synthetic opiate agonist it's a standard opiate to which all others are compared to its metabolized by the liver limiters to two substances working three boquer\u00f3n are and morphine six vulgarized metabolites are then excreted by the kidney and in cases where there's impaired renal function of metabolize can actually accumulate and cause side effects of their own so morphine three Pokemon is inactive and it doesn't have any analgesic properties but in a sense of renal failure can accumulate and cause agitation even seizures and delirium morphine Prix is metabolised with analgesic properties somewhat similar to the parent compound morphine and cause drowsiness nausea vomiting and respiratory depression side effects of morphine include sedation respiratory depression nausea vomiting constipation itching and urinary retention it can also be associated with a histamine release and you can notice or tutorial or a real appearance over the manger which morphine is administered and in rare instances it can actually cause systemic hypotension hydromorphone aren't dilaudid is another synthetic opioid agonist it's more potent than morphine about a by a factor of five to eight it also is metabolized by the liver it's all metabolized inactive as often a choice in renal failure settings on the axis reacted with abhinash additional alienation or excitation and cognitive impairment we've actually only seen is about once inner setting on where even consult for PCA no hydromorphone say shares a similar side effect as morphine but there are somewhat less though compared to modules so when we go to PCA we selected the mandals and s result that delivers with each push of the button you can see that the dosing parameters are somewhat different form morphine and allotted we also select a large interval that's the type of one a first push the button to when they can actually posted on a second time and actually at medication delivers we can also choose the continuous and medium juice Lucilla recommendations so we're often faced with a question when you start a PCA do we include a basal infusion or not so this list some of it you guys this is where you always want to start a continuous infusion for the PCA so in situations you have chronic opioid use high severity of pain chronic illnesses such as sickle cell disease and cancer where you know the patient is more likely or clear tolerance and any extremely painful procedures because you're anticipating there probably a higher dose of pain medications and what standards okay Greece's not to include a basal infusion or at least to consider a reduced starting dose would be those who are opioid naive little bit while severity in Maori painful procedures any other history of respiratory problems as I mentioned for obstructive sleep apnea because they might be more sensitive to opioids in some settings where there might be sensitive and they may risk hyperventilating and require urgent intubation if you know or kids have a history of a difficult airway difficult intubation may want to refrain from using a hires on those clearance infusions and also they have a prior episode of sedation hydrogenation with opioid use okay so this picture and the next two wonderful I think is a really good depiction of PCA use so achieve an adequate state of analgesia is also to compromise between two extreme states hyperventilation and pain do you see that we're sitting on the y axis on the x axis you have a give an interval of time an actual tracing represents five small opioid levels okay so in this patient they have a TC over the demand and basal confusion so that our patient here is started with some of my attain it push the button one and then they get back into that zone where there's adequate analgesia so then they fall asleep their opioid levels you're going to drip a little bit drip down the list and then under pacer to increase they push the bike once again then you're back in and out of the state of Angie's yeah okay the next picture shows organ and Oly TCA the same xly a trapeze we have a patient starting out with adequate analgesia they fall asleep your opioid level you're going to drift out and it takes several pushes of the button for they can get back on state of additives and abuse then last we have a patient's level demand and a continuous from PCA but the continues might be a little bit higher or maybe they could just be simply sensitive little feelings so they're starting out in a range where they have appropriate analgesia you need to try to push the button again and then they get into that danger so on all hypoventilation so then they fall asleep when despite not pushing the button the levels began to drift off and open up again until they get back to their entrees on all types of innovations so that's why the important ones kids are at a PCA they have adequate monitoring such as oxygen saturations pulse ox monitor to ensure safety so when we're transitioning off a PCA we use clinical improvement as a cue to start to process so if they took on secure connection start weeding themselves off of a PCA why and it would be indicated by increased use over time so we typically stop the basal rate now with certain oral opioid such as oxycodone in entertainment well control with the new regimen the PCA can be ultimately discontinued so our friends family basically prices so or step would be the first review this past admissions you determine which medication has been successful if you require escalation of opioids in the experience any side effects from the choosing agents and then we will start a PCM most likely a demand and continuous infusions and then ultimately notify the pain medicine team silligan Holohan okay so then we move on to chase number four we have Charles he's a patient who recently injured his back after sustaining a fall he tried some of his mother's oxycontin sales and found that he experienced considerable relief so much so that you now come to your office asking for a prescription overdose so how can is risk for overdosing on prescription opioids be minimized so much of the the statistics and diagrams that I'll show you are actually from the CDC so because description opioid overdose isn't a true epidemic and you know prior to appearances I don't know how severe this was so in the past decades most of prescription painkillers prescribed and sold in u.s. increased by a factor of four and this is despite the type of pain the quality of page and Americans of newer reporting are essentially unchanged so in the United States about 44 people die per day from opioid overdose and I've last decade the majority were between age 25 to 55 years old majority were non-hispanic whites although men are more likely to die from prescription opioid overdose the gap between men and women is closing in as past decade natural prescription opioid overdose among women increased more than 400% and over 230 percent among men drop overdose was the leading cause of injury death in 2013 and among people 25 to 64 years all drug overdose cost more death than ever das there are over 22,000 description drug overdose deaths in the United States and 2013 70% involve opioids and about 30 percent involved and revives a team such as ativan and on autopsy two people who died of drug overdoses often had a combination of both opioids and dental die as a team and their system so the ups are just do present across providers such as us over prescribing pain medications for chronic non-cancer pain we never want to leave any of our patients in pain but a long winter friends from jail now looking at our pain scores I think it's some resident infidels to try to prescribe medication sometimes when it's not really on resilient in the factories mentioned earlier and then some people feel limitation in pain is unethical and after there's very little evidence of supported chronic opioid use improve the quality of life or functional status and overdose rates are actually higher in the states that over prescribed opioids so I think this is a really nice illustration that wraps things up on the x-axis you have interval of time in year starting from 1999 to 2013 and Cisco kind of similar to it on dr. Reid's share with you earlier so orange tracing here represents sales of prescription drugs from 1999 to 2013 and orange you actually see a number of deaths from the same time period and you can see RIA somewhat of a direct relationship between sales and deaths and it isn't wrong until 2010 where you start to see things loving leveling off about their so the cost of opioid overdoses wisely right so not only are you using losing a loved one but it also places a financial burden and society in the United States prescription opiate abuse costs were about fifty five billion dollars in 2007 the majority were due to lost personas productivity in the workplace and also the price to pay for the abuse treatments and also the criminal justice cost so this little diagram is ultra CFE shields are there's variability into describing about states so the darker colored regions are an indication of states have actually at - scripts which reading rates DC is located right there is in the light hashtag purple and so we are among the highest in terms of describing Maryland Virginia also and orange sections so does the mb region like to describe these pain medication so what is the cause of this large variability the medical issues that cause people to seek out pain medications are not necessarily vary from state to state so that's not the only reason to explain why there's such a great variability other factors may influence prescribing rates includes healthcare providers and different persons of country do not have a general consensus consensus or when to prescribe opiates and how much the describes some of the increased demands for prescribing these opioids are from people who use them dogmatically they abused Israel description relatives for the seek as a high phone from these medications so again choose the cell demand of standard for multiple prescribers they're actually unethical peon clinics in many states that keep their own financial gains by prescribing pain medications of people who does need and medically I'm sure you've heard any Museum of these ones here so physician who's earning a million dollars a year and you find out that they're going off with them with Custer on jail because of them over prescribing these medications on ethically so the pediatric population itself is not immune from this epidemics opiate abuse and adults have an adverse effect on the children the adult opioid use is linked to an increased probability for child abuse located at home increases the risk for accidental pediatric ingestion after the times year 2001 to 2008 children in the u.s. under age of five had a substantial increase in emergency room limits because of accidental ingestion of globally in 2013 more than 6% of children from the age 12 to 17 got engaged in non-medical opioid use again for abusing it and just as thrill the thrill that I get from it and so it is actually feel it somewhat more accessible so abuse from prescription painkillers or killers because it's described by doctor and somewhat better than the state of using marijuana so they think is okay so many teenagers prefer barring medications of seeing your healthcare provider for opioid prescriptions either taken from friends of our family members so who is at risk for overdose those in chronic medical illnesses receiving medications from multiple providers and pharmacies and obviously consuming a high dose of prescription opiates on a daily basis and importantly receiving long-acting or extended-release opioids and oxycontin for acute pain situations if you had a history of previous overdose resistant as well and if you had a period of abstinence where you want to detox and then you come out and you fall off the wagon and start using drugs again your tolerance can change and then do more likely at risk for overdosing and then the extreme substances such as other benzodiazepines alcohol or other illicit drugs increases your risk for overdose so over the course of time roughly around 2010 when we started magically seeing the deaths on tapering off there's been many initiatives on the state and federal level to try to curb overdose but one of the ones that some pretty prominent in most states is the prescription drug monitoring program they are state-run electronic databases are tracked and monitored controlled drug prescriptions and dispensing is designed to stop pages containing multiple prescriptions from multiple doctors from multiple furnaces and every single state including the District of Columbia has is in place the only exception is measured so these states they can look and see who's advocating prescriptions for which pharmacies so they cannot necessarily look and see what a failure enero and you can look and see what's happening in Virginia to know as a patient is crossing state lines to actually obtain these medicines but I was up until I think 2011 2013 when they evolved the TMT intranet and that's another database that actually facility as a transfer of the data across state lines it allows participating States to be linked to provide a more effective means of combating drug abuse across the country and this is a list of the participating states you can see Maryland and Virginia are listed there in the states that are Alyce's are actually in various stages of being members of this program the exception being the Zuri because they don't even have their own state program um the other of initiatives is the trying to get drugs disposals of these medications of season effective manner physicians themselves cannot collect an investable medication and dispose of them it's not recommended under the exposes medications and trash or even flushing down the toilet because you can ultimately return to our drinking water systems yesterday Mainers should be sealed in a bag with inedible substances such as kitty litter and coffee grounds and then disposed so there are national programs such as a prescription drug take-back day the next one is actually this upcoming Saturday I'm explanted by the DEA that allows patients to return their controlled substance in an environmentally friendly manner and it's free of charge anonymous no one's going to ask you where you got a drug from or what are you doing with it and health care providers you're encouraged to advise patient's about the services and last but not least safe opioid prescribing education much like the one that you're here for today it's necessary for a medical relicensing in many states okay and in the event that there is a drug overdose naloxone is somewhat of a therapy for that if it's caught early it reverses the respiratory depression and sedation it's an opioid antagonist that competitively binds the opiate receptors has a duration of action about one or four hours but if you're using a  source of long-acting opioids such as oxycontin more than one bill so it might be required to reverse the effects some of the side effects of naloxone itself is actually competing with opioids it can actually result in increased pain and no option is also nose noted to have a increase of catecholamine release so it's not advisable to get it in a quick fashion because we can result in hypertension or India's or pulmonary edema so how can you help curb the epidemic what can you do so ultimately you want to make sure your patient has adequate analgesia but you want to provide a safe effective pain management program while we the risk for overdose this includes education educating the patient's about the risks of taking prescription opioids which is overdose and death and certainly not using other prescriptions that are not necessarily subscribe to the patient and using on opioid such as Tylenol insist physical therapy and exercise you want to ensure Responsible opioid prescribing you want to prescribe the lowest effective dose and only the among the cells in your tentative anticipated duration of pain you want to insert your patients how to stop it opioids and when the treatment is done you want to provide your patients with information how to use store and dispose off their opioids and also avoiding combination of prescription opioids and sedatives unless there's no specific medical reason that they should be given together and also using your state's prescription drug monitoring program so identify patients who might be at risk for overdose so our patient Charles who's coming in for oxycontin for a new onset back pain we're going to tell them it'll obviously education with the dangers of opioid use and creating an open your apology's such as ibuprofen and Tylenol and encouraging physical therapy I know we're over time but facilitate it and I think we have a minute or two for questions if you guys want I don't believe we have a policy and that's China you want to come we do not have a life oh that's for activating self or others prescribed as of yet so that is something that needs to be looked at freely from the pain team subscribers have to you like any legitimate prescribing the hospital to apply right and then you send you can prescribe which I haven't done yet but surprisingly from I mean we do get asked from a palliative care implants occasionally but I think the hardest thing we've had to do is for patients who legitimately could use it we are you can't do it for anyone outside Assisi unfortunately still there oh no oh I'm kind of fair share in clinic right now so we're looking at having worked with Ryder vocalising process that's not a wide standpoint means yet people gasp for subscribing ten point odd weeks that out there they have a set options we even picked out of here let's welcome question they're now about one more question I'm sorry they called the or I don't have the prescriptions of these obstacles kind of incident or the doctor I think the pre-screen usually is a prescribing doctor because if you're talking about the acute post-op situation when they're sent home from the pack you typically the the surgeons team is the one who are Michaels prescriptions so then you would have to get someone from their team to either try to get them a script or or if they need to if the pain is that excruciating then it would have to come back to obviously emergency room to get their pain under control well if Japan of X is that bad and I can tolerate it yeah yeah but it would be there as a surgeon please help me thank dr. Martin Rees again [Applause]", "9D7HeDeCWc8": "[Music] today is you want to do a contest prep by doing I would I with gigas and going on the theme of being unscripted I have never asked you before so for everyone listening in and by the way we're live for everyone listening in do you know much about females well there's some of my favorite you know people actually yes strangely and you're right you never did ask this but strangely I probably have actually have more success bringing women to the pro stage than men Wow all right so that's what we're gonna stop to you to of my former trainee partners actually and now please don't misunderstand this I'm not taking credit for their success but two of my former training partners moved on to actually be IFBB pros in the bodybuilding Domitian so yes I have dry of vast experience in that field amazing well we've got so many podcasts to come today let's start the prep podcast but let's start with female athletes now with females obviously there's bikini fitness bigger physique and also but do they still have bodybuilding well I was just gonna say that you you may want to change or you may want to change your tune and change your direction um I don't consider a figure and bikini and that's the [ __ ] douchebaggery and I don't give it any attention and I hang up on those people when they call me no I 100% especially figure [ __ ] figure why because I like big muscular women and I don't want to [ __ ] make skinny people [ __ ] skinnier it's useless okay fair fair but the figure competitors get really lean though right that's appreciable not really it's just not interesting to me okay but they might not be muscular not really they're like [ __ ] like beef Jerky's like I don't I exist my wife six-foot you 40 like I don't have a bit of [ __ ] interest in that yeah fair enough so well sorry bikini competitors or Fitness competitors listening in its just turn this one off how about physique is physique the one below the open big chicks well Zeke now what bodybuilding used to be so yeah I can I get I can live with physique okay you know if query person or you know any of them those people were competitive today they'd be in the physique division okay fair let's start with the the darker side of the female bodybuilding is it possible for these chicks and by the way for anyone listening we're talking about bodybuilders we'll give me some examples that people can Google just what the heck we're talking about I mean you're modern or historically or what what do you want I'm not sure I'm not sure I understand give me two names of two chicks that you appreciate it's in this division so people can understand the size we're talking about the size and condition um I mean you know you're talking about modern bodybuilding I mean you're talking probably anyone from Linda Murray to current time so you're you know you're talking about the Linda Marie you know Debbie gates our Vicki gates rather you know those types of physiques they're you know what many people would say are you know vastly too masculine or what-have-you you know Denise rutowski those type of physiques or what I think of as female bodybuilding yep okay and just some quick stats hot white condition for these type of cheeks what are we talking probably your classic female bodybuilders probably five six probably 165 you know essentially 0% body fats you know the south or 4% essentially unmeasurable Wow okay let's start with the stuff that a lot of people will always talk about before they even talk about the physique which is wrong but it is interesting clitoral megali is it possible that the she can get to where they are without that no not to some degree and please I'm sure there's at least one woman out there you're kind of wincing at what I'm saying but hear me out because even in a scenario where a female were to accrue vast amounts of muscle without drugs now that's really a fantasy world but let's create that fantasy world it happens through excellent genetics or say a non-sexual known like hormone this female is able to grow super physiologic levels of muscle the sheer existence of that muscle would raise their endogenous masculinity via androgen pathways and they would slowly begin to experience a minor incremental increase in row mass they would actually move toward that the sheer act of being muscular is masculine the act of making one more masculine over time creates that effect it's essentially unavoidable now we're talking about degrees the different you the amount you could accrue naturally versus the amount you could accrue at drugs is like the difference between you know a bikini athlete and a [ __ ] bodybuilder in visual appearance but nonetheless any increases long-term exaggerations in lean mass will lend a female toward that direction yes Wow so a little theory then and it may have completely no science to whatsoever obviously I've been with more than one female and clitoris has come in all shapes and sizes are the girls that tend to have larger clitoris in the other and there is a huge variance just like with penises does that suggest that these females are more prone or they could better build muscle then chicks that have smaller clitoris Azure do all that or does that reflect their androgen levels at all well the answer is yes yes and yes to a couple things you didn't even ask the first part is yes there are actually some studies done a long time ago actually these these sorts of studies are very out of vogue and out of taste back in the 50s during a Gothenburg time that sort of stuff there were studies that tried to make those types of comparisons and there was some data that suggested slightly more masculinized females in terms of sex organs were potentially better athletes in more modern times the studies actually suggest that there's something and I won't go into it now but anyone with a quick access to Wikipedia can look it up there's something called the fore-finger ratio where it measures the ratio of index finger to the second second and third finger the four finger ratio is actually a better indicator of athletic prowess and that has more to do with the actual androgen levels within the mother during gestation Wow that is fascinating hey this is why I love it unscripted we never young and that falls under the heading of embryology and quite honestly embryology is ridiculously fascinating and coincidentally or not ridiculously complicated yeah but super interesting that with that with what embryology mean is that epigenetic thin or or what is that no epigenetics is once you're born no well epigenetics would simply would certainly play a role in that but no epigenetics is kind of a extra mover on the standard Darwinian model of gene transfer epigenetics is actually again you're weirdly stumbling into all my [ __ ] hot spots it's actually the subject that I wanted to go out where fantasized about going on to higher education actually at the time epigenetics wasn't even really a coin to term but the concept of evolutionary biology is what I considered pursuing as advanced degrees but I just didn't have the temperament for additional education all very for institutions anyway but so it's fascinating could you I know it's completely off-topic but because we're there might as well could you give a layman's there's no job that's it that's wrong could you give a give a layman's definition of epigenetics um yes well I'm gonna be really broad really crude but if you think about first of all before I even say that let's say this everyone with any real biologic biology evolutionary nature based life science based pedigree understands that Darwinistic views on evolution are accurate however if they're also honest they will say under some problems it's definitely the way things work but we definitely don't understand it completely if you look at how pure random chance would lay out mathematically species mutate through time faster than a Darwinian evolution would allow so we know the mechanisms of evolution are pretty accurate but yet we see outcomes quicker than we can explain it turns out that there is an additional layer at that layer is epigenetics so now to try and describe to you what that means I'm assuming you being in Australia me being in the u.s. I'm assuming this analogy will carry over when when they draw the lottery there's these big plastic you know fish tank type boxes with walls churning in it does that mean anything you know okay so think of numbered balls think of each of the numbered balls as a gene or even a gene set or an allele it doesn't matter each one of them is randomly going to be chosen and the answer is gonna determine something about the creature so you have these balls churning in there and you move the little thing and the ball pops up to the top via vacuum that's your gene it's a purely random chance if that were the mechanism for evolution it would move too slowly so what has been learned is environment can actually handicap which balls churn so for instance let's say you mister you know equatorial dwelling Australia ight for some reason moves the [ __ ] Siberia shorter days longer winters specific high-fat foods like salmon and bear meat and elk and whatever the [ __ ] those things will change your basic physiology because their pressures no different than me moving to the equator and being out the Sun it would change things about me while those superficial changes can actually eventually make it all the way through the organism to handicapping the genes so now think of those balls churning in the tumbler except all of the ones for warm weather now have just like a little dot of tape on them so they don't bounce quite as effectively meaning the cold weather ones have just a little bit more advantage when you draw the number and it handicaps the game in favor of the traits you actually need or more importantly your offspring actually mate Wow so epigenetics is a layer of genetics that candy caps random chance to most ideally suit the in but the interpretation and that's a key word the interpretation of the environmental condition let's say on the flip side of that then let's say I have a I was born with thanks to my genetics with a polymorphism for say more prone to Alzheimer's but my environment can change what happens with that outcome could i what it also means is probably not for you probably not for you but potentially for your offspring okay so there is a chance that ya because again I realized it's I realize it's very easy to you know think of yourself when you're thinking of health and well-being and biology and those sorts of things but the reality is the purpose of you is actually to make children that's that's key to remember in biology is whatever you're talking about the real reason you're talking about it is because you do or do not want to pass it on to future generations yeah it's really hard not to be selfish when evolution doesn't really have that moral code it's all about the next and the survival of the bigger picture at hand isn't alright let's before we go back to the main topics just because we're there again do you think that it's a missionary article to have offspring for like optimal happiness in life um I mean completely the wrong person to ask about that dude I have some very very significant social and emotional flaws that I couldn't begin to answer that I don't know what happiness is I'm not even sure that I fully understand the concept much less how you know reproduction and cohabitation and your monogamy or polygamy or anything else would factor into it I I'm lucky enough to say that I found a spouse I believe that I'm happy and I have a handful of children but how that plays into the grander role or anyone else I got I got nothing for you I'm just not the right guy for that I'm I'm on the same wavelength you are at the moment even though I don't have a partner or children I I don't know whatever happens will happen yeah it's interesting I am again and I don't want to be completely off topic because I'm sure your people tuned in to see here some body building but I am by but by my very mindset a biologist I've been you it's--we I thought even early on before my education than my education reinforced it and I've worked in a field so I have this very biology minded worldview but I find the humans and you'll hire primates but really you're talking about humans really interesting in that there's actually two really well three really fundamental different things going on there is our genome that makes us the way we are we have certain number limbs and fingers and you know eyes and the architecture of our brain is a certain way then on top of that we seemingly have some sort of pre-programmed let's call it software pack you men get a certain software and women get a different set of software that male makes us more interested in you combat in mathematics and when more interest in art and reproduction it's a fact I'm not trying to be sexist I'm being honest so there's genetic issues there's then software issues and then there's geopolitical social issues and religious issues layered on top of that at so I find it interesting with so many layers of Technology working together I actually find it amazing that people work as well as they do and not the other way around every time I see somebody that works properly I'm like that's [ __ ] amazing and every time I see somebody that's off their [ __ ] rocker I'm like yeah what do you [ __ ] expect like you know a lot of work and parts of it they've about 10,000 cofactors involved in how someone you know behaves the way that they do 100 percent yeah you're probably under shooting it to beef it's probably probably in intensive you know okay back to the topic at hand female bodybuilders we've established that okay to get to that size and condition there's no way you can get there without at least some degree of a bigger clip huh what other side effects can women experience that men may not that is problematic well again you have to be very careful as to when you just find like even when you're talking about drug use which is the more obvious version it's very difficult to weed out what is and what isn't a side effect for instance clinically you might say oh well you exaggerated muscle mass lowered body fat percentage and exacerbated hair growth those would be obvious side effects however if you flip it around the other way and say I'm trying to become more hyper muscular those go along hand-in-hand like peanut butter and jelly to hyper masculine ism so they're not really side effects they're effects okay good that we defined that then so even like behavioral even behavioral changes it's been shown classically in standard sociology and by all studies that women they become proficient in athletics tend to change in their day-to-day hour-to-hour demeanor they get more aggressive less submissive more combative you'll more willing to argue more willing to etc they take on a minor masculine trait in their general behavior now is that a side effect or is that simply an effect it's very hard to distinguish no that is that is really good that you mentioned that okay again we go on tangents but they're good and and this is another question obviously as you know a lot of the anabolic steroid research is bogus especially some of the agree especially some of the the psychology related research it's just terrible you know what I mean it's it's epidemiology it's Association correlation type crap and so roid rage comes into these papers a lot these shitty papers by the way that's a myth there there's it is I don't want to say it's a myth because that's actually wrong it's a number of things ranging from an exaggeration / misinterpretation of the data - and I know I sound like a broken record for all of you out there that know my work to trend Bellona 99% of all the [ __ ] stories you've heard about you know somebody flipping out and throwing soup cans in a grocery store and you know [ __ ] - kicking a granny down the stairs and whatever you contract 99% of that back to [ __ ] trend blown if you took trend blown out of the equation the incidence and concept of roid rage would go down - phenomenally small number other compounds halo testing and I defy anyone I mean obviously it's a common anecdote so it's hard to ignore thousands of you know Google reports on the forums it's hard to ignore that which is you know why I started my diet there were no data for it but thousands of people were reporting anecdotal cures so why not give it a crack anyway I digress so tremble own no other compound not even something like halo testing or Anna drawl well again see now you have to be careful yeah and roll probably not I I would based on a structure based on the intended ending now something like halo testing or super drawl or some of those things very possibly again keep in mind why do most athletes [ __ ] use it most athletes track-and-field power lifters weight lifters use it right before an event to drive aggression the catch is most people are not walking around day to day week to week month to month on Halo tested to use a drug along enough term to generate chronic effects usually eliminates those types of drugs leaving you just with you know Tran and a couple of other you know holdouts so it really becomes again a matter of how you're interpreting the data what data sets you are willing to use you know there's a huge difference between saying you know world-class athlete X Y or Z you'll preparing for the World Championships had a bit of a run-in and saying you know Bob but down at the filling station flip the [ __ ] out those are wildly different people under wildly different conditions and probably following wildly divergent programming yep okay I've got a really good question I just need to grab a drink alarm I'm [ __ ] thirsty give me a sec I'm just gonna smash my mic back on you can hear me good absolutely no tremble I'm then let's talk about the biology mechanism of action why is it trembling what is going on under the hood honestly I wish I was smart enough to have an answer for that because I'd be much much wealthier than I am right now all I can tell you is chemistry is a fickle fickle [ __ ] a very small change in a molecule can have ridiculously large implications in the final outcome for instance to give you an example that's not tremble own but a good example nonetheless boldenone and Dianabol are technically the same goddamn drug yet anyone who's used either of them can tell you they don't behave the same the minor little chemistry change to make one orally active versus the other in some way that we truly don't understand in detail has radical implications in the total net effect of the compound so if you can literally get the same drug to act that different now imagine actually in making alterations to the drug you can get very radical what's considered order of magnitude differences with very very minor changes so you take 19 or testosterone to nandrolone and the conversion from nan doronjo Tran blown which seems very minor you know if I drew nandrolone and I drew tremble own you'd have a hard time telling them apart yet the minor difference has huge implications on anabolic activity your metabolism rates and apparently silikal activity do you have any theories as to why Trimble oh and he's causing this roid rage or extreme aggression not none no I really don't I could tell you two things one chemistry's a fickle [ __ ] and two of all the things about biology which I do know and I'm you know pretty verbal and proud of what I do know my biggest weakness is neurobiology people are always asking me about nootropics and those sorts of things and that's the one area that I just never really got it excited about and never really studied so that's pretty much my biggest blind spot so no I don't really have an answer for you I'm going to assume that not many if anyone knows actually what's going on with trembler um that's my that's my suspicion as well that is my suspicion as well well and again it's one of the reasons why such a shame it took the turn that it did because drugs like prima balan and trend blown which by the way speaking the same iteration in there in separate legs of the family tree but they're roughly the same numb descendant in the family tree if those pretty excellent pretty well-designed compounds had been researched for another three decades we would have really effective really low-cost high safety compounds and it's because it douchebaggery like you know joe biden in this country and you'll probably someone like him and god damn near every other country that that research was derailed and you know we don't have those good safe effective compounds but we would because those are really good starting points wasn't that the intention with the thumbs though no the intention was arms was an it was the same intended outcome but it was done with an entirely different approach keep in mind psalms are not sex hormones there's a big difference between starting with a sex hormone and say I'm gonna take this sex hormone tease out the effects I want and minimize the ones I don't want versus saying I'm gonna can create a wholly unique and synthetic molecule that just does what I wanted to do there's a huge difference there for instance and I know this sounds like an absurd analogy but it's not let's say I put up a ten million dollar prize to create a flying machine would you or would you not take unknown you know accepted design like a [ __ ] aeroplane and tweak it tune it and enter the contest or would you sit down with a blank sheet of paper and go I'll create something no one's ever seen before wait if two people took those two routes who's gonna get there first yeah I see what you're saying so with the designer anabolic steroids there were a higher chance that we would see these more perfect compounds as opposed to thumbs which is kind of a a pipe dream and may remain that way probably and at the very least at the very least it would take much much longer to get to the same outcome with a wholly contrived arbitrary artificial means when nature gave us such an excellent tool like testosterone to hone down I mean look we went from testosterone to prima Balan in a mere 30 years what would we do in another 30 years you know that's the order of thinking I would go through yeah you might get lucky and just create the awesome anabolic drug via the SARM route but probably not no you know on this topic of these minor chemical changes and for those listening that don't have a chemistry background what Broderick is explaining is that on paper the chemical structure of steroid or anabolic steroid to the next one looks quite similar but because of these minor tweaks you know something on on this end of the whatever element makes a huge change as far as the behavior of the drug okay so what got me absolutely and and this was inspired recently by a girl that told me when she came off the pill and I and I don't know which pill it was you know she suffered some you know neurological and psychological side effects and that wasn't the first time I had heard it firsthand my ex yeah years ago she came off and actually went through a strong period of anxiety and depression and so I remember googling it at the time and I just saw once again thousands of anecdotal reports not much in the way of the data but as you know I mean which drug companies want to fund that data right and so it got me thinking just then is that similarly to what's going on on a mass scale here well probably actually insert something you completely didn't ask or solicit but just because I think it's useful I actually have two young daughters and these sorts of thoughts are in my preeminent in my mind because it's gonna be relevant any day now you got a 15 and 16 year old female tooling around the concept though for instance birth control comes up many people maybe bordering on all people just acknowledge that something does work they say well this is a birth control pill enabled excellent they take it and assuming it's gonna control birth and that's and it does but there's a big big thing missing there and that is how does it work I realize the average person doesn't want to be a chemist or a biologist or a [ __ ] doctor or anything in the middle but having a vague understanding of how it works can lend some relevance to the importance that the severity of the death of the thing okay where I'm going with all this is most of the birth chemical birth controls on the market not all but most actually work this way they convince chemically convince a female's body that they are already pregnant because when a female is pregnant they no longer ovulate because double pregnancy is actually dangerous to the life of the mother and the life of the potential fetus so the way most birth control works is literally chemically convincing a body it's already pregnant you don't need to do that again now it works and it prevents pregnancy but think about how [ __ ] just life-changing enormous complicated dangerous [ __ ] gestation is and now imagine walking around like that for a decade then imagine suddenly not being pregnant on a chemical level and think about how important that might be you know you've heard of things like postpartum depression that sort of stuff well we're dove well what the [ __ ] you think that would be no [ __ ] I heard of it now please anyone please anyone out there listening please don't think like I'm like trying to bash women or I'm trying to bash women's rights that's not at all what I'm saying I'm mystified by the [ __ ] complexity and amazingness of females what I'm saying is there's some problems with that method of to birth control [ __ ] I just what I'm yes I'm concerned that millions of women or young girls are doing this and their parents who obviously don't have the education a trusting you know Doctor Who to prescribe it are simply taking a pill just so they don't use a section there are other youth well yeah I mean there are and again it's a you know again I like I said I have young daughters and that's a conversation that's [ __ ] comin um but in the other side of the coin you know let me speak from an entirely different set of experiences and say I came from a really shitty household I had really [ __ ] parents and goddamned who I wish that dumb [ __ ] had swallowed a pill and prevented the [ __ ] misery of the first 15 years of my [ __ ] life so I'm just speaking from two entirely different you know concepts I understand how easy it is to swallow pill and avoid that certain group of socio-economic problems I [ __ ] get it and I applaud you but in the same breath I think anytime you're putting a pill into your body whether it be an anabolic steroid a birth control an antibiotic or a [ __ ] crazy pill you'd want to take a minute and consider how does it work and is this something I want to commit to on the long-term that's my approach whether it be like I said an anabolic steroid of birth control or something else entirely so just for what it's worth that's how they work and I'm not a huge fan fair enough and and me as well I just like to conclude after we move on that if you're in you know a relatively fortunate situation women should consider not taking the pill and using a condom instead because it may and there is a high chance that it could leave you with with you know serious psychological side effects later down the track and who else knows really what's going on because there's not that much research to suggest what's going on in terms of you know other areas of health well I mean we just don't know how are we gonna know I just that is correct that is absolutely correct and it actually goes even a little further than that again I'm in no way and about this what what I'm about to say is intended to be anti anything but it looks like there's more and more correlation between chemical birth control and autism than autism and any other single factor certainly not vaccinations certainly not you know [ __ ] you know estrogens and plastics or any of the things that are being blamed the highest correlation appears to be chemical birth control yeah Wow plastics and a Trojan I'm traveling at the moment as you can tell how significant are these um what are they called phytoestrogens from drinking plastics anything out of plastics how significant it is not okay and the data is pretty much on that yeah again think about this and I realize you asked me about estrogen and I'm gonna answer not estrogen but the argument holds exactly equal if you or I or any other person just happen to have a bottle of testosterone you know just you know make it you know Mets can be fun and make it one of the old serous syntax no testosterone suspension you know a hundred mil milky-white bottle of just nothing in the bottle but water and testosterone it's testosterone if you tore the lid off of it and drink it what would happen uh thing absolutely nothing why it can't be feels like a lecture at the moment because it can't metabolize via oral ingestion okay now if you drew the picture of testosterone and you drew the picture of estrogen would they be much different no you'd need to aromatize from testosterone right 100% so estrogen is actually a slightly reduced version of testosterone so your argument is that the thing that couldn't go through your digestion hole can go through your digestion less than whole hmm that's sketchy the reality is yes some plastics do give off estrogen and estrogen like phytochemicals and the reality is unless you're [ __ ] bathing in them for hours of the time your digestive system handles it perfectly and there's no awesome that is really good to iron out or I haven't looked into it personally and the reason I don't care is because I feel good I mean I'm drinking plastics when I travel all the [ __ ] time and there's no gyno so I think I'm okay yeah yeah yeah you you're not you're not humping man and you're not you know having gyno so probably not an issue okay well we've digressed a little and we're gonna go back to the prep so excellent okay more broadly speaking here last time we left off with the offseason stuff now you as a coach yourself let's say the client has not come to you until it's preparation time for a competition which I'm assuming happens quite often people don't seek you out in the offseason and then when they want to prep for a competition then they think you out does that happen often um actually this maybe is a slightly new phenomenon but I'm becoming and I don't know if this is because of my actions or just luck but I'm becoming more renowned for my offseason prowess than my own season prowess so I'm actually at a moment it's quite the other way around but I very much understand your your concept and yes people do come to me saying I want to prep for the show but momentarily to be completely pedantic momentarily my infamy seems to be more how much progress I can get someone with how little drugs in the offseason yeah that and I can see how you have that conservative approach because I mean you always talk about the long-term game and I mean anyone can get huge in 20s but then if you get sick after that and loser your muscle it's not much good agree okay so last time and I know it's very hard to give specific answers when it's a broad generalized subject but do you have any go-to principles and protocols when someone says hey I want to prepare for this bodybuilding competition get me shredded and I want to you know maintain or even build some muscle in the process how do you begin okay the starting point is there's two absolute requisites two and a half one are you under 15% body fat male anyway okay if you're not you're disqualified you can't do it - do you have 16 weeks if you do okay if you don't you're disqualified so those are the two requisites I would say that we need to move forward appropriately and then I said the the half and the half would be ideally you also had a moment of time two to eight weeks to dial down farm and get a little bit of a respite before coming into said 16 weeks that one's not an absolute deal breaker but that's ideal okay so if we're taking me for example I'm probably I don't know 15 percent or maybe even a little bit less you could get me shredded in 16 weeks even at my body fat now yes actually actually that's a actually that's a partial lie because the actual target would be 14 weeks because I like based on how I handle pre contest Pete weeks and I did use a plural s as in - I like to have people at the target body fat two weeks before stage so the final two weeks could be devoted to nothing but electrolyte water and carbohydrate manipulation Wow so you could get you could get made alright beach lane site like say eight percent in how long ten weeks give or take yeah maybe last maybe six really yeah this would require the drug youth of course I mean I couldn't do that with TRT oops it would require drugs I mean could you do it at TRT and an assortment of other drugs growth hormone thyroid computer all possibly BNP yeah it'd be hard it'd be it'd be a little bit of a [ __ ] show but yeah yeah I've done I'll confess and say I've done things like that yeah alright we're just good to know if I need a right to a finish line for an event one diet can heat you up six weeks to go a a fairly infamous Australian Pro came to me and told me he wanted to walk on a pro stage now he was not overly you know high body fat but not in contest shape he wanted to walk on stage in 30 days and that was the day of the [ __ ] phone call so we actually wound up putting together something like a 25 day prep and uh you know we put together a very respectable package in that period of time so can ridiculous dumb [ __ ] be done if you you know have flexible morals yes I think I know who you're referring to we won't mention names but yeah it'd be interesting to know what this individual used in 25 days to get that lean could you share can you share like I said I try not to kiss I try not to kiss and tell but I'm just making a point that these sorts of things can be not fair enough just in case anyone does you know think about who we're talking about the only reason I know is because I think I know but I don't think anyone has any clue who we're talking about anyhoo moving right along they have met this prerequisite criteria they are at least 16 weeks out of competition males 15% or under how about for females when we talk about body fat percentage here honestly the answer there would be more about target outcome I like the 15 mark to go to say three but if they're in a division that maybe doesn't require the three you can tack on the difference so 18 to 5 or 22 you see what I mean but I like that general concept of 15 to 3 and then staged it as needle okay what yeah makes sense definitely so but essentially within 16 weeks they're gonna lose around 13 percent body fat well percents are an ugly thing to use especially because as you'll you body weights and lean masses change percents are actually a [ __ ] way to do it I was thinking we probably talked about this later but just because it fits here in the conversation what I would actually do let's say I'm gonna take you and I'll put you on stage what I would do is 9 personally I would use 9 but you could use Jackson Pollock or anything else and I would take 9 sites of body fat calipers okay and I would get in a sum total so a pinch from your chest to pinch from your abs etc and I get this amalgam I get a number and it's whatever 75 your head to toe your fatness is 75 I know from experience that top-level national caliber bodybuilders are something in the 35 range so our goal is now 35 we'd stop talking about percentages and we talk about millimeters and every week we want to incrementally trudge toward 34 and and this method this caliper method which I'm familiar with in terms of total millimeters based on the amount of sites and you've obviously got five sites ten sites 12 sites depending on how deep you want to go would you say that this method of checking or tracking is more accurate and a better fit than the Decker scan um I don't like accurate because you can take a position you know it's kind of like defending statistics you could take a [ __ ] position that's defensible and still not be right the reason I like using calipers is a couple fold one yep and [ __ ] do it at home that has huge benefits so instead of getting a deck so you know I mean if you're loaded and have an awesome access what are you going to do you know once a month whereas calipers you could do once a week big big benefit second with a DEXA comes reliance on somebody's mathematics there's an algorithm an equation put in play now it's probably pretty accurate they're probably pretty smart and whatever but at the end of the day the more variables I can remove the better if I simply have a pair of [ __ ] calipers and a notepad that's how many variables I've got I like that so we have the most stripped down version of numbers and and it's as simple as if that number goes up you are [ __ ] fatter if that number goes down you are [ __ ] leaner end of story there's no additional commentary you can not worry about or separately worry about your body weight your appearance your gym performance all these other things because now you've isolated one measurement and one measurement alone okay and how about the confounding variables within the subject on that day could you hear me do there I apologize yeah I know I lost you for the moment what was that okay I think it might be the connection in urine we've had some lag here and there but otherwise it's okay but it's not the usual flow where your connection and your visual is like really clear today there's a little bit different maybe a different part of the house you're in or not so sure yeah nope right at my desk could be anything yeah could be anything correct could be anything okay so the question was how about the confounding variables within the subject about to get their body fat percentage checked by you so for example they're checking body fat percentage with you via the calipers every Monday at 9:00 a.m. what if one day they had a little bit more sodium or carbohydrates and then they're a bit watery or they didn't sleep as well they're stressed a little bit watery is that gonna come up in the measurements it will in fact have some impact but and something most people don't really know about calipers because why would they they don't do this for a [ __ ] living I do you do and the secret is if you think about the the actual structures of what you're dealing with new you have muscle and then you have an area of water the sub-q layer and then you have a layer of fat and then you have the dermal layer that's the order of that's the construction of humans you know if you were to cut it open and look at a cross-section you'd be looking at skin fat water barrier muscle that's what's going on and then if you continue down there'd be bone and you know and marrow and that's the what the cross-section looks like okay so if you have this layer of skin fat water water is well water water moves so if you put the calipers on give it a little wiggle and then the next step that most people's don't take is give it a couple of seconds the calipers themselves actually displace the water and by and large the water is not skewing the measurement yeah I so gone the reality is yeah it does but they're also the reality is so little i disregarded provided caliper measurements or carefully slowly methodically it's not really a big issue yeah I I did know the answer to that question however I thought it was a good question to ask because it does come up a lot for people that are not savvy at least it's funny people love to love technology or Dex has got to be we go better than calipers it's a giant machine and it costs $100 and it's and the reality is it's just another tool and it's not always the best tool no how about the hardware so I know you showed me the you know the cheap plastic calipers my my PT mentor Brendon rabbit who I'm gonna get on the show he uses a expensive set of calipers that he swears by he seems to believe that those calipers the one that you showed me are not the best ones to be using because they themselves the hardware isn't reliable what do you think about that well I absolutely wouldn't disagree with that but it also comes down to you know it's hard to argue that better tools are better but for instance you know better golf clubs are better than junky golf clubs but if you're an average golfer the best golf club in the world ain't gonna make you any [ __ ] better of a golfer that's what we've got here could I make use of $500 laboratory calipers yeah if you're gonna [ __ ] buy them for me but you know for just if we're just measuring you know people here my you know office just off the cuff and kind of casually they're fine yeah and I make my career on them yeah and obviously you are an experienced person to be able to take these measurements so you can use the cheaper hardware better to I'm guessing probably that that is also probably I didn't say that but yes that's probably also accurate but in general the difference in measurement I would get between the these junky 25 dollar ones and 500 dollar laboratory ones would be 5% maybe 10% in the actual numbers the hard numbers not the percentage you know so instead of getting you know 75 I might get you know 70 or vice-versa which is a reasonable error but not enough to [ __ ] ruin the whole could you using the same calipers each time the variables control right consistency consistency Trump's accuracy every time like that quite okay so we've established that the subject is now below the required body fat percentage that you need them there 16 weeks out what's next any health checks again ideally any and this is kind of somewhat separate to the idea of you prepping for a bodybuilding show in general if you're gonna you know lift weights and take drugs and do all these ridiculous things that we do you ought to have a handle on your health you should at some point your life have a [ __ ] heart scan and a blood test that's just par for the course I don't even bring that up because I assume it's part of the deal but to be ridiculously specific yes obviously anybody that's gonna start whacking back exogenous illegal drugs or to get a [ __ ] blood test to make sure they're not already dying of something or it's not a prerequisite though obviously you're here to give recommendations it's not your job to be their mother to ensure that you know they're doing the responsible things do you advise them though in case they're unaware or labs well I'm not only do I advise them but I'll actually very often just choose not to work with someone if they think that's an absurd request if they think you know just the very concept of getting blood work is a little alien to them they're probably more reckless than I want to deal with and I probably just wouldn't this might be a personal question or you may not be able to answer it but obviously you have these requests for a reason have you in the past experienced times where you've had these reckless clients and people have landed in serious trouble and or any fatalities fatalities no have people that have consulted with me or taken information for me gotten pretty jammed the [ __ ] up yeah yeah absolutely and I don't want to say that I'm blameless because there's no such thing but most of the time I can track it back to them doing something other than what I suggested but yeah it happens I mean keep in mind fortunately this has not happened to me but you could do everything right and still get kicked into nuts it you know it happens I mean there's there's [ __ ] no vegetarian [ __ ] you know vegan hemp loving whatever two [ __ ] that fall over from [ __ ] you know heart attacks and cancer all the time you know they're doing everything right they still get [ __ ] you know struck by lightning so you know you yeah it can have well I sure that's a terrible analogy because I'm not sure that's doing everything right being a vegan thing I agree but I'm trying to be alright okay so they let's assume that these subjects are otherwise healthy individuals they've checked their blood pressure blood biomarkers all of your typical stuff your comprehensive metabolic panel with CBC sex hormones if if relevant and they're good to go what's the next step um I ideally they would have a diet Journal so I would be able to assess exactly not just how much but what they're eating and we would determine to baseline calories and then we would do some clever math and we would say alright you're currently 65 75 105 kilos and you're consuming this that means you're getting X number of kilocalories per kilogram of body weight and then we would go over to the end of the graph and we'd say based on your current fatness we think you're gonna end up at there would be a number and then we would figure out just linearly if you lay this now what would you need to eat to weigh that then we would do that math now don't think that's the end of the diet because it doesn't work perfectly linearly that's gonna give us a very good starting point and a very good approximation our ending point now we have a lay of the land once you have a starting point at end point well you can draw a map that's how the mapping works let me go back to the so that's where we would start there right sorry to interject there for a moment because I think this may be relevant no no let's go back to the starting point because at least in my experience the off season is a time to enjoy ourselves and a lot of people are not tracking that accurately and or accurately at all especially bigger dudes what I've noticed they're just trying to eat as much as possible no no no no you mean no no I got to interrupt you you mean people that suck at their job that's what you say it's pretty consistent though I mean a lot of these body builders even the ones oh yeah yeah most people suck at their job no [ __ ] doubt absolutely I'm with you a lot of these body builders especially the bigger ones on their off season I mean at the end of the day who's gonna be strict 365 not many people in the world you've got to be you know a real disciplinarian to be able to through that and I know these athletes are in that small percentage but I accept no no I'm very much accept what you just said being you know you draconian 365 days of the year not not the best idea but starting something as important as your push toward your pro to mure your your dream your life's goal this is it this is a bodybuilding show coming into that window in time you don't have your [ __ ] together you don't have your ducks in a row [ __ ] you you're bad at your job get a new job I agree I am I just don't know why but I can't name their names but they are people that potentially will be pros and two of them one is Pro 1 something happened I can't get into it legal matters anyway so all of them and I and I love talking about diet they're not they're just friends of mine right because I'm in the industry for whatever reason and a lot of them I ask what are you in the offseason and they give me these baseline meals at their lis but it's kind of yeah and after that I'll try and have like a frappe and after that I'll have like a burn on the weekend I'll go out with my missus it's really hard to get an accurate baseline when you're having these hyper palatable calorie dense editions on top of their diet it could be the difference between a thousand calories a day I mean how is that accurate it's not and again this is one of the things that might disqualify somebody from dealing with me because I can't quantify the [ __ ] unknown but in a perfect world they have some manner of diet journal that's going to going to intimated to me what they're actually [ __ ] eating and from that I would have a you know the equations that I laid out I just on a plane I almost want to use the word moral level on a moral level I just don't like dealing with people that are that avant-garde about things um I take this [ __ ] wickedly deadly [ __ ] serious and if you don't I have a really hard time communicating with you okay fair enough and maybe and maybe I'm even comfortable saying maybe that's a deficiency of me but it's still where I'm at fair enough would you then let's okay let's say someone has changed their mindset they've they've been enlightened by the Broderick Chavez way and they now want to find their baseline would you still work with them and say okay I will give you X Y Z equation let's see what that does would you do that would you try and find their maintenance calories for the day yeah I mean again you know hypotheticals just become dad just hypotheticals but if somebody's committed to the process and they're willing to work with me yes I will work with them regardless of what that takes but ultimately what that take is fairly effectively they write a goddamn [ __ ] whole other there knows and we write it down tally it up and it has to be reasonably accurate and that's how we would move forward yeah okay cool now in our last podcast we establish that most of these open class bodybuilders are eating between 42 50 kilocalories per pound or was it killa kilogram okay kilogram kilogram alright so if it's a hundred kilo guy 4000 to 5000 calories which I initially thought was quite a lot because for me personally I had at least 4,000 calories a day and if I don't I'm gonna be under 90 kilos I don't even know how that happens I just thought that these guys beings however keep in mind keep in mind you're essentially following a ketogenic style diet at the moment for the most part but even when I did not it was roughly the same honestly just on a note of the the keto diet I'm actually not in ketosis so I'm still running on the glucose system because I'm having higher protein okay and Mike what I learned from dr. Sophia Clemens she said even the individuals on and you might find this fascinating a few if you are interested in Kido ketosis she said even individuals who are having high fat moderate to low protein if they exceed a certain number of calories they're also kicked out of ketosis so what does that mean well of course because this year active this year active gluconeogenesis then becomes sufficient to raise baseline blood sugars to non ketogenic values absolutely I mean dr. Rob what was the original law I had kids dr. Adkins himself talked about that in the [ __ ] 60s that's that's really not news but yeah that's absolutely accurate yeah so for anyone listening oh yeah I follow the carnivore diet at least you know I'll do one binge every two weeks or whatever but for the most part I'm still running on the glucose system and I don't have any there's no other benefits to my blood work other than my inflammatory markers are going down because I'm reacting to foods that just happen to be carbohydrates so I'm not following a ketogenic diet and look I think there probably is some therapeutic benefits but I'm not gonna go and eat lard and then you know cream and then a little bit of steak like they say that sucks [ __ ] up anyway going back to great the yeah it's a miserable diet the ketogenic diet for me is reserved for when I get really sick at the moment just eliminating food seems to be working well enough for me I'll consider the the key ketogenic diet down the track these bodybuilders forty to fifty kilo calories per kilogram so 100 kilo Mel 4,000 to 5,000 calories per day let's say that this subject has established he is eating four and a half thousand calories per day he's done his diet journal with you what's next like I said we would then kind of speculate okay you're 15 percent body fat you weigh X number of kilograms we would figure out what their total fat mass is purely mathematically which again is not perfect but it's a it's a it's a baseline structure that's what we're doing is fleshing out a baseline structure and roadmap so we turn out that you know there are 100 kilos so they have 15 kilos of body fat pretty straightforward so their lean mass is you know 85 kilos so zero percent body fat is impossible but it's also going to become our now our target so we go from 100 to 85 the absolute maximum number of calories they could possibly eat at the end of the diet is the same 45 kilo calories per kilogram it won't be but we could say that so now we have an absolute starting point based on this is where we really are and we have an absolute best case endpoint we start diet hitting and now we have targets okay and we just simply debit calories measure millimeters seven days later measure millimeters adjust calories all the while managing pharmacology weight training values and somewhere in there depending on the person history responses etc we implement cardio to again additionally debit calories notice I didn't say burn fat because that's a [ __ ] lie debit cow burning calories is the same as not eating calories okay that's a really important distinction really important [ __ ] distinction people sure let's assume then that the audience understands these basic laws of thermodynamics and they understand that there's no magic involved so all of the woowoo stuff these people listening are clearly cognizant to what's going on in the scene and what we want to get from you is the extra nitty gritty so assuming then that their diet is perfect which we will discuss on that note first in the first calorie deduction what increment per week has a lot to do with how big the athlete is how muscular the athlete is that's actually more important than big because you can be big and just be a big goddamn human being the thing in a human being that burns the calories is muscle mass so if they're hyper muscular male or female they get a smaller deduction than if they're less so just because muscle is the thing deputy burning the calories you know it's kind of like looking at automobiles why does a Prius get better gas mileage than a dump truck it's not because of the [ __ ] high goddamn technology is because Prius or [ __ ] light is you know bathtub toys they have a little mass therefore it takes less energy to move them it's it's really that simple so small people low mass easy to move less energy big people hard to move requires more energy so the bigger the athlete the smaller the debit the larger the athlete unfortunately the lard you know I say that backward though the larger the athlete the smaller the debit the smaller the athlete the bigger the debit because we need to make it quicker inroads there you surplus of energy but in a let's think that big did the the higher side you got a hundred kilo athlete that's consuming 4,500 kilocalories we would probably start with a 500 calorie debit and that would be sufficient to really get things moving at the end of that week my usual experience is no change in no additional debit because the first one was probably exude exuberant yeah it does make sense who short of a time whereas if you have yeah now on the other side of the coin you have somebody much smaller you have somebody 70 75 kilos their first debits actually probably going to be that same 500 which is a much bigger percentage of their total calories okay makes total sense and again quite a standardized recommendation and it is standardized for a reason because it works what not a percent pharmacology the stuff that everyone has been waiting for I'm going to give everyone a recap of the previous podcast where we talked about Terry the hundred odd kilo bodybuilder who was using XYZ drugs so for anyone listening they can revert back to that odd cast and see what he was using let's continue with Terry then how are we going to change the drug protocols a lot of people seem to think that in the off season and and when I say a lot of people I just mean your general community they seem to think that the off season bodybuilders use more drugs and in prep because they're just trying to hold muscle they use less drugs that's not true is it not only is it not true but it's it's it's not true even enough like a like a philosophical fundamental you clearly don't understand what you're trying to [ __ ] an accomplished kind of mindset it's literally just you know you know just consistently have it as sex and wondering why you're not pregnant it's just [ __ ] it's just [ __ ] wrong the general approach I would say is drugs are a factor in overall in ableism a powerful one albeit but just a factor in the offseason for instance you have calorie surplus you have complete total control of your training you have pharmacology you have rest recovery sleep all of these extra modalities all combined to your net anabolic signaling so drugs are not the preeminent pillar of that they're a supporting pillar now don't misunderstand me and think that oh you can get big without drugs if you just focus on all those other things no that makes you one of the little natural idiots and doesn't work that way but it's not the sole pillar but if you use that analogy and you think of all of these you know all of these things coming together you know making some sort of structure like a teepee and drugs and food and all these things okay so now you have this structure now as contest time comes you start knocking away pillars you lose the calorie surplus you lose the 10 hours a day of sleep you lose the and just start losing things until there's nothing [ __ ] holding up the roof but the drugs I love that analogy everyone has to look at the video version of this for that one because it's it's it's really good go on it and again I don't want to be a dick but why is that not obvious to you you you be the listener now that concept will then come back later and help you decide what drugs to take even but that's maybe a conversation for an entirely different portion of the conversation if not a different conversation but the concept is that as the contest time approaches your calories go down your rest and recovery goes down your volume of training goes up your cardio goes up so there's all these factors that are digging you a bigger and bigger deeper and deeper hole and the only thing you have to support the roof is drugs so obviously drugs become ever more important as the contest approaches not the other way around and I want to mention a few things let's talk about the natural idiots as you refer them to talking about what goes on in their environment when they're dieting down ok so they're dieting down they're dropping their calories severely low so testosterone with testosterone so does estrogen they're dieting down Theroux at hormone Goes Down which also makes them feel like [ __ ] they sleep is suffering as a result and also make some nietzsche tired order and then also if I read Goes Down sir they need to die it even harder to go out any hotter they're losing my crows losing macros it's it's a huge cascade of crap going down then they can't sleep but they won't take drugs so they can't necessarily so poor sleep poor recovery before you know it they step on stage like you said a bag of bones and unhealthiest [ __ ] absolutely I would venture to say a drug using body builder on stage is probably healthier than a natural bodybuilder on stage as funny as that sounds I bet wise imagine pound for pound as well imagine the ID kilo drug using body build of Earth is the 80 kilo natural night and day absolutely ours are actually 80 kilo natural bodybuilders they actually exist I've I wouldn't know I wouldn't know as much as you don't because I don't I'm not into it I think that's a [ __ ] unicorn if you ask me but whatever you know on that question then and I know you're not into bikini but I do have some girls that are into bikini and it's just look I tell them myself you cannot compare an open class male diving down to a bikini competitor but it is their goal they appreciate it they like it I don't know how its judged you know based on who's given you know the best blowy but look would you say that even as a bikini competitor or even as a guy that just wants to get Beach lien-tsai alright in his board shorts is it easier and is it healthier to be to be doing this with drugs as opposed to doing it naturally because you're still going to be seeing these um negative or health effects when you diet so severely well I hate to answer a question like that because it sounds like you're giving people a free pass to take drugs with impunity and that is not accurate it doesn't exist everything you do to yourself whether it be natural or drug-induced has consequences what I could say it this way I think with fair safety I could say this I would not put myself under said stresses at any point in my life without drugs I personally would not do that from a physical emotional and you'll result driven mindset I would would never embark on such a thing without drugs I agree with you 100% this female in particular that I had a conversation with and even though its bikini but let's talk about the environment she still stopped her menses or stopped getting her menses a month out which is a indication that this you're not so natural or not you know the healthier healthiest thing to follow so if they're not getting their menses they're obviously getting lean enough for this to be a problem and therefore it could be suggested that even bikini competitors or recreational guys that are looking to get into Beach shape it's probably a good idea that you know you want to rock up on the beach as a bloke and still have a sex drive and be energetic and for girls you know running into a bikini show you want to rock up on stage not feeling like total [ __ ] so that these drugs are suggested even for them I tend to agree I would I would agree and like I said this is purely from a hypothetical theoretical point of view because like you said I know nothing about bikini whatever's like you know not only do I not even know about it from a you know professional coaching point of view I don't even know anything about it in terms of like appeal because it just doesn't appeal right now but I mean at the end of the day that's their goal and I don't think that we should will you agree with me anyway but I don't think we should draw a line in the sand of who should use drugs and who doesn't just because that person's goal is harder I mean essentially at the end of the day being an open class bodybuilder or a female bodybuilder that's way harder but that doesn't mean that a guy that wants to look good for the beach shouldn't use drugs just because serious competitive athlete right yeah again you're you're kind of blending in meals skirting the world of morals and ethics and I don't like I just don't have those I don't know how to have that conversation I'm just not qualified I mean I look at drug use in a very therapeutic mindset what does the drug do do you or do you not need that action if you do [ __ ] take it if you don't [ __ ] let it lay that's that's how I view that like you don't mean like penicillin is the literal single savior of humanity without penicillin the modern world would not exist it's the greatest drug ever discovered but if you don't have an infection it's [ __ ] useless okay it's that simple so it just comes down to do you need it take it do you not need it pass until next time that's it that's how my mind works it's a binary I don't have shades of morality I just don't know how you also have these cost to benefit mindset right so these bikini girls or these getting it right for the beach guys they're cost the benefit is in the sense that they obviously need less drugs and therefore probably less ill health effects to get to their goal exactly exactly 100% as you know their their overall that goals are smaller therefore they're an overall net risk is much smaller so the cost of benefit ratio is probably very very similar if superior for that you see how I'm charming you here with the bikini recommendations do you see where I'm going with this I feel like there's a setup but I'm not sure it's gonna worry look let's say there was a chick she wanted to prepare for a competition but she wanted to get there in the healthiest way possible of the way that motive most comfortable what kind of drugs would you suggest for these girls that want to remain feminine would you just cut out anabolic steroids altogether or would you add something like anavar that has a lesser androgenic fact per given milligram well actually you bring up a very solid point and it is one that I make probably in an entirely different context but women are a very special case in that unlike men they have very low native androgen levels so it does not take an enormous stimulus to generate anabolic signaling meaning women can get well and true real anabolic like actions out of things like clenbuterol potentially thyroid drugs certainly growth hormone certainly insulin possibly even metformin so there are a lot of non sex hormone modalities that could exacerbate muscle mass by a kilogram or two which if you're really well and truly that low on the tier of need could be sufficient in its own right so there are modalities to exaggerate muscle mass without going the full route of anabolic steroids so that's not that's an important concept both for those wee little bikini type people and potentially for other athletes that need to bridge periods where they cannot use anabolic steroids for masculinization concerns so all of those drugs then fit in that bridge window come off of the antibiotics introduce insulin metformin growth hormone clenbuterol etc get as much as one can out of that stretch that period out then come back with antibiotics again at a later date preserving homeostasis a clean mass body weights that's certainly a modality but I think what you're really trying to tease out is one of the non masculinizing antibiotics that women can take and you threw out anavar which is kind of the knee jerk reflexive go to it's a good choice but it's actually not the best choice it's in my opinion in my opinion it's actually the third choice the first choice is actually nandrolone no kidding probably via probably yes probably via something like NP P and an Angelo and phenol propionate and the reason and I historically don't go for short-acting esters but in this case I do because with women the major thing you want to control is duration of use so you want to be able to get them on the drug get em did the actions and then get them off of the drug so a shorter acting ester is a better choice and nandrolone again people need a little bit of a history lesson here we're did and I'm being facetious I'm guessing you don't know the answer to this but we're Dan and rone come from Dino path nandrolone was first discovered in the urine of pregnant women yeah right yes when women again going back to embryology and gestation women unlike men can change ridiculously in the course of one year if a female gets pregnant their body weight can go up you know 20 kilos in four months five months it's an enormous change and to help power and cancel out that radical change they need anabolic signaling however if they use the standard antibiotics signaling say in men testosterone would skew the skew the reality ie the forefinger did you know ratio we talked about earlier and all that stuff so when women get pregnant instead of expressing additional testosterone they actually have an enzymatic quirk that makes them generate 19 nor testosterone which is a much less masculinizing component of testosterone that's non-interference in the incubation of the child so what anabolics could have masculinized women the least the one they [ __ ] invented wow this how did I not know this honestly you got to remember too I sit here night and day you know poring through books this is what I I mean I'm not being a dick but this is both what I do for a living and pretty much the only reason I'm alive so I happened a little broader width of knowledge because you know you go out and [ __ ] talk to people and you make friends and [ __ ] I don't I say what my nose I mean ever released that information to the public before I'm sure you have it yeah I think so yeah I think so yeah well I mean keep in mind it's not my it's not like a secret or anything it's it's legitimate information it's yeah it's available out there somewhere okay so these women are probably going to benefit from something that they make themselves which sounds pretty obvious 19 great testosterone which is yes the compound name for nandrolone aka Decker you want them to take a short accurate version of it in case of you know chronic youth actually you know elevating androgen levels to a point where you know they see site exactly so right okay I'm just let me just backtrack for a moment here let's talk about the chemical structure and therefore the behavior of nandrolone I did not know that on paper less anabolic to androgenic rating that nandrolone milligram four milligram with less antigenic banana-bot yes it is and well see and actually you got a there's a problem there the anabolic androgenic ratios are set up in terms of fractions testosterone is 102 104 is oh I don't remember the number but it's it's a hundred and twenty five to thirty or something like that that somebody should look it up because I'm sure that's not exactly accurate but it's it's something like that now 19 nor testosterone is something like 300 to 80 so technically it's more masculinizing but it's more than twice as anabolic so if you scale the dosages to get the same anabolic component now it is less mass than [ __ ] make sense do you yes do you see it's a candidates that whole [ __ ] learn in fractions in the fifth grade you're like I hate these things well there's a reason why we hate them because they're [ __ ] complicated but if you arrange the fractions in such a way that they're actually equated nineteen or testosterone is a superior tool this is very important to bring up because I try and tell females they state they think that taking an OVA will not cause these masculinizing issues and I say hold on remember this quote the danger is in the dose the effect is in the dose when you take a high enough dose of anniver you're gonna get the same side effects as taking testosterone testosterone absolutely so you're telling me here is that you can take a micro dose of nandrolone phenol appropriate propionate which is MPP this the shorter acting version of the edge alone and not receive these masculinizing effects but see better muscle building effects then on about 100 percent for instance you get these women that take say 20 milligrams or a day okay it's 20 milligrams ooh it's only 20 milligrams but over the course of seven days you know two times seven they're taking 140 milligrams total weekly those same women could take 25 milligrams of npp twice a week get the same or better results they're exposing themselves to less than half the amount of drug low overdose so I want to repeat that for the audience just just we had some connectivity issues there when there's important information I might repeat it so what Broderick says was that a typical dose for females and preparing for a bikini competition - this is a typical dose 20 milligrams per day of anniver but let's talk about it weekly here 20 milligrams times 7 days is a hundred and forty milligrams of anavar per week as opposed to nandrolone even on the scale it is more angiogenic you only would require 25 milligrams of nandrolone twice per week a total of 50 milligrams per week to see the same muscle building effects if not better than that 140 milligram dose of anavar per week correct absolutely that is okay and I see it in clients and people literally every day it's completely completely the case it could be fair to say then for this bikini competitor that you do not want to advise on even though you seem to know that you could that a dose a starting dose at least of 25 milligrams of MPP twice per week is a good place to start absolutely and I would make the escalations very very modest for instance you know 25 a week for a number of weeks and maybe 30 you know twice a week for a number of weeks maybe you know if they're crazy and are training like a demon maybe top it out at 35 milligrams twice a week and you're still only at 70 weekly milligrams which is 50 full 50 percent of what they would be with anavar and you're still getting equal or better results isn't that amazing for for anyone listening a typical dose of MPP for a male would be 350 to 400 milligrams per week as a starting toys right not only are you right but you're actually more right than even you think because I can I point this out over and over people lack fundamental perspective again I'm gonna go by way of quizzing you just because I'm a dick how much testosterone does a male make what's that what's that number seven to eleven milligrams per day or something yep we can round it we can reasonably round it at you know 10 ish milligrams per day so let's say you're just your alpha you're crazy that's a hundred milligrams a week max that's absolute top-end max 18 year old hi to your life you know [ __ ] [ __ ] of the walk that's 100 milligrams a week now how much testosterone does a teenage girl make it's about a tenth about one milligram per day making ten total milligrams per week now here's what I'm pointing out is if one per week is normal and these women are taking 20 of anavar they're literally at 20 times normal now if for a male 10 is normal 15 maybe and they're at you know divided 400 by seven the women are actually taking more than a man they just don't realize it more in proportion but on that topic let's get a little bit more specific does 20 milligrams of enema equate though to that endogenous milligram of testosterone or is it more or less what happens after antivirus metabolized you know via the the pathways what actually happens as far as your available active androgens from that milligram dose is it the same though surely not wow you you've actually asked a [ __ ] enormous Lee complicated question I don't know how much answer you want but anavar itself is obviously anabolic it thus tainot the oxandrolone molecule binds to the androgen receptor sends via cyclic A&P a message to the nucleus that causes all sorts of genomic expression protein enzymes across the board yes now that eventually that anavar pops out of the receptor moves into the bloodstream probably stumbles into another receptor causes the whole thing again eventually it circles around to the liver the liver disassociates it but tab eliza's it okay the catch is the metabolization is basic like taking a word in Scrabble and breaking apart into just bunches random bunches of letters most of those random bunches of letters are just waste products they don't mean anything just gibberish but sometimes it breaks apart and then a smaller word forms out of the bigger one you know you break apart you know whatever I don't know be a big complicated word and it just so happens that the middle bit still a recognizable word well that happens in the case of anabolic steroids and that recognizable word is what's called a downstream metabolite and many drugs and of our being one of them the downstream metabolite albeit there's less of it is actually more anabolic at its own right the what is it the eleven hydroxy Sten eleven hydroxy Stan own I believe is the the Batali that metabolite then has its own anabolic action that circulates through the bloodstream and does a whole bunch of [ __ ] and gets broken down into something smaller and so on and so on many of the steroids we know and love drugs like boldenone DHB were actually identified by virtue of that same thing if you feed enough testosterone to an animal you'll actually eventually recognize these downstream metabolites and then it's just a matter of isolating them and synthesizing them in the lab Wow okay I'm I'm forever learning and a lot of these stuff I mean it makes sense to me I know a lot of the lay audience will probably not understand that and I just did I don't know how but I think after talking to you for a bit I understand it's just it's fascinating anyway we'll we'll go back to what we were talking about we're already at the 90 minute mark this is this is how many podcasts we need to do with you I see because there's so much gold that I mean you are you aware that how many podcasts we need in order to get this out like we didn't even touch on the prep we would just kind of talk and [ __ ] for for 90 minutes broad-stroke yeah yeah just broad strokes yep that's it we weren't talking [ __ ] there was a lot of gold in it and six 16 weeks less food more rugs very straightforward okay well look I mean we're at the 90 minute mark and I want to be respectful of your time and also for the audience because I think 90 minutes is a good time to talk about a pod cut talk on a podcast well I'll do it again because we haven't even just it's just to say it just means you need to have me back we'll do it again right I think we can do 10 plus parts and it's going to be you know there for eternity for the audience listening that really enjoy these podcasts whether you're listening to my humble channel which is unlikely because no one knows about it unless I tell them about it or you're listening to this content on Broderick Spade section is that where you're uploading these we rolled yeah that's it yes loaded there okay which is good and I'm honored that I could be a part of your your page section we'll end it there it's huge let's sorry yeah it's it's no I I try to get in front of the camera and I try to you know record content but it's much easier when somebody's asking me questions that I'm not entirely prepared for and I have to think and work and it actually works out really well um you know and you're obviously you're interested in it if this good actually makes me better so well I think I appreciate this as much as you do I am you said because we had some connectivity issues there I'm not sure what's happening this time as opposed to last time maybe will will stress test out on the next one because I think the the quality of this recording definitely won't be as good as our last ones but yeah I agree when it's it's much harder doing a solo cast and having to kind of rehearse what you're going to say as opposed to someone who's really nosy like me who will get the best area yeah yeah it works it's definitely a good good deal yeah awesome okay Broderick I will contact you again for the next one and go through the same processes as always we will chat then excellent you", "9SKrai-jQeY": "hi everyone welcome to the September headset data analytics webinar I see that people are starting to virtually file into the room I'll be back with you in one minute to give up another one-minute warning and we'll jump in and get started hi everyone welcome again to the headset edibles and beverage market insights webinar C people are still filing into the room we will get started in about one minute hi everyone I'm Steve from the customer success team here at headset it's my pleasure to welcome you to another in our series of webinars about the adult use cannabis industry today's topic is a yummy one will be discussing discussing beverages and edibles and we'll jump in shortly please be reminded to post your questions in the questions section in the zoom and we'll handle as many as we can at the end and first of all just a little bit about headset our mission here is to help businesses easily understand the cannabis industry through data analytics and market intelligence enabling them to make better informed decisions unlocking success and pushing the industry forward and whether you are retailer trying to eliminate guesswork about inventory or a vendor trying to avoid stock outs and streamline distribution or a business trying to understand trends and opportunities the headset team will be there to assist you and here to assist me today and our presentation is my colleague and mentor and all things data Liz Conners welcome Liz thanks for having me Steve tell me one thing about how you're accomplished in French pastry yeah well I was a pastry school a few years ago not really related to analytics but just so that I could bake for co-workers to get more favors though I did spectacular leaf flop a cake today so not not bring it in well they're over there why don't you jump in and take it away I know you've got a lot to cover yeah absolutely so hi everybody I'm happy to be here today like Steve said I'm our director of analytics here at headset and today I'm going to take you through what is mostly an audible and beverage webinar we've done to market reports we did one back in August where we focused on the beverages market and we did one that was released I think it was just this week maybe last week sees on the edibles market it's very fresh yeah absolutely just like out and you know you like your animals super fresh for sure so that's the freshness of the reports but so we're going to examine some of the insights from those but actually did quite a bit deeper and see if we can get an idea of the landscape of both of these markets but before we do that a lot of people in these webinars are sometimes new to the cannabis market entirely they don't know much about the market or what data we're looking at so first I'm just going to go through the total market size in some of the adult u states and we're going to have a brief Canadian interlude where we talk just a bit about Canada not a lot just a little bit just enough to whet your appetite for the edibles have I used too many audible puns already no keep going excellent all right so without further ado let's look at some of had such insights market data with just a little bit of adieu first let me tell you about the data that we have here at headset so I want to give everyone an introduction to how we collect our data our insights data is transactional data it is not from survey it comes from point-of-sale systems from consumers when they make purchases at the register our insights data product offers market level trends to help businesses better understand the competitive landscape of a recreational cannabis market insight specifically focuses on helping business businesses make data-driven decisions related to product innovation pricing and demand planning to create our insights market data we start with data collected from our participating retailers point-of-sale system currently there are over 700 retailers connected to the headset retailer platform and that number grows every day it has set we protect the privacy of our retailers and our first step to do that is we aggregate anonymized and normalize the data of our retailers only retailers have access to their own data via the retailer platform the rest of the data it goes through an anonymizing process from their machine learning algorithm step in to help us normalize the disparate products in each retailers catalog as you know Steve there's no UPC's right now in cannabis so it can be very difficult to relate products to one another our first step is to have robots help us in that process go robot excellent yeah so after the robots are done we have some human data entry specialists that go through and categorize the product and assign metadata including the product traits these are things like what segments perhaps it's the amount of milligrams at each seeing the product perhaps it's the strain of the marijuana that's in the product so they assign a lot of product data for us finally we take all of that data and we cleanse it to reduce noise and skew this involves a lot of inferential statistics which I can't see people in person but I imagine their eyes would glaze over so I go to much deeper than that all all I'll say is those methods their help to take our sample and forecast it out to the total population and finally we take those sales and put them in our insights platform so that people can take that information and make business decisions just like the ones we're going to look at today alright so before we get started let's look at the total adult use market in a few of the adult you States this isn't all of them but some of the larger one so they're in the last we see California which is the largest market coming in it at over 200 million dollars for the month of August these numbers that you're looking at are for the month of August and less noted down there at the bottom of my footnote for Washington just under a hundred million dollars Nevada is about half that five at sixty million so Washington about half the size of California Nevada about half the size of Washington and finally Colorado is coming in order around 130 million these states are are for inside states you know the ones we're primarily going to look at today but I do want to call out that there is the Oregon market which is about 60 million dollars of adult use sales and Massachusetts which is growing and I think in June I believe both organ and Massachusetts and Canada here Jim numbers they were about 45 million dollars of sales and finally I have some Canadian information in here so the Canadian market is for all of Canada was it about 60 million dollars that's been converted to USD in July so still small but definitely growing let's dive in and look at these four insight states a little bit more so here what we're looking at is August sales year-over-year so this year like I said August rang in for these four states at just over a half billion dollars for the month compared to last year that is about 34 percent year-over-year growth so it's still a very healthy market growth there Oh prior year 2017 or 2018 there was even more growth but a lot of that was the California market coming into play the California legalized adult use in the beginning of 2018 when we look at that growth from 2018 to 2019 what's remarkable to me about that Steve is the fact that that came without the addition of a new state when we're looking at just this data so that 34 percent growth is organic growth within the state now let's quickly look at Canada for those of you that didn't pay attention in your Canadian geography classes there are 12 provinces in Canada the largest of which is Ontario which contains Toronto the second largest is Quebec as alluded to by population size that our largest they are also the two by cannabis sales that are the largest as well so you can see those down there at the bottom for all of Canada in June of 2019 sales ring in at 91 million dollars that is Canadian so if we convert that to us to compare for us market size that's about 70 million I want to specifically call out Alberta there though Alberta had about 18 million dollars in sales in June Alberta is one of the provinces that is the only province in Canada that we offer insights in Steve so we have the four states from the US California Colorado Washington and Nevada but we now also have Canadian insights starting with the province of Alberta that's relatively new I think we launched that within the last month or so they're still super new insights but I wanted to point them out so as we think about Canada let's look at some of the month over month growth so when we compare the month of June to the month of May we see that in total Canada grew about 6% with Quebec and Ontario taking a little bit faster than average growth rate and Alberta's in there right around 5% what I want to point out about these numbers is these are month over month growth numbers so if we took that number and forecasted it out to be what would the year growth be we would see sales almost double within a year if that growth rate continued so it's growing a lot faster even than our US States for sure we hear a headset are really expecting to see Alberta grow over the late summer and early fall because they've been issuing a whole lot of retail license I believe in June there were fewer than 200 retail licenses and as of today 279 has been issued so we'll probably see a lot of retail traction pick up there in the next few months but let's head back to the US everybody grab your passports means back to the US and here in the US for our four inside states what we're looking at is a breakdown of the category sales in August so the first thing I want to point out is the bright green square that is flower sales a headset we take the total sales and break them down by format or category and we have nine major categories flower is the largest category though I do want to note that flower has lost its majority market share so Steve flower is ringing in now at only like 43 percent I think of total sales down from well over 50% just a year or two ago paper/pencil in our next largest segment and that is a little bit more than half the size of flower and surround our are in Haleyville segments we also have concentrates and pre-rolls so you can see concentrates there in a navy blue at about 38 million and pre-rolls just a bit larger than concentrates at 45 but today what we're going to focus on instead of the inhalable is the non inhalable so non inhalable czar seventeen percent of the total market with the largest category being edible coming in at sixty million dollars last month we also see tinctures and sublinguals topicals beverages and capsules that's what makes up our non inhalable market today we're going to focus just on the edibles and beverages so these were 65 million dollars of sales in August annualized Steve that would be just over three quarters of a billion dollars in those four states alone those four states wouldn't just edibles and beverages mm-hmm yeah sixty-five million a month works out to just just over three-quarters of a billion these are very very large markets for sure in fact they make up such a substantial portion that were really excited for when Canada begins allowing these formats in the coming months so right now grab your passport will hop back to Canada yeah absolutely here's the sales mix mal Berta as it stands over the last three months so we see flour being very dominating for sure and pre-rolls taking up out the rest of that space a lot of this is because beverages out of bowls and favorite pens those really large segments that we were looking at before are not yet legal in Canada so they will be soon and so we're really excited to see those come into the pie and make this pie a much bigger piece I would probably have to get a bigger screen for your computers for us to see it alright so now that we talked just a little bit about all of the categories let's go ahead and dive into our edibles and beverages so in the four states that we have insights in in the u.s. like I said we have about 65 million dollars of sales in August this is from a very rapid growth over the last few years the one thing I want to note we see a really big uptick there Steve at the beginning of January 2018 that's the California recreational market coming into play we also see some peaks and valleys here a little bit of that is due to some months having more days than others but a portion of it is due to seasonality in the data both edibles and beverages tend to be a little bit seasonal if we look at this growth what we'll see compared to last year so this do you remember we had beverages coming in at around 5 million dollars that's a 22 percent growth over last year an audible today's 35 percent growth over last year so super quick growth rates there absolutely but as things grow what we wonder is do they grow outside of the rest of the market so our edibles growing faster than everybody else especially those in Haleyville segments remember I said flower was losing its market share so it must be going to someone so if we go and look at market share what we see is the edibles increase their market share since 2017 so in 2017 in July a table for making up about nine point four percent of the market today that stands at just under 11 percent so because that market share increased what we know is that edibles are growing faster than other categories beverages are relatively flat we see about a 1% 1.1 percent market share in July of 2017 over to 1% today so we're going to dig into that trend a little bit more and diagnose it it sounds like all the sales are flat that's maybe not that great of a thing but when we look at it we'll actually see some healthy growth underneath that market share change it also sounds like a pun if you say it does yeah yeah beverages are flat no one likes flat beverages I'm gonna try to make them not flat here in a bit okay so if we go through and look at market share remember just a while ago we talked about the non inhalable products they were about 17% of the market in both July and August of this year but they were comprised of five categories so when we think about the categories we're talking about today of those non inhalable products these two categories make up between two-thirds and three-quarters of that marketplace it does vary a bit by state with California having a slightly lesser share to these these two categories a lot of that's because temperatures are quite popular in California and with Colorado Nevada having a bit of a larger market share I do want to point out Washington where we see a bit more beverages than other places and we'll come back to that in a while so let's begin two beverages on their own so we're going to do a set here on beverages and we'll hop over and do a set on edibles and really get an understanding of these markets and what they're made up of so the first thing I want to talk about is the pricing and the market size for that matter so remember I said Colorado had a much bigger portion of their sales going to beverages so does Washington we knew from our very first slide that Washington is about half the size of California in terms of recreational marijuana sales however they actually have more beverage sales in California that was a really interesting finding to me with Colorado having the most sales of all so that really shows you how the difference in market share can play out across the different states the other thing I'd like to talk about here is the average item price so average item price is the average amount you would pay for a given product in the marketplace and while we see that there is some variation with the most expensive beverages being in Nevada and the least expensive being in Washington those are all the blue numbers that you see along the along that graph this actually isn't a lot of price dispersion we use a see prices be very different across the market for beverages we I see them be relatively close to each other this is an interesting finding for me as well these prices are going to raise an eyebrow Liz so we should probably mention taxes and discounts here yeah absolutely so when we talk about prices here at headset we give the price after the discount the discounting is common I personally my favorite is the industry discount but there's a lot of discounting that can take place especially when there are promotional days or we see a lot of discounting on 4/20 for instance Green Wednesday these numbers are after discounts as it relates to taxes these numbers are exclusive of taxes played paid explicitly by the consumer so for instance as always sales tax when you think about the receipt you get when you purchase something you'll see the total amount of the product and then the sales tax will be called out right there in some states I believe Washington is one of them the excise tax was also explicitly paid by the consumer in other states excise taxes paid before it ever gets to the consumer and is built into the prices so that would be common in California I believe and so these prices are should be the prices that the consumer would be expect to be paying before they pay any of the sales taxes thanks yeah worried all right so moving on let's look at that market share remember I saluted the beverages where it had a relatively flat market share but let's break that down by state and see if we can figure out why that trend exists so here what we're looking at is the market share of beverages in 2017 hovering right around one percent in most states in 2018 all states saw increases in market share for beverages and we see the introduction of California with a market share of 0.6 so this is actually one of the reasons we see the market share remaining stable it's growing in states that had had beverages but when California entered the market it was a little bit of a lesser market share and so that's actually what makes the trend look flat because again if we have 2019 here what we see is sort of flat there in Colorado definite growths in Washington a little bit of a contraction in Nevada and some growth in California so really when we break these down by stage is going to get the better idea of how the trends are occurring now that we know a bit about market share what I want to dig into as we're trying to wrap our brain around what cannabis beverages are is what that category is composed of so here it has set we break every category down into segments or subcategories in the beverages category we have four segments I'm sorry a six segments with one of them being others a little bit of a capsule there but primarily we see it being dominated by carbonated beverages so as you're looking at this graph everybody the bar at the very top that's the first quarter of 2018 and we go quarter by quarter until we get down there at the bottom to q3 of 2019 which is a partial quarter but we see carbonated beverages being the leader and kind of retaining that we see drops mixes and elixirs relatively maintaining their market share the one I want to call out is the teal one that is the mocktail segment that's the one that we have really seen a lot of growth in lately and we're going to dig into those just a little bit more and try to understand where it's coming from but just like we did with market share it's always important to look state-by-state when you have these aggregated numbers because what we'll find is the each state is quite different so here what we're looking at is the market share by segments across the state this is what's currently true today in Washington we see about 80% of our beverage sales going to carbonated beverages we're very heavily dominated by carbonated beverages that's very different from Nevada in Nevada the most common beverage segment is iced tea lemonade and fruit imagine up fruit drinks not fruits now I think this makes sense when we stereotypically think about the states there's not a lot of months for us here in Washington to kick back in the sunshine and enjoy those iced teas and lemonade's but in Nevada where it is usually warm usually sunny if perhaps there's a bit more space for that in addition in Nevada we see mocktails being a very important segment it is the second largest tech and again I think this probably plays into a lot of the market in Nevada so a lot of the market Nevada is around Las Vegas and as people come it's a really nice tourist option it looks like something you're used to not everybody wants to purchase in Haleyville to take back to their hotel room nobody wants that smoking fine so those mocktail beverages do seek a bit of growth there colorado is different still here we see that drops mixes elixirs and syrups are the majority of the market this is a lot of this is small packages of dissolvable powders in fact they're mostly unflavored powders that you pour into your own beverage so BYO liquid and then you have that powder of the THC to mix in there and you can mix it into anything you like it also makes the most common flavor in Colorado be unflavored which is interesting to me yeah most common flavor is none and then finally if we looked at California what we see is the carbonated beverages dominate that space but again pretty healthy market share therefore mocktail and the thing to me that stands out a lot about California is the tea coffee and hot cocoa segment which is about a quarter of the market a lot of that is Kiko cookies in that space all right so moving on that's one way that we break down categories here at headset is by segment the other way that we break down categories is by their package size and when we talk about package size here headset what we're talking about is the milligrams of THC in the package not the fluid weight not the ounces we care about the good stuff so what we care about is that THC so here what we're looking at is by state the unit volume by the amount of THC in the package so the first thing I want us all to note is that dark maroon bit of the graph that it looks like it's a majority in every state those are 100 milligram packages so very large package sizes there the next thing I want to point out is that in Nevada we see a whole lot of 0 to 5 milligram package sizes these are more single serve beverages they're things that maybe you'd grab a couple of them at once they're also our Hevy CBD to THC so there's a whole lot of CBD in it just a little bit of THC those are quite common in Nevada as well in Washington we see a lot of 10 milligrams a decent amount of 30 milligram but really again we're still dominated by this 100 milligram packages California again a little bit more dispersed there where we're looking at everything from maybe the smaller single serves all the way up into the big packages and then finally Colorado Colorado has the largest share to these hundred milligram packages and that trends really interested me so what we're going to do for the rest of the section on beverages is dig into the 100 milligram package size in Colorado I was just interested are people in Colorado do they have really high tolerance is that what it is or could it be something else going on you said Mountain there it is yes yeah really increases your your tolerance to THC I don't know that that's true please don't use that you won't have a good time but let's dig into that and see what those are composed of so what you're looking at here is a landscape a product landscape chart on the Left we have the milligrams of THC in the product so that's that y-axis there at the bottom or on the x-axis we have the segment's and then the chart is populated with the total unit sales in the last 90 days and it's colored by the amount of unit sales so it's kind of like a heat map the first thing I want to point out is anywhere that you see white or no number no beverage no beverages exist in that space so for instance there are no iced tea lemonade and fruit drinks in the 0 to 5 milligram segment in Colorado at least the vanilla so what I want to point out is the biggest thing remember we're talking about these 100 milligram package sizes that's very dominated by the drop makes those elixirs and syrups and actually what that is is a whole lot of hundred milligram packages that have either 10 or 20 individual serve powders to mix into your drinks the other thing that we noticed was really large in Colorado was the 10 milligram segment and here that's primarily dominated by carbonated drinks these are sodas with with 10 milligrams in them so those are kind of the big players we also have in ice tea lemonade and fruit drinks a lot of 200 packages but anytime you're looking at the landscape to me what I always wonder is this is what's true today but what was true before and I think that's one of the places where there's a lot of opportunity to really understand how the markets are shifting these markets shift very fast sometimes you can see big shifts with it within even a 30 or 60 day date range so I'm going to compare it to last year because there have been some very major shifts since last year so to do that same graph there on the left is the graph you were just looking at so that's this year and then we're looking at the same time period last year they're on the right still in Colorado still in Colorado yep still in beverages and what I want to do is point out how different things are so transformation Tuesday here on mocktails for sure there were very little of them last year absolutely not a lot but this year what we see is those are really coming into play so we see a lot of small package sizes there Steve up at the top you see 3,600 units sold in that 0 to 5 milligrams I there's also some in that 100 milligram segment but this is one where this is a segment that's growing quick and we can see sort of what types of beverages are making up that space as we try to decide whether that's an opportunity for us to do some product innervation not you and me us our customers up or whether it's the face that we should be concerned about the hard thing that caught my eyes straight away was that last year the most common type of beverage you would purchase at a unit level is a 10 milligram carbonated beverage this year it is a 100 milligram it's actually a hundred milligrams drops mixers elixirs and syrups so the most common segment has shifted that's always something to keep an eye on when we see someone kind of fall from the top and someone new come in and take their place the other thing I want to point out is that last year in this drops mixes and elixirs and syrup segments that really weren't very many units sold in the 10 milligram package size with this year we see about 7,000 units that's a 7x growth over last year no again another trying to keep an eye on I would really want to look at this next month and see if that continues to grow so that I understand that segment also I don't think I have it highlighted but just above that in the drops mixes and elixirs we see the 0 to 5 milligram last year at 10,000 units up to 25,000 this year so again here we're looking at some really rapid growth two and a half times growth over a year these are some places that I would be keeping an eye on if this is the space that I was either in or thinking about being in the other way that I would look at this graph is if I were a retailer it's important for me to watch this data over time and make sure I have the right stuff in the back if I was using just things that I learned about last year even a few months ago I might go really heavy into for instance those 10 milligram carbonated while they still are a really common segment I think I would want to make sure that I'm really covering these drops mixes elixirs and syrups as well because it seems like something that consumers like alright that concludes our beverages section so now we're going to move on into edibles and do a similar exercise so inaudible let's start about looking at the total market so remember I think we saw that edibles were about 60 million this month in a 90 day time frame that works out so you know around 180 million dollars before remember Washington and Colorado has the largest sales now we see California that's what we would expect California's about twice the size of other states but Steve that teal bar there in California is not quite twice the size of it is that it is in Colorado and maybe even Washington there's a little bit lesser than inaudible space so something to think about the other thing I pointed out when we were talking about beverages was that the prices were relatively close together across the state here we see a very big difference in price with prices in Nevada being over $20 and here in Washington our average edible cost under 14 so good for us here in Washington with our not too expensive edibles so let's dive in again and see what it's made up of oh I'm sorry first let's see how it's growing oh my gosh Steve I almost got ahead of myself there I'm just so excited about edibles don't get ahead of the growth yeah no we got to talk about this growth because it's great growth so if we look we see that Colorado has the largest market share there edibles this is in 2017 if we add 2018 everybody saw increasing audible sales and California entered the market again pretty strong with 13% there California has had a bit of a decline this year but everybody else again we see market share gains in edibles what that means is the added the edibles category is growing faster than the other categories around it at least the average category now we can look and see what it's composed of just a few more segments here inaudible there are in in beverages for sure I'm only going to call out the big ones there are some smaller ones in here that I'm not going to focus on today things like savory edibles or cooking ingredients but our big ones the first that I notice is of course gummy and remember we'll read this graph the same way we read the beverages one so that bar up at the top that's the first quarter of 2018 and it goes quarter by quarter all the way down to the third quarter of 2019 so what we see with that blue bar there in the middle is that gummies have really increased their market share throughout this time I don't think that caught my eye was that chocolate market share was declining I'm not actually going to dig into that today but that would be something really interesting to look into to see if we could figure out why gummies are growing so much faster than chocolate sniff there's anything there I do believe that in gummy as we see a lot of CBD and THC combined products and in chocolates it seems to be a bit more teach be or CBD so perhaps that's a bit of it if I could jump in I just want to have you distinguish chocolate from cookies because the colors are real similar there can you comment on that oh absolutely yeah so chocolates are the teal color so those are ranging between about 30% back in 2018 to 17% today and then cookies are that greener color sort of there between the chocolates and the gummy again a bit of a decline there from about seven and a half percent a little over a year and a half ago to about 5% today cool now let's look again at how the states are different remember our stickball is really different before here what we see is that three of our state relatively similar in Washington is the odd duck so in our three states that do look similar we see that gummies are a really substantial portion of the market one of the reasons that gummies aren't quite so large here in Washington is there was some regulatory stuff with them a few years ago there are a lot more government entering our market now I imagine that chair will probably change so for those folks who are not in Washington the regulatory stuff involved making it harder for me to get my gummy open Oh what it was I see yeah you don't want it to be too difficult to open alright so looking at this I think we can kind of get an idea the most of states are similar the only other thing I wanted to call out is that chocolates are less common in Nevada than they are other places and that California is starting to see some mints so the very dark purple maroon bar up at the top in Washington it's nine point two seven percent of our sales go to mints in California that's six percent so those two states do see mints come into play though not as much in other states so next remember we looked at things by the segment they belong to and now we'll look at them by the size they are so here we see a space is very dominated by 100 milligram packages so in beverages they were most common they were a decent port of them a portion of the market but it was about half maybe even laughs here in edibles we see about two thirds all the way up to 84% there in Nevada of the total units sold are going to be 200 milligrams packages so the only other thing to note maybe their Washington is this really big group of 10 milligrams we don't see maybe quite that large of a group anywhere else in California at California has a whole lot of colors there right so maybe a lot more choice options in California but since this market is pretty dominated by 100 milligram pack rather than me investigating the landscape where we're looking at this segment and the package size what I'd like to do is think of a third way to investigate these categories and that would be by the price since we saw the prices were cheapest in Washington I mean go ahead and I'm going to investigate that and see what that could mean so first before we do that what I want to make sure because I'm going to do it by segment is that all of the segments are dominated by 100 milligram packages and that is the case so we see in Washington not of those five large segments any one of them all on the staff you wouldn't be able to read it for sure but other than most larger segments what we see is they are all dominated by one hundred milligram packs perhaps a little bit of an anomaly there in mints with a lot of 20 milligram packages but for the most part we're seeing the bulk of the sales coming from 100 milligrams so we are going to continue to dive in 200 milligrams we're going to stay right in there 900 milligram so first let's look at the prices remember we had just the average prices of everything together and now we're looking at it by a category so we see that gummies caramels chews and Taffy's and chocolates all right they're together maybe 15 16 dollars whereas candies maybe something a little bit cheaper but the average price call before I do this one I'm going to go back sorry to spoil her that for you guys the average price isn't always the best way to look at stuff and so what I want to do is break it down by price bucket and the reason I want to do that is just to give a very easy example is let's imagine a segment that has only two products than it sees a product that costs $10 and a product that cost $40 so the average price of those two products would be $25 but $25 doesn't tell us anything about how that segment actually looks so what I want to do is investigate these segments a little bit more what I want you to remember is when we were looking at average price gummy caramel shoes and cafes and chocolates all looked really similar when we look at it by price bucket they actually look kind of different so while the most common price range in caramel shoes and Taffy's chocolates and gummies which are these three bars in the center of this graph the most common package headed average item price between $14 and 16 dollars that's a teal color they're in the middle however in gummies we see about 50% of units going to products price at 16 to 18 dollars these distributions are really different from each other so while the average item prices were relatively close what we see is in chocolates there are a lot more that are on both ends so we see a lot of higher priced item greater than $20 that's the navy blue at the end that's 15% of chocolates versus things that are under $12 that'd be the purple in the red there on the left is another 15% of the market so chocolates have a lot of expensive products and a lot of cheap products whereas gummies have mostly products all in the middle so one of the reasons that when we compare prices across categories we want to make sure that we're not just looking into averages but the way to the price breaks down the other thing I want to call out is that candies remember we did see a slightly lower average item price for that those are very dominated by products that cost between ten and twelve dollars and then mints are very dominated by products that cost more than $18 so over half of the sales 66% of the sales in fact are to products that cost more than $18 so those are the two blue bars the bright blue in the navy blue just like we did for the beverages what I want to do is compare this across time and see if it's different a whole lot of colors here no need to panic I'm going to highlight the stuff that's important so the thing that I think is most important I'm going to do it segment by segment is that when we're looking at today which is the graph there on the left and we're looking at a year ago just the graph there on the right today we see that a lot of the sales are dominated in this candy segment by that 10 to 12 dollar range is what we saw that was fewer before we saw more expensive candies in the marketplace before about a year ago the same is going to be true there in caramel shoes and Cathy's so here when we look at products in the $10 to $16 price bucket that's almost 50% of sales before it was very small we had a lot in the 16 to 18 dollars there 48 percent so again we shifted there to the left so we're shifting to cheaper products if we go to chocolate same thing here if we look at the bright green the bright blue and the dark blue last year we're looking at most of the sales occurring to product over $16 has shifted today we see most of sales happening to products that are under $15 again that's oddest this year on the left and August of 2018 on the right yes it's exactly what you're looking at Facebook similar story same song different chorus here with gummies again this graph is shifting toward cheaper cheaper priced products last year 36 percent of sales were to products that were priced between 18 and 20 dollars that's that bright blue bar there on the right only 10% today though we really see a pretty big shift and then finally our outlier every every statistician really loves an outlier our outlier is mints so if we look at mints the way the market was last year we see that 31 percent of the sales were to 10 to 12 dollar products that's the red bar only 19 percent today in fact if we look at the very expensive products those print over 20 dollars that's about a fifth of the market today or 21% last year was like 15 so while all four of our other segments have started to shift to lower price buckets mints are actually going in the opposite direction and becoming pricier I thought it was a very interesting trend it's definitely something I would want to keep an eye on and see how this is pricing whether I'm a retailer or a manufacturer manufacturers to set their price with the retailer's but retailers to know what consumers are seen on average so we do see mints going up the price but their sales growth seems pretty healthy so I think that that's really about the marketplace so what I would like to do a quick recap for the total market we saw about a half billion dollars of monthly revenue coming from our four state the entire country of Canada sees about 90 million a month right now in Canadian dollars though that is growing faster than the US is growing in fact it's growing at about 6 percent month-over-month which is that rate continues we would expect to be a Canadian market to double by next year Canada was dominated by flowers but I think a lot of us because there are no beverage in the edibles yes yes but hopefully I'll be able to do this again for everybody in the bring up next year and we can look to see what Canadians think about edibles especially because there you saw that our edibles and beverages were dominated by Center milligram packages I believe the limit Canada is only going to be ten milligram we're going to be a really different product landscape there and then finally we looked at the beverages market where we saw it's about one percent of the adult youth market but the assortment is really different by state and then we look into the edibles market which is about ten percent and was dominated by this one hundred milligram packages so the pricing was fairly different so I think the one of the big takeaways for me if I'm in either the beverage or edible space is that perhaps I should be looking for inspiration outside the state them in to see what sorts of things exist in our growing because it could be an opportunity for me to bring something new and interesting to my state and that's really about what I have well that's fantastic Liz so what we're going to do is turn now to some of the questions you all putting through the zoom Q&A section please do continue to put your questions there and as Liz goes to review those I just wanted to call out that we're helping D tonight's all around the country so watch for us in your area and if you don't have a day tonight nearby let us know and we'll get one set up secondly we've got some industry reports available to our subscribers and nonsubscribers there's one on edible solid sales steady growth and then one on beverages is weed the new beer it's a deep dive and then the cannabis infused beverages also produced by liz and her team if you're not a subscriber just go to headset Daioh and scroll all the way to the bottom and you'll see links to recent industry reports there Liz yeah absolutely I have a whole lot of questions popping up if you do have any other ones feel free to submit them here I'm gonna answer as many of them as I can but if we don't answer your questions you can always reach out to us and we can get you answers for those I have a lot of questions about the beverages space so I'm gonna do those first and one of the first questions was do mocktails include cannabis beer and the answer is yes so for those on the phone that aren't from with Kanna beers is what they're usually called it is AD alcoholized beer just been infused with THC CBD or both and those are that we put those in the mocktail segment here as they're definitely a growing segment for sure they do not contain alcohol so it is something that is why we call the mocktails there's no alcohol in them mocktails also includes some faux wine so again at the alkalized wine that's been infused with THC or CBD it also includes we're starting to see a lot of I guess faux alcohols pop up or faux cocktails who we see things like a mojito for instance it'll be in a jar it looks like a liquor jar or like a real fancy bourbon bottle and it may be you know lime and mint flavored like a mojito but instead of alcohol it's infused with THC those using multi serve beverages so it's like a bottle and you would share it among people versus the kin of beers we definitely see those be single serve I've not seen any like really large can of beers and then the wine again are usually packaged as multi serve we do also see at least one or two cannabis infused champagne I think you have to calm sparkling wines I don't think they're made in France ah alright so I just wanted to point out something that someone brought up one of the people on the line brought up it in Nevada there's a big presence for to root in low potency levels so for anybody not familiar with to roots it is a can of beer company I think they do like an IPA and lager maybe you're an ale they might even actually I think they have a handful of product and those are they're packaged in I think twelve ounce packages and again low potency levels we're talking two three five milligrams so you kind of consume those more like beers right maybe even someone is a short as me can maybe even have oh god maybe even three of those about how many beers I can have two they really dose was out right didn't they alright so continuing along our beverages question another question I had is is the cost of beverage for single serves or multi packs the answer is both so the way we think about the way when we're looking at those cost me think about package size we're actually really just thinking about the amount of PHC in it I think it is probably safe to assume that for most users the hundred milligram packages will be multisearch maybe save for a handful of enthusiasts their high enthusiasts who I got a pun in their volumes absolutely yeah so but other than that I think when we're seeing the hundred milligram so they're generally going to be multi served and those lower milligrams are going to be single serve I've got a question in which category are shots I've not seen shots like a buttery crown or whether I don't know kamikaze but it could be in mocktails if it's faking a or not faking if it is a faux alcohol drinks like a lemon drop or something like that if you mean energy shots those would be in other I believe depends how they're packaged some companies are packaging their energy shots actually as tinctures and those going to temperature spec category so really just a pen that's a new question for me I never thought of workshops for alright so I had another question what about the lounges for cannabis edibles this was posted by an anonymous attendee and I assume it's anonymous because I'm not yet aware of many places where it's legal to have a consumption lounge there are a handful of cities and a handful of I think that San Francisco now those event venues where you can consume on premise but we really don't see a lot of on-premise sales just yet for either beverages or edibles if beverages are we're out of out of bowls were sold at a legal adult youth retail establishment as part of an event or they had that license then it would likely be trapped in our data but definitely for the most part that consumption lunges I've run across might still be a bit gray market which we don't cover I was asked if will offer a series on CBD either edibles or beverages and I'm happy to report that we already did so our last webinar covered CBD and we basically we looked a bit in the topicals a bit into edibles but all of our data at nights right now are covering cvd edibles and beverages so we're doing those we've done them in Washington we did one in San Francisco and in Los Angeles there's one coming up on the 26th I think in Santa Cruz as well on the 26th in Denver I'm sorry in Portland him so the 26th is Santa Cruz in Portland the 10th is Denver so if you're in Denver and you were really excited and thinking oh that's too far away don't worry we're doing it on the 10th in Denver if you're interested in learning more about those webinars you can reach out to sales at headset thought i/o and they get you signed up for sure or if they're not in an area and you want to reach out I believe we have some links to recorded webinars on it as well I had someone on the line ask if we can send out a copy of a deck because lots of people in their org need to see those numbers man that's a great comment I didn't even put that one in myself yes we will send up the deck it will be available I am not 100% it'll be sent out afterward I think to everybody that has RSVP'd looking at my my marketing guy over here to make sure I'm not not making them things up again I had another question if we do reports like this for CBD not only do we do reports which we did do a market report we have hold dashboards that are just focused on products that contain CBD in all five of those non inhalable categories these DVD sales are CVD at recreational dispensaries so it's not the CPD that you see in perhaps places like CVS but it's the CVD containing product in these rep dispensaries so there are a lot of CBD only products and then a lot of products contain some CBD and some THC so they're legally sold in recreational dispensaries and those can't be sold now that places didn't get to attribute gumgum II sales to their potentially containing a lot of simi beyond the get-go yeah absolutely I think that's a big part of it so if you are interested in learning more about CBD or getting insights like this and actually even deeper insights like you can reach out again to sales at headset Daioh and they can set you up with some demos of those dashboards they're really excellent products let's see I had a question about what falls into ingredients in edibles those are usually things like oils and butters so I think there are a handful is like a couple flowers and some some powders that are like a sugar substitute or they might actually be sugar even with some THC in them those are things that you bake with so if you're someone with a degree in French pastry let's say who likes to bake maybe you don't want to buy your cookies you want to bake them for yourself so those would be those types of products that the Baker's buy let me know sorry I'm getting questions as I'm doing this so let me awkwardly read through the question Steve you want to make up some things to talk about real quick while I do that yes please reach out to us at sales at headset dot IO for links to previous recordings especially on the CBD topic happy to share those with you and perhaps we'll do a refresh on that in the very near future to let you know what's going on in the CBD space maybe in Canada or how it's changed a quarter yeah all right before I let Steve make up too much stuff I can get back to the questions now so someone asked if the Canadian sales numbers include exports to other countries they do not so when we're looking at the Canadian sales numbers those would be sales in retail establishments in Canada the top-line numbers that I was giving you the total sales by province those are actually from stat Canada Statistics Canada they publish retail numbers so I'd encourage you to google that I think it's just statistics Canada comma cannabis retail and you can find those numbers yourself the numbers when we're looking at the percentage of the category or the prices or the brands even again that is just sales within the province of Alberta that's insights data and that's data that we sell so if you're interested in learning more about the Canadian province of Alberta and what it's composed of please reach out to us and we can hook you up with insights for not province I believe that is all the questions that have for today I do have a couple of questions about the FDA's position I try not to speak for the government so I don't really know much about the FDA's position on stuff I would encourage you to to reach out to maybe someone in more of a legal legal career path for that sort of thing and then I the last question I had was does my audibles data disregard sales that include CB d like did I evaluate teach the only product and the answer is no I evaluated edible products sold in recreational dispensaries so it could have been THC only it could have been CBD only it could have been a combination of the two and if you're interested in how that breaks down and how it affects growth and prices I'd encourage you to reach out to our sales team and they can demo you those CBD dashboards I think that's all the questions if you think of any later though reach out to us and we're happy to help awesome Liz thank you so much for what has been lavish and and I'm out of gustatory adjectives for now thank you very very much as always it's a lot of fun listening to he will run down the data like you've done here so for everyone out there listening you will have slides in a recording and I don't know can we call you back for an encore or oh man these are my favorite yeah for sure okay so we'll send out notifications as to the the next topic and scheduled date for a webinar and we're very much looking forward to it so for everyone on the call thank you so much for playing and we'll see you on the next one you", "VWQrvIH6540": "hey guys what's going on credit from others easily here I just want to tell you about a new product that we just got in these are from a company called pinnacle they do CBD oils so these are called honey sticks it's basically honey mixed with the CBD oil in it so you can just eat these how they are you just pop the top drink it whatever you want to do it's just honey but basically after about 30 or 40 minutes you'll start to feel the effects of the CBD people use these for pain joint pain stuff like that some people mix them in with their coffee other drinks I wouldn't recommend mixing it in with like water something might taste kind of funky with that honey in it but just to show you that's one of the products that we do have they're $5 apiece or they come in a five pack of all I got three in here because we've sold some of them but if you buy the five pack they're only 20 bucks so you're basically getting one for free if you have any questions about this product feel free to leave them in the comments below we'll be sure to get back to you alright y'all have a great day", "MYD__PVYReA": "good I'll be talking about this topic fungal infections in ICU so this talk I came in Baptist Hospital on 28 August 2019 in their internal medicine CME so the topics I will be covering is background and when you talk about fungal infections in ICU predominantly 80 to 90 percent of them are candid Enya so pretty much I will be covering about Candida Mia in this talk because 10 only 10 to 20 percent or constituted by moles like Aspergillus is one of the commonest was so Candida Mia the topics I'll be covering is epidemiology the modes of spread and epic to study a bit about torn on and weakens we'll talk about Indian data and we'll talk about risk factors for Candida albicans and canden non-africans we'll talk very briefly about antifungal Indian agents because it's extremely important for all the trainings will talk about azoles Pauline second of handit's approach to antifungal treatment and take-home message so when we talk about Candida infections these infections can occur in immunocompetent and in immunosuppressed patients so the epidemiology and risk factors for these can be quite variable and may be different between immunocompetent and even suppressed and as I said invasive per area as per glossies constitutes of around 10 to 20 percent and predominantly these pulmonary aspergillosis occurs in solid organ transplant patients so since my topic is in immunocompetent so we'll talk more about Candida infections and we can send on albicans so as you see this is a study from the Swiss Swiss of land we have have shown that Candida may have forms for predominant fungal infections I see up to 90 percent only 10 to 20 percent is caused by invasive mycosis and even these mycosis predominantly occur in solid organ transplant so what is Candida you presence of Candida species in blood like any other septicemia is called Candida Mia and his Candida Mia important for us to know yes because the mortality is pretty high so these are two studies from us where they are shown mortality up to 57 percent in one study and 34 percent but I have to say in India the mortality at least from some of the studies just come from some of the hospitals has shown much higher water up to 70% so in the most Western studies the mortality Falls around 40 to 45 percent so and if you do not treat this Candida Mia so the mortality can be much higher so this was one study where they showed in 28% who were not treated 63 percent died so the mortality can be up to 70% in someone who is not treated and another important thing for us to remember is it constitutes 5 to 15% of healthcare-associated infections which means it is one of the fourth commonest cause of nosocomial infections so as I've already mentioned so it's it does come within the five normal causes and it's a fourth calmness knows of four million frictions so this is a one of the big study which came in JAMA by Gene Vincent wave they looked at the prevalence rate of Candida me across all the countries and of course all the continents as you see they had Western Europe Eastern Europe Central America North America Oceania Africa and Asia so what the found is the candida Mia prevalence rate somewhere was between 16 to 17 percent as you see most of the of these continents you would see the prevalence rate falling between 15 to around 17 to 18% and Aspergillus you see it is around 1.4 to you know 1% and here as you see in this big study which came across the continent 62% of the formation infections for gram-negative followed by gram-positive and 19% were fungi so they took the median has 19% has a fungi prevalence across the globe so this was again another study which looked into the mortality correlation as you see this was a study from USA and even here you see Candida species accounting for fourth commonest cause around 7.6 percent and the crude mortality was 40% in this study so what is the more substrate I think the modes of spread of Candida Mia predominantly happens with gut translocation because gut tasteful of fungi so when there is a breach of Curtis barrier in a in a very sick patient or where the mucosal integrity may be pre due to various other reasons so Candida Mia can occur I think that is one of the commonest cause of spread of Kennedy Nia so which means any sort of an individual who is quite deconditioned or who is recuperating from infection where the cut because and integrity is lost so there is an endogenous print of Candida from the gut which is the commonest cause of infection the second most common astiz the hands of the healthcare professionals so like any other infection hands of the cornish mode of spread of infection or for mites so any of the contaminated objects in ICU or any of the instruments any of the you know equipments that patient may be connected to if it is they could be contaminated with Candida and that can cause nosocomial infections and the common asides of canada mia most often has been found to be the surgical wounds because any of the surgical wounds and primarily the abdominal surgical wounds become the harboring sites of candida and urine also is one of the commonest cause of getting colonized with Canada and from here they have bloodstream translocation and then lead to Kennedy Nia so that is how the candida albicans look - Mia so this is a very important study which I think most trainees should be aware of a pictu study so this study was done in thousand 265 I see use across 76 countries to look at the prevalence of Candida Candida bloodstream infections so this is one of the landmark studies so they included 14,000 414 patients who had bloodstream infections out of which they saw that 99 patients and can't Adelia so this is the largest global study out of it 69 patients had only Canada man 38 patients had combined Canada and other infections and the prevalence rate was six point nine per thousand patients so for all the trainees if you would want to know the global prevalence of and demian blood bloodstream Candida it is on six point nine four thousand patients and this study also looked into the mortality I think for all the trainees if you want to quote the mortality associated with Candida may as you see the issue mortality here was forty two point six percent as you say it's 42 hospital mortality uh also on forty two point six and if you look at the ICU length of stay what is striking is people with Candida Mia will stay longer in ICU they stayed for the median duration of thirty three days as you see the longer they stay the higher is there is an edema or vice versa can edenia tends to stay longer in icy so let's look into a bit of non albicans so non albicans species also a problematic the commonest ones are tropical is Parab celosia is club rat and you see in india predominantly non albicans that that is prevalent is candida tropicalis and what all of us should be aware is these are dreaded species canada glabrata and canada koozie occur in more immunocompromised patients and they are dreadful as they are resistant to fluconazole so if you are dealing with a immunocompromised where you believe there is a ended up glamour Etna that has been isolated then fluconazole is not that recovering that is something all of us should be aware of so this was another study from USA done in 16 hospitals where they showed 43% were non advocate so predominantly it is Candida albicans but what we need to also remember is significant proportion of them can be known as because in India so I want everyone to remember that it is predominately non albicans and Candida albicans occurs second so I will show some of the data and in this year's study candida glabrata cost 25% of canada mia in LW so indian ee patients after 65 i think twenty five percent of them had kind of glabrata which is resistant to fluconazole so that is what we need to keep in mind that if you're dealing with clabber at or cruzi fluconazole may not be the drug of choice so what we have seen is from 1980s predominance it was tender albicans and 24% was not advocates so as with the passing decades we have seen the transition of hand beacons to non amethyst as you see in mm it is non albicans occurrence rate or the proportion is significantly increased it's almost doubled so what we need to understand is globally there is a shift from albicans to more occurrence of non-africans and in this non albicans this were the commonest ones found in US data glabrata 16% perhaps a loss is 15% tropical is 10 through Z 2 and others 3 so again had to rate rate in India tropicalis is the commonest occurring Candida Mia in icy use ahead of albicans also so what are the important fungal pathogens based on medical literature that are found in India in India albicans is formed like as I've been reiterating and really emphasizing a month known as beacons all these are seen but most communities tropicalis that is see almost Aspergillus you have all these species Aspergillus flavours fumigate Asterius Nigel and nederlands I think in India we commonly see fumigators and Aspergillus Niger I think what I need to sensitize the listeners is to this dreaded species called Canada or is I think there is a re-emergence or we or occurrence of this Candida arrays which is most devastating from that because this is resistant to fluconazole and even to Aquino Indians so I think the only drug that may be more effective is so we have to use combination of the drugs so I think these are becoming inherently resistant to the proposals and aquino canyons i think that is something we need to keep in mind so what about you know the indian data so if you look at the indian data candida tropicalis appears to be the foundation as you see the 38% had candida tropicalis followed by candida albicans followed by guillermo d so in India the data is quite different to the Western data so tropicalis remains the 4 - followed by albicans and Guillermo D but as I said Candida Oris is also becoming a problem so for Canada Horace I think the drug which is currently being used his IV possible nozzle because before it was only available as oral so now it is available as IV it is found to be effective so aureus is something I want everyone to keep an eye on because that is more devastating if it happens in any patient so when you look at this Indian data this Gangaram hospitals of the youngest epi James so Canada Mia the occurrence rate was around 27% albicans when you look at non albicans you see predominantly it is much higher eighty-eight point five percent of this Canada Mia had non albicans he names it was 79 percent and tropicalis as I said was the formalist followed by glabrata and mortality as I said in India and data models if you look at the epic study the mortality was around 42% but if you look at Indian data mortality is much higher 55 name study it or 72.2% and they have in fact shown resistance to even I am focusing in orientation of Medical Sciences so this is our sort of rough indian data that we have so Canada Mia the current rate in Isis are 0.7% and predominantly you see more non albicans in India so now we have finished about you know the occurrence rate or the privileges of Candida and what are the statistics that are prevailing in India about nine ambitions so how do we go about suspecting the patients who may have Candida we have something called Canada colonization index so you calculate with colonization index as number of colonized non-blood sites divided by total number of body sites culture and CCI is Candida colonization index so you calculate by colonization index into number of sites with heavy growth of Candida divided by total number of positives so basically this will help in identifying patients who are at a higher risk of developing Candida based on ascertaining the colonizers that may be present so why is it important because they found that colonization has a significant pathophysiological correlation with occurrence of Canada your active Canada infection identified by pulsed field gel electrophoresis so you have higher colonization index the risk of them having candid images much higher so you may have in the case of high index of suspicion you may have to start therapy where you're polarization index may be a year so I think there is something called Candida score which one could also apply to determine which other patients are at a higher risk of Candida infection and in in this given clinical context where you suspect there is a risk of Candida Mia you could consider starting empirical antifungal therapy pending cultures so Candida score is you give one for TPN one for surgery patients one for multifocal colonization and two for clinical severe sepsis so the cutoff value is two point five so basically you give one score forty pn1 for colonization one for undergoing surgery and two for someone with serious sepsis if your score is more than two point five so then the senseability sensitivity of them possibly having Candida is around eighty one percent specificity is around seventy four percent I think this is a easier tool that one could apply so some of your DP n someone with a candida organization who has undergone surgery too for severe sepsis more than two point five you know they are at a much higher risk of having Candida Mia and you could consider when other tests are coming negative with these patients so the risk factors for Canada may I put in a pictorial format so that all trainees can remember that are around eleven risk factors the highest risk factor is for someone who has CBC so as you see the odds ratio was nine point five so if someone has a CVC the risk of them developing Candida Mia also of them developing is around nine point five their psychiatrist followed by stress ulcer prophylaxis you have an odds ratio of six point four and just the fact that patient remains in ICU for a longer time is one of the risk factor for ICU or someone who has high apaches score or who is very sick he's at a risk of developing Candida Mia now someone who's on a range tube itself can you Chris the odds of them developing Candida Mia the oscillation of 3.7 or inappropriate antibiotic usage increases the risk of Candida Mia or someone who has a bacteria someone who's had abdominal surgery as I said abdominal is a is a good sort of a cultural media for fungal infections anyone who's undergone abdominal surgery laparotomy are at a risk of developing Kennedy yeah now someone with renal failure is at a higher risk of developing Kennedy Mia Riley and automatically so for all the trainees the key thing to remember is someone with a CVC someone who is having stress ulcer prophylaxis and someone who is in ICU for a longer time or inappropriate antibiotic use I think these remain the top five culprits for someone at risk of developing Kennedy Nia so that's why our sensitization must be to reduce our antibiotic usage and moreso mitigate the usage of stress ulcer prophylaxis so what are the risk factors for non applicants so non Ambika is the main risk factor is someone who's had a flu connoisseur exposure so this way we need to temper down or reduce the usage of Luca nozzle because if someone is exposed to fluconazole the risk of them developing non albicans inflation is very high the odds is eleven point six so very high possibility of them developing Nam albicans and someone again who is on a CVC catheter the risk for non albicans almost doubles and someone who's had an aprotic me so the main risk factors the trainees should remember is when the CVC stress ulcer prophylaxis you know appropriate antibiotic usage for someone who's had a abdominal surgery or who's on a laparotomy and longer scale I see I think these remain the sort of the main risk factors one should keep in mind so this is another study from Australian prospective cohort study for three years they looked at 179 Candida Muir as you see in the western setting albicans remains calmness in Australia the second commissioners glabrata followed by crews a and thus constituted 16 but as I had again the emphasis in India it is always candida tropicalis which is published so let's look at the anti-fungal agents so we have three groups of anti-fungal agents as souls Pauline's and canteens azules fluconazole is what we commonly use so the dosage is 12 mg per kg per day which is 800 mg per day on day 1 followed by 400 mg per day 6 mg per kg and Marie Connors own is claimed to be superior to fluconazole and the main reason orokin Azul one could consider is if you are having a suspicion of someone having Cruz ID well Lambretta then obviously we know fluconazole may not be effective so very colossal may have to be considered and it is shown to have low M Isis for horican assume so as I said whose sock on ozone is mainly was available only as oral and it was being used as prophylaxis for graft-versus-host disease stem cell transplant and hematological malignancy but now poster colossal IV is come and for Canada or is it is inherently resistant to fluconazole poster console is something that that is being tried so for Pauline's amphotericin B is the communist and drug that has been available for more than two decades the dosage is 0.5 to 1 mg per kg per day but we need to keep in mind that it has no effect on Canada on Lucy target so liposomal amphotericin B because we know after - simpiy is nephrotoxic so liposomal I have photos in peas is less nephrotoxic so the dosage is 3 to 5 mg per kg so there are other regions I can put Ellison be lipid complex or amphotericin B colloidal dispersions that are available that will be more expensive it you know canons the commonest ones the first one which came was Casper fungus become 17 years at bolus followed by 50 mg once a day when you do no fun game we use as 200 mg bolus followed by hundred mg once daily because fun game uses 1 - t mg 4 or 500 mg once a day so these are some of the Aquino candidates in liver transplant patients there is a preference to use a needle of function as it is found to be less apt or toxic and cash popping gene has been shown to have little effect on liver enzymes worsening so that is something for someone dealing with liver dysfunction to keep in mind so how does this anti-fungal agents work so when you look at the the structure of the Fung cell wall so it has a fungal cell wall here and the cell wall is made up by this beta 1 3 glutens and then you have this cell membrane which is made up of phospholipid bilayer and then you have one this molecule this protein called beta 1 blue con synthase which helps in the synthesis of beta 1 3 blue cons so when you look at when you look at the results so basically all the adults look on ozone they act by inhibiting the synthesis of this your ghosting on see this yellow thing what you see is your ghost at all which is needed for the synthesis of cell membrane so this azoles helps to is inhibits the production of aldosterone which is needed for the production of this cell membrane and polyenes so polyols so basically by inhibiting the synthesis of el kosterow you have from the cell membrane is disrupted and then fungal lysis or killing of fungus happens Pauline's polyols like amphotericin B this violet one what you see is the steroids which maintain the integrity of fungal cell membrane so poly means mind to steroids and then causes disruption of cell membrane and all the aquino contains as I said this big protein what you see is beta 1 3 glucan synthase which helps in the synthesis of this beta 1 3 glucan which maintains the cell wall integrity aquino pendants inhibit this beta 1 3 glucan synthase so what it leads to is the breakage of the cell wall or inhibition of the synthesis of bitumen 3 so that is the mechanism of action so if you want to look at the sites of action so as you see polyenes which I am photo simply acts on the cell membrane aquino can Deen's it inhibits the production of cell wall so it acts on the cell wall so as holes they inhibit the steroid synthesis so act at the cytoplasm and T n + v floor site design acts of the DNA of the nucleus so these are the sites of action of this anti-fungal agents so when we look at the treatment of fungal or candida Mia there are four aspects of treatment so one is prophylactic the second is empirical third is pre-emptive and fourth is targeted therapies so which means when we talk about therapy these are all there is sort of a complex interplay between what we are using so we have to be very clear so when there is absolutely no disease then you are using anti-fungal agents then it is called prophylaxis and this you use in high-risk patients where you assume that they are at a much higher risk of developing from the system in fungal infection of Candida Mia and these high-risk patients may be someone who's had a bone-marrow transplant or whose address fall into organ transplant and pre-emptive is where you have these markers that has come positive and I say markers you can look at Canada colonization index or Canada scope and where Canada colonization index is high or you are Canada score is high but patient is asymptomatic and you sort of make an assumption that they are a much higher risk of developing Canada that's why you start treating them that is pre-emptive empirical is where patient has signs and symptoms he has fever where all your other cultures are coming negative and then you know that Canada score is high and where he is already on antibiotics so you will start empirically considering that he may have Candida Mia the fourth one is targeted therapy target it is where your culture has yielded Candida in the blood and that is easy then you have patients with symptomatic then you would treat so these are the four paradigms of treatment that that our clinician may be involved in so we need to be very clear whether we are prophylaxis or whether we are doing preemptive empirical or targeted therapy so I think in ICU we would dissuade these prophylactic use or even pre-emptive I think in these two situations I think we may be reasonable to consider giving antifungal therapy so approach to antifungal therapy we'll just talk about the broad guidelines the choice of initial agent he is first question one needs to ask is whether this patient has added a zone exposure because if he's had an exposure then what should run in your mind is that this patient is at a higher risk of developing pickles and you have to look at prevalence and susceptibility data and severity of illness someone who has metastatic abscess is like this then you cannot take a risk then you may have to start on a higher antifungal like castle if you know canyons and then maybe deescalate once the speciation is done and you have to look at the Komets I think these are the four elements that one should sort of deliberate upon before embarking on the choice of anti-fungal agents and tolerance so I think this is the rough sort of a guideline someone who has no neutropenia who is hemodynamically stable and who has not had assault prophylaxis the choice of therapy maybe proposal so he has no neutropenia is importantly stable and who is not exposed to zone then your understanding is he will have even if as Canada Mia it will be a sensitive Canada and fluconazole may be the drug of choice someone who has no neutropenia but with severely ill and where you consider that in elderly patients 65 or who's had a solid organ transplant where you suspect them that he may be at increased risk of developing Canada's collaborator whose eye which we know are resistant to fluconazole then the choice of antifungal may be a key no candidates so if you have a patient who is neutropenic and who is at increased risk of Nakano zone resistance because of previous exposure then I think economic and ins and amphotericin B may be the reasonable drug of choice in someone who is neutropenic but he's hemodynamically stable and who's not had an assault prophylaxis still you could consider fluconazole as a first choice so the crux operation is imminently stable no neutropenia then there's no reason to consider starting at once antifungal like if you know and you can still start off fluconazole but if it's neutropenia can anybody can unstable then you may have to consider starting a cure attendance or even if it is neutral penny if is hemodynamically stable no a zone I think you know girls can still be considered once Candida Mia treatment is started I think the duration of therapy is much longer so the suggested duration is or two weeks and the guidelines do suggest daily blood culture in Indian circumstances this may be difficult at least we may have to consider every two to three days blood culture to see clearance of Kennedy Mia and we have to watch for resolution of symptoms and neutropenia and once the speciation is gone once you know the species and sensitivity like any other antibiotic therapy we need to deescalate to look on ozone if it is sensitive if it is Candida cruzeiro glabrata we know they are resistant to fluconazole but from aquino candles you can deescalate to Oricon ozone so now coming to the last slide is Candida Mia so now we have discussed so much about Kennedy Mia is it something in intensive care we should worry about is it a marker of karateka mess because 25% of the patients with Candida Mia can die so the mortality is very high and as I said overall mortality rate is 30 to 80 percent depending on your index of suspicion and initiation of treatment if you are not treated modernity can be up to eighty percent even with treatment I think mortality can be high in Canada vet can be about 30 to 40 percent and patients who have malignancies on the background or who is he might have climb stable mortalities can be somewhere up to 80 percent so it is a reason to be worried in ICU if you are suspecting Canada Mia the first thing that should run in mind is mortality can be up to 70 percent if you not treat appropriately and attributable mortality of Canada Mia is said to be around 38% so the take-home message for all the listeners is candida Mia is the four - fungal infections in ICU in India I have to reemphasize again and again non albicans tropical disease forests in India Candida Oris is emerging to be problematic and this is indirectly resistant results and even to some economic engines so PO so kannas all is claimed to be the drug of choice we need more data to see the occurrence rate of this Oris in India and it's very important to identify risk factors for all the trainees you can remember this picture so CDC constitute the highest risk for Candida Mia followed by stress ulcer prophylaxis especially proton pump inhibitors or Fanta fertilization in ICU increases the risk of candy Mia so that's why we have moved away from routine stress tensor prophylaxis and longer stay nice use increases there or inappropriate antibiotic usage and someone who's undergone laparotomy all these constitutes high odds of them developing Canada Mia and with regards to the choice of treatment if there is no exposure to fluconazole remains mainstay of treatment but when there is neutropenia with exposure to zone ii of Camden's remain the track of choice and please remember Canada Mian is a life-threatening condition and it does lead to increase in mortality so I'll end my talk with this we don't see things as they are we see them as we are so please keep candid email fungal infections in back of your mind because unless we have an index of suspicion we may fail to identify the patients with fungal infections so

presentation is called physical and behavioral problems often seen in autism troubleshooting these issues and then suggestions for intervention this is a presentation that I have done in the past matter of fact many of the presentations that I've done over the past year are actually available on as movie files and you can also access the color slides to each of these presentations at this particular website autism seminars on demand so this particular presentation is actually available through that website if you'd like a copy of the slides or like to get a more high quality movie recording of this particular presentation before we get started let me just give you some some tips here on some educational material that I've used in my practice and I want you to know about two books these are excellent resource books for you to have in your library the one on the left effective biomedical treatments from dr. Pangborn and Baker this is not a book that you would read from cover to cover but an excellent book to look at with respects to questions about supplements you know issues related to behavior testing some of the biochemistry with respects to biomedical intervention and then the book by dr. Shah the biological treatments for autism is PDD this is one of the first books that I read many many years ago this is a newer version both can be you know accessed through Amazon you can get the biological treatments book from dr. Shah through Great Plains this website two really good books to have in your library I also have a number of online resources autism recovery treatment is a blog site a video blog site where I record video transcribe those videos into articles and then placed here on this site this is all free information and then I also have a very interactive parent subscription website where you as a parent where a caregiver of an individual of autism can really reach me 24/7 through this website through an interactive parent forum doesn't matter where you are in the United States I work with people you know and answer questions for people around the world and it's a great place just from the stand point if you have questions when a troubleshoot you know things ideas on testing questions you may have respects to different therapies that's what this particular site is for I also have many of the recorded webinars on this site too as well as the PDF files that can be downloaded of each you know individual presentation and the color slides for future reference I also recently released a book called autism recovery book.com title is autism the road recovery it's an e-book that you can access if you want to learn more about things that I've discussed things that I discuss through this presentation things that could be found through this book at autism recovery book calm and as I mentioned before the autism seminars ondemand.com is where many of these presentations were re-recorded in a movie file that is downloadable as well as the PDF slides and then finally if you want to just get more information about me you can go to dr. Waller com this is sort of my official website it's the hub of the wheel if you will that has links to many of the other different websites that I have online okay so let's go ahead and get started here what we're going to talk about is common issues seen with kids in the spectra I'm going to troubleshoot some of these problems I'll come up with some treatment suggestions that can help overcome some of the behavioral and physical issues it's always important no matter you know what information you get online whether it's from me and other doctor etc is to discuss some of these supplement recommendations so the medication therapies that come forth with your own child's physician really before trying to implement some of the stuff on your own so we're going to go through a number of thing as we'll talk about abdominal bloating an aggression anxiety diarrhea looks like there's some typos on this that I missed irritability tantrums you know regression issues sleep issues and if you've heard this presentation before I'm really gonna just sort of talk about these things in general but then also give specific things that I've seen in my practice some things that I want you to think about instead of trying to read each individual slide to you that gets pretty boring I really just want to have a discussion with you um things that I've experienced in my practice clinically over the years so I want you to walk away from this presentation with some some things in your back pocket that you can think about with respects to your child when you talk about abdominal bloating there are a number of things to consider and and the first thing that I think about clinically in my practice when I have a child come in who is just distended with in the abdominal area first thing I think of is gas and we know that yeast and bacteria can produce gas specifically yeast and we know that yeast and bread is what causes that expansion so one of the differential diagnosis is for distended abdomen would be a ye and overgrowth of yeast constipation can also be a problem in that backup of stool in the lower bowel can cause the bowel to become swollen and that also can lead to a distended abdomen to also constipation can become a breeding ground for yeast so many kids who actually had are constipated will oftentimes have an overgrowth of yeast and bacteria as well sometimes it gets to the point where it's so significant you need to have some Diagnostics done to you know take a look from an abdominal x-ray to see actually how much stool is actually down in the digestive system so descended abdomen certainly constipation yeast and bacteria some kids actually have a deficiency or the inability to make adequate amount of digestive enzymes there's not a specific test that we have for this that is a hundred percent definitive you can do a comprehensive digestive stool analysis Great Planes has a CDSA test that actually looks at elastase levels which is a reflection of pancreas enzyme output but many times just doing a trial of digestive enzymes can be helpful pep desired enzyme prime are two enzymes that I've used quite a bit in my practice peptide is really more specific for the gluten in the case in zine Prime is a more all-around digestive enzyme for protein fats and carbohydrates these are both from houston enzymes they come in a capsule as well as chewable generally one capsule is equivalent to about two to three chewable taken with meals or large snacks some kids have a hydrochloric acid deficiency difficult to test for and using hydrochloric acid supplementation you have to be cautious particularly with little kids who can't swallow a tablet or a capsule you don't want them chewing a hydrochloric acid capsule or tablet because it can damage their teeth so it's not something that I've used all that commonly in my practice another thing to consider with respects to persistent abdominal distension is just chronic inflammation you may be dealing with a situation where your child has some type of inflammatory bowel problem a lack of intestinal motility is present in some kids it generally can be picked up through endoscopy or colonoscopy where they can you know look at look at the surface lining of the gut sometimes doing further diagnostic testing to look for intestinal motility problems is needed to be done it's not commonly done with kids on the spectrum just because it tends to be more invasive but a lack of intestinal motility can manifest with some kids as constipation so when we're talking about constipation ideally we should all be having a bowel movement for every meal we eat the reality is that doesn't happen so even in most adults if kids are having to mount bowel movements a day that's great many times I'll just take one bowel movement a day the reality is is that we need to get the stool out if we have any hint of constipation the constipation is only going to become a problem with respects to an overgrowth of yeast and bacteria and the bowel toxins that come from that so getting the stool out is of critical importance one of the things that I've seen you know over the years is that many times constipation can lead to aggressive behavior can lead to irritability can lead to moodiness for one what aspect of it is constipation is uncomfortable it causes pressure sometimes pain and then again if we have any sort of concern with respects to yeast or bacteria the constipation is just going to make things worse the ideal thing with respects to stools is that the stool should pass easily they don't necessarily shouldn't come out as a hard log and they shouldn't be real loose but soft and consistency and passed without much effort is ideal various constipating foods breads pasta pizza potatoes cornstarch bananas this will all increase constipation for many children couple of the things to think about with respects to constipation or persistent constipation again yeast and bacteria can cause constipation they can cause diarrhea too but they can also cause constipation parasites as well specifically worms pin worms round worms come to mind you're gonna be hard-pressed to do a stool test and actually find a worm they don't show up very often on stool testing but there are some hints that worms may be present one of them would be chronic constipation another a child who's constantly itching their bottom another is coughing in the morning morning coughing or clearing of the throat can be indicative of worms one of the tell-tale signs or at least one of the suspicious symptoms that seems to occur with worms is a worsening of behavior during the full moon so this is this has been known about now for many many years and as a big suspicion for worm infections not only with you with kids on the spectrum but but a lot of individuals but certainly with kids on the spectrum if there is a clear consistent pattern of a worsening of their behavior during the full moon it's it's pretty suggestive that there may be an underlying worm problem couple different remedies vormax which is also called mob end Azam he is a prescription medication that has been used for pinworms and roundworms 100 200 milligram chewable tablet given 1 twice daily for 3 days usually what I do is I'll give a ver mocks for 3 days wait two weeks and then repeat that dose it's generally easy to take their true but I don't see really any problems with them new beginnings carries some anti-parasitic herbs black walnut extract for example comes to mind after one dropper full 2 to 3 times daily you know for a couple weeks it's not a bad option usually though if I suspect pinworms or roundworms I'm going to be looking to use something like ver box because the reality is is that it tends to work so well couple other things to consider with respects to constipation and remedies for it high dose vitamin C is an option matter of fact this has been a longtime nature Pathak remedy in using ascorbic acid as a powder to what's called bowel tolerance where you just give ever increasing amounts of vitamin C because you can reach a certain point and it has a laxative effect it's not dose dependent based on age or weight its Jo's dependent on what you need to get the job done it could be a thousand milligrams it could be two it could be 10 it could be 20 I had one child that needed 20,000 milligrams of vitamin C in a 24 hour period of time to finally open the floodgates if you will with respects to a persistent constipation problem probiotics have an added benefit not only do they add to the intestinal flora of beneficial bacteria in the gut but if you use a lot of them they can actually cause loose fools so high-dose probiotics can actually have a laxative effect which is beneficial for an individual with constipation again it's not dose dependent based on age or weight it just is a natural reaction of the body to high dose probiotics in some individuals I always like magnesium whether it's citrate or oxide as a remedy for constipation I use that quite a bit 250 to 500 milligrams daily I usually will give it at bedtime so that we can have or at least attempt to have a bowel movement in the morning if possible and then other things to try would be you know aloe vera juice fiber supplements like flax seeds psyllium seeds apple pectin I can't say that any one of these works better than the others and some of it has to do with consistency some of it has to do with taste some of it has to do with what mixes well in a you know para sauce applesauce or a smoothie that your particular child will like another option actually is magnesium you can do magnesium tube al tall it's just like you can vitamin C to bowel tolerance usually don't have to use as much so some kids do you know do fine at 250 others at 500 Summits 750 milligrams I try not to use more than a thousand milligrams of vitamin C either in citrate or oxide on a daily basis for kids so if I was gonna do about tolerance remedy magnesium first ascorbic acid likely lean towards ascorbic acid and then just try to use a regular dose of magnesium you know 250 to 500 milligrams as some added benefit the one thing that you might be consider if you're gonna consider something like ascorbic acid is if your child has some type of known oxalate problem if there is an obsolete concern well then using real high-dose vitamin C is probably not the best thing for them so you know other options can come into play but the bottom line here is is just try to you got to get the poop out and that also means to some some kids need enemas some kids need suppositories to do it true fiber is a great product I really like true fiber since I started using it it's a digestible fiber it's also a prebiotic essentially it's a fertilizer if you will for the good bacteria in the gut one to two tablespoons excuse me one to two teaspoons or a tablespoon daily seems to work well for most kids just as an added product to help with constipation keeping kids hydrated as I mentioned before sometimes need to do laxatives sometimes they need to do an enema you know for two to three days to help unload the lower bowel is really important one thing to keep in mind with respects to constipation there are some kids who appear to be having a bowel movement every day so they actually you know maybe you know produce a three to four to five inch piece of stool and it looks like they're having a normal bowel movement but they still remain really distended their abdomens hard and appear swollen but if you look at their tests they may not have really high levels of yeast or bacteria but if you were to do an x-ray you'll often see in some of these kids a bowel that's overloaded with stool so what's happening well what they're doing is they're pinching off a small section of a larger piece of stool so technically they're constipated but they're actually producing a section of stool every day but they're not completely evacuating the lower bowel this is why when you're dealing with constipation many times if you suspect that there's fecal plug a large section of stool in the lower bound usually you can tell because it comes out really hard and dry which means it's been sitting there a while and the lower intestine has been absorbing the water this is why in some case it's actually better to do some type of a suppository one time daily for 24 hours and 48 hours or you know over a three to four day period of time to try to unplug the lower intestine and then your other remedies whether it's magnesium or vitamin C or aloe vera juice or whatever it may be has a better chance of working throughout the gut so it's sort of trying to unplug the drain before you know adding things to sort try to push stool through the digestive tract so if you're still running into a problem of constipation despite the probiotics despite the fiber just bite the magnesium you're probably dealing with a situation where your child has a fecal plug way down in the lower bowel let's switch gears here and talk about diarrhea what are some things to consider with respects to diarrhea well certainly the number one thing on the list would be infections yeast can cause diarrhea more commonly bacteria and parasites will cause diarrhea and there's a pattern that you need to be pay attention to is the diarrhea continuous or I should say diarrhea and neither lose stools to okay it doesn't necessarily have to be full auto really just be loose stools is it continuous is it intermittent is the cyclical or does it alternate between diarrhea and constipation usually diarrhea loose stools is an underlying sign of an infection inflammation in allergy you so if it's continuous think of either chronic inflammation some type of inflammatory bowel problem or a bacterial infection if it's intermittent which means it only happens once in a while it's likely related to some type of food intolerance if it's cyclical okay so maybe it occurs every 7 to 10 days or every 14 to 10 do it 14 to 21 days maybe it only hangs around for about three days and the stools firm up and then it cycles back usually highly suspicious of a parasitic infection whether that's Giardia Cryptosporidium entamoeba histolytica some type of parasite okay alternating diarrhea and constipation that gets a little more tricky certainly could be an infection chronic inflammation could also play a role you could also be dealing with stool impaction I had a case many years ago of a child who had severe constipation but it appeared like he was having loose stools because periodically you would have this loose stools emerge until an x-ray was done and actually found that he had a softball-sized fecal plug in the lower bowel so what's happening was was he was leaking stool around the fecal plug and it wasn't until we got the fecal plug out that his bowel started to normalize some kids unfortunately have persistent ongoing bowel problems where they really need to be scoped they need a diagnostic workup from a pediatric gastroenterologist a specialist to evaluate what the heck is going on and this generally requires ended osku pee to look down the esophagus into the stomach as well as a colonoscopy to look at the large intestine and in some kids doing what's called a PillCam evaluation where the camera the size of a pill capsule is deposited into the upper testin and then it moves its way through the bowel child wears a belt that that receives the images from the camera and that helps to identify more insidious problems occurring in the small bowel and that's something that dr. Craig's Minh does Craig's Minh is a pediatric gastroenterologist in Texas who is an expert at doing thorough GI evaluation gastrointestinal evaluation for kids on the spectrum so a couple things just to consider there with respects to diarrhea oh by the way let me just go back real quickly in when you're talking about parasitic infections and this is not a particular a specific talk on parasites but two very common medications that are that have a cross ability of covering different parasites one is flagyl flagyl you've probably heard of with respects to Clostridium bacterial treatment another is called Alinea both are confound at most compounding of excuse me most pharmacies Alinea is still in a patent I do not believe it can be compounded flagyl can Alinea is very specific for Giardia very specific for Cryptosporidium flagyl is also very good for amoebic parasites not so good for Cryptosporidium does pretty well for Giardia does a good job for bacteria such as clostridia flagyl is going to be much cheaper much more readily available much more ability to get it covered through insurance Alinea not so much it's not used as much but aleni is a very good pair up antibiotic specifically for Giardia and Cryptosporidium but it's more expensive so you know a couple options if this comes up for you if you've got a test you've got suspicion you've got questions on these types of things this is where you can actually reach me through my autism action plan com website through the parent forum you can post me these questions there and I'll be happy to go through a lot more of this information with you in greater detail let's switch our gears to anxiety another huge problem with kids on the spectrum it's not an easy condition to treat there are a number of natural remedies that may be helpful and I say maybe because they're not universally helpful unfortunately and usually it's not just one remedy sometimes it's a number of these things in combination I can't give you a specific amount based on age or weight again with these supplements they're really dosed I'm really on need so you have to start somewhere and then adjust it as you go gaba is a calming neurotransmitter in the brain it has been helpful for some conditions with respect to anxiety anywhere between 500 to 5,000 milligrams usually in my practice about you know 2 to 3 thousand milligrams per day does a good job some kids need a higher amount and again it's not universally helpful but it is a pretty darn good first start if you're looking for a supplement to help with anxiety theanine is an X is an extract of green tea theanine at you know hundred milligrams to 400 milligrams per day works pretty well in association with GABA inositol powder is an interesting supplement comes events from new beginnings about 700 milligrams per dose comes as a powder it's easy to mix in water easy to mix and dilute juice it actually has been studied with respects to obsessive-compulsive disorder it's been an effective treatment for anxiety in association with gaba and i've also found it to be selectively helpful for some states of with respect to obsessive compulsive behavior again not universally but it's something to consider magnesium has a role in anxiety it doesn't work by itself as well as gaba specifically for anxiety 5htp has some usefulness to 5htp is a supplement that actually is a precursor to serotonin again not a specific dose based on age or weight you know one to two capsules a couple times a day is not a bad place to start you have to be cautious though something to talk over with your physician if your child is taking what's called an SSRI medication a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor prozac Zoloft paxil you need to be cautious with 5htp because you may just drive too much serotonin which is not a good thing a couple of the things that I've actually had some good success with with respect to anxiety particularly social anxiety generalized anxiety is oxytocin I actually have entire presentations that go into oxytocin much more in-depth the nasal spray is not a bad option most of the compounding pharmacies carry at Hopewell Park pharmacy wellness least cells be the nasal spray works mostly pretty good for older kids for smaller kids they're not too happy with a nasal spray this is where an oxytocin tablet is going to be a little bit more effective again the dosing isn't based on age or weight so much as just a starting point if I'm using a tablet I'll generally start with a 5 unit tablet and I'll give it a couple times a day and then if I can do a nasal spray I may use the nasal spray as a as a in another emergency but as the therapy you might use in limited circumstances because it has a pretty quick onset let's say a child has a problem going to the mall or going to a restaurant but they get real anxious many times using a nasal spray in the moment can help decrease anxiety very quickly and you know it could be one to two sprays per nostril to get the job done so oxytocin has been a nice addition to biomedical intervention specifically with respect to generalized anxiety and social anxiety because the social part is that oxytocin in the brain helps to increase the facial recognition voice cue emotional recognition with people a couple of the things that have been helpful for anxiety one is respin a which I'll talk about shortly and then namenda onda Minda is actually a medication that's been used for Alzheimer's patients and it actually has been helpful for some cases with respects to anxiety respite a is a remedy that's been around now for about about four years I've been using my practice and it actually is a disc that's worn on the skin in that disc is a very small amount of something called brucer pain reser pain comes from the indian herb rural wall via a long time ago low wall via as a bulk herb was used for hypertension there was a study back in the mid 50's that used a liquid or or an herbal elixir an oral suspension of high-dose recipient ism and what they found was these kids had greatly improved socialization which environmental awareness less sensory issues across the board the problem was is they had some side effects to some of the kids became irritable because of it some of them had what probably was from low blood calcium where they got cramping and became agitated because reserpine is actually known to decrease blood calcium levels they're not the rest Binet but the or elixir researching can do that and so there's some special circumstances some of the kids over time became real emotional well they likely became that because what was happening was was the restore Pinos up regulating a specific enzyme called mao a an mao a is responsible for serotonin metabolism and over time if you're not replacing your stores of serotonin you can start to run a deficit and this can lead to irritability moodiness emotional instability let's fast forward and talk about respin a because respin a is low dose researching delivered through a disc it's not a high dose herbal oral elixir and so the side effects if they do occur are much more stable and much more low-key the benefits that have been observed with respects to RESPA may really fall into two major categories improvement in socialization where the kids are more engaged with the family more willing to participate more empathetic they're happier they many times just are overall improved in their mood and then in some kids they have more complex speech more deliberate and specific speech i haven't seen in a situation where a child went from being completely nonverbal to speaking but kids who at least had some language some words started to speak more side effects with respects to respin a hyperness very common with many different biomedical interventions nothing that's too extreme some kids have become irritable that's likely because of its influence on calcium moodiness emotional and depressed that's why when we use resume we make sure kids are getting enough protein or using supplements like 5htp or tryptophan for serotonin support I had one child that had increased stemming because of respin a but you know again that's that's not real common overall respin a has been a very favorable treatment it's something that you have to study it's something that you have to look into it's not a it's not a treatment that doesn't require some input on your part what I mean by that is it's not just about putting the disc on the skin and walking away putting the disc of respin a on your child's skin is easy but you also have to take some supportive supplements with it calcium needs to be taken at a certain amount we found out you know over time from the main researcher an innovator with respects to respin a elaine d lack that many times we have to modify other supplements modify the amount of essential fatty acids kids are getting vitamin D things like curcumin all can have an inhibiting effect on the effectiveness arrest but at least early on also b6 magnesium calcium as I mentioned and inositol are supportive supplements to rest Benes effectiveness so many times those have to be used to to help resume work more optimally so it takes a little bit of time to learn how to work with it a little bit of tweaking but overall it's been a very very encouraging treatment and something that I've used quite a bit and continue to use in my practice so if you want to learn more about respin a you can go to their website which is WWE and that's our es P and - a.com I also have a section on respin a in my autism action plan site as well okay what about gluten infraction what are some things to consider here what are some things to watch out for and this would also be for casein as well a couple things to have on hand if you know your child is extremely sensitive to gluten extremely sensitive to case in then I'll make sure I'd have some pepcid ac on hand you can get this over-the-counter this is only going to work by the way if it's if they if you can catch the infraction right away anywhere between a quarter to a half a tablet taken immediately after ingestion well many times nullify the negative reactions from gluten or casein epson salt cream as well as epson salt baths can be helpful this is something that can be done even if you didn't catch it immediately I wouldn't say days later but if within a couple hours putting add some salt cream on the skin um or doing an Epsom salt bath I learned from a parent a long time ago her child had an extreme sensitivity to gluten and whenever the child had an infraction she would put her child in the bathtub with about Oh about three to four inches of water and she would supersaturated that since salt you know use about four to five cups which is actually quite a bit in a small amount of water and should ever child sit in it and she swore by this that it helped to nullify the negative reactions that her child would have to gluten some kids skin is really sensitive I mean magnesium sulfate is a salt so you know it can be a little bit itchy and a little bit irritating so just you know be aware of that the things that are worthwhile I've had parents who carry around a bottle of Pepto side peptide is that Houston enzyme that is specific for gluten and casein digestion again you know this has to be an immediate this isn't something where they eat gluten and then you know six hours later you give a pep design it's not going to do anything some parents carry activated charcoal to help bind up the gluten casein right away immediately after exposure alka-seltzer gold can be used kind of similar principle as the pepcid ac essentially what you're trying to do is just neutralize the acids so that the peptides of the gluten encase and don't get broken down readily and then absorbed so a couple options there by the way if you're gonna do alka-seltzer gold it's got to be the it's got to be the gold it can't just be regular alka-seltzer so I think you know the probably the easiest thing to do is carry around an extra bottle of the peptide enzymes and if you know your child is really sensitive the pepcid ac is a good way to go okay hand flapping you know there's not one specific treatment for hand flopping and I realized that hand flapping can be situational okay it can just be a behavior that a child has because they're excited about something watching a video watching a TV show whatever it may be something that's just a situational but sometimes hand flapping has been associated with toxicity and sometimes dietary infractions ammonia is known to cause hand flapping ammonia for most kids on the spectrum is going to be generated by bacterial dysbiosis in the gut and protein mal digestion in the gut it's not always some type of internal biochemical urea cycle problem so a couple of things tickets with respects to that if you are suspicious that your child is hand flapping because primarily of bal toxicity it goes back to those bowel remedies activator charcoal to help bind up intestinal toxins once to twice a day whenever you do activated charcoal be cautious because activated charcoal can be a constipating agent so you need to work on things to prevent it i usually when i prescribed activated charcoal will also prescribe magnesium and again i'll use 250 to 500 ohms a day with activated charcoal used to try to prevent as best i can the constipation alpha q2 glute eric acid is a supplement that you can get from new beginnings it has been helpful in trying to helpful in reducing ammonia levels in the body whether they're coming internally for protein mal digestion or bacterial dysbiosis it's not universally helpful unfortunately but it is something to consider again percentage-wise for most kids their bacterial issue excuse me there ammonia issue is going to be gut related in in the vast majority of cases that I've seen so again look at constipation protein digestion problems you know even yeast overgrowth digestive enzymes working on the gut hyperactivity probably one of them the more troublesome things to try to try to figure out and help particularly from a supplement standpoint can be extremely difficult I mean quite challenging the first thing I think about with any kid who is hyperactive is diet so some type of food sensitivity whether it's to wheat soy dairy sugar intolerance you know what's their diet like with respect to sugar consumption juices sodas a biggie is artificial colors and flavors this is one of the first things I try to do is talk to parents respects to hyperactivity is really cleaning up their kids diets and the Feingold Institute you go to Feingold org grant website with regards to information with respects to food dyes and flavoring sensitivities that can trigger things like hyperactivity and it also talks about this this the the link between what are called salicylates and phenols so if you have a hyperactive child nothing else seems to be working you're doing gluten casein free you're doing supplements try to get them off of the the ritalin type medications please please please look at artificial colorings and flavorings the salicylates and the phenol connection through the Feingold Institute a couple of the things that you know can lead to hyperactivity or exacerbate hyperactivity a lack of nutrients so lack of B vitamins a lack of essential fatty acids this is one reason that cholera oil has been around for so long as part of a supplement in many of the introductory supplement programs for kids on the spectrum lack of antioxidants yeast overgrowth some kids are hyper because of yeast not all the time not every kid with yeast is hyperactive and but think of it okay this is why I always recommend doing the organic acid test from Great Planes because it gives you a good insight into yeast and bacterial toxins other metabolic imbalances but it really specifically helps to identify yeast which is such a problem again going back to a lack of nutrients new beginnings Nutritionals has something called a starter packet which includes B vitamins includes essential fatty acids through cod liver oil includes antioxidants a nice place to start some additional things that have been helpful for some kids hyperactivity I wish they were universally helpful but not always the linic acid can be a helpful adjunctive supplement on to kids programs you know usually about 800 milligram excuse me 800 micrograms per day not a bad place to start pycnogenol has had some usefulness in some cases pycnogenol is not one of the first things I think about when I think about hyperactivity taurine can be helpful in association with the linic acid again there's not a specific amount based on age or weight but it's been useful methyl b12 therapy it's interesting some kids actually who are hyperactive do really well with methyl b12 even though one of the most common side effects of methyl b12 therapy whether it's nasal injection oral or the lollipop is hyperactivity but many times what you'll find is there can be slight elevation hyperactivity for a period of time then in the hyperactivity can actually diminish and then you start to see an emergence of eye contact and awareness and sometimes language so methyl b12 therapy is an option Epsom salt bath Epsom salt cream which you talked about earlier with respect to the gluten infractions has been helpful to with respects to hyperactivity and then of course looking at the phenol issue is really really important so I can't give you an exact protocol of you know you know do all ten of these supplements and this for every particular child because it's very individualized but I don't know what I really want you to get a you'll come away with from this particular discussion about hyperactivity is looking at food looking at the diet specifically with respects to the the phenols and the salicylates treatment wise and we can have an entire discussion here you know about Ritalin type medication an interesting remedy which doesn't get a lot of play and doesn't get a lot of interest from parents and and from doctors too is something called the nicotine patch but I wanted to point it out to you just so you knew about it the nicotine patch idea was proposed by doctor Bradstreet number of years ago and what has been found with respects to understanding the biochemistry of nicotine is that its primary mode of activity is that it stimulates thing is called the nicotine receptors which helps control the production of acetylcholine acetylcholine is a part of what's called our cholinergic nervous system it modulates other chemicals in the brain specifically with respects to attention to memory to the speed of mental processing to just an overall improvement in cognitive function and it's also been helpful at reducing hyperactivity in some kids so let's uh let's look at a little bit closer what was being used and what has been used is purchasing a 7 milligram nicotine patch and again this is something that you've considered this is something that I highly encourage people to talk over with their doctor about but we're not using an entire cell 7 milligram patch you're generally only using a quarter to a half of a seven milligram patch one patch is equivalent to 0.15 milligrams of nicotine being delivered per hour a common cigarette provides anywhere between two to three milligrams of nicotine so we're talking about very very low amounts of nicotine applied through the skin over a 24-hour period of time so it's a very low amount delivered in a continuous way to try to stimulate these nicotine receptors and it's been helpful at reducing hyperactivity and some kids as well as focusing issues some kids get some sleep disturbance from it if that's the case the patch can be worn for less period of time maybe 14 to 16 hours a day so it's an interesting remedy that's been helpful for some kids with respects to hyperactivity now and again it could be considered an alternative potentially to the common medications would this be the first thing I would reach for of course not I would be looking at food sensitivities yeast issues nutritional imbalances phenyl salicylate sensitivities I'd go through that entire list first to see if we could get some inroads with respects to hyperactivity before I would even consider her something like a nicotine patch and I would encourage you do the same thing here to Bill we're also now falling into that group of the discussion with respects to aggression a couple things that want you to be aware of in thinking about your child's mood is it continuous or is it intermittent is it situational is it potentially or is it age-appropriate situational what could be some situations that could generate behavioural problems is it only occurring at school if it is occurring at school when is it occurring is it occurring around lunchtime is it occurring after lunchtime maybe it's something to do with their food could it be low blood sugar is there some new kid in class that's bugging them is it occurring with neighbors is it occurring with an aide so one thing is not every problem is related to a medical issue it could just be an environmental problem is it age-appropriate this is gets hard honestly because you can have a six-year-old child on the spectrum who behaves more like a four-year-old so by age they're older but by developmental age they're not so unless you have another child in the family that you can reference things to sometimes it's hard to know but sometimes kids act out behaviorally because of their age of the old terrible two scenario sibling rivalry even though you may have a child on the spectrum that doesn't mean that they're always going to get along with your brother and sister so it doesn't mean necessarily that there's a medical problem it could just be that their brother or sisters bugging them I mean I see it within my family with my my daughter and my son you know sometimes they're gonna fight so that can happen so again can be again diet okay artificial colors flavors he salicylates these phenols found in chemicals I could take this conversation back you know with respect to that to what we just talked about with respects to hyperactivity the same thing B vitamins essential fatty acids antioxidants he's Grover growth but more commonly irritability moodiness Tantrums if it's going to be tied to some kind of biotoxin it's going to be tied more specifically to a bacterial worms may be an issue particularly if you see it around the full moon that's certainly a possibility but more often than not a moody irritable tantrum a type behavior is more bacterial based than it is yeast based so therapies you got to do some investigation and we can start to look at you know things like testing like the organic acid test etc a couple of the things what I've tied into here with respects to irritability and tantrums is would fall into the category of anxiety so many kids who are anxious when they're overly anxious will become irritable and may tantrum okay they can't necessarily tell you but that's what's going on so this then references us back to what are some things that are usable you useful for anxiety the thinning the gaba the inositol they may be helpful aggression again hyperactivity anxiety irritability agitation moodiness now we have aggression same thing is it continuous is it or a mittened is it situational is it happening at school is it happening with neighbors is it happening with an aide it's not always a problem medical wise quick story years ago I had a patient and this is actually a case that I present in my autism the road to recovery book was a boy severely autistic who did you know very well on dietary intervention really really bad behaviors but that what happened was was there was a point in time in treating him where he started to develop a behavior where he would come home from school and 2 hours or whatever was after school he would tantrum so much that he would essentially destroy his bedroom and just you know and essentially go through the home and tip things over throw things and just was out of his mind what we finally found out and what what came of this through the pattern is that it was only occurring Monday through Friday wasn't happening on the weekends well it turns out that what he was having was he was having low blood sugar he was hypoglycemic he wasn't eating his snack at school and he only sporadically ate his lunch so what was happening is when he came home from not having eating his lunch and not having eaten a snack was he was hungry he couldn't tell his mom he is hungry he just lost it and he would tantrum and tantrum until you know finally at some point he ate something interesting is that it wasn't occurring on the weekends because he wasn't in school it was remedied by making sure his teachers knew that he ate if he had to eat something he had to eat his food and then also he need to eat a little something before he headed home and once that was the case no more tantrums same thing here though ok from a biomedical standpoint diet think about diet diet diet is there some type of problem particularly the sensitivity to the phenols and the salicylates allergies is it a possible food allergy or environmental allergy I've had kids who've left their home they go on vacation they do finally come back to their home and they start getting aggressive and irritable could be mold damage not real common but it's something that does happen the other thing you absolutely want to Lou lout and work on and remedy is constipation I've seen more kids develop acute problems with aggression when they become constipated so that whole discussion we had early on about constipation one of the reasons I also recommend doing the organic acid test from Great Planes laboratory is to rule out Clostridium bacteria Clostridium bacteria there's a bunch of these bacteria they produce some of them produce a marker called HP HP a HP HP a will affect dopamine when dopamine becomes erratic it causes erratic behavior and this I've seen this over and over and over again on my practice really really important to assess and to consider there's a wide variety of treatments for Clostridium problems everything from culturelle to sacrum Isis Velarde to the use of flagyl to the use of vancomycin they're very individualized but these these can be effective some kids do okay just on culture well others need antibiotics that's that's the reality comparing flagyl and vancomycin as a treatment flagyl again is going to be more readily available it's going to be cheaper it's also going to have cross coverage too parasitic infections - vancomycin is a very good antibiotic very good against clostridia but it's going to be more expensive and not readily as readily paid for via insurance one thing to consider with respects to cluster T of treatment neither of these antibiotics whether it's flagyl Alinea or vancomycin treat the spores of clostridia cluster t is a spore-forming bacteria this is where you need things more like high dose probiotics taken long term like culturelle or another probiotic like VSL 3 or from custom probiotics the the D lactate free these are the things that are going to help suppress cluster attea long term again more this is more of a discussion we have time for tonight again you can visit me if you'd like for more detailed questions on the the parent forum through the action the autism action plan com website a couple other things to consider with respects to aggression again constipation gut inflammation this is why so many kids have responded well to something like the specific carbohydrate diet is because the sed diet helps to decrease gut inflammation the low oxalate diet or an oxalate issue is another consideration something that you can actually pick up on from the organic acid test as you look at the oxalic acid marker there's a great website Lowe oxalate info oxalates are organic compounds of any mat fan and many different types of foods actually healthy foods that many of us eat but some individuals absorb oxalates to a to a to high degree in many individuals and severe cases it can lead to kidney stones typically what's happening with kids in the spectrum is we're getting an accumulation of oxalates they excrete them through the urine it can cause painful urination but it creates pain and inflammation throughout the body which can impact the brain adversely and we can see aggressive and behavior irritability etc from an oxalate issue bsl-3 high-dose probiotic helps to break down oxalates magnesium and calcium citrate the the situated forms of calcium magnesium are needed to be taken with meals to help bind those oxalates in the gut and then allow them to be excreted the low oxalate dot info site is in depth get much more information there if you detect oxalates on your child's organic acid test or if there's a family history you know that you know of oxalate kidney stones it's always a possibility so the oxalate story is another component another dietary intervention that can be helpful something i think about particularly with kids with just they're irritable all the time they're constantly on edge I think about off the problems also individuals with fibromyalgia certainly it has been associated that oxalates could be a problem with them as well okay what about sleep problems this is one of the first questions that I ask parents is how well is their child sleeping because if a child is not sleeping generally the parents are not sleeping and everyone is tired and everyone is miserable so the lack of sleep is really a high priority of things to try to correct dietary infractions can be a problem again you have to look and say is it because of something a child might be eating is it because of peptides is it because of the gluten soy or dairy is it because of a food allergy is because of too much sugar not eat enough complex carbohydrates and protein but just eating a bunch of simple sugar you know in your bedtime you know cakes and cookies and jell-o's and muffins where they're having a blood sugar problem those are some things to from a dietary standpoint that might be a link that's not a link you may be looking at some you know checking a blood level for iron or ferritin would be a good thing to do some of the things that can contribute to sleeping issues B vitamins in the evening you know b6 for example can be overstimulating for some kids I had one child years ago actually have a sensitivity to a zinc supplement that they're taking a couple other things too much activity before bed many kids these days don't have a bedtime routine so you know it's just expected that they're gonna go to bed and fall asleep well kids on the spectrum are very sensitive to electromagnetics they're very expensive to frequencies they're very sensitive to sensory input so TV video games DVDs tronics will over stimulate their brains a nervous system and one thing that i found and i think it's true of all kids but it's it's something to be aware of with kids in the spectrum even though they may appear that they're not watching TV or not paying attention they are they're very aware and they're also very sensitive and innocent and I think you know because they many kids can't talk and they can't express to you how they feel they can't always express a nightmare they they may not be able to express some type of excitable image that they saw something disturbing and you know honestly TV these days for the most part is is awful with respects to the types of images that are flown forth into our homes particularly in front of our kids and it's a very difficult thing to control so we have to think of that that may be something that's happening you know is so creating a routine turning out the TV turning out the videos turning out the DVDs and creating a routine for bedtime some parents not all but I found in certain circumstances actually had full-spectrum lights in the house full-spectrum bulbs will suppress melatonin so we need to turn off those off also a change in the seasons in the summertime you can expect your kids to stay awake longer there's a natural tendency for kids just to stay up longer during the summer couple other things to consider with respects to sleep assess the pattern do they have a difficult time falling asleep are they waking up at night are they waking up at night giggling goofy so stimulatory behavior if they're waking up giddy goofy and silly think yeast could be a phenol sensitivity to but think yeast if they wake up irritable and agitated oftentimes it's a food sensitivity many times it's a bacterial problem in those cases unfortunately it could be a nightmare but I wouldn't expect a nightmare to be going on every night so usually that goofy giddiness the silliness is definitely yeast though if we have a difficult time falling asleep many times melatonin can be helpful melatonin between 1/2 to 3 milligrams 30 minutes before bed can help kids get too young be helped melatonin can be you obtained for many supplement companies like new beginnings sometimes magnesium in the evening can be helpful and some salt baths in the evening can be helpful I've had a few parents you know have some luck with some of the herbal teas like chamomile passionflower given before bedtime as well routine as I mentioned before establishing a routine you know turning the TV off taking a bath you know getting them a bed getting them prepared to go to bed as best you can a couple other things with respects to sleep 5htp and tryptophan another 5htp and tryptophan are the precursors to serotonin i generally if I'm going to use either one I will start with 5htp and 1 to 4 capsules 30 to 90 minutes before bed can be helpful for some sleeping issues sometimes we have to use tryptophan although I don't use it that often as I mentioned before melatonin is not a bad place to start the melatonin that you would get from your beginnings is going to be more of a quick-acting sometimes we need to use more of a time-release melatonin and where we can use a quick-acting melatonin to get to sleep in a time-release military stay asleep the difficulty is with the time-release melatonin is a difficult thing to give and use and to have it be effective if your child cannot swallow a tablet or capsule excuse me a tablet or capsule if the time release has to be broken up and mixed in food and for the most part it's not a time-release tablet anymore but if you do have a situation where your where your child can swallow a tablet or capsule then that time release melatonin is a nice option sometimes just a short-acting is all you need and sometimes if kids still wake up in the middle of night giving another dose of a short-acting helps them to get back to sleep I've not found melatonin to be toxic matter of fact melatonin is an antioxidant in the brain so it has a lot of usefulness do we want to use it long-term would it be great not to use it at all certainly would it be ideal not to use it long-term well I think any of these supplements particularly a hormone would be ideal not to use long term so we try to do the best we can to get kids sleeping but if they're not sleeping and the only thing that works is melatonin then in my personal opinion it's a worthwhile thing to use because the lack of sleep is devastating you can actually obtain time release in short-acting melatonin through this web link here at Emerson ecologic s-- there's a doctor code called sunset and a zip code of nine to five nine one that actually need to be used to order the time release and the short-acting melatonin and actually in doing so through that link there's a 10% discount on on the supplements through that Emerson ecologic so again this information by the way look at the presentations being recorded will be on great plains website for a couple weeks but there's also another recording that you can obtain right away through the autism seminars on demand and if you want to get a copy of those of the slides then you can do so through the autism seminars on demand as well and just download the slides so stimulatory behavior well there's a lot of things that can lead to that first couple things I think of any recent illness cold flu or allergies all known to access to be yeast is there a dietary infraction gluten casein soy other allergens food dyes could this be a contributing factor to stemming then I start looking at other factors that might contribute to to self-stimulatory behavior is it worse or an onset after a particular situation is it happening at school is it happening from something they're doing in the community okay swimming for example in the summer the chlorine maybe in quotes in quotes a potential problem a glutton fraction that you don't know about I don't want to throw grandma and grandpa under the bus but the reality is is some family members don't get it you know all kids deserve milk and cookies you know that's the perception anyway of some people so you think do some detective work a couple other things is the stemming worse at a particular time of the year is it really only is it getting worse in the winter or maybe there's more propensity to illness or in the spring where it could be tied to allergies a new supplement that was added maybe it's a lack of supplements you know where they need something more sometimes you have to work this out you know with with your doctor to kind of to kind of figure things out the problem is is the list for things that can contribute to self-stimulatory behavior or huge it's not just one thing unfortunately and I have found all of these things on this page to be useful for some kids at certain circumstances cod liver oil has been a wonderful therapy for visual stemming sigh glancing for example with some kids treating yeast has helped many kids with respects to self-stimulatory behavior but I've had kids who had so stimulatory behavior work olive-oil did nothing and treating yeast didn't stop it but respin a helped or doing a combination of gaba and lithium seemed to to make the difference because in in those particular situations the cell similar behavior was also in association with a child being irritable and agitated so I wish I could give you an exact breakdown of you know do these five things and it's going to help every time it's just not the reality this is why we have so many different things that we can use and in many cases they work quite well but sometimes we have to keep searching and searching for other things that are available that may be helpful this is why understanding what to do clinically and working with a doctor who understands the the the subtle nuances of problems is important so a couple things for my observation self-stimulatory behavior is generally worse with anxiety it's worse with repeated exposure to the television set to video games most it's worse with kids being indoors a lot and I see that happening with a lot of kids on the spectrum they're in therapy sessions all day long where they don't get outside much why is that happening is it because of the excessive electromagnetic radiation that they're exposed to maybe it may just be because of they're not getting enough exercise so not getting enough exercise not getting enough outdoor activity running swimming being in nature many times will just increase the problem with self-stimulatory behavior that might be a simplistic viewpoint for some kids I mean I get it there's some kids that are impervious to no matter what you do with respects to trying to help their self-stimulatory behavior but these are things that I've seen we ran over my practice throughout the years and then finally what about regression well the reality is is that you have to go through the the you have to go through that list of all the usual suspects is there a dietary infraction do you have a do you have a history with your child to being a strong reactor to gluten casein could it be yeast and bacterial overgrowth even if you did a test three months ago that showed nothing doesn't mean they couldn't have picks up picked up something new or had an overgrowth occur because of a of a weakened state of immunity in that moment is it a new infection is it tied to some type of seasonal change again situational changes that may be occurring at school a detox reaction die-off certainly is something that can cause regression so is it a new therapy that you've just started are you treating yeast are you giving something for detox are you doing chelation therapy think back you know as to what maybe is going on recently could it just be an age transition kids develop and kids go through brain development at certain times that could cause emotional changes and we know about we know that about kids and teenagers you know there's a transition point around 10 to 12 years old we're you know kids become combative and they talk back and they're constantly saying no you know these same types of changes are happening with kids on the spectrum so it may be it could be an age transition issue too so some final comments okay I always encourage people to journal you don't have to write an obscene amount of information on a daily basis but but keeping a journal that you can take your observing with your child keep a spreadsheet of therapies it could even just be a calendar notebook that you write down in your notebook and your calendar when you started a therapy and then keep some notes under what you're seeing it's also important to note when you stopped a therapy so that you could share that with your doctor try to recognize patterns okay situational seasonal time of the day all of that is is useful and then looking to say well you know what new therapies have been added what's been seen are we seeing any positives any negatives no changes because a lot of times I'll find that if I it if I find that a child's reacting to something I'll usually start backtracking and what was just added recently this is why I often don't like to start 5 or 6 things at the same time so if I'm going to start a group of supplements then I'll usually have the parents introduce one new supplement every 24 to 48 hours so that we have a little bit of a lag to see what kind of reaction they're going to have so the reality is is you have to become a detective with respects to your child's particular autism condition and there's a lot of great resources out there these webinars I know are helpful for many people a lot of other great books and conferences to go to a lot of online sites a lot of parent chat rooms as well and then you know hopefully you know if in time and if it's something that you find useful this is why I created the autism action plan comm site was to be there for parents and caregivers to answer questions to try ideas about things that I have seen from my experience even if you're working with a doctor the reality is you can't always get a hold of them you can't always get an appointment and this is why I answer questions on the weekends in the evenings on holidays it's just it's an avenue for people to go to who want to have access to a medical professional okay so with that said I hope this information was helpful for you and again this particular presentation can be found through the autism action plans comm site as well as the autism seminars on-demand website again it's going to be it has been recorded will be on Great Plains as web site for a couple weeks I'm also available for private consultations I have office I see patients in Southern California occasionally in normal well as having just established some office hours in Oregon in Bend Oregon which is in Central Oregon so if you're from the Pacific Northwest you can certainly contact me if you go to dr. roller comm that's my central website you can access my office information through that website if you want to get more information about me my consultation services and just an FYI parents who are members of the autism action plan comm site actually receive discounts on consultations through my practice whether that's office phone or Skype okay so just some general information for you again I hope this information was helpful for you I realize there's a ton of stuff to consider a ton of different scenarios to consider but at least you can hopefully walk away tonight with some some useful tips that you can start applying care of your child and I hope everybody has a great holiday however you celebrate it I hope this holiday season is a happy and joyous one for you and your family and we will be back in leave the second week of January for the start of our 2013 webinar series okay good night everybody take care", "MRaxQ3ChSK0": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] you [Music] we're gonna get started today a special speaker this morning that I went to university to his name was Bill Kristoff he is a orthopedic surgeon who spent most of his career in private practice in Truckee where is it Nevada California if any have been there's beautiful place he had a unique end to his career however and he has gotten involved with the military for reasons they'll come clear in a second he's in town as part of a symposium put on by the parks department honoring veterans coinciding with Veterans Day this week so I'll let the introduction mainly be done here by a video - he's lucky to have him thank you so much am honored to be here this morning at the earth to Department University of Utah speaking later tonight a veteran suppose in nature nature's grace and today I really wanted to just this is an overview of combat casualty care by no means is a comprehensive and for anybody who have further interests I recommend a book that was published recently called combat casualty care by sobieski and East Ridge and it's basically lessons learned from Operation Iraqi Freedom Operation Enduring Freedom minutes I was just looking through the last week it's a it's a fabulous book so that's the Bible this is just going to be an over here basically as you heard I was in private practice in Truckee doing general orthopedics and sports medicine for almost 30 years I came out of the University of California Davis and did additional sports medicine training when I joined the Navy they sent me off to a number of military medicine courses to learn combat casualty care including Marine Forces extremity war surgery course and a marine course called field medical service officers course and finally as well as a TLS T Triple C or tactical combat casually care I mean it's a host of courses and they're excellent courses the three service courses and then finally three weeks at LA County where the Navy runs a navy trauma training program for outgoing military teams and my first deployment was to Morocco with a surgical team where we set up shop on a remote Moroccan military base where a Marine unit was training Moroccan military and doctrine required that they have surgical capability within 30 minutes so we were there luckily we just did routine work and didn't have no casualties from the exercise in 2009 I raised my hand and deployed to Iraq with the combat team from Camp Lejeune in North Carolina you need to understand that Navy medicine takes care of Marines so I was Green side the whole time I didn't have a navy uniform I had marine uniforms that said Navy on them but Navy docks Navy nurses Navy corpsman provide medical care for marines of course their other task is the blue side on taking care of sailors so in Iraq we were out it was a I'll show you a picture of that facility we were it was a relatively quiet time in Iraq we had very few combat injuries and mostly was routine care for Marines with training injuries I came back and I took active duty orders and went to the Naval Hospital Camp Pendleton just north of San Diego in the orthopedic Department and after a week there I got a phone call from the Navy orthopaedic leader saying bill we got a spot for you been requested to go to Afghanistan and I had a laugh I hadn't even unpacked my bags just getting oriented there and the leader said this there was Friday said call me Monday with your answer so you can imagine how that went over with my wife but nonetheless it was an opportunity that I might not get again and I ended up going with with the team from Pendleton led by captain Bowman and captain Bowman is icon in navy medicine this was his eighth deployment and he basically wrote the book on the level to mobile level - he basically designed it and it was a privilege to serve with him Afghanistan with his nup was a completely different program the Marines were surging up in Helmand province that's where we based it was very busy very intense and we were busy from from dawn to dusk and my final deployment was in Guantanamo Bay where I was the orthopedic department at the Navy base and took care of some of the same bad actors that I took care of in Afghanistan at the detainee camp so I'm gonna look at some of the best practices this is again gonna be an overview this is a very complicated topic I'm just wanting to try to give you a hint of some of my experience in particularly some of the cases that I took care of some innovations in combat care which basically have been pushed out to the civilian sector again many of the innovations that we have in the civilian sector originated in the military because they have a huge experience the combat problem in the military of course is a little different than the knife and gun club at LA County or Denver General or San Francisco general I'm going to talk about the principles of conduct here talk about medevac national lines of care understand that the military assistant numbering system is different level one is the first place first contact with medical care level five are the tertiary care facilities as a which would be comparable to the level one trauma centers here in the States we'll talk about damage control resuscitation damage control surgery in some cases and application to civilian care well what about a TLS well they use a TLS but guess what you've got to get that marine or that soldier out of the line of fire first so first thing is get them to a safe you know they can't handle the combat you may not be able to do anything right away get them out you don't you don't have the option to put them on a backboard and have three people attending to them you drag them out of the way make sure that you know return fire make sure the situation is safe in the military doctrine says take care of the bleeding first so life-threatening hemorrhage is taken care of initially and that's either with it and we'll talk more about this either with an extremity tourniquet and tourniquets are universal value' bic otis in the combat setting most soldiers of Marines will carry one or two tourniquets each and some of them were pre positioned on their legs I mean that's pretty crazy there's also a junctional tourniquet that's been devised and I've got one here and I'll pass that around in a minute so what about the evacuation weather reasons that the combat injuries the fatality rate now for all injuries is proud from these conflicts is probably about eight percent and the reason are probably probably threefold better care at the scene with the corpsman and combat medics and and combat lifesaver number one number two body armor okay body armor is a little different when I see pictures in Vietnam and in Colonel deterrence era there was no banya body armor maybe they had a flak vest so the the flak vest what contains a ceramic plates front and back that will will stop an ak-47 round but there of course there are places where it's not going to be stopped like in the neck so predominant injury probably 50 to 60 percent of the injuries sustained in Iraq and Afghanistan or extremity injuries so guess what orthopedist are pretty busy the third component of of care is rapid medical evacuation where Korea started the mobile health care mobile mash unit the sort of bringing the surgeons to the more closer to the scene of the battle Vietnam instituted helicopter back in the evacuations that we had the facilities were very robust so to buy doctrine that secretary gates that defense secretary gates established for Afghanistan is that every injured soldier marine sailor would be within one hour of surgical care well in a big country you're the time and distance precludes being one hour so that means pushing out surgical care into some of the moat areas that there were three levels of care in Afghanistan in the air evacuation the army had the army evacuation army planes were staffed with the combat medic would be equivalent to probably an EMT to in the civilian sector they were good but they were not as good as the Air Force paramedics of the PJs who had basically a year of training consistent with Delta Force medics for example so they were very high-speed they were really capable and very knowledgeable and good for mountain rescue they were scuba trained some of them they were pretty fabulous the highest level actually was the Brit Unit and the Brits I work in a British hospital Brits had what they called mert mert basically would you have to describe that as a mobile emergency room medical emergency resuscitation transport something like that and they sent out an intensivist either an anesthesiologist ER doc or an intensivist in that helicopter to the site of the injury and that of course that doc was ready and go starting IVs placing blood placing chest tubes intubation potentially even cross-clamping any orders so pretty sophisticated and they were bringing back patients that had not bringing back patients before the heartbeat that had never been had not survived to make it to the surgical facility there is a luck there is question about level 2 versus level 3 and I'll get into that in a minute this was the action of the unit I worked in in Iraq this was our surgical facility this was a hardened facility and this this was on an airbase in Al Anbar province and it was pretty well equipped for middle of nowhere we had a trauma Bay capable of taking care of six to eight traumas at a time we had two operating rooms we even had a CR I'm not quite sure how that got there and we had a recovery room we had huge staffing we were kind of overstuffed with staffing and again this was a this was a level two three we had good general surgery and North defeated capabilities here but again we were treating mostly routine care interestingly enough we had helicopters stationed probably a hundred yards from from our facility so if we had a patient that was critical needed to go to a higher level facility we get on get on the horn that patient could be loaded ready to go in less than five minutes and out of there I mean it was the the capabilities of medevac in Iraq were amazing to me what about the level one so what level one is the first place they get care and it could be anywhere from their fellow marine who's got Turkish who's trained in tourniquets to improving their airway usually it would be the combat medic in the Marine Corps it would be the Navy corpsman there's a corpsman or a combat medic that's with every clue - and every 36 to 40 soldiers or Maurice in they're pretty well trained training is a little bit variable they start out with three months of training basic training and then the corpsman to go with Marines have an additional two months so if they've deployed a couple times they're gonna be very experienced so it's a little bit of a it's variable but again they you know what they have is what they can care they're pack so they're not carrying a mobile emergency room but they're good at stopping bleeding improving Airways and really this site the site bar really talks about the three Ian studies that the military has looked at looking at three types of preventable death what who was dying in the battlefield that might be saved that would been found that it was hemorrhage number one number two Airways that were lost because of positioning in number three unrecognized tension pneumothorax so the train for our combat corpsman our Navy corpsman our combat medics of the army was addressed at these at these three to try to alleviate try to improve those those numbers and the highest there's a battalion aid station where the battalion surgeon and you have to understand the military battalion surgeon is a general medical doc it's a guy who's had a maybe a year to a collateral training and it takes care of that battalion the highest level of care emergency care this is in the Navy as the Shock Trauma platoon and that is essentially a mobile emergency room staffed with ER Doc's ER nurses Navy corpsman and capable of everything that's listed below here intravenous giving blood intubation placing chest tubes and probably doing a fast exam and the fast exams were ubiquitous in theatres doing a quick abdominal exam that's fast exam for those of you who may know it's a basically a sonogram ultrasound a little little unit to look for free blood and the abdomen of a prepare cardio tamponade or in look at the lungs so what were the goals again I'm going to repeat myself here a little bit stop the external bleeding number one number two well how do we address torso hemorrhage I'll talk about that you prove the airway treat tension pneumothorax with needle aspiration rapid medical which I mentioned this clinical practice guidelines because in this book combat casualty care there in the appendix there are a lot of clinical practice guidelines this is an ever-changing list of techniques and it could be treatment for gunshot wounds could be treatment for blast injuries could be burn injuries it antibiotic treatment wound care and these were constantly updated by lessons learned from the returning teams from theater so the military is very good about updating these lessons learn what do we need to do what's different what's working when is it in the military courses that I went to they were usually taught by the guys who just returned so they're very good and there was a a great institutional knowledge in combat care that gets passed on from the senior senior leaders like captain Bowman down to people who hadn't deployed previously I mention this because this was a devise of mobile trauma Bay basically could be driven to the site of a conflict this was designed by a a ER doc named captain Hancock and he had gone in the early days in that in the Afghanistan pamphlet he designed his own mobile emergency room with sheets of Kevlar and had his corpsman drive a seven ton truck to the site of battle where he was saving lives very close to that scene and basically they pushed out a few of these units they're quite expensive in but I don't think that we use that much to really use near margin and in my experience there were helicopter evacuation to robust facility seemed to work better this is an example of an MRAP and you hear a lot about mrs well what are they amrap stands for Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicle so in the early days in Iraq Humvees which had even the armored up Humvees had armor on the size but they did not have underneath so they were very vulnerable to improvised explosive devices or IEDs the hammer acts are armored underneath and they have a v-shaped hull to deflect the blast and even though you could get injured in MRAP the survival rate was very very high so these were instrumental in saving soldiers and Marines in theater and they were single-handedly the bureaucracy which these were pushed out by secretary gates and he single-handedly saved hundreds of lives by getting A's in theater and that was set up as an ambulance okay what about him so I'm gonna pass around a cat tourniquet we'll talk about that that's the that's the tourniquet that is standard equipment then to talk about junctional tourniquet so on the upper right we're talking about this is a cat tourniquet in place and the severely injured leg and if one didn't work the corpsman would is - and they're they save lives they're really in studies that the military yet there were no as long as they weren't left on for longer than six hours there were no long-term consequences from putting these tourniquets on note you know no major neuropraxia is no compartment syndrome so these were the life-saving and of course when we got the patient we would take take them off about it at the lumely in America the Sam tourniquet was developed to deal with the problems of bleeding in the in the groin working I'll pass that around in the groin and in the axilla and basically uses this belt with a diaphragm and a blood-pressure cuff to apply pressure now quick clot and some of these hemostatic units were available personally I did not see them used and didn't have patients coming in with those hemostatic agents well what about truncal hemorrhage other than the operating room well tsa has been used and was used in our facility and can't we'll probably talk about that a little bit later but that became a standard used to control truncal bleeding and health decreased leave if given within the first three hours well what about Airways well again the coroner thought about jinlun jaw thrust and on a conscious patient to place a nasopharyngeal to the corpsman are also given these super glottic tubes and there's a there's a variety of the IO man that came - they're not of course as satisfactory as and a lot of emotions in as far as the corpsman ability to do that it was variable depending upon their experience the quickly all surgeons in theater were taught to do cricothyrotomy because you could have injuries to the jaw to the pharynx that would preclude intubation I mean when things are we've got a devastating injury there's no way you're not you can't the normal Anatomy is simply not there so the emergency airway is a cricothyrotomy what about analgesics and this is changed too the breeze will carry tylenol ba carry mobic enough for their own use for moderate pain the although this was off label the that no lollipops were coming into use and that's kind of been standard and ketamine is now seems to be the drug of choice either I am intranasally IV or entry out into obviously and of course more cream amides of standby as long as you have the ability to reverse it with no lock so I want to talk about this patient I'm going to get into something a little bit a little bit more meat on here so this patient came in this was a Navy corpsman came in with devastating injuries he was on a foot patrol stepped on an ie D had a blast injury basically had traumatic amputations of both legs above the knee one very high on the right partial amputation of his right arm partial amputation of left hand and he was stable he was talking basically kind of intubated he had no chest or abdominal head or neck injuries and we these people always got a lateral c-spine they got a chest and abdominal pelvic x-ray and we saw this and I'm going okay what's up with this and then we got this and then we went to the operating room straight away no studies no CT scans and what we found and think might recognize this what what he had when we took all his dressings down is he had a web belt which comes off the waist obviously they saw how he carry a lot of gear read your big web belt the web belt was strung around his waist and around his amputation stump and the windlass for this improvised tourniquet was the barrel of a machine gun 240 golf machine gun and I'm going oh my god who did this who figured this out what happened was he had an amputation so high in his right thigh that that precluded placement of a tourniquet without this he would have bled to death so we had a chance we worked on him and again it's not like one guy working for five hours when we took him to surgery we had eight surgeons we had two surgeons on each land he was off the table in probably 45 minutes but a hint plastic hand surgeon from Britain on his hand I worked on his other upper extremity we had no orthopedist with general surgeons helping us clean up the last injuries on the lower extremities we're all saying it got proximal control from the general surgeons up in the groin before going to the to the limbs so tremendous manpower at that facility we had four orthopedist orthopedic PA lots of general surges and we were kind of interchangeable so what we found was going going back to this guy we had a phone conference this guy was out of out of our facility in Afghanistan the next morning flown to Bagram goes to the launch stool where his wounds get looked at again and he's back in the States probably in less than 72 hours so there's rapid evacuation of the cash base they weren't stacking up we didn't have a holding capacity and the idea is to get them back to the level five or civilian level one facility as rapidly as safely as possible and we talked to the the trauma doc who was taking care of him he said well how a corpsman doing and we were on this boat this weekly phone conferences he had Alexan well that guys doing great this woods are all to always know no problems for that and the plastic surgeries are working on his hand he's sitting up his family's here with him and he seems in good spirits because you've got to be kidding me this was this guy was on death's doorstep a week ago and I mean these were devastating injuries I had a chance to talk to this corpsman when I got back from deployment and he was learning to drive a specialized band he was renewing his marriage vows he there's just like we'd be talking here today and he subsequently got a job with another government agency no longer in the green maybe your Marine Corps but went on with his life and back back to back to a pretty happy situation with his family his wife was planning to go to medical school so I mean it was a strange turn of events but with his quick thinking he had trained him prior to deployment he had trained his Marines on improvised tourniquets and he had directed his Marines and basically direct his Marines to save his life so what about the love of - I was involved in level two in Iraq as well as in Afghanistan and basically you could set up shop and I show pictures this was a this was a mobile team and this is I thought this was this was what I want to do I wanted to be part of a pushed out surgical team well all these Ollis equipment in our what's called a RSS board resuscitated system were placed in small connects boxes they could fit on the back of a truck that could fit in a c-46 helicopter we were totally self supportive we had our own generators we had a water supply we had anesthesia machine an oxygen generator and we had full complement our team in Afghanistan was led by captain Bowman we have a third a cardiothoracic surgeon from San Diego we had another young trauma surgeon and myself as North Pinochle so we had big time let's go back so this is what this this can look we're practicing setting up a tent in Iraq this was a fixed tent that we set up shopping in Afghanistan we did not set this one out this was already here but you can see that these these containers all contain our mobile surgical unit we're assembling our table you got battery-powered lights we've got our anesthesia machine every fall our equipment hangs from the wall and we're capable without resupply of doing 18 surgeries we had anywhere from 20 to 40 units of blood we had very rudimentary lab but that was available here's our chest cracker we had our two tests or excellent so in the in the battle in Iraq in 2003 this this type of unit follow the follow of the Marines to Baghdad and they were moved they could set up shop it's hard to believe I know you won't believe me you can set up shop and be ready to operate in one hour and be ready to leave and pack up and head to the next spot in an hour so that was pretty amazing with a well-trained crew this worked really well in a fixed combat theater there was this kind of concept was kind of redundant because maybe you'd be better going to a more sophisticated facility with helicopter transport and that sophisticated facility is our level 3 just in in Afghanistan I worked at a place called Camp Bastion that was a British Hospital it was staffed half by British surgeons and half by Navy docks and we had big capacity so we had a trauma Bay we can handle 8 to 10 traumas at a city we have CT scanners we have a CR robust ICU capability so our operating room was about the size of this conference room and we had four operating beds placed placed around it and we had contamination we were the fifth one to give you an idea of the capabilities we have a one-day where we had 32 patients come in from a bomb blast added as a civilian at a town nearby we took 24 of those patients to surgery that day and we were done by 6 p.m. so big capacity lhasa docks lots of help never a a lot good great blood bank and ready and obviously compared to the mobile unit where you have maybe one or two operating rooms the capabilities were much greater and who did we treat well in Afghanistan we treated Brits we treated US troops where else a tree and Afghan army and police afternoon civilians we also do treated some detainees at least didn't show up on this one and it was a busy time it was a very very active theater at that point in the conflict now what about the level for so the casualties from Iraq and Afghanistan were tickler when stable were taken to launch to Germany where more specialty surgical care was available they were flown out on c---seventeens staffed by critical care docs and critical care nurses and they if they had open wounds they'd be taken back to surgery they had MRI CT scan available there and further care was given you should understand that in theatres and I'll talk about damage control surgery damage control resuscitation that we were doing the breeding cleaning wound stopping bleeding cleaning the bone putting fixers on we're no internal fixation apply maybe an occasional KY on the hand that was floppy some internal stabilization that's about it in level 5 most of these patients went to Washington DC the Naval Hospital at that time was Bethesda Army Hospital was Walter Reed thought they system combined the burns were flown directly from theater to Brooke Army Hospital San Antonio all of burn patients by doctrine were flown straight there were the best birds enter the country this these other hospitals are level five facilities in San Antonio Portsmouth Naval Hospital San Diego Naval Hospital in Madigan Army Hospital no the entity coma so definitive care of these wounds and internal fixation reconstruction rehabilitation treatment of infection coverage solved on a level 5 facility and they were in that facility until they are either discharged went back to back to the Marine Corp army or they were discharged to the military and then on to the VA what about damage control resuscitation well who guess it well obviously these people with these major injuries need damage control resuscitation and that's pretty much self-explanatory but the major bleeding traumatic amputation major fractures uncontrolled major blast injuries with I should say that in my experience probably 60% 60 70 percent of the injuries that I saw in Afghanistan were blast injuries the gunshot wounds were much rarer and these are the physiologic findings who needs damage control resuscitation low blood pressure high pulse becoming hypothermic and by the way if they came in with a temperature of 32 survival rate it was zero so hypothermia is a killer I'll talk about that a little bit they were acidotic with the base excess of minus 6 they were trouble and needed damage ditional resuscitation the shock index is also very helpful right over systolic blood pressure well what are the goals the goals are to treat the bleed establish a chance of resuscitation blood free we're not talking about loading up with crystalloid to 120 we're talking about hypotensive or permissive resuscitation if you don't have in the field getting in a radial pulse would give you a blood pressure of 80 to 90 so that's the best goal keeping them warm preventing hypothermia preventing high acidosis this triad of care again this is a killer so acidosis is is a function of inadequate perfusion and lack of well mosted perfusion and tissue acidosis and hypothermia this these are basically self reinforce the hypothermia they found that transporting patients on open helicopters you know even though it was 120 degrees in Iraq the patients were coming in hypothermic so the corpsman started putting these patients in body bags to try to keep them warm and eventually more sophisticated approaches of hot pockets and in heating units were applied in transit so that they would come in in a warmer condition our operating rooms were heated to 100 degrees in theater so we were in t-shirts and shorts but trying to keep the keeping those patients warm with heating blankets whatnot was very important what about coagulopathy we want I'm gonna talk about that we want to prevent that coagulopathy of course acidosis and hypothermia make them more likely to be coagulant Catholic so damage control surgery in general surgery and abdomen were not doing definitive repairs we're stopping the bleeding we're packing the liver lacerations if there's a gut injury basically it's clamped off their wounds are cleaned but there's no anastomosis vessel injuries in the level 2 even some of the level 3 facilities they're shunted we're not doing long-term stuff basically they're in there for less than an hour in the back the ICU to continue the resuscitation what about the teams well this fellow was head is a head of Navy trauma training center in La County's a professor at the LA County is a trauma surgeon and he was our chief surgeon in Iraq so the teams were led by very experienced trauma surgeons and of course here we're doing some training on malta mass casualty drill in training training training because there's no substitute for that being ready to go when you do have a mass casualty and again as I mentioned Afghanistan captain Bowman was our was our leader eight deployments wrote the book on the level two facilities the mass units just an amazing teacher amazing trauma surgeon what about damage control Martha piece she thought I wasn't going to get to them it wasn't super complicated but it was a lot of work so debridement debridement debridement we used irrigation we used low pressure irrigation no pulse lavage big bottles the Big Woods would get 9 liters usually normal saline we stopped the bleeding tie off any bleeders clean the bones and fasciotomies if we thought about they get fasciotomies didn't apply external fixator so lots of external fixators on the unstable and they were really used for transport obviously to stabilize the fractures but to make these patients stable for transport well what about it okay this guy this army patient was injured you know what's called a Stryker vehicle he had appeal on fractured the tibia they had I think a tibial plateau fracture as well and possibly supracondylar fracture basically a blast injury where the the force came up from the floor and drove him down and it's just like falling from a height so he had these they of juries had a lot of swelling and he got this nice man fix it or fix it or from the mid tibia down to the foot and that to getting ready for trance transport all these were closed injuries he clearly clearly had a fair amount of tibideaux swelling now he's going to be having some long plane rides here to get out of to get to evacuation not only to ready to leave theater but also to get to Germany to get to the states so basically you think about these are done this is big-time fasciotomy where we're opening a lot of compartment with you four compartments two incisions generous decisions these are not cosmetic incisions these are big we did not use wound vacs we use big bulky dressings Britain writ doctrine didn't use wound backs at that point in time so he's just about ready to go he'll be in the ICU overnight go out with the next crew blown probably to Bagram and then out the next day this guy was a Marine we saw in Afghanistan and Iraq and he came in the next day with this swollen calf and it turned out he was on top of his MRAP and he banged his cap into the light stander and came in with sort of a numb foot a little bit of weakness going on okay this was not hard to diagnose we can't recall when we did tissue pressure measurements not sure we had the capability but the bottom line is we took him directly to surgery he was 24 hours and evacuated this expanding hematoma that was there and did compartment releases immediately and laterally and we were able to close his wounds in four or five days he basically had compartment syndrome and from this expanding hematoma and we were able to keep him in theater we did not send him out put him on light duty and he was able to return to full duty at about a month this was a bad actor this was a insurgent who was planning an AED and it kind of went off prematurely against his leg and he sustained burns to the lateral aspect of his and you can't see it very well here but he had an open tibial plateau fracture I took him to surgery and washed-out detonated fragments out of his tibial plateau washed out his wounds and applied this spanning fixing her to him and we had to change that out in order to ship him off to the prison dkt prison they weren't they would not allow that so we basically after his wounds were healed and he was not infected wounds were doing fine he got a warm like calves good alignment okay sorry this was a Afghan civilian and this was this would not be a typical you can see in this x-ray up here in the circle okay he's got a foreign body here you can see a proximal humeral shaft fracture and that's what we started with this is what it looked like in the operating room and you can see from this blast blackness Bob laughs he's got clothing and debris that are basically embedded straight into the arm you can also see that he's got this gigantic tenting foreign body in the anterior axilla the good news was that he didn't have any neurovascular injury did not nail his plexus or his brachial artery actually our your vein cleaned all this out took the debris away fish this out this is what this chunk of steel look like so this guy was really lucky in he did not have a fatal injury or a devastating injury to his left upper extremity we did put a fix around him he ended up going to and ability after he was he was stabled this last patient was an Army soldier took a took an ak-47 round to his ulna got significant kommune in here this is what the exit wound looks like in surgery you can see it's expanding there's devitalized muscle bad skin edges so he got cleaned up washed out divided alized muscle was to breed it tried to keep any bone fragments in there that had any blood supply we did not put a fixer on him he was splendid well by his radius and basically got after washed out and I believe in antibiotics got a long arm splint and he got transferred to launch tool so what about the ICU the ICU again we're dealing with preventing hypothermia keeping the patient's warm we're treating blood loss again in my day back in the day trauma who were treated with crystalloids we just loaded them up and of course that just created more bleeding I'm sure you guys are knowledgeable about all that so that's that's kind of not part of thinking anymore and we're treating blood loss with blood products so that means platelets fresh frozen plasma and packed red cells at a 1 to 1 to 1 ratio what's even better if you have it available is fresh warm whole blood because you got it it's warm sky you've got everything that you need in a number of settings in the military they are going to use what's called the walking bug Bank and the walking bug bank would be Marines or soldiers have been pre-screened who were on a base that said yeah we can give blood this guy's got a major trauma he's got you know mass transfusion greater than 10 units and they will call these guys in and you'll get warm blood that's been previously typed so we didn't have that we never needed to utilize that we had Robus blood bank but in settings in 2003 they would often utilize the walking blood bank when needed for transfusion so keep them warm treat the acidosis usually by restoring circulation again not necessarily to 120 about at least to 90 again we've talked about the wormhole blood we talked about the one to one to one in whether or not cryo and factor seven play play a role that's that tends to be controversial so what were the numbers the published numbers from the mobile level twos from Iraq actually were 97 percent survival marine came in with a heartbeat that's he would it's got a pretty great survival rate in our facility Camp Bastion in 2010 well we were better than that it was about 98 to 99 percent Marine came in with a heart beating he made it out the back door a lot so the the facilities the system devised was terrific well-designed it seemed as though the busier we got the better we did and we had great help and it was an honor to be working in both theaters and that's it any questions from any of you that are still awake [Applause] [Music] yes well I think a lot of us training so basically we train for example when we were pushed out I didn't have power I have no power to put all this in you don't need power you know quite quite frankly you know hand drill works just fine for putting external fixators in I didn't have power drills and we have anesthesia machines that work so this was designed in I don't know if he had an opportunity to go to the orthopedic academies they have a disaster response course I don't know if they're still doing that I took it four or five years ago and it's equivalent to our level 2 training course it's called a in the Navy calls it the combat extremity course and that trains you to work in an austere environment so the bottom line is when when you know I saw what was going on in Haiti what I saw was going on to Katrina what I saw what's gone what went on in the tsunamis in Indonesia and I'm going they don't really get it what they need is a level two fr SS with that pushed out in those situations are capable of working in an austere environment with no power no water self-contained and take care of business so that's just part of the training that goes and part of my training of course was to go to Morocco and set up shop in the middle of nowhere I mean we took everything with us but power we were good to go and turned out the following year they had a helicopter crash and they had some severe injuries so it was great that that came to he was there but I think we get over over foot you mean you're here in a you know and I was there in a technologic universe where you've got all this gear you're doing I did arthroscopy knees and shoulders for four years and you're you've got all this equipment and you're you're out of luck because your camera's not working here this or that well we even have all itself we just basically had standard equipment and I think you get back to basic orthopedics and you really get down to what you originally trained for it and it worked great I mean this here's a corpsman a week later his wounds are fine doing great I mean it's a massive injury is a grave injury but you really train to work in an austere environment with with little equipment and it's after a while you get used to it anything else any other questions yes so the Brit hospital is closed that I worked at that's gone Kandahar a level 3 facility that's a fixed facility the Navy is running that the Air Force is still running Bagram the Germans had had a level 2 3 facility of north and condos and I don't know about that so as the drawdown has continued they basically pulled back but Camp Leatherneck to my knowledge isn't functional but I know that Bastion I'm one of the fellows by the way the fellow who led our unit in Afghanistan who at Camp Bastion was a trunk was up Shock Trauma trained general surgeon from Bethesda and he ended up closing Bastion and they when they did that they just set up a very austere surgical capability in a hand as they were leaving as the last Marines were were leaving Afghanistan so it's basically they're still they're still care available and I think when I talked to one of surgeons from Balboa they were mostly taking care of Afghans so that they you know they think you're whoever comes through the door makes no difference adopts detainee Afghan civilian you're doing the same thing you don't distinguish you do your stuff well thank you very much it's great to be here [Applause]", "nhhcki9Z7Xg": "you you you you you I mean food stream you you good evening to everyone and welcome to today's session Barry Allen [Music] is a white cloud and clear Barry Allen ravi kumar priyanka projector sweetie Shalini and many more over all online welcome to cha-cha-cha with dr. Morley barrage on this wonderful evening can you please punt whether the voice is loud and clear continuing our discussion on the leaf PG question Bank in the last 15 years the next topic of interest the most high-yield topic frequently asked a topic is all about seizures if eight questions come in Neurology without the question on seizures there is no question paper is what you need to remember that's good now what is the treatment of choice so the generalized tonic-clonic seizures that you see in pregnancy lamotrigine is considered to be a safe drug let's quickly run through the seizures what a simple partial seizures are what the meaning of that simple means there is no loss of consciousness partial because they are arising from one single focus in the brain and typically the seizures will be tipping from one part of the body to the other which is called a Jacksonian March is what you need to remember the simple partial seizures they involve one side of the brain their lungs for about 20 to 60 seconds and there is no change in the consciousness but how do you want to manage the partial seizures and the generalized tonic-clonic seizures the preferred drug of the partial seizures any day is carbamazepine but calm about the pain in the young girls is not preferred I mean it is the one it is preferred instead of the night owing because of the cosmetic effects if you happen to use the phenytoin a lot of visible hyperplasia and the skin there all the challenges which are not dead with the carbamazepine now valproate is a wonderful dad the drug preferred in tDCS but in children if you want the new valproate you should remember happy to toxicity now what are the radius it is a lamotrigine gabapentin the parameter comes to be good as new now if you take the GDC as the first choice any day is carbamazepine phenytoin val create phenobarbital our second choice lamotrigine gabapentin propeller made premiered on Liberty the system all this you can be able to add on to this primary drugs like carbamazepine and phenytoin is what the interpretive empire complex partial seizures pay there is a loss of consciousness autumn and isms will be there and the last between 30 seconds to 2 minutes consciousness is impaired and the patient looks confused or inappropriate with a desert behavior that characterized the complex partial seizures generally we use carbamazepine first then I join our valve rate refractory cases we do limited I see Tom llamas the change of a pending proper amazing journey so much then what are absent is the people say the child is looking through me he's not looking at me that is the absent teacher is what you need to remember they last less than 40 minutes they'll be postural tonic changes and there will be autonomic phenomena that happen in the absence seizures you can do it Oh Sookie my Dorval crate but Val crate is most commonly used because if you use valper 8 in absence you can prevent the emergence of the daily CFC is what you need to remember glamour twitter is a good alternative if you want a sustained response Club Assam can very much be given so Val parade is a first choice ito sucks amide in lamotrigine of the second choice in the case of the absent features then it comes the atoning it also called a kinetic epilepsy the patient may suddenly fall down then myoclonic seizures a typical trail who has myoclonic seizures will be suddenly falling down there false alarm spells are the classical feature of the myoclonic seizures now doctor if you look at the management of the myoclonic and atonic seizures valproate is a preferred drug la mode treated is a preferred alternative and you can add the pyramid and lever to the season so for the myoclonic and a tonic what is the drug that should stay in your mind the tomorrow's exam valproate is contributed best and limited I see Tom and clonazepam you can add to evaporate in case of the myoclonic seizures is what you need to remember finally comes the state\u00eds epilepticus when they call it a state with ability if it is lasting more than 30 minutes he is considering the important definition to call it that status which is a medical emergency now one of the favorite questions were asked in the entrance fees what do you try first then next then next in case of the status epilepticus so this you have to remember once more in the tomorrow's exam January 6th then P whether I need PD 2019 exam fill up ready hosana you will remember me in exam hall when they ask a question on status epilepticus typical management you give learners a pound 0.1 milligram per kg intravenously and at a speed of two milligram per minute if you Ralph am is not available then you can give diazepam or phenytoin IV and nowadays phosphonate Owen is being preferred but if there is no response to pain a toy then you know Barbie tone is used which is 100 to 200 milligram if the seizure is continuing then you should be ready to give general anesthesia with the propofol or thiopental at the last resort is what you need to altum Utley remember so doctor all these lists of drugs in status epilepticus management and then those idiots also on the favorite question of the examiner which you should not forget now what are the newer anti-epileptics lamotrigine gabapentin topiramate lever to the sit down John Issa might be a job in become a spring you should be doubly sure about Oh none the c'mon nay Harker thank you very much for a small donation good good two days back I just introduced the super tag feature just for fun whether it is working or not I really don't mean it thank you for all the guys who are very affectionately donating hundred or two hundred bucks thank you so much but you really need need not do that you know you all come to the class every day you bring your friends to the class every day I am the happiest and I always tell my colleagues recently in the association of physicians of India when we met one of the senior physician his son is also attending in your group he said that doctors about you are we are all treating malaria and typhoid sitting in the opening at the time you are taking the responsibility to create the more knowledgeable new doctors so the greatest gift you all have given to me is to be with me to give me an opportunity to study along with you and spend a wonderful evening with you yes now doctor how do you what do you what are the five points you should know about Lambeth within the Lamott regions mechanism is similar to that of the carbamazepine but it should not be used in children it's a broad spectrum anti-epileptics it has a half-life of 24 hours which is a very very important feature and it is vetted Holliday tail then carbamazepine or phenytoin and good thing is there is no negative effect on the cognitive function especially children if you want to use any anti epileptic they become very drowsy become very difficult to manage in the school so we always look forward for that anti epileptic which does not affect the cognitive ability of the child and lamotrigine has that special privilege is fortunate to basically remember then coming to the gaba printing gabapentin it is a add on to the first line of drug and it reduces the fusion frequency in refractory partial seizures and it can even be given as a monotherapy top animate is fundamentally a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that is very very important Ravi asks a very good question cup of the main Supremes half-life somebody should check Wikipedia and quickly update him yeah but were they the old question please remember only will the old question remember otherwise don't that is the most important thing you should be quite limited too what are the things must do remember you should be very sure so I hope most of you have downloaded the umineko app using the new notes feature yesterday there were a little technology bucks there all slides all topics same DVD was coming because the problem in the database but they have corrected that they have fix it that bug and now you can check you are having all the nearly around 70-thousand the PowerPoint slides which we used in all our lectures are all available you can go bookmark it and then get the reminders notifications of the theme I hope you will all enjoy that please give me a feedback how the notes feature is helping you write in the humid eco app no dr. Topol image is also a weak carbonic anhydrase inhibitor Unisa might also especially in refractory powerful features which is the one which is yeah Snowbird Vani is asking where to download the what is the Google Play Store type you medico and you get the app just download it and you can start using the feature somebody help dr. Snowbird money to download the you medical app new version then Leavitt is a sitcom it is three of many drug interactions that is one of the major advantage which you should basically remember it is used increasing increasingly common in complex partial seizures myoclonic epilepsy etcetera and it suppresses the Kindle the seizures which is one of the special effect yeah so dimanche factor is saying if Lana Britain does not affect the cognitive function wide is not referred in children once more you need to look at the entire of the city profile like if those equipment is very effective but either six made you cannot hear because of its effect on the vision and the children cannot report it so similarly the overall property profile doesn't make it the limited asset arm so I mean the lamotrigine not a preferred one right now ta da bin big about three how did about Tia Harbin potentiates the gaba it is added as a add-on to the partial derivative seizures raghava are three needy limits the gaba transaminase and it is effective in refractory epilepsy is what you need to remember so in summary if you look at the top image it is safe in pregnancy very high response rate main advantage name disadvantage it has got a CNS adverse effects and a renal disease you need to decrease the dosage of tapa domain and it is one of the broad spectrum efficiency if you can see kind of a antiepileptic is what they were to ultimately remember now what are the neurological manifestations of the ripples disease is a very important question you have seizures as a presenting feature of the people so the people is involving the guide there are also a neurological effects of the Ripple's so dementia ophthalmoplegia myoclonus altered level of consciousness hypothalamic dysfunction then psychiatric anomalies abroad maladies and seizures ataxia they're all considered to be the important effects of tea the ripples from the CNS is what you need to remember if you have status epilepticus want is considered to be the drug of choice is the favorite question of the exam any given day it is a lot as a farm and you should know what is the dosage of the lollipop now what are the best dragon but the photosensitive epilepsy was the question in need the PG 2014 and 2015 so you should remember it is a valid for a if you look at the sodium valproate what's the mechanism it blocks the activated sodium channels not the one who turn existing state please don't it enhanced the garbha synthesis it reduced the degradation of the gaba it suppresses the glutamate action in blogs that the type of the calcium channels which is considered to be the important part of the mechanism and other than epilepsy where do you use it is another favorite question about 40 ml 3 bipolar disorders prophylaxis of migraine lennox-gastaut syndrome they are the places where throat about previously then in the Epilepsy almost all forms of epilepsy you can use value do Decius absent its complex partial myoclonic a tonic photosensitive epilepsy either epilepsy came aramaic question i have our options main pal thread rojito if you ever on the side of valproate it is not going to ditch you be very sure about my appraised now when FC seizures in all Commission's use exchanges where CMB cryptococcal meningitis toxoplasmosis that all the videos parasitic infections fungal infections viral infections which can lead to the development of the seizure 'la for our disease what is incorrect about lab for our species you have myoclonus autosomal recessive inheritance DNA sequencing will help you to diagnose the l'Opera okay penny what is Lapua or they claim LaPorta disease may you have see here say myoclonus high or dementia appealing all the thing it's called a juvenile in myoclonus because the onset is in the adalah fence between 10 to 18 years it is rapidly progressive death occurs before 25 years and headache difficulty to work in the school work doing schoolwork and generalized seizures visual hallucination they're all the problems in case of the Buddha so myoclonus seizures hallucinations which gradually worsen and become in fact remember dr. metabolic disorders neurological disorders psychiatric disorder unfortunately they are all expected without knowing the metabolic or a neurological basis if the psychiatrist fitra psychiatric disease continuously that there will be missing a point so that is the reason you should have that your you prepare for so many things and become a MD right should always remember that since you read all this high-yield topics tomorrow when you become a MD dermatology or MD pathology or MD neurology all this basic awareness helps a lot in that speciality which you are going to become great okay everyone offers ultimately I want to become great please remember that you are born to become great all of the it was decided six years back when we got in medical school and they became a doctor medical students that day only or the great as you are out of millions you are the one who is being collected by the natural selection of Darwin that's the reason you became a medical student in the doctor is only a little more everyday greatness that only comes when you are clinically practicing and that is what you are striving for so there's a reason doctor make your heart strong say that I am the one who will be chosen by the Almighty to become the grave and hence I became a medical student and this is only one more test that I'm passing coordinate teaching the moment you think that that way and make the best use of the next 25 days I am very sure January 6th Chabad they are going to break a champagne and celebrate a victory as outcome that should be the goal so now doctor what is lacrosse this is glycogen due to the mutation will form a lack of body and this left rewarding unable to metabolize will lead to collection in the brain and lead to the development of epilepsy dementia except etc is what you have to basically remember now doctor this glycogen can become a laugher in hyper phosphorylated like Adele that form the label left for a body which will initiate the neuronal apoptosis epilepsy that constitute the LaFrance disease is what need to be remember so what type of mutation is it it's a horrible recessive mutation and a joke haunted is 8 to 18 and there's a cognitive regression today my cloning Derek's visual hallucinations and ataxia dysarthria mood disorder of sexify etcetera which are responsible which are typically seen in the last issue if you're having to do the biopsy you can be able to see the in the liver the presence of these hyper phosphorylated glycogen deposits which are called as the leprous bodies is fortunate to remember so doctor today preparation is very easy to have all this images all these videos everything in the Google so that's the reason whenever you are getting bored watch one myoclonic seizure if you want to look at how means in the real time real scenario status epilepticus patient will others if um they be 8 though he calm down if you want to see even that video is there in the youtube so there is a reason youtube google has made the knowledge easy at your fingertips but what is needed motivation to utilize them and then until the end of the game reading every day preparing every day and filling all the gaps that is the need of yoga so how does happen a present and we already discussed it is in the form of a myoclonic epilepsy excellent so their premise we t sudan shukla everyone is right it is a my own clothing epilepsy it presents and where do you find l'Opera bodies you can see examiner K pushing bank may server may libera by decay after day three here they are pooja madam hey and he left for our tahoe time so that is the reason you should prepare with an intention what example is going to ask right so every year consistently leftovers us so it is a juvenile progressive myoclonic epilepsy is watching it to remember we're a case Antoni a body's where do you find them we're okay Anthony a body schwannomas so there are two types of growth pattern in anima one is called Anthony a very long gated cytoplasmic processes arranged like a fascicle with a very little stromal Maddox and Anthony B is a loose meshwork of cells with mix oeid and micro cystic changes that is Anthony be Varick lowing better koi body they are typically found in Anthony a so this is how a Anthony a patent typically looks like where you can see the elongated cells present like arrangement rolls of bicycles that is what you are able now where you see retrograde amnesia right Robbie rasping which type of sea hurts in lepida myoclonic now retrograde how many CI seen in temporal lobe epilepsy so we have discussed to it already that if you look at the temporal lobe epilepsy how is it present there will be Ora 90% of times hora will be there some epigastric sensation with the rising character very not specifically patients present sometimes like a fear like a DejaVu like a nonspecific sensation a fire burning autonomic changes that's how it presents so alpha-3 gustatory hora they're all the presenting features is what you need to remember then visual and auditory will not be found in the temporal lobe epilepsy what you find is olfactory and gustatory aura and also there is a development of retrograde amnesia in case of temporal lobe epilepsy so something is asking what is retrograde amnesia remembering that we did not qualify in the needa PG 2018 forgetting that five is called retrograde anterograde amnesia December 25th you study the topic of hypertension and that question came on let us say December - January 2019 need PD after hypertension Tia hey boy gay that is anterograde recent memories is anterograde what is the gender specific side-effect of valve h you should remember PCOD polycystic ovarian disease the valve rate Kapoor decide affects tips Marin Amira by weight the game dose related from a transient head launch if you still have some hair polycystic ovarian disease bone loss ankle swelling and moles to severe side effects gives hepatotoxicity is what you need to basically remember and any increase offer as G voting is a sign of the liver damage what you need to follow neonatal seizures what is the drug of choice this is a question I asked it cleans 2,000 times in the last 15 years various entrance exam so be very sure it is a phenobarbital in neonatal seizures a typical febrile seizures what are they associated with possible typical several teachers out there or complex sobriety the power a typical tablet Jesus called ahead icky right if there is any focal or gender lines and prolonged seizure the Braille official of adoration more than fifteen minutes recurring more than once in 24 hours or it has a postictal neurological abnormalities like for signal pal see then that is called a complex the break is not a simple one but a complex otherwise a typical the Brian Fisher so simple febrile seizures and their typical sobriety a bit macabre echo that most commonly it is a typical febrile seizure where a child is being drawn by the mother who where the tail is having fever very high-grade fever and he's having seizures they're very apprehensive cow that Abeyta Jin Nagisa mom Lena hey can doctor anti-epileptics so what will it'll have no don't worry typical suggests Abdel fizzle high-temperature cabinets yeah ahead a check temperature control kuru cold tepid sponging kuru bring down the temperature after raja beta but a bank a mall bonita that's what you had to tell the mother we show her she will cry on your shoulder and go and that is most important and so this one harmon a fake use doctor for every clinical condition as doctors it is just a small diagnosis but firm the patient a new lights farms heal starts living with the disease to live with something you should learn how to live with it you should know what it is that's a reason very good educator patients about common a fake use that they have when a diagnosis is being final like maltose process limited arthritis how the medicines work that is all very important so we have a youtube channel similar to this called as pure chat kyo-chan see you are mostly healthy kyo-chan so i will send you the link walls of the puritan so please subscribe to that link tell you also promote it and share it with your friends from tomorrow onwards i am starting the patient education series freely to the patient and there are about forty thousand medical consultants globally who are ready to come for a live talk show with me then i will be anchoring the session asking them the patient's questions and they will be answering some from the london so I'm in California some in New York some in New Delhi Mumbai top consultants in our network so morning turn into evening 8 p.m. there are about 10 shows that we run and we want to help every month we landed on three and it shows on the kuro-chan YouTube channel common questions how to take use a table Iser and is it good or bad - take him to him defintiely laelia those addiction hoja Tatia lot of patience patience we have as doctors we don't get time so there is a reason we started this YouTube channel called kuro-chan please go to that subscribe to it and then promote it and also give a talk show where I will anchor you it show with you tomorrow when you join the MD right now with neuro developmental abnormalities it is no more called simple febrile seizure the age range at virtually febrile to have simple after is between six months to five years please remember the Braille readers do not have to below six months that's very very important to be remembered right yes something is saying purify not the Apple Kuro not purify it is purochan see you are go see her 380 euro check please in the YouTube you type euro chat it will give you the YouTube channel you can subscribe to that and then participate in the life top shows write help top shows then duration less than 15 minutes are typically is the nature of simple febrile seizure now what's the most common abnormality yes most common electrolyte abnormalities causing seizures in hospitalized patients ah Don is asking if it for patient proper exist doctor and patient more or less are same in the modern days of the information era right so that is the reason sometimes patients are more knowledgeable they will tell you maybe I don't have indication for a total knee replacement I will do it after there is a narrowing of the internal articular space interacting like space after doing a CPR MRI if they say no he'll be kinda oh my god this much knowledge they have able to indications contraindications and complications all because of the information era right that's good now you should remember that in the hospital lines and patients very commonly hyponatremia is the most common district likely we are leading to the development of the seizure is fortunate to remember so one inspite know Lipsy is a yeah karna JDP saying there are only 35 subscribers serbia now we are starting still today only we started so please all of you click on subscribe and that way I can have another 15 20 thousand subscribers in no time you will keep getting notifications on the live help top shows I got some of the top cardiologists neurologists the prodigious across the world who are ready to come and participate in the description of the case studies of the patient okay now so hyper Lipsy means a skater's absentee here is called as Pikeville FC so if you look at the absent cheaters they are less than 30 seconds information six to eight years with a common age inattentive student is the way they are recognized hyperventilation precipitates and 3 Hertz spike in slow wave pattern classical of the absent teachers is what we need to remember sweetie is asking what is meant by Fife ellipse itself it is a status epilepticus of absence assurances for this Pike my lips if the attentions are happening we currently within a single day under time 60 times 50 times that's called fight Alexei now yeah except ik meningitis can any duckin lead to drugs can they lead to a septic meningitis is a very important question ibuprofen is the most common in the side that is most frequent cause of their septic meningitis is what we to remember in premium what are the important series of findings is my question to all of you Thank You candidate for subscribing to the kuro-chan time please share it with your friends everybody family other family members right yes so you should remember that there is a lymphocytosis low sugar high protein that is what you find so typically if you look at the TBM straw-colored see yourself no organism protein is around 250 and glucose is typically low type of like array here just like back to the meningitis in the cytology lymphocytes will be 70% and a DA will be around 3.4 and more is what should he do remember so this is one table doctor you should not forget you should not do a mistake in the tomorrow's Inc that bacterial versus viral versus fungal versus P here opening pressure bacterial main soup nickel Geiger abkhazia cell very high even premium on the Bolivian see counties between thousand to ten thousand in bacterial whereas in case of my rate is less than 300 neutrophilic predominance is a feature of the backfill meningitis protein typically is 150 to 200 in CBM and hundred to five hundred but normal in viral meningitis glucose you find a - like a here less than 40 less than 40 in CBM fungal and bacterial but viral may pilot us don't need the sugar in the CSF so it is more than 40 Gram stain is typically 60 to 90 percent positive in battle meningitis and culture typically TBM and battle meningitis may 70 to 85 percent it will be culture for with you whereas fungal it is 25 to 50 percent culture positive is what we need to remember now car cinema address many natives why does it what is the most common cause brain is my question to Allah it is a constant my breast breast cancer around 34% lung cancer following that is 26% so breast cancer is considerably the most common cause for the consumer breast is what you need to remember so this is an example a patient 57 year old woman came to the emergency with the altered consciousness there is a regular enhancement of the dura mater so the dura mater is enhanced that means there is a constant of - meningitis and car - the matter the invasion of the meninges is fortunate to remember Mulla rates meningitis what are all the five to six points that you know about molar it's meningitis you should remember that it is caused by the herpes simplex type 2 in most of the cases so it is a recurrent information and they'll be recurrent episode so today meningismus fever and the CSF Clio's hypothesis and there are large endothelial cells in the CSF put is very very important feature and epidermoid cyst sin the CL nurse they also can nourish the moderates minute it is but very frequently it is to to the HSV I to is what unity remember so recurrent episodes of meningitis spontaneous remission of symptoms and episodes of symptom free periods and fever for not always present and transient neurological symptoms but no permanent neurological sequelae and it is the hf sweet to what is implicated in moderates meningitis is fortunate to remember a 32-year ball HIV positive female lumbar Ponton shows leukocytes more than hundred india ink stain it for the view what is your answer will jump and Ansel Cryptococcus meningitis India into positivity tomorrow examiner is going to few emails base for the question lot of times he gave about the Cryptococcus now about the PBL once for a favorite question lead PG 2015 and 16 so CSF has got lymphocyte ik predominance and the count is high remaining at all through culture of the CSF is a gold standard and it is also seen in young children but also develops in adults most often in young children and there will be evidence of old pulmonary infections malaria pattern where the dissemination happened to the cns they're all the features of Pina which type of meningitis you use steroids is a examiner's favorite question Haemophilus influenzae meningitis may other steroids try stemologica it oh there is a great chance that it can be to neurological sequiny like definite success so if you say trait infants remain in Vegas five points you should know number one what is producing less than six years eight what people subtype of simopoulos influenza capsular pile B causes more than 90% of invasive if the dangerousness in danger I be and what are the prettiest posing factors for the development of pitch influenza - no - no patria Fatiha steroids are they used they are also used in PBM absolutely don't forget DBM may call it DB medicine section Safina yoga dexamethasone methylprednisolone either up da toe he even your P matrix will have a penetration to the brain is what you need to appreciate now Robbie is very very uhh anxious about aura and postictal state big deals up there or are you with the head a feeling that I know all these people the surroundings and all that that is aura but if you look at the person after having the seizure either they will have confusion or they will be running away without knowing anything what you think or they will be lying down dull unable to move their hand with weakness which is called thoughts fallacy they are all called postictal phenomena is watering to understand the way yeah now ah no no not a trader please go and say that Ravi is my most favorite student always what we are not very sure no small thing right there which were clear carretoni humko or anxiety Nikola then only you will become a topper you should have the tank whatever you why do you know this why do you know this then only you will get that always tension anxiety of the exam should become a driving force to prepare let me tell ya so now treatment how do you treat steroids dexamethasone and antibiotics IV they are the ones which are preferably administered of course all the P one my favorite students no doubt on that but I want you to get clarity before you go to the exam only you should know except the topic I know what is going to come what is not there I need to bother what are my weak points what are my good points first you should know that is important pneumococcal meningitis the big you for about 14 days is the duration for the Streptococcus pneumoniae 10 to 14 days I'd Chile and her miss area seven days listeria 14 to 21 days even a collectively then Sudama has 21 days epidermidis 21 days and what is the drug of choice this is a favorite question of the examiner this area infections pneumococcal infections is all absoluta Dorgan isn't what they are typically seen in the terminal complement component pathway deficiency here's what you need to remember this reason c5 c6 c7 there were four terminal complement components the patient is having headache nuchal rigidity normal glucose with a clear CSF there are 50 lymphocytes lymphocyte agree your side offices what is your diagnosis once more ATP need pitching 2015 question classical of viral meningitis normal glucose means no hyperbaric here that means she will jump and answer it turns the viral meningitis most of them are benign self-limited they give si clavier purgatives p1 + 2 video ganciclovir and post kermit as a maintenance dose for the CMB meningitis these are the things that you need to remember no patient has what a headache fever neck rigidity sugar is 60 protein in 68 opening pressure 190 have to do percent lymphocytes when all these clues are there what do you think without i public or IKEA normal should that is a leading differentiator lymphocytosis with the low sugar is equal to TB m lymphocyte office with the normal sugar is equal to in the CSF is equal to the viral and that is called the key virus is what you are going to answer so once monitor in viral meningitis there is a lymphocytic predominant and is what you need to appreciate now is no philic meningitis all the conditions that lead to it except so you should know any metastasis leptomeninges metastasis helminthic infections cookie-dough my glasses they're all considered with the causes of is no filling meaning right is what you are able to see here classically it cryptococcal meningitis spaceship with left a fronto-parietal area getting involved with a enhancement of the meninges is what you are able to appreciate now in pneumococcal meningitis what is the drug that you give empirically is a very important question so don't forget doctor many natives empirical three infective endocarditis empirical treatment you should be 100% sure about these topics if you look at the Streptococcus pneumoniae Masseria fit in but these three what is the initial therapy of the subtraction and vancomycin by commencing buying because for a better streptococcal coverage Listeria monocytogenes either hypo you should add ampicillin if there is a mr LCA Sudirman are typically for cervical neurological patients are a skull trauma patients switch to separate zone to SEPA fine or meropenem then what are the agent two measures you add dexamethasone especially pneumococcal I think Lee and her PBM in all the scenarios which will reduce the death then you know how to isolate we're droplet isolation is done their patience here on sweets needs another until meningococcus is ruled out and that is a most important thing now what is the treatment of choice for the Listeria meningitis is a important question by the examiner I am very happy to see 205 online viewers on this wonderful winter evening of December right all our life is fulfilled with the sharing of the knowledge always remembered of when we were born on this planet there is a deal of delivery to do that God census so the reason when you are spending your birthday is marriage this engagement days but still you are in hospital doing the duty think that this is for what I have been delivered by the god invisible God so when you teach when I teach also I feel every day evening it is the purpose for which we have been delivered and we keep delivering that purpose until we are alive so that is the spirit with what you should so while preparing for need feeding what will you think it is the purpose to become a MD to become DM cardiology DM neurology that I have been born my hands are created to become a plastic surgeon career as a surgeon and I'm just delivering what I am bonfire with that spirit you've got a reading room everything becomes easy if you are born for that you will win it that's a simple thing right so Listeria meningitis treatment of choice is ampicillin is what connected it on that now don't if you look at the Listeria meningitis please go and forget this ampicillin for at least 3 weeks gentamicin is added especially in critically ill patients and you use in pencil analytic people time is the operands helper methoxy soul is the one who has given every six of us the next topic that comes over is prion disease so what do you know about three-on-three on is not a virus freon is not the bacteria not a DNA or the mycoplasma it is a altered configuration and structure of the protein which makes it pathological so infectious protein he's a 1 what you see will the prion so there's a prion protein alpha-helical 30s sensitive then this becomes the resistant prion which is a beta created sheath in 30 is the sustained is what you need to remember spongiform encephalopathy if you happen to look into the brain in astrology you find spongiform changes so when you see in case of prion disease it's fortunate to basically remember so if you look at the human prion disease there's a death of neuron cells death of glial cells amyloid plaque formation and spongiform changes in the brain tissue in the tomorrow's exam examiner is going to give you but spongiform astrology and ask you looking at it what do you remember you should think oh three on it's something that I will remember now with regard to the prions what is except about it is my question to all of you they can be inherited they can be transmitted within especially human growth hormone preparations and they can occur sporadically and they can be transmitted by a corneal transplant also is what you need to remember with regard to the prion now kruk's melts jackets disease what is an important change that you see in the brain the spongiform changing brain because the prion disease the word spawn deforms should go and sit in your brain once one need if he did 2015 may spawn deform the generation where do we see is the examiners push it is the crux well it's Jacob's disease is what you should remember now cannibalism if the NEET PG examiner gets a brain biopsy what will he get docked it what what are the changes you'll see on different ages because he's the biggest cannibal sitting there allowed to eat all your doctors brains huh so cannibalism so typically candy balls have cruel is the thing that you all know very well Abbi masala topic of need to be the exam today without a question on headache there is no paper and headache is also important for you to learn because Java practice you consider your first our first patient age or in the antique who is the avoid Volta aqui dr. Humberts I made that the way I could Corona so if you happen to give a medicine headache the vengo know who that Dounia Cabo Liga yeah I will talk to her further the drinker maybe is Canadian so there's the reason always remembered of them tomorrow in the war P there are certain subsets of your patients spend an extra or extra mile to make them happy do you think you don't do that if you do that they will become your ambassadors to promote you brand imbalance if you make them to their expectations pain they will see that you close the clinic and run away that is that is for guarantee so headache oh you should know everything shoot out two months very Bry typically is caused by water the underlying causes between the air toxicity obesity sudden stopping of the speedo H they're all the predisposing factors for the to determine cerebri but is also called idiopathic intracranial hypertension so there's elevated intracranial pressure more than printing but when do you call it as a sewer too much they should know impress any almas no hydric happiness no infection without that if there is any high headache that becomes your tumor that's reason most of time pseudotumor cerebri if the diagnosis of exclusion is what you need to remember now with regard to the treatment of migraine very important question so what are the drugs that you want to use neither Krypton acts longer than sumatriptan sumatriptan is used in the acute attack but not for the chronic migraine sumatriptan acts on the serotonin receptors in the great results is what we to remember so click tongs are a very crucial part of the clinical management of the McGrane so how does it basically act the paths they're going not from 5hp one B by the receptor they prevent the peptide release and that lead to vasodilation neurogenic inflammation and pain so that is very very important and they act on the cranial vasculature by a ht1 B D receptor and they need to vasoconstriction which is the underlying mechanism for the pathan is what we need to remember now McGrane ball necklace what are the diagnostic criteria number one more than five attacks lasting four to 72 hours and it should be unilateral or bilateral probably moderate to severe intensity and if you do routine physical activity there is an aggravation which is important part of the definition and there should be more than one of the following nausea or vomiting photophobia Arcana phobia these are the important components to call the grain and know the reason to attribute that today is what you need to remember two types of migraine I hope those who have downloaded you medical app already we discussed in the high-yield topic theory except atop its cup and also you have videos in the DMV last athenaeus question bank topic whites subject Weiss discussed a note should be the area I have a topic headache our topic there are little leaky lug Mohito just go back to you medical add courses then go to the DMV and then medicine neurology in that you have the nodes and also the video yeah so that is very very important so big rain without aura is called common migraine with aura is called classic me so focal neurological symptoms if they proceed or sometimes accompany that today then you basically thing with this called migraine with aura which is called classic negative so how do you treat the grain is a very very important question acetaminophen aspirin coffee Wow rocket trader gives a very good logo chai betcha that's good so it's a time in open aspirin Cathy simple analysis pipette tip directly in the sights naproxen ibuprofen they are the ones which are also yeah yes Mitch I heard Stephen a grenade spews sorry today totally you do algorithm I never tripped on they just ripped on sumatriptan almost ripped on Velma trip an oral nationally you can use sumatriptan the old meet with Ron and I had Roberta much parenterally dihedral gratifying and even sumatriptan can be given current relief they're all the pilots p1 agonist is a very very important question then what are the dopamine antagonists that we give for the treatment of the written in agonies dopamine antagonists orally you can do prochlorperazine and metoclopramide parenterally chlorpromazine metoclopramide and prochlorperazine then the sometimes we use combination it's a time in open dichloro Farrah's on and I somet the thing attempting then naturally you can give you torque and all parenterally not putting now suppose if you are using in the sides and I'll just six fish it is not improving then what are the first retired drugs then slow ear effect but better tolerable the drugs and if it is not that frequent as the classical McGrane in that situation what do you want to do so sumatriptan almost diphthong result returned all three plans are fundamentally thought to be the first retire and Timmy grain drugs if there is a failed in the side says what you need to basically remember then you the patient is having vomiting as a major symptom of the McGrane then Djalma tripped on natural spring sumatriptan subterraneous li can be given probably be the menses related headache then to prevent you can give a river to mine for orally and treatment you can use with tongues and die hydro a goodbye and suppose if the symptoms are developing very rapidly then you can use all with lift on Sumatra front thigh head to it but the mind is what we told to me t remember then next important question acute episode Kelly a tripped on size of this tomography prevention Kelly a chronic prophylaxis Kelly what are the anti McGrane drugs that we use is the favorite version of The Examiner beta-blockers like corporate law preventive hi cycling's like amitriptyline ah tripoli in d\u00fcsseldorf slipping then anticonvulsants like topiramate valkyrie in java painting and centimetric drugs like betty subgradient already seen is what they took ultimately remember now what are the various metabolic causes so doctor please remember one of the important point that we should McGrane treatment tonight only you should make it a emergency session and then review it in the you may require you need to bookmark it set up reminders and be ready equip refer the tomorrow's exam okay now with all the metabolic causes of the headache hyponatremia hypercapnia hypoxia it is the hypoglycemia is the underlying cause what are the contraindications for the three thoughts Amarinder say sir I had a speed-up feature in America after you I will try I'll talk to my developers to add that feature since I got the same request for them a good number of students so you should give me a feedback are you enjoying that notifications reminders and the notes feature in the you medico or not you click on the video you are you have that relevant video of that topic so that is dead and many more question banks in jippy then PGI all the question Bank discussions that we had both notes and videos are getting uploaded you are going to enjoy the you medica fully yeah now so much Lipton we should remember that it's creamy cadres pregnancy and bits alarm agree so contraindications for sumatriptan is a very important question yes Coverley artery disease and ischemic cardiac they are the contraindications then returns can be too familiar tree vasospasm arrhythmias and they have a lot of interaction with SSRIs and neuro inhibitors now what is the cause of the primary headache out of all this is a very important Bush McGrane cluster headaches tension headaches they're all called as the primary today is fortunate to the member so that is the part of the story yes can you load the continuation yes you alarum is not working in notes yaaaaa I understand pintle but you can toggle the slides by flipping under your finger have appreciated that feature is working and now our guys are making it how to read that note slides if you happen to turn the phone also in a big way where you can be able to spread it in reading okay yeah let's complete few more questions before we go to the quiz the next topic of choice in the need PG examiner's agenda raised I'm sipping when you serious racing the predisposing factors our inspiration will rise ICT then copying will Silva maneuver anything can rise me I sleep when you have arrived ICT today confusion shallow breathing increased BP and nausea they're all the classical features No what are the various cover surprised I City any intricately hemorrhage vasculitis neoplasm hydro carefully pseudotumor cerebri hyper adrenal ism attitude sickness outdated tetracyclines if you take no outdated tetracyclines patients will develop her to the tumor cerebral and with a mini intoxication also all of the causes for the development of pseudotumor cerebri is fortunately remember a patient after an accident was unconscious unilateral pupillary dilatation what is the main reason for this is an important question typically when there is unilateral people read eyelid ation for example if there is any fracture there's a bleed and a bleed will push the brain and make the transplant oriole combination of the uncle when it harm eh it will push the brain stem to the opposite side and from the midbrain the opposite side oculomotor will be coming out and that becomes compressed is what we need to understand so that is how the uncle Fermi's if select Wilfred policy if see lateral hemiplegia where you see we see it in case of the uncle herniation classically whenever the tentorium whenever the temporal lobe of the temporal lobe hunters have made it will push the brainstem and lead to the compression of the oculomotor nerve coming go to the midbrain and also in the midbrain the descending pyramidal tract also is involved and so that's reason there is a development of any pleasure where is the bun syndrome what is the feature already we discussed that deep penetrating branches of the posterior cerebral artery will lead to the development of the birth syndrome so what are the features of it it is a dorsal midbrain what is involved and through the door film it Dre in the a dorsal midbrain you have hurricanes on Europeans so there is development of EPs electril third cranial nerve palsy and the descending pyramidal tract descends to the midbrain pons medulla goes to the opposite side so that is the reason contralateral hemiplegia EPSA lateral vertical nucleus because of the dorsal mid brain injury because of the conscious simple arteries penetrating branches in the midbrain they got a fluid and leads to the development of the members is what we do remember my clock Lucien favorite question of the exam you will all remember it is a little better rates in the role of the villain by transplant Oriole herniation you can see how important are these for the need Fiji examiner what are the important features there's absolute or hemiplegia [Music] chain strokes respiration hips electril dilated pupils they are the classical features what you see in case of her transplant or eel or the uncle aviation if what we to understand so if you look at the various types of permeation CNS formations there is one sub pal sign herniation there's a fall celebrate known of their operating the hemispheres when there is a sub fall sign variation then it little today and this is the area typical of undress a black tree Tedric cerebral all its area this is the underfill article and itself largely Auckland in Macau a contralateral lower limb the mana of Paris's further mode bar discuss country Facebook so you have a contralateral lower limber weakness leg weakness if the the sub pal sign honey transient toriel may off-limit repulsing which is a chelator dilated pupil will be read and contralateral hemiparesis will be there is what you need to remember and tonsillar can syllable of Consular permeation agoraphobia though often Dacian pressure will be in a semi-comatose stage is a classical feature now yay waves in intracranial pressure monitoring what did they indicate well I interacted in high pressure monitoring Miriam's possible care from ala Moana who Smith then he a wave quwata editing he receiving brain herniation so normal intracranial pressure power monitor Torito taka waves there is one p1 representing arterial pulsations p2 which is called a tidal wave which represents the complaints of the impact cranial space p3 is dicrotic wave representing the closure of the aortic valve these are the three important waves that you find in the normal inter-cranial pressure waveform is what they remember then you have Lundberg a base what are the Lundberg a base otherwise called to actuate is a name given whenever there is a reduced intracranial compliance then the amplitude of the waves become very high fifty two hundred millimeters of mercury and a longer duration five to ten minutes and they are called the Lundberg a waves is what you have to basically remember so this is how a Lundberg a way typically look like what is having a high amplitude is what you later remember so if this is a normal ICP wave form p1 p2 p3 wave sometimes PMON is elevated amplitude increases in hypertensives hypertension also will have rise I city right but abnormal ICP with increase the pulsation or brain complaints will lead to Lundberg shavings then if the amplitude of the p2 is increased means there is some mass or a congested brain inside the calvarium that is the meaning of a aggravated p2 wave is what you have to remember so p1 is percussion wave p2 is tidal wave p3 is diacritic wave and how a complaint versus non complaint non from brain brain wave p2 become elevated that's what you had to basically remember now what is wrong about mannitol is a very very important question so doctor 226 online students on board crucial game so mannitol if you look at the mannitol getting places for cerebral oxygen delivery it if they're the prolonged usage it can lead to blood brain barrier damage using cerebral edema all of you know very well so that all the true statements if there is a intern who has never used on written a prescription of mannitol then you have not done the internship only so after road traffic accident blood pressure is 90 by 60 but the heart rate is around 56 ppm so what is the inference of you is the examiners question so it is typically a neurogenic now you have hypovolemic distributive cardiogenic obstructive that's how you divide so if you look at the jbp hypovolemic and a neurogenic or a distributive shock make will be low but will be high in cardiogenic or obstructive shock look at the heart rate heart rate is normal or decreased in your organic shock that is what you need to remember so there is a reason in view of the 56 beats per minute we consider the shock type of shock as a neuro thick Shaw is what we need to remember now how do you manage a raised intracranial tension is a very important question we elevate the head end of the bed mannitol anesthesia there all the options so how much of head ending is elevated very important question activities is what you need to know and you need to give sedation's muscle relaxant maintain a normal cap Nia you will be hyperventilating the the patient so that you will enable carbon dioxide to leave the body and very commonly am booing is being done to bring the the normal Catholic state in hi I city patients diabetics proves amide and magadhan you need to go good seizure control normal thermia sodium balance barbecue they're all country to be the important part of the management lastly let us pick the topic of neuralgia before we go to the quiz now that's what Robbie is asking hyperventilation very much we do hyperventilation and out the carbon dioxide and maintain a normal or a low co2 levels in cases of the rise right CT patients is what you need to remember Crimmins test is done for what you are remember for the facial nerve so normally the else of a person are going to be up to more than one centimeter for five minutes speed they should form and cause a coloration so you want to know that at Qwest level of the fear you look at how much part of the split peas but think that's what you will be able to identify by the Fremont's test then which I'm your assembly 2/3 no palaces become aneurysm very close to the midbrain so there is a reason the junction of pca with ica is called become and the pecan aneurysm for sure communicating artery aneurysm lead to the development of fir no palace e-ticket Alaric's if the cranial nerve all of you know very well but now i want to ask you a question if the pic catalytics like pain happens in a younger female 21:22 what is the diagnosis that comes to your mind whoever answers this correctly is going to get the pre-need PT 2019 if you find in a young female 2223 intense pain like tick $2 X what is the diagnosis that you have so i Italia's find a good try but it is not true it is not hysteria I'll give one more clue excellent sweetie were merged in the word sweetie Verma is going to join MD take it as my word right multiple sclerosis even with a Chiltern me and our Sharma amid joy while she Kamenka hugs of understand amber hot push for me now crinoline calmly compressed in an intracranial aneurysm which one to the oculomotor most commonly the one which is complex become and it is a much fun you see how frequent is that question in the examiners question Bank it is the octal Abaddonn then millard Gubler syndrome aha Jota hey brain stem me kiss jaga pay futa hey butch cable yet say what are the presenting features is the favorite question of the examiner so it is a 16-7 when the chordal forms pons curve it cranial correlate the ventral dorsal data so ventral part chordal part of the font is involved there the sixth and seventh till the new PA on TV and that lead to obviously contralateral hemiplegia because still the pyramidal tract by passing through ponds is uncross it will go away down the medulla and then it crosses to the opposite side then it's a little lateral rectus Paris's because of the training of the six and ipsilateral facial paralysis because of the field and seven it's what can it remember which is called Millard Googlers syndrome is what- you need to go back to the Humana quad where in the notes in the DMB and the high heel topic wise brain stem syndrome in the neurology you have to go there review that video bookmark the important slides in the north very high l topic for the MD entrance very good Bobby Lee's syndrome Millard Gubler then Benedict syndrome all this you should be good now seven and ninth level this car integrity courtesy occupied tastes indefinitely this chorda tympani the branch of seven and foster one-third is where they got a range here the symmetry of the palais to know the line to their possession of nebulae to know the ninth Anelka covering here but from the broad solution is a test of what it is a test of hypoglossal is what need to be remember so if you are having a right hypoglossal witness right hypoglossal weakness when you ask a person to cross route will the I'm going to move towards the right side or to the left side the tongue will show deviation towards the right side to the side of the weakness why always the hypoglossal nerve supplies the tongue muggles which push that uncooperative in their weak opposition will push them it's level the right side it is right since ahead panco left to push now I got over from my character the left will push the tank totally unopposed towards the right side so always the deviation of a pang will be still a trail to the side well the hypoglossal is paralyzed is what NATO basically remember the right at 12 the Naaru damage will lead to they go fitna chikna technique ocean poot Alexander they he will exactly catch it you're Ziegler you should be ready to attack the examiner a chart crane looks good right yeah I would also put you right now for the male to come up with tray old Arab and you should answer that should be the spirit of attack hunk deviation will be toward six little to the side of the hypoglossal is what need to be remember the hypoglossal arrives in the medulla it supplies all the modules of the panel except pellet of glasses is what you need to remember and it leads to the deviation of the pants which the ipsilateral side because of the unopposed action of the dreamy Oh glasses of the normal size and it lead to any nuclear level involvement of the hypergraph in the medulla is the element type so it leads to flaccid paralysis of the tongue but bilateral corticobulbar gets interrupted what is that called suitable bar fal'cie then also fiberglass with involved but um n-type so there the tongue is not classic so they will also have dysphagia these are three and this knee our difficulty in cueing food they're all the problems in hypoglossal nerve paralysis is what you have to remember now killer h-parameters it lead to vestibulocochlear henna it's the a tinnitus what they go motion sickness expected gag reflex car gag reflex means we'll be checking how the pellet moves if you touch it then quickly so glossopharyngeal carries the sensory and the Vegas is the motor and what is that motor activity you are looking for you are looking to move the filet and if there is any Vegas involvement then the uvula will deviate towards the opposite side that is what we will appreciate in case of the gag reflexes fortunately remember gag is got G hood ahead trill now 9 with his sensory then AG Vegas Miata head or whoa both ahead mode on the apron is what you need to remember the removes can all what are they carrying actually it is Durrell oh the railroad can all he is found on the middle part of the petrous range and if channels they have the sentences for take remember strabismus diplopia horses they're all because of the damage of watch you know very well the extraocular muscles oculomotor pal singh classically leads to diplopia ptosis premises what did he do ultimately remember so that brings us to the end of over their knowledge invasion now the time unfreeze your fingers let's go for a quiz yeah so I thought you all guys are in a great spirit of preparation bubbling I know give me down bubbling every day every moment every second living in a wonderful spirit to win the exam yes now doc let's run for the answers Ritt pig says DnB 201 a June discussion please if I remember I already did that if I did not I will do that no problem yeah so all of you are saying here versus see chronic vomiting it is hyperkalemic hyperkalemic because KCl is getting vomited and metabolic alkalosis it's correct answer this is one thing that I don't want you to do wrong where is she normal anion gap of this the clay is the DNA exam over or is it still there if the DNA still there yeah if so then vanish then become again already fixed in their DNA okay I can see Sudeep t everyone is saying renal tubular acidosis absolutely increasing a neon gap is the important question so Sneha is asking ophthalmology you can just go to the you medical act you have a video library in that both need PG d NB a PG I all these question banks have been discussed here vise topic wise so you can review that ah yes yes yes so no more B&B in December oh very good good good so it is starvation diabetic ketoacidosis they are all increase on you on there pulse rate Murat eight and as BP is 80 what is the best solution you want in you hundred fifty four should you answer very good Monica proposes normal saline absolutely life these are all the features of hypokalemia except one so ECG is a favorite area of this we should be doubly sure 155 good ravi proposes be excellent faulty wave is a picture of hyperkalemia hyperkalemia metabolic acidosis where do you see this combination hundred fifty-six but top part on soccer oh yes 156 should your answer up there very good morning light saying corn syndrome but who said the obg excellent the area the area is making you to lose a bicarbonate which colonic secretion and also it lead to hypokalemia that's right conscious hyperaldosteronism doubt they're so metabolic alkalosis bowtie Santa that is how those who answered e like mashaallah tree are green balls already we discussed this we should not do this wrong Sunday also did wrong it's it also sort of cake consequence answer that they made a pie you are dr. Morley Burroughs why students should not do this wrong cause for the hyperaldosteronism holiday we discussed now metabolic alkalosis is selling responsive or saline unresponsive whatever it is the underlying common denominator tells them all metabolic alkalosis me - aldosterone is emotionalism will be what will I understand - sodium retention in the renal tubules can you give you the boat please can you give you the boat your topic home cat am cartina other whose topic to ended up if you are still answering it wrong then would your heart attack another right so yes should not do this wrong you have glamorous then you have Bowman's capsule proximal convoluted tubules then this become the collecting that distal convoluted tubules here and collecting that what is the action of Alistair on it retains the sodium preventing it from entering in the urine and secretes a plus expressed into the urine into the urine so that is the reason H+ is launched into urine hence metabolic alkalosis will be there again K+ is launched into urine hypokalemia will be there in these people not metabolic acidosis be very sure right so how do you treat I understood on metabolic alkalosis like this first of all why aldosterone is high if the person is dehydrated there is a decreased perfusion to the renal tubules and the decreased perfusion will decrease GFR and decrease GFR is censured by the macula densa it will increase renin production and that lead to angiotensin aldosterone production and that high aldosterone will lead to sodium retention / - + H+ loss into yoga so it's got frequent Ghouta dehydration cooker Oh Celine they though you see a metabolic alkalosis with underlying denominator is high aldosterone and if that is due to dehydration it will be saline response second reason my metabolic calculator is if there is any adrenal adenomas like cons that also lead to high aldosterone and high out of Sudan will lead to all this metabolic alkalosis by using headspace into urine so there to treat the metabolic alkalosis you do a I lost it on antibodies like spironolactone triamterene except again if she does is our closest dissolute lady Mia but they out of 30 Marquis are not general but it's in Maine then only dr. moogly barrage will be happy right yes I can teach this hundred times also to you okay now thank you Sam saying for calling this awesome definitely but already we had this awesome discussion so still if we do this wrong we should be careful okay now seborrheic dermatitis cellulitis alopecia a looper apathy 1:57 definitely Thank You Abby Shay question number 157 yes worldly couple taken up were lookup them from d-day they lifted a certain Tendulkar and champagne open here right that should be the spirit when we win the 2019 big meeting so that is what we should drink right now it is the biotin deficiency which lead to the combination of all this once what is a repeat question here where do you see question once what is a repeat question of renal sugar is no sis okay why didn't anion gap we've seen in all this except where it is not a high anion gap but a normal anion gap push number 116 116 should your answer doctor very good to see 215 online students please don't forget to subscribe for this channel that is youtube.com slash online immediate share this channel with all your friends on Facebook whatsapp every wave so that the number of subscribers will increase all shall go to the cuter chat I'm typing for you yeah somebody type the URL of the qh @ youtube channel one of you please write that also go to that channel please subscribe to the Kuro chat so you are will see 880 YouTube channel we are going to have a lot of health talk shows a lot of consultants worldwide doing phase discussions for the lay population to the lay public and we are going to do a lot of a lot of times patients asked them both of this drug how does it act how does decoction and I am going to teach pharmacology to the common people so they understand what medicines they are taking how are they working right kyo-chan that's good that's good so there would be please go to the pure chat on the YouTube channel and please punch the address over there for the benefit of everybody right ah that's good so you should remember diarrhea absolutely right if the gut is the cause for the normal anion gap metabolic acidosis what will happen to the unary anion gap will it be low or will it be high is a very important cushion your Duryea anion gap will be good to you if the gut is because of the normal and on gap acidosis this also be discussed last time so please review the whole video in the umineko video library they will upload that pitch the view that video now doctor severe combined immune deficiency way card expired bezel dicta T cell dicta both dicta are nine NK cell yes should your answer doctor what do you see in severe combined immunodeficiency I mean James wall want to bet on both most of you absolutely hence called combined immunodeficiency but there's mrs. me what is not involved is it the nerve lymphatics smaller tree or reveal it is not involved in goodness receives 162 Robbie SIA Delia's they are differing between a and D sweetie things smaller three very good I mean a small rocket traded zindabad lymphatics are not involved apache2 scored made a subculture mother karna he had in apathy to score is my question to all of you to Durant everything serum Emily's Sunday things arterial pH and Santo Kings juiciest serum nebulous is not involved in apathy doctor but just may what is the site of the pain where you find from benj\u00e3o obliterans but there may be what is the fight of the pain classically and in 64 good so I mean a small things and thing joy deep sings of pain very good most of you are thinking of pain classically smoker from Bandra dis orbit range leg pain to odd occasion is a classical feature central line kiss made out of it centerline you can put in all this center line of course we put let's commonly wave but most commonly there 165 even external jiggler also it's not that we don't put him exogenous this actually wrong Fame of pushing rectal temperature in hypothermia should be less than how many degrees Celsius you call it as hypothermia is a important question yes 166 I can see Robbie on a honky-tonk be and Mittal key Ronnie on C 55 degree structure numerically now cancel cable Sehun Emily to make most common cancer leading to with you and giving you passport tube and visa to go to UM elope what is that so Monica is proposing lung cancer most of you accept ranching things skin I know something want to become a dermatologist but the C is not right leptospirosis me what is acceptable run gg's on 168th yes rubbie is on cipro good sorry Monica also is on cipro so Deepthi our Telangana scud missile is on John days John D's to defeat malaria leptospirosis oh man Telangana merimna's el discrete farmer comes with jaundice means two things neptr was it that finally hybrid it was at the malaria or system malaria and left oh very similarly looking we should not do this form very good pencil in dr. Krista limp insulin is the drug of choice for the left o is what you need remember very commonly seen in at least there are 200 cases of leptospirosis terminally ill dialysis Kirk a uremia managed care fee when I was in his arms instead of medical sciences so very common in Hyderabad and Telangana now that they're defective DNA any pay where do you see it's an important question 169 should here instead of the defective DNA repair when you see 169 correct workers working in sewage farmers a lot of times I used to ask her rat your input million phone a Quran says Hika patience just look at me like a crazy useless in one of the three idiots they use from the kid pool right so I never know patient give me a history of rat here in third they talk a lot that so who will remember counts all

talk about Wi-Fi tether and Wi-Fi repeater I know some of you actually use your phone's Wi-Fi hotspot' as your home's internet connection so you connect your laptop your office computer your Android tablets your ihor tablets all that good stuff well you probably run into this problem if you have a big house oh you try to use your phone as a Wi-Fi hotspot now the phone is not a router is not been designed to be a router so the strength of signal may be good for a small home but if you have two floors if you have a large house it's probably not going to work for you so how do you extend the range of the Wi-Fi tether on your phone it's actually rather simple actually you can go ahead and go to Amazon and buy a Wi-Fi repeater now those things I've tried it out in they're not actually that great the range isn't that great a better method is if you have like an old router sitting around or you can buy one of these cheap-ass cisco Linksys routers this is the e 1200 and you can put the dd-wrt firmware which is sort of like custom ROM for routers and what that allows you to do is hack it and you can increase the transmission signals you can also turn it into a repeater that will repeat the signals of your Wi-Fi hotspot so my internet is usually fast I get 100 megabits per second download on Comcast business but the other day it was down and somebody actually saw me on Twitter I was having trouble so what I did is tether off my verizon no3 which I have unlimited grandfather plan now the problem with that phone is that once I take it into my tent outdoors it gets nice 40 megabits per second download if the phones inside my house it's dropped straight to like 10 megabits per second download so that's another reason to have a Wi-Fi repeater if you want to have your phone sitting in the part of your house that has the best for glt signals and how do you write all that signals to your house so let me go ahead and show you Mike set up and show you some test results let's go do this baby all right guys so this is my computer this is one of my main routers this is my Comcast business and also I've got a bunch of gigabit I got a bunch of routers in my house anyway um the other day Comcast went down I was getting like 1 megabits per second download so I usually tether off my phone but to maximize the actual the maximize the actual output I put my phone out here because out here if I do a speed test real quick I will get like 30 40 megabits per second download because there's nothing blocking here there we go so I'm getting like 25 whatever so this is actually using the hotspot right now all right so I've got that hotspot there and let's go back to my my office here alright so when my internet goes down I have a Y wireless connector there and I'm gonna go hit and I'm gonna go ahead and connect it to my note - it says no - but that's actually my note 3 so I'm going to go ahead and connect it I get fairly good speech here all right let's do speed test ok so I'm getting like five six and you can see I'm barely getting signal up there and that's - my node three out there alright so let's go ahead and go to uh the other part of my house my other office here so if I'm working in my other office or let's say upstairs I will probably lose a signal see how is I'm getting like almost no bars alright and I'll do a speed test here real quick and I should probably get like like I sometimes it doesn't connect you'll probably even disconnect well as you can see it's just not getting it all right it's not connecting so I'm going to go ahead and connect to my repeater which is actually sitting on my desk which is sort of halfway point between my node three and here which act as a repeater that's what a repeater does so my repeater will repeat signals from my node three so it says note 2 but it's actually node 3 and I'm going to go ahead and do a speed test and now you will see that although I don't get full full us full 20 30 megabits per second download but I'm getting fairly good from my tent out - all the way to the other side of my house that's really good I'm so by using repeaters you can actually repeat as many as you want you can actually have your best signals repeated to everywhere in your house all right and you always want to put your phone where you get the best signal obviously because once you have that good signal download bandwidth then you can repeat it but it doesn't work the other way around if you have like maybe 10 megabits per second and you try to repeat it um it's not as good all right going back to my desk this is the repeater that I was talking about here alright and let me go ahead and show you how to set it up the first thing you'll need to do is obviously install dd-wrt which is not too difficult I'll have links to where you can do this this is an e 1200 but you can use any other router just check ddie pub dd-wrt check for the supported routers this is actually a really shitty one but I have it laying around that's when I turn it into repeater once you have installed dd-wrt then you can go ahead and follow my next directions alright first thing you want to do is obviously set up your mobile Wi-Fi hotspot if your tether is blocked make sure you route it and install tether mod or I saw a customer arm alright and go ahead and turn it on you can see I've got it set to make sure you choose a ap name that's easy to remember no to because we're going to go ahead and enter it into the repeater I usually switch between my no.2 and no.3 that's why I just named it no two because you can go ahead name any of your phones as Note 2 and this will repeat the same signals alright and also do set a password so no one else can connect to your new repeater alright set my password to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 use a wa2 PSK alright method and also go to Advanced Options use 2.5 gears for channel you can go ahead I think set it auto but just set it to something you can remember so I usually set it to 6 there alright and also for timeout settings make sure you have it never timeout so it's always on unless you want it to shut off and your whole hotspots going to turn off so I've already set it to never timeout and you can go ahead and place this where you get the best for glt signals where you know your phone gets the best for DLT signals alright so I'm going to go ahead and place this in my tent like I did before alright next once you have installed dd-wrt I recommend you do a hard reset you can do this easily by just holding down the reset button for like 30 seconds alright and this will allow you to follow my tutorial from the get-go or you can also do it from the interface if you want to but this way you're not you know starting with some other settings you had on there ah and whatnot alright and I think it's been reset it so now leave that alone and let's go to our computer alright guys once you have reset it your router your dd-wrt hopefully you in solely firmer it will show up as dd-wrt in your wireless network connections you can also connect that via lan but i'm going to go ahead and show you how to do it wirelessly you can also do this on your phone i'm just going to show you with desktop because it's a lot easier alright once it's connected alright go ahead and go to go open up a browser and go to 192.168.1.1 alright and this will get you into the dd-wrt interface um so you're gonna have to set our username so I'm going to go ahead and set it to root for now I'm just going to set it to one two three one two three alright so change the password all right and now you'll have to enter your password so I'm going to enter root 1 2 3 1 2 3 I'm going to go to wireless here alright and this is where you're going to enter your all your information so whatever you name the your phone actually I have right here so I named my SSID Note 2 so I'm going to put Note 2 all right and also you're going to go ahead and choose the wireless channel you chose which for me was 6 and you can use 40 megahertz that will give you I think double the bandwidth and also you can change the network mode I usually keep it to ng mixed or N only it's up to you ends the fastest but you can do ng mix also change the ap2 repeater bridge alright and that's about it go ahead and hit save oops sorry no to actually you don't have to enter all the other stuff just send our note to the the channel actually it doesn't automatically my bad alright next go ahead and click on AB under in virtual interfaces alright this is the actual repeater name you want to give it this is actual connection to your phone so I'm going to name this 0 max repeater alright and hit save and you do have to set wireless security so go to wireless security tab and go ahead and go to wpa2 personal and set this to AES AES and set this to odd the the password for me it was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 let me unmask that to show you hit save don't hit apply settings yet alright until we're all done and go down here and go to w2 a personal also and do the same thing and I believe the password have to be the same for both so make sure you use to the same same password 1 2 three four five six seven eight all right and you're gonna hit save that's pretty much it it's in repeating mode now there's one more thing we got to go and we have to disable the firewall because we're not acting as a router so go to security hit disabled under SBI firewall and hit save at the bottom all right and also there's one more thing if you want to still access your your repeater UE here a graphic user interface make sure you enable this web GUI management all right otherwise you'll have to reset your router to get back into this or connected via LAN which is a pain and the poor is going to be eight zero eight zero or you can set that to eight zero also if you want to I'll show you that in a bit alright once that's done hit save alright and also if you want to go back to a wireless go to advanced settings alright this is where you can actually increase the transmission power so you repeater we have will have more power so you can set from 1 to 250 all right I recommend about 180 I find it if you actually go over it doesn't actually help I'm 180 so that will almost double your transmission power it's save alright once that's done hit apply and that's it and give it a skip it about five minutes and this should show up here the dd-wrt should go away now here a bit because the router is resetting and it's going to show you 0 max repeater that I which all should be able to connect to so I'll be back in about five minutes let the dd-wrt routers sit all right guys it's been five minutes so I'm going to I'm going to go ahead and connect it to zero max repeater down here that's my new Peter setting and I'm going to go ahead and connect to it alright it's connecting here ah if you're having trouble sometimes it does that oh you may want to reset the router so I'm going to try to connect it one more time if that doesn't work I'm gonna go ahead and power off and power on my router it's this part is the hardest okay so I'm going to go ahead and connect the cable and connect it back on and give it another 5 minutes and the second time it should connect all right guys I after I just let it sit for like 10 minutes smiles cumin smoking it's finally working so let's go ahead and check out with my Internet's working there we go and it's working we'll do a speed test on light here and test now your Peter can be pretty much use anywhere and we'll do a quick speed test here just make sure we're getting some good speeds now with the repeater you repeat your signal so it actually cuts down your bandwidth I in half I'm so it isn't exactly the best way to get it but this is going to get you those signals where you need it the most off from your phone so getting about six seven eight that's going to change that's good there you go and thanks for watching this video that was how to extend the arranger Wi-Fi hotspot on your phone with the use of repeater you can actually get these for like 15 bucks on Amazon which is cheaper than getting a repeater those things actually don't have that good range anyways in this one actually you can turn it into a router if you want to you can do a bunch of stuff and also you can increase the transmission signal which is nice all the links where you can buy these anyway I hope you guys enjoyed this video another idea that you can do is I usually have my Wi-Fi hotspot in my car you get one of those power inverters for your car you can go ahead and plug in your router that has been turned to repeater repeat the signals from your car and make it go much much farther extend the hell out of it anyway I don't recommend you to do this setup all if you're going to download a ton of stuff because the carriers they might walk you terminate you but if you just use internet for browsing the web and stuff this is a great way to set up your whole home internet without having to get a cable modem or DSL modem all off your phone and their social watching this video as always don't forget that like

partner with Ventura County behavioral health inter accounting Public Health Ventura County of Office of Education and Ventura Unified School District this enables us to go out to middle schools and high schools all over the county we work in the middle schools we work in the high schools at the continuation schools we do projects with the students at the juvenile detention center so we're gonna cover some of the products that I was just talking about some of the known health effects the legal risks physical health and then we'll get into some tips for you guys and some QA so we're gonna be getting into this line here shows product diversity okay and this is exactly how the tobacco industry and the babe companies are targeting our youth if you look at some of the pictures up here you can see that they're coming just like Rowland said in all shapes and different sizes and what are the key things to know is think about the look appeal and the appearance the appearance has bright colors in it camo print it's all appealing to what's in right now within pop culture the one that's highlighted here is one that we are seeing out of all of the middle schools even within the high schools this is most formally known as jewel we have a jewel product up here jewel is looks like your typical USB flash drive it has a pod that attaches right to the front of it so there's a pod that comes out of here and this is what actually contains the nicotine it comes with a magnetic charger that can be plugged into any USB flash drive so know that when you're going around your house if this could be plugged into the side of the computer and it might look like yeah it's a Wi-Fi stick it's a USB flash drive okay notice that also keeping with the sweet flavors if it automatically smells like Apple our fruit malady or a mint and there's no candle on our air freshener in your child's room that is a key indication that there could be some type of substance that is being smoked within that room this next one here we have if you look at the name it is called Sauron we have a few different examples of the Sauron here the Sauron has actually a heavy weighted failing to it almost like an anxiety weighted rock think about fidget spinners how they got extremely popular right something that could be heavy and that fits right in the palm of your hand this makes it easy and accessible that I can go ahead and just take a hit out of it here cover it with my hand and blow the smoke right into my arm you even have some that looked just like a credit card this fits right in the palm in your hand the black portion on the both of these is where the nicotine and the flavors are held all of these are all rechargeable again with your regular USB Android charger you have your THC cartridges now unfortunately the THC cartridges are one of the ones that we get the most from the middle schools we have of course there's always going to be a battery with these and each and every one of them contain a cartridge with a lot of the students don't realize that the wax pens like this is the highest form of THC concentrate we are now seeing the THC concentrate at a level of 293 to 90% concentrate of marijuana this is absolute the most potent form out of this is in its concentrate form also another thing there are going to be air bubbles within these cartridges here if you have an air bubble and you tip that cartridge over and the air bubble moves really fast up and down the cartridge has been cut with something sub type of chemical and I wouldn't be able to tell you what it is unfortunately all of these concentrates could be made at home I can get all of the supplies off of the internet the cartridge is what I need from a lay and I can put anything I want in this unfortunately does the dispensaries it is a business and this is how they're affecting our youth we also have the Chargers the Chargers are the apparatus of course that are going to charge the battery like I said you have the cartridge at the top but each and every one of these contains a battery now the batteries like I said come in all different shapes and sizes and colors so you have your choice of gold purple black and maroon charger connects to the end there and it's the same thing a USB flash drive you can charge it anywhere in your car in your laptop or even just how you're charging your phones and it will use that same square so if you see any one of these know that there could be possibly the missing cartridge that the top looking at this picture can you guess the age generation that they're targeting think of the fun bright colors the bedazzled bunnies at the bottom of this this is straight off of Amazon also a tip for parents here's one of them if your child is going to be having a birthday do not purchase them Visa gift cards or Amazon gift cards get them some type of food if you get a Visa gift card I can order anything I want online and I'm gonna ship it to my best friend's house where I know that their parents aren't there and I'm gonna get my jewel and when you go on the jewel website there's only one question that asks is are you 21 and over please be advised the type of gift cards that you give your kids just as quick sidenote the state of California recognizes vape products as tobacco products and in California it is illegal to sell or provide vaping paraphernalia to anyone under the age of 21 this device here is considered a mod now with the Mont yes I'm sorry currently no I think they're working on that though that's why the gift card thing is extremely important it's c4 if you you can't go into a store if you're under 21 like for example if you go into a circle okay you'll probably find a lot of these vape products specifically jewel right behind the counter so you have to ask the clerk for it you have to be 21 to purchase it so for our children having these types of products it is absolutely for them to have them looking at the slide here this is considered to be one of your mods now our mods is more of an older generation type of apparatus with this these are high in price these can run anywhere from $60 up to $200 if you look right on the top there as you can see it shows some type of prestige and that's where the adult form I have money there is some type of class think about the tobacco companies when they had lady fair slim cigarettes you were more of a woman or a classy woman if you smoke those cigarettes it's all about the image with this one it has a fancy LED screen so that you're able to actually control the level and the amount of nicotine within this mod we don't see a lot of these mods of our children having these so this is gonna be a from age ranges about 21 and over into your mid 40s these are actually the devices when you see that huge cloud of smoke this is them with these they come with you have to fill them up with the nicotine juice like this and this flavor is called juicy apple and it has 55 milligrams of nicotine within this your traditional cigarette only has 20 milligrams so just as a quick side note those some little squeezy things to refill those canisters some students are just squirting it right into their mouth it tastes like candy later on when you come up and take a look at these products I'll go ahead and open that just take a quick smell of it it smells like sour apple I mean it truly smells like candy so looking at these in the beginning when it came out in 2007 electronic cigarettes were meant for people who wanted to quit smoking as you can see the image up here it has completely changed we're going back again to the sweet flavors and the bright colors in a cool little light that iluminates once you start automatically taking puffs of electronic cigarettes the sorin's come in six different colors smaller than a credit card that is also a Soren so if you see anything and know that they're coming out even smaller this one here is your fix doesn't that look like mascara ladies and look at the name your fix what is that telling are you do you think our youth is understanding what fix means not at all even the name Soren Soren hi and here we have our jewel this is our jewel starter pack like setting it for $40 on line comes in cool mint fruit malady creme brulee and Virginia tobacco so if you smell through melody in your house and usually your kid stinks what's really going on right there we go I want to [ __ ] so that's the jeweling palm of your hand we just recently like we said they come in all shapes and different sizes this one here is called a Loki comes with a button on the front different heating settings if you have a BMW and your key pops out like that has a little key ring that you can attach it to your key it has a built in charger already on this end it's everything I needed one the industry is only getting smarter and more advanced and more appealing to our youth all I do is push the button down goes right back in like a key this is one of the newest ones that we're seeing now there it is charging so know if you're seeing that you're walking around in the laptop that is not a Wi-Fi device that is a joule ways of hiding it everything you want to know about vaping and how to conceal it is going to be on youtube or it's going to be on Instagram if you are not on Instagram I suggest that you make an account on Instagram and you friend your kid okay also know that you may know your child's Instagram but please know that there is a such thing as called spam accounts they build spam accounts and they could have five different instagrams that you aren't even aware of spam accounts are meant for people that they don't want to see their story if you want to know how to check that please come to me and I will show you exactly how to check for their spam accounts also with this no student within the school should have permanent markers period check your children's backpacks if there's a permanent marker in there what is the use and make sure that you're opening it if you're sick if there's any of these types of devices in their backpacks as well okay once again just go on YouTube how to hide a vape it's going to come up there's lots of tutorials another one that we're seeing is you take your deodorant stick and you spin the wheel on the bottom so it comes all the way out you can drop your device inside put it back on spin it back down tighten it so it doesn't rattle around so all you have to do is loosen a little bit and shake it if you hear something rattling there's something hidden inside of it this here is your basic apparatus of how the inside of one of these vape product looks like so most of them all have a lithium-ion battery within them this is they have to have the battery on majority of these pens in order for them to work okay and then most of them are gonna have a cartridge the cartridge is going to be where the juice is gonna be or where the THC wax is going to be they're gonna have a mouthpiece all of them have a mouthpiece and last but not least there's going to be an autumn Iser with that that is the heating coil when that heating coil one you're automatically inhaling in and pushing down on the power button the heating coil is getting hot that allows the using that to turn into an aerosol which comes out as the smoke for many years consumers we're told that the clouds made by these products it's just water vapor is that true many of these like this one here I believe if you read the ingredients there's no water in it the base is propylene glycol which is odorless and flavorless to make it taste good they add artificial flavors so these products allow the user to make those big clouds they think that most kids think it's just paper they're just it's fun it tastes good in reality the cloud is a mixture of many different chemicals that were either present in the e-liquid or produced during the heating process but it's within this light here you're gonna see the nicotine levels on some of the different apparatuses we have here on your traditional vape pens you're gonna have anywhere from 0 to 36 milligram of nicotine then getting into your Mons it's gonna be anywhere from zero to 24 milligrams remember with those you can adjust the nicotine levels on those with your Sauron is gonna be anywhere from zero to fifty milligrams and last but not least is going to be your jewel The Jewel contains 50 to 60 milligrams the highest amount of nicotine out of majority of the electronic cigarettes that we're finding absolutely at alarming and addicting rates traditional cigarette is only 12 milligrams right 12 milligrams grams you notice on the bottom right Jul 15 but make the switch to jewel love your lungs the next time you go to Circle K or 7-eleven look outside the window and see the ad and how they're advertising for jewel and when you go up to the front counter you're gonna see that a lot of the tobacco products are even the flavoring is right next to the candy what type of message are the retailers sending sincerely raise your hand if you can tell me why do you think students choose to use these devices yes they think they're more harmless yes trendy cool they want to fit in anybody else yes it's easier to hide it in your hand easier to hide the smell why do you think some of your students choose not to use these devices smart yes it's not cool so some of the ones that are more aware they're actually listening that get it are saying literally the opposite they're unhealthy they cost a lot of money in one of the classrooms that we asked students this question about why do they choose to use it one of the students blurted it out cuz we're stupid and I said no you're just not aware yet but that's what we're working on that's why we're here to raise your awareness we literally go all over Ventura County middle schools high schools and we do different projects with them one of them is we've created a game show that's kind of like jeopardy so all the students we put into teams and they all get a remote control they answer the question and I get to be the game show host and there's categories alcohol facts tobacco vapes prescription drugs and then there's point values below that so it's an interactive and we get to share information with them and that's one of the things that I tell the students because when I walk in the classroom and their teacher introduces me this is Roland Roland he's gonna talk to you about drugs and alcohol so their defenses go up so right away I tell them so we're gonna do a game show maybe your game show host and I love my job because I get to go into middle schools and high schools and share this information I'm not gonna lecture you one of the things that's important to me is that in 15 20 years you're gonna be the next generation you're gonna be the adults if I get sick I may end up in your office I'm gonna need you to help me get better if I end up in court I'm gonna go into an office and it might be you I'm gonna need you to have the sharpest brain to kill me and it really lowers their defenses because honestly that's the truth and I want them to understand that they are important you know it upsets me when they say to themselves that they're stupid it's like no you're not stupid we don't send them home with homework assignments everything's done in class so the game show is basically a quiz show so we'll ask a question for example how much alcohol is in one drink is it 1% 5% just enough to give you a buzz or it depends on the serving size and kind of drink and then they all push the little clicker answer the question and then we'll find out what the real answer is and then there's usually a little summary afterwards so we can explore that answer a little bit more detail so your homework is to share what you're learning tonight with your siblings with your peers with your children but I wouldn't share with them how to hide a vape device I am we actually have some parents who want to bring their students and we said this is really about educating parents about what's happening we don't want to educate the students on how to get away with these things and how to buy them there are gonna be some labels that say this product is nicotine free know that with the labels that they can get away with up to putting 5% of nicotine within that product and not have to put it on the label it is not really nicotine free make sure you're always looking at the ingredients jewels pogs you don't refill them when you're done with it you throw it away and you get another one but one pod has the same amount of nicotine as a pack of cigarettes it's it's you can hit it once or twice throughout the day or you hit it continuously throughout the day it really all depends on the user we have some people that are going through three of these pods a day so that is twenty cigarettes it all depends on the user so within one pod you're guaranteed to get that 50 to 60 milligrams and it contains are we gonna tell him how much it contains now go for it so within these pods it is guaranteed to have 200 plus 200 puffs that's how long it takes to get through one pod like you so there's 300 puffs or 200 hips now just kind of put that in context when we inhale and exhale we inhale and exhale 700 times an hour they can go through 200 puffs so it depends on if they're hitting it constantly or if the date taken a couple of hits per hour that pod might last them a few days but the thing is they taste so good it's like eating candy all day so they're constantly hitting it because it's like sucking on a sucker so they go through 2 3 or even up to four of them in one day our dopamine levels that say you have your dopamine levels are flat when you take a hit depending on the strength of nicotine you're gonna spike and then you crash kind of like a sugar rush and then you know how you crash after that so drops below you feel awful you take another hit and it brings your dopamine back up and we're going to encourage you to do your homework you go online do your research there's a lot of information on YouTube there's a lot of to tour students are making to educate other students you need to educate yourselves also a recommendation if you do not have urban dictionary downloaded on your phone please download it now urban dictionary if you're gonna look up vape pens or wax pens it's gonna give you all the different names of what they're talking about so if you hear your kid talking about cheese or broccoli or the gooey they're talking about this even wax is considered a slang word for them they're not calling it a THC cartridge or a vaporizer pen nothing like that they're calling it wax they're calling it cheese they're calling it the cream so know exactly that there is slang words that they're going to get around about talking to these if you look at their phone and you're looking at a text and it has a picture of broccoli or a Christmas tree so with that Jeopardy show that I was talking about we've asked the students the exact same question I asked you why do you think students choose to use these products and why do students choose not to in this next slide are those answers the cliche funny thing is the number one thing we hear over and over is it looks cool and then it tastes good and then the rest of these but some of them they are where they are listening they are learning in classrooms about the health about the addiction that it's dangerous some of them choose not to use it because of religious beliefs they don't want to get in trouble if they don't get in trouble in school they don't want to get suspended they don't want to let their parents down they know that their brains are still maturing and it costs a lot of money they'd rather spend their money on video games or music or movies kids are using vape devices and record numbers the FDA Commissioner announced it is reached in epidemic proportions across the country we originally spent a few days in the middle school presenting our vape show and the counselor gave me a bag about the size of a sheet of paper not a real big bag a small bag half weighs full of these devices that they confiscated from the previous year and they said that they're already reaching that same amount for that year so this chart shows vaping Nikitina marijuana has increased between 2017 and 2018 this is from the California healthy kids survey which is an anonymous confidential survey a lot of those vape pens are used to inhale THC oils also known as wax or honey to put it in perspective when somebody smokes a joint there's about 15 to 20 percent THC when they use an oil or that wax or honey it can range from 80 to 90% so it's a lot stronger so getting into our cannabis concentrates our honey or Lily gooey or broccoli whatever you want to call it this here is one of the packaging that we found from hid one some of the packaging can look like this more along the lines when you're getting onto the street or from dispensaries they could be in a test tube like this this is from salvaged carts and the flavor is bubble gum or it could be here this is from cookies that is a hybrid indica so that means it has a double strain in it so in indica is more of a body suppressant type of strain it's gonna give you that really lethargic heavy body feeling the sativa is more of a mind-altering which is going to give you that head high almost the same as nicotine when you have a hybrid it is the mix of both of them together with our hid one here as you can see cool bright colors and the flavor on this one is Key Lime cookies fits right in your hand and we actually have one of these cartridges but none of these cartridges know that they're not FDA approved this one actually shattered because sometimes if the heating element gets too hot the cartridge can crack at the bottom exploding or leaking out all of the wax this here is on Instagram please check your kids instagrams and their feeds now with here you can see what kind of perception are they giving off does everybody look like this when they're smoking it looks fun it looks cool it's exciting there's flavors and if you notice at the top nothing is for sale on this website but once you go to hit 1la everything is for sale and it only asses you one question are you 21 and over click the button yes you're in so these are some of the health effects now we don't know we don't know the long-term effects not enough time has gone by yet so it's either some of the short-term effects that we've learned something else we just learned the FDA on April 3rd last month announced a new health affect young adults and teens are having seizures from using these products why are they having seizures high toxicity levels of nicotine their brains are still developing this was more specific about teens and young adults our brains generally stop developing between 21 and 25 years old so their brains are much more susceptible to addiction it's shorting out their brains and they are having seizures the nicotine levels in these things is outrageous one major ingredient in the vaporized aerosol liquid and a liquid is called propylene glycol which is a hydro scopic meaning it attracts and holds water molecules from its environment like the mouth this can lead a cigarette to use to have a constant state of dry mouth and to drink a lot of water so if they're not exercising and they're drinking a lot of water that might be the reason that's a red flag dry skin is another common side effect if they're using more lotion if they're rubbing their arms a little bit more if you notice their arms look dry and scaly are they having random nosebleeds it can cause nosebleeds some vape users develop a sensitivity to caffeine so if they're cutting back on the Red Bull a rock star drinking more water that might be a reason one study conducted at the University of San Francisco Department of Adolescent Medicine found five concert cancer-causing agents in the urine of sixteen year olds it's in their system another study found that some e-cigarettes release formaldehyde so what happens is when these batteries heat up that little coil at Vanessa was talking about that gets red hot and it expands metal expands when it gets hot now the surface doesn't stretch so when it expands the little pieces of metal crack off and go into your mouth and your throat and into your lungs they're not big shards that you can pull out with with tweezers little tiny microscopic pieces these tiny particles can trigger inflammation that have been leaked to asthma and diabetes in addition the use of vapes has been leaked to higher rates of pneumonia same buddy knows someone who rapes he knows somebody who hates the rest of you being shy next time you see that person vaping this is I'd like for you to say I want you to say thank you thank you for vaping you are a walking lab rat you are donating your body to the medical field into science your illnesses are going to educate us and teach us the long term effects all of these chemicals have been found in the vape devices in the aerosol over-40 which have been found to cause cancer while we did not notice at first many of these have the same chemicals found in traditional cigarettes some of the one of the flavors that's causing one of the lung diseases that we know about is called diacetyl it causes something called popcorn lung popcorn lung is a serious and irreversible condition in which tiny air sacs and the lungs become scarred and constricted which results in no air movement most of them contain nicotine just like vanessa was saying if it says contains no nicotine they've done the independent studies about all kinds of different products tested them even the ones that said that contain note nicotine actually contain nicotine no talking on the lines of secondhand smoke so using an e product and in a closed environments and voluntary of course you're going to have that secondhand smoke smoke exposure the only downfall is that just like the research we don't know exactly how it's truly going to affect somebody we know that of course that there is going to be some things that are going to be not right on this but we know that the initial concerns is the metals especially the lead the lead is one of the hugest things that we're worried about and right now the thing is on the tutorials that everything's going around it's the cool thing to do if you haven't heard your kids talking about challenges this is one of the challenges in order for them to use their bait in a classroom without getting caught it says thrill its seeking for them or now that the new that restrooms aren't all called the vape rooms so everything is considered as a challenge they even have it on youtubes on how to make different designs out of the smoke it seems like it's innocent but nonetheless they have no idea what type of exposure they're actually getting themselves involved in so vaping has created a whole new vaping culture again you can go on YouTube and look this up they've got stages set up loud music scantily dressed women and they're having these legitimate competitions called trick vaping creating shapes they blow a circle they make some movement they control the way it moves and then they blow smoke through the middle of it this is very exciting to them it's who can make the best shapes who can make the best designs out of what they're exhaling or they get back to back they both take a big hit and they blow smoke out like a dragon whoever has the longest cloud so the FDA is in the process of getting a flavored products removed or in 21 and over only smoke shops so school board policies state education codes and California state laws unified and recently we passed a resolution from our school district asking the City Council to take a stand on tobacco exposure for young people and asking for a local ordinance that would control tobacco sales so one of the things that I learned through public health was we have 34 outlets within a thousand feet of our schools in Ventura so there are 34 places where kids can very easily after school walk across the street and buy tobacco it's illegal but I will tell you my 16 year old daughter came home with a vape that she bought downtown Ventura with her IV and you know no one stopped her and so really what we're what we are trying to do now is to create an ordinance that would provide for regulation and also enforcement because no one's in force and whether or not tobacco stores are selling to youth with liquor stores we have undercover seeing's and we have you know regulations and we have two liquor licensing that imposes fines if you sell to minors that doesn't exist for tobacco and so if if you as a parent find out that your child bought from a store you can tell the police and they'll say okay there's an 800 number at the state you can report it to they're not going to do anything about it but at least we know so as a school district and as a parent for me that was not enough so through partnership with the county we've asked the City Council to look at this and they're in the process of drafting a resolution that would ban flavors tobacco flavors of all kinds it for sale in the city of Ventura because that's we know what it appeals most to young people and then it would also impose a licensing fee that would generate the funds for enforcement so that we would have people whose job it is to go to these stores and make sure that they're not selling to our young people it would also impose some buffer zones around our schools so that if someone were applying for a new tobacco licensing new tobacco license it would not be able to be within a thousand feet of a school because again we know that our young people are very attracted they're targeted by companies we can't locally control what comes in by mail and as a parent I will tell you I've learned a lot about how to control what comes to my house by mail but we can control what's happening in our town right and so that's where our local officials can really take a bigger stand on making sure that our young people aren't falling prey to tobacco retailers in June of 2018 we did conduct a sting and what happened was that almost 25% of the stores sold and these kids were kids who had just come from church they were all dressed all the girls had skirts on it was kids that you would definitely have questioned why they were there trying to buy something in the FIR place and still 25% of these stores sold to our kids I'm with the Ventura County Public Health and I'm Helen Tosh so the city's attorney is currently working on an ordinance and they expect it to come to City Council this summer yeah so we will definitely reach out to parents because as you might imagine there will be people who say no no I should be able to buy my creme brulee you know bait cartridge in town and so our goal is is for parents to to rally so legally you know we're looking at ordinances that have passed and and withstood challenges in other communities nearby we have San Luis Obispo that passed an ordinance a few years ago and that has been very successful in reducing teen exposure to tobacco the city of San Francisco banned all flavors so I mean there are big Sacramento recently did something very similar so there are big cities with significant legal teams that have done what we're hoping to do and so yeah I mean I think that our opportunity is here unfortunately we are behind where our kids are right and as a parent I was shocked how easy it was for my kid to get hold of these things and and seriously disappointed at retailers in our community that are selling to young people as a sidenote after I found out I sat outside that establishment one afternoon after school got out just to see what happened and watched dozens of kids I know you know I have a 20 year old and a 17 year old watched dozens of kids I know walk into this store and walk back out and so I went into the owner and said hi I'm with the school board you know I'd like to talk to you about teens and tobacco and he assured me they don't sell to youth it's not just that stores will sell it but also that there are people who will sell them right you can buy them on Craigslist you can buy them from older kids who buy them in bulk and will sell them for cash so it's not as simple as just from retail outlets but certainly I mean I think that's where that's where the the bigger market is the other thing that she mentioned is the Challenge on buses so a lot of our school buses and you know it's hard to see everything that's happening in a bus this is not new right I rode the bus 30 years ago and things happen on the bus back then but with vaping one of the things that's really challenging is it's hard to know exactly who it is right they can they can blow the smoke into the collar of their shirt they can they're teeny tiny devices and and stuff can't search kids right we can't have staff members going through pockets so it is a real challenge and that's part of the reason that we're coming to parents is that it isn't enough for us just to try and tackle this from an enforcement perspective at school we really need parents help in making sure that your kids aren't bringing them there they're not starting this the other challenge I think is that there really is not there's there are very few programs to help young people once they're addicted so there are lots of programs for addiction among adults but this is very new and as a community we don't have treatment places for a fourteen-year-old who's addicted to THC or nicotine those programs don't exist so it's very important that we prevent because once they're addicted it's really hard to help them stop and the kids who are are using these products our kids who traditionally wouldn't have used them years ago like when cigarettes first started it was usually the outer edges of kids that were using them and nowadays it's the football player it's the ASB president it's you know all the people who you wouldn't have normally thought would use them so that's something to look out for too so just to kind of emphasize on that students who have never smoked a cigarette are using these devices students who may have tried cigarettes and didn't like them they tech they taste nasty are using these devices because they do taste good addiction is higher with the teen brain because it's still developing these are some of the things that we need to comprehend we need to understand nicotine actually creates a path to addiction to other drugs the way I explain it to kids in the classroom because it gets into all the technical scientific jargon as I try and keep it as simple as possible I'll explain to them imagine a big field grass and you want to get to the other side of that field if you decide to walk across that field and you get to the other side and turn around you're gonna see your footsteps now if you go back and forth you're gonna flatten the grass eventually the grass is going to turn yellow eventually the grass is going to go away gonna have a dirt path some other people come walking down the street they want to get on the other side of that field and then they notice there's a path and they take that path nicotine creates the path when they introduce other drugs those drugs don't have to create a path it's already there and it takes that path so the importance of understanding it is a drug and it does have it's a toxic it's a toxin kids are having seizures from this we're seeing more signage which is awesome I'm seeing these at most of the schools if not all the schools I take a look whenever I go to a school to see if they're where I'm at when I'm walking into a school some examples of new stories regarding exploding devices I'm not sure if any of you have heard about these devices exploding do you remember the Samsung phone that was blowing up you couldn't get on an airplane if you owned that phone do you know what was causing the phone's to explode the batteries Samsung is a huge reputable company they took care of the / took care of the issue some of these products are being made overseas with the cheapest products that they can find to put them together and ship them over here and kids can buy them because they're more cost effective the problem with those devices that they tend to explode from the batteries they've killed pets they have created car fires house fires one of the things I want to let the staff here know principals isn't when you collect these devices don't hide them in your drawers if they explode you can come back to a burned-down office you know those safes you can buy at Home Depot or Office Depot it's really heavy it's pretty much made of cement and keep your documents in there get one of those put it in there if it explodes it'll contain the explosion also some students we've heard from other staff members at different schools that once the students find out where they're being hidden they break in and middle the night and stealing back and they sell them to their friends in the California electronic store one minute a customer is in a back room picking out a TV the next his pocket explodes into sparks and flames he is screaming and yelling all of his right leg was completely burned it's the latest e-cigarette to explode in a long list of similar cases across the country experts saying most are caused by lithium ion batteries often used in modified vape devices made overseas a study showing 62 percent of explosions happen while the e-cigarette is in someone's pocket or actively being used earlier this year the first documented case of an e-cigarette killing someone a 38 year old man died after his vape pen exploded his cause of death listed as a projectile wound to the head now another e-cigarette explosion caught on camera showing the potential for danger carried by millions every day a device like this that big chunk of metal exploding in somebody's face it's like a hand grenade that man was killed by a chunk of that metal it being embedded into his head there was another case of a 24 24 old young man who was using one of the smaller devices it exploded while it was in his mouth ripped his cheek open chunk of his lip and battery acid splattered all across his face these things do explode the typically the cheaper ones the ones that we have have up here I do not know if a single one exploding these are the ones that are made much better so getting into the developing brain like rodney was saying before it could be arranged anywhere at least between the ages from 21 to 25 now knowing this we're looking at our youth and like Helen said earlier it could be our ASP members on a real students you know my child could never do anything like but we're seeing a lot of the students that are saying that due to stress anxiety and depression are some of the main reasons of why they are using these substances we know that that it is such it's so stressful right now they're in a transitional stage where they're barely figuring out their identity let alone the perception in which they're trying to give out to everybody with the vape companies they pretty much got our youth targeted with that targeting that's giving them this persona giving them this outlook of how they should be how they should look think about the brand Fela and champion Fela and champion is a huge brand now but when I went to high school and middle school if I wore Fela or champion I was considered low class that was Kmart brand Walmart brand you wouldn't be caught dead wearing that because you would be targeted now you can buy a champion sweater for a hundred and fifty dollars I would never I would never but you put the right face on it you put the right flavor you give it the right taste and the right look our kids are gonna absolutely absorb it let alone the less let it be one of their favorite rap artists 'iz music musicians poet whoever it be they're gonna be setting that example and print and painting that perception because our kids brains are not fully developed and they're gonna absorb that they're gonna be more successful to taking higher risk and like Rowland was talking about the pathway once that pathway has been interrupted with any of these substances and knowing the high potency of them absolutely addiction will be on the rise schools are responding with approved CDE California Department of Education curricula adaptations to include a product's redefining tobacco products to include a products requiring the inclusion of e products in tobacco free board policies so our schools are responding and taking action updating the field teachers administrators campus supervisors what we're doing today right now with you guys so we're looking and a lot of schools are actually doing this instead of kept getting a kid who gets caught using a device and suspending him or her and they go home what are they gonna do back and use their device all day I've been suspended I'm sad I'm stressed out so I'm gonna go home and bake so schools are responding by having that what I've heard so far is Saturday school they're getting it in an educational component they come back to school and they learn about these devices and their dangers and what it does to them legally and their health so how do you keep these kids from starting keep yourselves updated again go home do your homework here's one of the websites if you need to this is your time right now for a photo op if you want to take a picture here this is from teens drug abuse gov and this is gonna give you some tips for your teen I'm sorry this is ya parent tips for teens here you know drugs and your kids the truth about drugs and drug abuse treatments gonna give you some more facts and resources NIDA by the way stands for National Institute on Drug Abuse this page yeah this one's specifically for teens if you want to share this page with them make sure your school administrators have your most current email so that they can contact you resource here this is the tool kit can help you to start having these conversations with your team it is available in English and Spanish and here's this is another photo op for you go ahead and take your pictures there's all the links for all the slides we just showed you so some tips for parents we've kind of gone over these things as we've been going along some of the tips what to keep an eye out for the scent the smell some of them can have no scent whatsoever but as Vanessa pointed out if you walk into a room and you suddenly smell sour apple and there's no packages of candy anywhere that might be a hint pens at our pens examine what's around in their rooms pick things up look at them does it look like a battery does it look like a mouthpiece does it look like an antenna does it look like a thumb drive does it look like your car keys communication when we do these classrooms we ask the kids you know what what can what can we do to help you and a lot of them have told us you know we want to some we want some more interaction with our parents we want them to talk to us we want them to challenge us we want them to set those bars so that we can strive to to satisfy you because one of the things that they've told us also is that they don't do it because they don't want to get in trouble they don't want to disappoint their parents so if you set those bars there how give them something to strive for because they do want to please you they do want to make you happy it's all about communication it's about keeping the communication in keeping those doors open for example one of the things that we tell parents and our reality parties is if your kid comes home drunk take care of them don't yell at them don't get upset with them get them to bed if you think they're gonna vomit get a trash can stay up with them sit next to them make sure they're okay get them some water the next morning have a conversation last thing you want to do is argue with a drunk person right so talk with them educate them listen to them don't shut them down if they say well you don't understand why don't say I know why I saw that picture I saw your Instagram you were there with them while they were hitting those babes well maybe there if you listen to their answer maybe they'll say you know what yeah that was one of my friends I was trying to get her not to do it that's why I'm in the picture that's why I was there so listen allow for meaningful participation positive activities like sports youth groups service groups opportunities to experience natural rewards natural release of dopamine that they don't rely on these things to make them feel good stay involved with their activities if you don't want your kids to use these devices you probably shouldn't be using them yourself you're just setting a precedence that it's okay and if you do use this product and they say well why are you doing it don't say because I'm old enough that doesn't make sense to them it really does not make sense of it because they see that you're doing it they hear of the health risks why are you damaging your body if these are bad for you bad for my lungs aren't they bad for your lungs you may hear sometimes well it's legal well it's for medical use and like I said earlier in the South presentation I said one of the things there's like well do you have glaucoma why are you using this also another thing to remember is like roland said you don't want to have a conversation with your child when they say they're intoxicated if there have been smoking the THC or the wax pen you don't want to have a conversation at that point with them either because they're not fully functioning they have the most potent type concentrate within their body that could last anywhere for up to 2 to 5 hours depending how much they smoked so no you're gonna have to take that time and let them fully come down from that high and then have the conversation with them most likely when they might get a little hungry that maybe could be the transition when they get out of it or when they're done maybe being a zombie or they could be extremely paranoid or even have anxiety attacks with such the high potency of the marijuana now not only that but if you have that discussion with them while they are stoned they're probably not gonna remember the conversation not at all so the three ingredients to youth resiliency caring relationships opportunities for meaningful participation setting those high expectations give them those bars to reach give them something to strive for resources in the community online it's another photo op opportunity here well one of the things that we talk about is peer pressure and what that really looks like with these devices yes demonstrate so this is what I do when we do the class okay I'm walking around the class we're doing our gameshow Haman's going to you want hit my face I just got it it's like cherry flavor do you want to hit it come on just hit we've been friends for so long we went to middle school since sixth grade you're not gonna hit my babe seriously I just she's alert come on it's a plate of sweet flavors so you want to hit it right and so the kids start laughing when I do this right and I'll just leave my bit like my pretend bait there it's my cell phone whatever it is because I don't take these into the classroom and I'll leave it right there and then I'll say a situation that this friend got caught with my bait and then all of a sudden I don't know this friend anymore and I tell them who do you thinks gonna get in trouble they are and that they're gonna be deemed and targeted as the person who babes and guaranteed once I do this demonstration they all look at I know each and every one of the students that babe in that class because the heads go like this to the person that's been baby and it's all known I'm sure as parents you've heard from your home kids who's the kid that bakes and ever the kids laugh exactly like that because I'm telling the truth and with that I already have that in and so we go through examples like that well how do you get away from that I can't hit that I have a basketball game on Saturday and I need to be prepared for that or I have asthma or my mom is super crazy and she comes home and she smells me and I don't have time for that right we say put it on mom put it on dad that's that is you're out route right there because it is exactly like that hey Mike come on can you just hit my baby can you hold it just hold my baby for me thinks I got a holding because my mom's crazy and she's gonna come home and then all of a sudden your child that says what is my friend's vague I'm just holding it for them you know how many times I hear that within the classroom that it wasn't really them Oh it wasn't really time that we're smoking it but they're holding it for a friend so give them that out round let them know when you're having that conversation hey put it on me say that you have really strict parents so that you don't even have to you have that automatic out Ralph give them examples like that or put them in situations like that can you hold keeping all this do you want to take a hit of this come on just take just have a little bit it's creme brulee fancy so delicious favorite don't follow me to social pressure social pressure so when you do offer for you to be an out you're creating a pact with them you're creating a bond I'm here for you I got you put it on me so now they have this bond with you it's that open fluid communication that we're talking about you know let them know that you're safe to take that accountability away from them because that pressure for them is intense it's happening in the classrooms on the buses in the restrooms that are now known as the VAP rooms where they're hotboxing the restrooms and now of course know that the school is taking action and we're they're putting people inside the restrooms now one of the schools they have a person that's actually will sit in the stalls and then pop out like a jack-in-the-box and be like what are you doing here but that's how intense it has gone so another thing that again what peer pressure feels like for them is simply somebody coming over and going I just got this new flavor I you don't vape don't worry about it it tastes good it's just water but it tastes good so it's like to them it's like sharing a piece of gum or sharing a mint it's not a big deal it because of the flavors now think about this if they are sharing that one of them sick now they're all sick one of them's got a canker sore some of these devices actually cause ulcers in the mouth also another sign to with the dry mouth it will dry out their lips and they may get cuts on the sides of their mouths the very thin portion of the webbing there will have small tiny cuts hello I'm Murray and I'm your new communications coordinator for Ventura Unified School District and caps media is actually sponsoring tonight and they are paying for and videotaping and editing this actual presentation so that I can put this online for all of our parents we will be sharing this out next year we'll be taking probably eight to ten workshops that are done throughout Ventura Unified School District on hot-button topics and what we're trying to do right now is find a sponsor to pay for those and so I'm working on that over summer so that we can do more of these because we do realize we're all really busy and so we may not be able to make it to Anacapa at six o'clock on a certain night but they will be available online so that you can take a look at them so yes and we're gonna try and do more of it as well we do PSAs with the students so they actually create their own public service announcements and we help guide them and we edit them together and we share them with them we share them with the other groups the other classes and so we have project alert six and seventh grade we have model smoking prevention program MSP P in eighth grade and then we have T nd towards no drugs in ninth grade and our teachers just this year we got approval from the CD California Department of Education to start integrating the Stanford toolkit into the curriculum to help with the vaping needs that we've been seeing the last five gosh rising the last probably three to five years honestly and and so part of chip a grant is also straight up coming into our classrooms in doing PSAs and then this parent education is through a different grant through VCO II and Ventura County behavioral health so we get to be able to utilize agencies like straight up a few different ways in our district which is wonderful hi Helen again I just wanted to mention that you have a group in Ventura that's working on this ordinance trying to ban flavors and cut down on signage and things like that that will attract kids and if anybody's interested in that please let us know and also a short little story this gentleman was asking about what are the what what are the roadblocks we might hit as far as a new law is concerned and one of the things that happened in San Francisco is that the City Council actually passed a law saying that they could not sell flavors in the city of San Francisco and that was passed and then big tobacco came and heard about it and they spent like 12 million dollars I think it was on advertising to try to turn that around and they and they were able to make the the law go to boat to the entire population the entire city and they still managed to pass this law so if you happen to see that it comes to vote in Ventura please remember to vote in favor of this law please attend your City Council meetings if you see this on the agenda it will show them how important in that us as a community are concerned about this if there's only two or three parents sitting there they're gonna think well you know what this isn't such a big deal no one's here if we show up as groups that's powerful that sends a huge message did you want to say something and because everyone's time is you know stretched so thin and so valuable you can also email your elected officials so don't feel that you have to necessarily be at a city council meeting it's really you know speaking as a someone who gets emails from parents about questions it's just as powerful for you to send an email saying this is something that's really important to me and I really want you to take action and then the other thing I was just gonna share is as a parent I learned that every single mail carrier company has a way for you to receive notifications before package is delivered to your house so if you're not even not home during the day and your kid gets home before you and sometimes gets the mail or might grab a package that's delivered at the door FedEx UPS post office they all have services where if a package is coming to your house you can get a text message so for me that was valuable because now I like wait I didn't order anything who ordered something from Amazon what's coming to our house so it's just a way of staying you know up-to-date aware of what's happening in your house teenagers are naturally sneaky and it's very hard to stay on top of them but you got to just do your part and as a parent stay engage listen to your friends share what you're hearing because as a community we all just need to work together to keep our kids safe if there's no more questions I really appreciate you guys being here again I enjoy sharing this information because our kids are important thank you very much for having us out [Applause] [Music]", "UAHhhweamIU": "welcome back guys it's actually been a little\u00a0\nwhile since I made a video because I've been\u00a0\u00a0 working and I'm actually in the middle of a move\u00a0\nbut I think it's important to just get this video\u00a0\u00a0 done because of the urgency with all the Covid 19\u00a0\noutbreak that's going on in the United States and\u00a0\u00a0 the rest of the world so in this video I actually\u00a0\nwant to talk about the impact of vitamin D and\u00a0\u00a0 vitamin C and also the weather cold weather versus\u00a0\nwarm weather and humidity levels and how that\u00a0\u00a0 affects the common cold how that affects covid 19\u00a0\ninfluenza virus so let's go ahead and get started\u00a0\u00a0 so first things first does colder temperatures\u00a0\nmake you more prone to getting the common cold\u00a0\u00a0 to getting influenza to getting covid 19 which is\u00a0\ncaused by the SARS coronavirus type 2 most health\u00a0\u00a0 experts agree that when it's colder out more\u00a0\npeople end up spending more time indoors and\u00a0\u00a0 this actually facilitates the spread of viruses\u00a0\nalso experts believe that when it's warmer weather\u00a0\u00a0 the immune system might actually function a little\u00a0\nbit better compared to colder weather and there\u00a0\u00a0 are actually studies out there that looked at\u00a0\nspecific viruses and how they spread during\u00a0\u00a0 cold versus warm weather and at different humidity\u00a0\nlevels back in 2007 there was this study in this\u00a0\u00a0 one particular study looking at the spread of the\u00a0\ninfluenza virus they put guinea pigs together in\u00a0\u00a0 a chamber and carried out different environmental\u00a0\nexperiments on them they found that low relative\u00a0\u00a0 humidities of 20 to 35 percent were most favorable\u00a0\nfor infection while transmission was completely\u00a0\u00a0 blocked at high humidity levels of 80 percent they\u00a0\nalso found that when guinea pigs were kept at 5\u00a0\u00a0 degrees Celsius transmission occurred with greater\u00a0\nfrequency compared to 20 degrees Celsius in a 30\u00a0\u00a0 degrees Celsius there is no transmission detected\u00a0\nat all the authors concluded that low relative\u00a0\u00a0 humidities produced by indoor heating and cold\u00a0\ntemperatures favored spread of influenza viruses\u00a0\u00a0 I also want to add that during the winter months\u00a0\nduring the cold weather people can get runny noses\u00a0\u00a0 without actually having a cold but if they have a\u00a0\ncold and they have this running nose those viruses\u00a0\u00a0 can be spread easier in those secretions that\u00a0\ncome from nose and then people often wipe their\u00a0\u00a0 nose without cleaning them and then shaking other\u00a0\npeople or touching surfaces and then other people\u00a0\u00a0 touch those surfaces so that's another factor into\u00a0\nwhy viruses spread better in the winter months 40%\u00a0\u00a0 of common colds are caused by rhinoviruses the\u00a0\nsecond most common cause of cold is the corona\u00a0\u00a0 virus the normal coronavirus not this novel\u00a0\ncoronavirus aka SARS coronavirus - it's been\u00a0\u00a0 shown that the Rhino virus reproduces more quickly\u00a0\nat colder temperatures which means you can catch a\u00a0\u00a0 cold more quickly if you're cold and this probably\u00a0\napplies to the corona virus as well it's likely\u00a0\u00a0 that with a combination of all these five factors\u00a0\nthat I just mentioned meaning colder temperatures\u00a0\u00a0 lower humidity people staying indoors more often\u00a0\nin the winter months cold weather causing runny\u00a0\u00a0 noses and our immune system being more active\u00a0\nwhen it's warmer these combination of factors\u00a0\u00a0 likely explains why colds flu and covid 19 are\u00a0\nmore likely to cause infections in the winter\u00a0\u00a0 months but there is likely a sixth factor as\u00a0\nwell and that's vitamin D our bodies don't\u00a0\u00a0 normally make vitamin D unless we get sunlight in\u00a0\nthe winter months for most of us in the world we\u00a0\u00a0 don't get enough sunlight to make enough vitamin D\u00a0\nunless you live in a warmer climate then maybe you\u00a0\u00a0 are an exception so if you aren't getting enough\u00a0\nsunlight in the winter months that means you have\u00a0\u00a0 to get enough vitamin D in your diet and if you\u00a0\ndon't do that you'll have low vitamin D levels\u00a0\u00a0 vitamin D helps regulate our calcium levels and is\u00a0\nimportant for bone and muscle health it also plays\u00a0\u00a0 a role in regulating our immune system but its\u00a0\nexact role is not known so why is this important\u00a0\u00a0 when it comes to the common cold and the flu\u00a0\nand possibly even covid 19 so vitamin D doesn't\u00a0\u00a0 actually affect viruses it actually affects\u00a0\nthe way our immune system handles infections\u00a0\u00a0 such as viruses back in 2017 there was a large\u00a0\nstudy in the British Medical Journal and it was\u00a0\u00a0 a meta-analysis meaning it looked at a bunch of\u00a0\nother studies combines all the data from each of\u00a0\u00a0 those studies and analyzes and interprets\u00a0\nthese numbers into one huge study in this\u00a0\u00a0 specifically I looked at over 25 randomized\u00a0\ncontrol trials with a total of over 11,000 people\u00a0\u00a0 who took vitamin D in this meta-analysis that\u00a0\nshowed that there was a significant association\u00a0\u00a0 between low vitamin D levels and being more\u00a0\nprone to developing respiratory infections it\u00a0\u00a0 also showed that daily or weekly supplementation\u00a0\nwith vitamin D have the greatest benefit for those\u00a0\u00a0 with a vitamin D deficiency the ones who benefited\u00a0\nthe most were the ones with more severe vitamin D\u00a0\u00a0 deficiency specifically blood levels below\u00a0\n10 and G's per ml and this decreased their\u00a0\u00a0 risk of respiratory infection by 50% if they\u00a0\nhad vitamin D supplementation it also showed\u00a0\u00a0 that all participants experience some beneficial\u00a0\neffects from regular vitamin D supplementation\u00a0\u00a0 not just if they were deficient it also showed\u00a0\nthat taking occasional high doses of vitamin D\u00a0\u00a0 did not produce significant benefits so the\u00a0\nkey takeaway there is that you have to take the\u00a0\u00a0 vitamin D on a relatively routine basis for it to\u00a0\nbe effective and these results were statistically\u00a0\u00a0 significant with a large n of over 11,000 so what\u00a0\nis my recommendation for taking vitamin D the best\u00a0\u00a0 thing that you could do is actually have your\u00a0\ndoctor check your vitamin D levels if low you\u00a0\u00a0 could get vitamin D supplementation maybe this\u00a0\nis done by getting more in your diet maybe this\u00a0\u00a0 is done by taking a vitamin D supplement exactly\u00a0\nhow much you take should be a discussion between\u00a0\u00a0 you and your doctor I do realize that not everyone\u00a0\nfrom a practical standpoint can get their vitamin\u00a0\u00a0 D levels checked a good broad recommendation would\u00a0\nbe to take 800 IU or 1000 I use either every day\u00a0\u00a0 or every other day and it's highly unlikely that\u00a0\nsomeone taking that dose every day is gonna run\u00a0\u00a0 into vitamin D toxicity but again that's a broad\u00a0\ngeneralization so we can get into a little bit\u00a0\u00a0 more details with that right now if you're getting\u00a0\nyour vitamin D levels measured you want to aim for\u00a0\u00a0 a level between 20 to 30 NGS per ml and definitely\u00a0\ndo not exceed 30 9ng per ml we also know that too\u00a0\u00a0 much vitamin D can be a bad thing vitamin D is\u00a0\none of four fat soluble vitamins and that means\u00a0\u00a0 the body stores the vitamin more readily in the\u00a0\nbody compared to non fat soluble vitamins and\u00a0\u00a0 this is significant because storing it in the\u00a0\nbody means more potential for it to have toxic\u00a0\u00a0 effects so just remember too much is not a good\u00a0\nthing with vitamin D as well as other supplements\u00a0\u00a0 some brands are more trustworthy than others my\u00a0\ngo-to source to find out trustworthy brands for\u00a0\u00a0 vitamins and supplements and such is ConsumerLab\u00a0\ncalm and this is an independent lab that tests\u00a0\u00a0 various products I have no association with them\u00a0\nand there's no financial relationship that I have\u00a0\u00a0 with them so you can check out that website the\u00a0\nvitamin D that I personally recommend I have no\u00a0\u00a0 relationship with this company either would be\u00a0\nnature made this nature made brain for vitamin D\u00a0\u00a0 is also recommended by a consumer lab if you\u00a0\nwant to purchase on Amazon I'll provide a link\u00a0\u00a0 below vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin that\u00a0\nis important for overall immune health its exact\u00a0\u00a0 role is not known however it does seem to help the\u00a0\nfunction of white blood cells but again the exact\u00a0\u00a0 role in our body's defenses is unknown vitamin C\u00a0\nis also important for iron absorption and being\u00a0\u00a0 deficient in iron can make you more vulnerable to\u00a0\ninfections in general but normal recommended daily\u00a0\u00a0 intake of vitamin C for adults from the diet and\u00a0\nor from supplements is 75 to 120 milligrams you\u00a0\u00a0 can get about 80 to 90 milligrams from a cup of\u00a0\norange juice or a sliced orange or even more from\u00a0\u00a0 a kiwi fruit or a couple of sweet peppers so it's\u00a0\npretty easy to get adequate amounts of vitamin C\u00a0\u00a0 just from the diet alone it's common folklore\u00a0\nthat taking vitamin C supplements helps treat\u00a0\u00a0 cold symptoms but for the most part that folklore\u00a0\njust doesn't hold up to scientific study in 2005\u00a0\u00a0 researchers analyzed 55 published studies that\u00a0\nlooked at vitamin C's ability to fight symptoms\u00a0\u00a0 of the common cold and the findings were pretty\u00a0\nunderwhelming in most of the studies they found\u00a0\u00a0 no benefit to taking vitamin C to treat a cold\u00a0\nthough one large study found that people taking\u00a0\u00a0 a very large dose eat thousand milligrams at the\u00a0\nstart of a cold got better faster but subsequent\u00a0\u00a0 studies were not able to confirm these findings\u00a0\nas of now there's not enough research to recommend\u00a0\u00a0 that people take vitamin C supplements either\u00a0\nbefore or after they get a cold so once again\u00a0\u00a0 there's no evidence that taking a vitamin\u00a0\nC supplement even at high doses can protect\u00a0\u00a0 people from the effects from coronaviruses\u00a0\nthis strategy is being promoted on various\u00a0\u00a0 websites and social media high doses of vitamin C\u00a0\ngiven intravenously are currently being looked\u00a0\u00a0 at in covid 19 patients in China who developed\u00a0\npneumonia so those results are still pending but\u00a0\u00a0 taking in more vitamin C than you need can lead\u00a0\nto some side effects that includes GI upset so\u00a0\u00a0 stomach upset maybe a little diarrhea here and\u00a0\nthere and if you take too much over the long\u00a0\u00a0 term that can lead to kidney stones and possibly\u00a0\ncataracts so until there are further studies that\u00a0\u00a0 definitively show that vitamin C supplementation\u00a0\nis beneficial and preventing and/or treating\u00a0\u00a0 respiratory illnesses such as the common cold flu\u00a0\nand now covid 19 I do not recommend taking extra\u00a0\u00a0 vitamin C unless you are vitamin C deficient and\u00a0\nit's highly unlikely that your vitamin C deficient\u00a0\u00a0 if you eat food on a daily basis zinc has been one\u00a0\nof the most popular suggestions for helping with\u00a0\u00a0 symptoms of cold and even this covid 19 there have\u00a0\nbeen conflicting results about the effect of zinc\u00a0\u00a0 on the severity and duration of cold symptoms some\u00a0\nstudies showed that zinc reduces the duration of a\u00a0\u00a0 cold by half while others showed no effect another\u00a0\nstudy found that the type of zinc taken determine\u00a0\u00a0 the result zinc gluconate lozenges that provide\u00a0\n13 milligrams of zinc lessen the duration of colds\u00a0\u00a0 but zinc acetate lawson jizz that provided 5 or\u00a0\n11 milligrams of zinc did not zinc has also been\u00a0\u00a0 shown in a lab study to inhibit the replication of\u00a0\ncorona virus in cells not this novel coronavirus\u00a0\u00a0 but the regular coronavirus there's no evidence\u00a0\nat this time though to suggest that using zinc\u00a0\u00a0 lozenges can prevent this novel coronavirus\u00a0\nthis covid 19 and additional research is\u00a0\u00a0 needed to determine whether zinc actually has an\u00a0\neffect on colds also keep in mind that excess of\u00a0\u00a0 zinc ingestion can lead to copper deficiency and\u00a0\ncan impair the absorption of antibiotics and the\u00a0\u00a0 use of zinc nasal gels or swabs has been linked to\u00a0\ntemporary or permanent loss of smell traditionally\u00a0\u00a0 a kanesha has been used to help treat cold\u00a0\nsymptoms there have been multiple studies that\u00a0\u00a0 have suggested that taking it when cold symptoms\u00a0\nfirst begin reduces the length and severity of\u00a0\u00a0 symptoms however these studies were very low\u00a0\nquality and higher-quality studies that have been\u00a0\u00a0 done since then showed that there was no benefit\u00a0\nto doing so okay now a final word regarding herbs\u00a0\u00a0 and supplements it's difficult to talk about most\u00a0\nherbs in supplements with scientific Authority\u00a0\u00a0 because most have not been well studied for\u00a0\neffectiveness for side effects and for appropriate\u00a0\u00a0 dosage also the FDA does not strictly regulate how\u00a0\nherbs and supplements are manufactured therefore\u00a0\u00a0 are compared to prescribed medications and non\u00a0\nprescribed medications is a bigger unknown in\u00a0\u00a0 terms of strength purity and safety so it's best\u00a0\nto talk to your doctor before you start taking\u00a0\u00a0 any supplement many interact with medications\u00a0\nand many interact with each other and some are\u00a0\u00a0 not recommended for people with certain health\u00a0\nconditions most supplements should be avoided by\u00a0\u00a0 women who are pregnant or breastfeeding and most\u00a0\nhaven't been tested for safety and children and\u00a0\u00a0 therefore should not be given to them now I'm not\u00a0\ntrying to hawk any products like this guy you're\u00a0\u00a0 saying that silver solution would be effective\u00a0\nbut what I

from impact p 1093 my name is theodore rule and it's my pleasure today to present these results on behalf of the impact 1093 study team i'll be presenting data about the 24-week safety tolerability and efficacy of the dollar tech purchase personal tablets in children ages four weeks to less than six years of age with hiv deutsche beer is recommended for first-line treatment of adults and children with hiv due to its potency high barrier to resistance and tolerability a five milligram dispersible tablet pediatric formulation is being evaluated at impact p1093 an ongoing phase one two open label pka safety efficacy and joe's finding study today i'll present our 24-week results among participants who received the dose proposed regulatory authorities lab of fda actually approved this formulation on june 18 of 2020 with a hyperlink to the label provided at the bottom of the slide this slide summarizes our methods children were enrolled into three age cohorts four weeks to six months six months to two years and two years to six years children had to have an hiv rna of greater than one thousand copies per ml time of enrollment this could include treatment i.e for treatment experience treatment prevailing therapy dispersible tablets with five milligram units and dosed by differential rate bands as shown on the table below children also received an optimized background regimen that included two other agents which one had to have genotype predictive activity clinical and laboratory assessments occur between days five and thirteen and then at weeks four eight twelve sixteen and twenty four with three day vision windows safety data including this analysis for current april 30th 2019 additional videos about the protocol can be found at the impact website shown by

12 percent from thailand four percent from the usa and 14 from brazil twenty nine percent of the millionaires were aot naive intermediate and rna at the time normal is 4.3 log copies per ml the optimized background regimens are summarized in the table to the right you can see that 47 received a block of air plus the levity an additional 20 received xaidavity plus the xyz and the diversity of different regimens um received by the other children but worth noting that 13 of them received lenigra or tonovir as part of the regiment and one shall receive both the favrens as well as derivative this slide summarizes our viral logic efficacy results it was assessed in 34 or 67 of participants who had 24-week hiv rna results available at the time of data freeze in the figure you can see the proportion of participants who achieved a viral load of less than 400 copies per ml at different time points in the 24 week period the table on the right summarizes those at the 24-week time point the first row represents those with fire loads of less than 400 copies per ml 29 or of 34 or 85 percent participants achieve that end point second row summarizes those who achieve less than 50 copies per amount that included 18 of 34 or 53 percent you'll know why the confidence intervals reflect the small sample size of this population ultimately we've also included for reference results from similarly structured sailing trial and adults which reported that 87 comparable achieved a proportion of less than 400 copies 79 achieved less than 50 copies at 24 weeks in that trial slide summarizes the viral logic and immunologic outcomes of children receiving the dispersible tablet formulation of dollar tegaver that's stratified by age cohort so across the first row you can see the three age cohorts defined with again four weeks to six months and that was included seventeen children nine children were six months or two years and eight children were two years to six years smaller numbers across the first row you can see the proportion that achieved hiv rna of less than 50 copies per ml at 24 weeks that proportion was 41 percent in our youngest cohort 67 in the middle and 63 percent of the oldest cohort across the second row you can see the proportion proportions have achieved less than 400 copies in comparison these were much more comparable across the age cohorts with 88 percent the younger school 189 of middle cohort and 75 percent of the oldest cohort across the bottom two rows you can see changes in cd4 count in cd4 percent without going into details you can see that most achieved some degree of recovery but there were wide ranges of diversity met among them in some cases even declines these data were difficult to interpret when overlaid upon normal age expected changes across these time periods safety and tolerability is summarized in this slide all children who received the proposed dose were included in safety analyses no grade three or four adverse events were attributed to study drug and accordingly study drug was never discontinued due to toxicity table below summarizes adverse events of any attribution or overall of grade three or greater severity the first row summarizes clinical events or participants who experienced clinical events this included 13 of the youngest cohort 17 of the middle age and six percent of the oldest cohort laboratory events are summarized in the second row fifty-seven percent of the underscore thirty-three percent of the middle and nineteen percent of the oldest cohort experienced laboratory events laboratory events included anemia neutropenia and clinical events included common infectious diseases such as pneumonia diarrheal illnesses that are unfortunately commonly experienced in the study population in our study settings and in greater incidents in the yucca populations tolerability of the dispersible type of formulation was excellent palatability rated as average good or very good for 98 of respondents in summary the dispersible tablet formulation of dollar tega verb was well tolerated had a favorable safety profile and demonstrated viral logic efficacy among infants and children ages four weeks to six years with diverse prior art experience the variable cd4 changes seen likely reflect multiple factors including recovery or laid upon age-related normal changes we believe our results support the recent fda approval of this pediatric formulation of dilatography for the treatment of children living with hiv globally the authors would like to advance the entire p1093 protocol team sites staff and most importantly participants and their caregivers we'd also like to acknowledge vive healthcare gsk for their team and financial support and overall support from the niaid and nichd the impact trial network thank you thank you dr rule for that very interesting abstract dr rajendra singh from vive healthcare in the u.s will be reporting pediatric wteg revere dosing recommendations derived from combined p1093 and odyssey population pharmacokinetic analyses hi i'm rajendra singh thanks for providing opportunity to present my recent work i am presenting results from population pk analysis of toilet revere for supporting pediatric dosing recommendation the population pk analysis is based on data from two studies impact pita 93 study and penthouse odyssey study peter 93 study was a phase one to multi-center open level pk safety and tolerability study uh while odyssey study was a randomized trial of dtg based antiretroviral therapy versus standard of care in children with hiv infection starting first or sec switching to second line art the objective of overall analysis was to perform pop pk analysis to support dosing recommendation derived from combined p1093 and odc data and to assess whether there is a correlation between dtg pk parameters and selected safety endpoints overall 239 subject provided data for population pk and pk safety analysis baseline age was 6.3 years and baseline body weight was 22 kg black rays constitute almost 80 percent of data with white and asian corresponding to 10 percent each fill coated tablet granules and dispersable tablets were the three formulation used in peta 93 study in odyssey study film portrait tablet and dispersable tablet were used data was collected under fasted or without regard to food conditions one compartment model with first order absorption and first order elimination was used to characterize thermokinetics of toilet review in periodic participant the base model includes allometrically scaled clearance and volume of distribution model also include a maturation function as defined by anderson at all inter occasion variability was used on clearance as well as rate of absorption the relative bialability was estimated for granules and dispersible tablet related to film coated tablet based on poppy model estimated oral clearance was 1.3 liter per hour volume of distribution was 13.6 liter rate of absorption for granules and dispersable tablet was more than 2 fold higher than film coated tablet the relative availability of dispersible tablet and granule as compared to fill coated tablet was 50 percent higher and the biology without regard to food was ten percent higher than viability under fasted condition interoperation variability on clearance was thirty four percent and the inter individual variability on clearance and volume was less than 30 percent while for rate of absorption it is approximately hundred percent the extrapolation of doses in periodic participant is based on adult equivalent exposure that means if auc c max or c trough in periodic participant within a weight band is similar to adult exposure then efficacy will be same for pediatric dose selection therefore targets were predefined the targets were based on primarily adult geometric mean data coming from 50 cubit doors for auc the target geometric mean was 46 with the range of 37 234 microgram per ml for trough concentration the target was 995 with the range of 697 to 2260 nanogram per ml maximum lower limits were also set they were set based on e-max model in hiv infected subject corresponding to 95 percent of maximum biological response for auc it was 25 micro mr per ml for c trough it was 500 nanogram per ml one compartment population pk model was adequate to characterize data from two study for del tegravir in pediatric subjects this slide shows proposed doses based on population pk model and simulated exposure corresponding to those doses for example in 3 to 6 kg weight band for subject greater than 1 year 1 month of age 5 dispersible tablet dose is proposed accounting for maturation function in 6 to 10 kg weight bend two different doses were proposed one can make disposable tablet for subject below six months of age and 15 make disposable tablet for subject greater than six month of age in all cases the exposures were within the predefined target range for both auc as well as c drop no target were defined for c max for dose selection based on modeling and simulation and exposure safety analysis doses were proposed for film coated tablet as well as disposable tablet for 6 to 10 kg weight band as shown in left panel doses were proposed by accounting for maturation function and they were stratified by age for subject greater than six month of age tanmay dispersable tablet dose was proposed for subjects greater than 6 months of age 15 mig dispersible tablet dose was proposed in discussion with fda that age stratification was removed and for 6 to 10 kg weight band only a 15 make disposable tablet dose was finalized to conclude the model described data from both study and associated variability adequately based on simulated and observed data those stratification by age was proposed in 6 to 10 kg weight band where 10 mcdos was proposed for subject less than 6 months of age and 15 mg dispersable tablet dose was proposed for subject greater than six month a of age in discussion with fda age stratification was removed and 15 big dispersable tablet dose was approved for 6 to 10 kg weight band at all the proposed doses both auc and c-max were within target range the safety exposure response analysis demonstrated no relationship between pk parameters and adverse event thank you for your attention thank you dr singh for that interesting abstract dr eva natacunda from joint clinical research center uganda reporting safety pharmacokinetics and efficacy of low-dose ecf taff in biologically suppressed children over two years of age living with hiv doctor even at kunda from uganda on behalf of the research team i present the safety pharmacokinetics and efficacy of low dose ecf traffic biologically suppress children 82 years and above living with hiv i report no conflict of interest young children especially those weighing less than 25 kilograms living with hiv have few erv options there is no single tablet regimen used or approved for this population in the u.s or european union taft has been shown to have a safe bone adrenal profile in adults older children and adolescents in association with low plasma tenofovir exposures compared to 10 of overdiesel proxy the fixed dose cognition tablet of lv demographic copy system in pristine and tuff is a once daily concrete era of regimen recommended as uninitiated men in the u.s in adults adolescents and children at least six years of age and weighing at least 25 kilograms this single tablet regimen has now been co-formulated into a low-dose tablet for children who are at least two years of age and going between 14 and 25 kilograms we report today the first pk safety and efficacy data of the low dose tablet vcf taffy children three years and above living with hiv this is a simple um open labor study with an external design the primary endpoints of this study are to determine the plasma pk of immunography and taff and evaluate the safety and probability of ecf2 through 24 weeks of treatment the primary results from code 3 are the focus of the present analysis key inclusion criteria for cohort 3 included a viral load of less than 50 copies for at least 6 months cd4 count of at least 400 cells per mma and egfr of at least 90. 27 participants were enrolled in all underweight intensive pk testing at week 2. the primary endpoint of this cohort was reached at week 24 and secondary endpoints at room 48 after 48 after route 48 participants are offered continued participation in the extension phase of the study of the 35 patients screened 27 were enrolled and all have reached at least 40 weeks at baseline the median age was six years with a lower age of three years the median weight was 19.3 kilograms and 63 percent were female almost half were enrolled in south africa with the remain half enrolled in thailand uganda usa and zimbabwe 89 percent of participants were black all were biologically suppressed that study entry had a median cd4 percentage of 37 and the median cd4 count of 1600 and a good renal function most were infected through vertical transmission most baseline era virus means prior to study drug where nrtis and two nrdis the picket parameter ovary under the curve for every degree and tough was the primary endpoint in the study the geometric main auc of ebg and tough encode 3 were compared to adult auc values and were shown to be modestly higher in children than adults the evidence constitution was slightly lower in children than others but was still nine-fold above the inhibitory constitution for wild-type virus exposures of evd are from within the range of historical data in adults adolescents and children that have been shown to be both safe and efficacious additionally exposures of co-resistance ftc and tenancy also remain within range of historical data there were adverse events of any grade reported in 74 percent of participants but no grade three or four adverse events no adverse events leading to drug discontinuation and no deaths the most common and perseverant participants the most common adverse events were respiratory tract infections cough decreased appetite and vomiting four participants had adverse events considered related to studying drug consisting of diarrhea vomiting acetylene and decreased appetite the one unrelated serious adverse event was pneumonia one participant had a grade three laboratory abnormality of decreased platelets egfr remains stable over 48 week period one minute density analysis showed that participants minimized born according to their reference population additionally no participants had a four percent or more decline in spine or total body less and bmd by week 48 over 48 weeks body weight improved while fewer gains were observed with height consistent with what has been reported in the literature which would be living highly unstable originals biologic efficacy by fba snapshot analysis at 28 showed that 89 percent of subjects encode three were below the threshold of 350 copies per year due to coping 19 restrictions data was missing in the analysis window for seven subjects no subject met the criteria for resistance testing the cd4 count should then initially decline a quick two that was not reflected in the percentage both remains stable to 48 weeks acceptability and palatability were also assessed by questionnaire requesting information as to whether the tablet was broken in half to sell which was allowed by the study and how easy it was swallowed and how acceptable shape size and test of the temperature for participants mean adherence assessed by peer countryside at 97 solubility and component of acceptability and palatability were assisted baseline and between 4 and 24. the number of children who needed to split the tablet decreased from 4 at one might be 24. ease of swelling was high in this population in which the youngest age was three years and improved over the 24 week duration and this was also mainly rated as good news for good throughout the 24 weeks in conclusion in virginia suppressed children each of them flip those single tablet treatment was well tolerated all areas were mild to moderate there were no adverse events that led to discontinuation essential demonstrated excellent adherence and maintain biologic suppression the low dose tablet had a high level of acceptability exposures of evidence on top are consistent with ranges exposures observed in adults in phase 3 trials of ecf staff efficacy and safety were consistent with results from phase 3 trials which showed high proportions of viral suppression no resistance and good durability these data support further pediatric studies of ecfter which may be an important integral inhibitor option for which had infected young children aged two years and above a potential determinant thank you very much this study was funded by geared sciences thank you dr natacunda professor juliet wanga from epicenter uganda reporting on safety pharmacokinetics and acceptability of the ibaccavir 3tc lopitovir retinovir granules 4 and 1 in children living with hiv three to 20 kilos in uganda the lollipop study representing the labor study interim results on behalf of all the authors lollipop is a phase one to randomize crossover peak safety and acceptability study of four in one fixed dose combination of a barca bala movidin lopinava and returnable compared to la pinawa return over pellets plus a bakabala movie dispense with tablets insulin living with hiv weighing between 3 and 25 kilograms children were dosed as furtherate away dozen schedules children from wet band 2 to 5 are reminds to either receive the 4 in 1 or the reference formulation for that one days decent picker is performed and then the treatment arms are switched and children receive return days of other formulation the second intensification performed and then children are returned to their standard of care children from westbound one are not randomized they receive a four in one for 21 days followed by intensive pk and then returned to their standard of care the four-in-one formulation also called quadrimune are granules the size of the granules are optimal for very young children and this formulation is well test masked here we see the environment per weight band 44 children were screened and the three were enrolled into the study of these four patients were in weight band 1 uh and 29 in the highest weight band 15 of who were enrolled into the four in one first while 14 were assigned to a reference formulation first data sets available for all but two children not included in the pk set baseline characters for gender age and weight are as expected all the children were already on lupine best therapy and 76 percent of them had been on interactive for six months or more at the time of enrollment 21 29 of the 39 that three children had viral load below 400 copies per meal at this line the proportion of children with very low less than 400 copies per meal increased from 87 percent at baseline that is the blue box 97 percent at the end of the study that's a red box the proportion withdrawal drivers less than 50 copies per mail increased from 48 to 65 percent when excluding the missing data the median change in cd for sale count was on rank 20 and on average there was no change in 64 percentage in terms of safety 101 treatment emergent adverse events were reported 96 were mild four moderate and one severe non-led treatment discontinuation one was seriously broken ammonia which started while on reference formulation the most common adverse event we are vomiting 52 percent of the episodes and all treatments related adverse events were of grade one here we see the pk results for back cover the blue cultures are back over in the four in one and the red cup shows up back over in the reference formulation these two exposure curves overlapped nicely the area under the cup target was set extracted from the arrow study and the back of our package inside the geometric mean ratio for area under the curve is 49 percent a c max geometric mean ratio for abakava is 24 percent lower thereby equivalence criteria we have made for a bar cover area under the curve here we see the peak results for three tc as before the blue curve shows the 3dc in the fourteen one and the red cup shows the 3t c in that reference formulation the geometric mean ratio of four in one for every under the cup is 82 percent and the c max is 69 percent neither under the curve nor c max made by equivalence criteria but we're comparable to historical exposures in adults and children interestingly through tc exposure with four in one we're closer to historical values here we see the peak results follow in the foreign one and in the reference formulation the gmr area under the curve was 12 percent lower with the four in one and lower confidence interval lay outside the by equivalence range filipino c-max geometric mean ratio was 19 percent lower absorption of la pinavac was slower with the four in one overall the lupine over exposure was comparable to historical data in adults and exposure with a foreign one were closer than those with a reference formulation two of the four children with weight band one and one child in weight band four had sit half below 1000 nanograms weight band one includes heterogeneous population of children and we are currently gathering more data in this weight band if we look at the characteristics of the white bandwidth children the first two heard with a low exposure at 8 less than five months at the start of the study and presented either with comorbidities or suspicion of prematurity but two other children eight eight months had a very low weight of screening with severe malnutrition all children gained weight in 21 days and and their radical suppression improved on treatment food did not appear to impact on exposure here we see the exposure of la pinaba by formulation according to the expected upper and lower target exposure stratified by weight band in weight bands two three and four extra sloping is very close to the expected range is observing adults we band one the target range is based on that observed with liquid formulation in children we see white variability with the with our four children all enrolled to date given the small number in the wake on one children uh we cannot yet draw upon conclusion and so more children are being ruptured in this way and as conclusion weight band two to four demonstrated comparable drug exposure two children in weight band one had c12 below one than nanograms four in one was well to related including in women one children and seven percent of children who are violent suppressed at the end of the study uranus one had a decline in viral load after 21 days of exposure the study is ongoing and final results will be available and details about accessibility of this new four-in-one formulation are presented during this conference we thank children and caregivers who participated in the lollipop study in uganda as well as all study staff partners and the sponsors we thank unitate for their support and thank you all for listening thank you dr malanga dr jason baca from baylor college of medicine children's foundation tanzania reporting on the dtgs of dtg for children and adolescents living with hiv or cal hiv descriptions trends and gaps of rolling out dolutegravir in cal hiv in mabella tanzania hello ladies and gentlemen and friends and colleagues my name is jason bacha from the baylor college of medicine children's foundation tanzania and the baylor international pediatric aids initiative and i'm excited to present the findings from our study titled the dtgs of dtg for children and adolescents living with hiv descriptions trends and gaps of rolling out dola tegrovir in children and adolescents living with hiv in mba tanzania background to the study as i think we well know efficacy and safety data of novel arvs in children often lag behind the adult data and this lag can lead to hesitation and slow uptake by prescribers of using new arvs regarding dtg specifically some of the early trial data has been reassuring um in children specifically the impact in odyssey but of course it's small sample size and hard to know how it will translate to real world settings where the medicine is used and needed the most um in 2019 tanzania procured dtg updated guidelines and began a country wide rollout and therefore to try to understand better the use the safety and efficacy of dtg in tanzania we studied and described the characteristics and outcomes of this rollout in children adolescents living with hiv treated with dtg in our clinic in embaya tanzania the methodology we used we did a retrospective chart review to describe these characteristics and outcomes of children who were prescribed and given dtg as part of their arv regimen the site again was the baylor college of medicine children's foundation tanzania center of excellent in embaya tanzania which is in southwestern tanzania the inclusion criteria of our cohort was children adolescence ages 0 to 19 hiv positive who are on art and in care at the baylor tanzania clinic in embaya and the dates of analysis were through the 1st of march 2019 when dtg became available at our site through the end of that year 31st december 2019. also of note we defined hiv viral load suppression as less than 1 000 copies per the in country guidelines what did the results of our study show we had 681 patients who received dtg at the embayo coe during the time of study in 2019. the 681 made up 46 of all patients on art at our center and 60 of patients who are eligible to receive dtg defined as having a weight of 20 kilograms or more the pie figure below shows the distribution of regimens used you can see the majority of patients receive the tld fixed dose combination the table on the right shows the baseline characteristics of our cohort there was a nice split of male female the average age was right around 14 years of age ranging from five up to 19. the time on art was average of five years again ranging from new initiations up to 14 years of arv exposure baseline who stages of the cohort showed over 60 percent with a stage 3 or 4 reflecting the complex care and complex patients we see at our center but thankfully through the course of the study 98 percent of patients were able to be a wh treatment stage one also of note we had about 60 of our patients with some form of severe or moderate malnutrition again reflecting the complexity of patients and care at our center and as for the art status of this cohort 12 percent were new irt patients with new initiations the remainder were shifted from prior regimens with the majority 62 percent that had been on nnrti regiments as for our outcomes data we had very reassuring data with zero patients having any severe drug toxicity or negative outcomes of the patients on dtg 95 of the cohort remained actively and safely in our care while the remaining five percent were successfully transferred out and we had zero deaths and zero loss to follow up also of our dtg cohorts 77 were able to utilize multi-month prescribing the figures on the right the upper figure shows viral suppression rates pre and post dtg among stark cohort with viral load results prior to the dtg 77 were virally suppressed and at the end of the study post changing the dtg regimens 84 percent were virally suppressed the bottom two figures on the left it shows of patients with viral loads pre and post who were initially unsuppressed we were able to suppress 63 percent of those patients by using a dtg regimen likewise of patients previously suppressed who were changed to dtg 95 percent were then suppressed through using dtg so in summary our study showed that dtg was very well tolerated and quite effective in our clinically diverse cohort of adolescents in children living with hiv again there was no toxicity no adverse events no deaths no issues with dtg it also showed that the use of dtg resulted in viral suppression for many of our previously unsuppressed patients and these results we hope are very encouraging and that they show that dtg can successfully and should successfully be used in children and adolescents living with hiv thank you very much for your time and listening to this presentation thank you dr baca and finally agaron collin from macarrera university uganda acceptability of a new four-in-one ibakavir lamividine lopinibir ratanavir pediatric fixed dose combination the caregiver child dyad's perspective i would like to thank the organizers for the opportunity to present the qualitative results of the lollipop acceptability study i am again calling a qualitative researcher on this study so we set out to investigate a new four in one pediatric fixed dose combination of above la miuvedin lope nava and retinova which was brought by simpler in partnership with dndi for use in low resource settings where infants and children have challenges swallowing tablets overall this study is also presented at this workshop so what was the objective the objective was to assess caregivers perceived acceptability and related factors of the fine one formula compared to pellets and tablets under the methods we are saying that it was an open-ended randomized crossover from a coconut safety and acceptability study and we purposefully sampled an administrative 18 semi-structured interviews to caregiver diets between three to 19.9 kilograms interviews were conducted after the 21st day of the foreign one as shown in the figure in this slide we use an inductive thematic analysis with support of a computer software called in vivo version fellow so now i move to the results and i first want to talk about caregivers perception regarding characters acceptance of the foreign one and later on i will talk about the factors related to their acceptability in overall the caregivers had a better experience of the four-in-one than any other formula for example the syrups and pellets that they previously used hence the foreign one was highly acceptable on matters of children's acceptance i want to say that most children enjoyed it because it was sweet as one of the caregivers noted she likes and enjoys it because she responds very well she does not become nervous when she is taking the formula now i want to move the acceptability factors relating to the formulation and storage many felt that the foreign one wasn't easier to store this was because it is kept at room temperature unlike previous formulas in addition the formula four in one had an average five minutes time taken for administration compared to others and this gave caregivers a better perception about its as one of the caregivers noted another good thing is that it is stored at room temperature then the first era was set up which required someone to find a free to keep them safe now i want to talk about acceptability factors relating to the packaging and testing so generally the packaging was received well by most of the caregivers however for a few who said the bottle was too big and then for the children the test was nice for the foreign one as i said earlier on so it was swedish and this is backed up by experiences where one of the characters noted that their experience has been good and easy oh this formula is an easy form because you just open the capsule and pour it in honey porridge or medic and give it to the child now i want to move to aspects around factors related to caregivers acceptability and here we are saying information and adherence another information endurance caregivers learned easily how to correctly administer the foreign one because they knew the effects of a missed dose as one of them noted not adhering to the drug the child soldiers reduce meaning a high viral load under motivation they are the caregivers had witnessed positive results of the foreign one in the short run or in the short term in terms of weight and growth of their children and this gave them a real hope that their children's future was bright for example one of them said when my child grows up i would like him to become a doctor so that he can also treat others now i want to move to issues around caregivers skills and innovation and understand many of the caregivers adapted innovative approaches to remind them and keep time for example alarms and on their phones and others as one noted i set my alarm at 8 00 am and 8 pm and that is the time i give my child medicine finally i want to move to the aspects of support needs and we are saying caregivers through counseling and tips to administer the following one by the health workers were very influential in acceptability yet this study was short so in the short run adherence as one of them noted the first day i started using the four in one formula i poured the powder that is like millet on a spoon and put it in the mouth of the child but it made him tend to vomit so i asked the doctor who advised me to mix the medicine into little product and then give the child this method worked very well for me in conclusion i want to say that the four-in-one is a better accepted pediatric formula than other farmers previously used i also want to say that acceptability was greatly influenced by the formula itself in terms of test is to administer and storage and finally i want to say individual motivation and tailored specific support to caregivers influence acceptability thank you very much for listening to me and i want to acknowledge all those who supported this study to take place thanks a lot", "LarjsOPp0UA": "you hello everyone good morning learning is not the product of teaching learning is the product of the activity of learners Kove

dosage forms without patent infringement etc without further delay I request the crane Vijay Kumar sir to proceed for today's talk on the topic role of in vitro in vivo correlation in bioequivalent studies and bio ever welcome sir yeah well thank you very much less it yeah thank you very much Anna sabasha for such a nice introduction about me I mean she you made it very easier for me to introduce myself I mean I think without introducing myself again I can proceed for the presentation today a very good morning wallop you very good money a very good morning to all of you I'm very sorry when I'm taking the lecture webinar lecture on Sunday also mean because when they've approached me as I am working in the industry it could not be possible for me to take the lecture on working days so I requested them to arrange it on Sunday so anyway most of you might have accepted this and participating in the lecture before proceeding to the lecture I would like to start the seminar or webinar with the prayer it's a common practice for me as my guru start me to start anything with common prayer guru brahma guru vishnu guru devo maheswara guru sakshat parabrahma tasmai sri-gurave namah ha is very big thank to all the Guru's in my life I especially am thankful to my guru and my boss and my managing director have even traditional lugar ooh for accepting this accepting my request to give the to deliver a lecture during this faculty development program one week program and recent updates in formulation development and as well as a little method development and then thank you thank you very much all the management team and especially principal sir and Shanthi NASA Pasha from polarity college of pharmacy for giving me this opportunity and for keeping me some belief on me definitely I will try my level best to share my knowledge in role of inhibitory NY the correlation in by opponents and as well as in by a waiver as you all know even nasty partial so just now we said it is very important to have the knowledge on bio equivalence and to apply the IV AVC tools to get the bio success and also on knowledge and bio weber it is very important tool especially in the formulation development so most of the audience to the targeted audience are faculty there were faculty members from various academic institutions I don't think that detailed explanation about IV IVC and the bio excellence is not required but today's seminar I would like to focus more on case studies how we can build the correlation between in vitro and in vivo and how we can get the bio waiver under what circumstances IV ABC is required and under what circumstances in vivo by equivalent testing is required and when we can exempt they by the equivalent study and how can we get the more success in bio equal and studies that I am going to focus more with one case study in bioequivalence and one case led in bio waiver so as you all know any pharmaceutical research any pharmaceutical formulations research is generally we have two types of researches one is innovative research and other one is generic research innovative research as you know it requires at least two preclinical studies Phase one clinical trials then Phase two clinical trials then followed by Phase three large number of patients then only the molecule can come it can bring the molecule into the market as a suitable dosage form so it requires more than ten years of time sometimes it may go up to 20 years of time and it requires the investment of more than 10,000 crores it is a not a small job and definitely the innovative product as a indie a new track application from they will come into the market they have some royalty and definitely they will have some patents but as a pharmaceutical or as a practical alternative to the innovator molecule there is another kind of research most of the Indian companies are focusing more and the other kind of research is nothing but a generic formulation research the major difference between a generic formulation research and innovative research is as already that osage form is existed in the market as already clinical efficacy and safety has been proven and no need to conduct all the preclinical trials no need to conduct all the phase 1 phase 2 phase 3 trials because already safety and efficacy have been proven only the objective view of generic research is to bring the copycat of existing innovator molecule into the market at low cost because innovative product innovative pharma company have done so much research elaborative research by conducting preclinical phase 1 phase 2 phase 3 clinical trials even after bringing the molecule phase 4 will be continued as post marketing surveillance so that requires more time that requires more money so that obviously the cost of the innovative product it is very very very high and cannot be affordable by the all the middle class people are below middle class people so ever even government also will gives the permission to do the generic research because royalty will be given monopoly will be given to the innovator for certain period of time but being third if we bring the generic molecule which is copycat a practical alternative to the innovator then definitely because all the studies are not required the cost can be expected to be very less so now the difference between innovator and the generic innovator have done all the clinical trials and generic no need to do the other clinical trials but at the same time all the clinical trials may not be required but to prove generic formulation is equivalent to the innovator certain criteria is required the major criteria in the list of various requirements is the bio equivalents at least we need to prove that our test formulation is bio equivalent to that of innovative formulation so then only we can I mean even Regulatory Authority will give the approval to bring the molecule into the regulatory basket to bring the molecule into the market so if the product is chemically equivalent if the product is pharmaceutical equivalent if the product is bio equivalent to the innovator then doctor can alternatively prescribes our generic formulation has a Kerr optical alternative to the innovator molecule so as the clinical trials are not required only bio equivalent test is sufficient enough the cost can be expected to be low I mean the generic formulation cost is expected to be low so this is all known to all of you so that's why I'm not going in detail about the bio equivalence and its importance but any pharma company if you consider the 50 percentage or 60 percentage of beta H or more than 60 percentage of weight is from my side I can tell you 60 percentage of weight H can be given to the bio equivalence because to bring the molecule generic formulation to bring the general formulation into the market the major part the major success story will be on bioequivalence part because formulation development anybody can do we can match the dissolution profile we can match the other quality attributes as that of innovator very quickly and very easily by conducting several experiments in vitro mapping is very easy so we can do several experiments and several manipulations in the excipients concentrations and excipient ratios are the matrix we can do anything and we can map the dissolution profile in the into the lab in the in vitro conditions but once the movement when we conduct the bio equivalence testing it is very critical to match the resolution to match the bioavailability as that of innovator so most of the pharma companies will fail in the final stage while conducting the bio equalness studies so that is the reason why if we have a tool a bio relevant tool which connects the in vitro resolution our in vitro other testing parameters with that of in vivo parameter which builds the correlation between in weed in vitro and in vivo and using that tool we can predict we can predict the bio equivalence before conducting the pipeline study so that whether to go with the BI equivalence with that formulation or any other changes required to be incorporated into the formulation that can be assist by conducting the in vitro in vivo correlation so that at least number of bio equal and studies can be reduced so that ultimately the cost of the formulation further it can be reduced down is the major objective of this present today's presentation I have chosen this topic because it is more important and fun especially the people who are working in the pharmaceutical industry and the faculty members who are working in academic farms in who are teaching post graduation students with pharmaceutics background and mylanta while advising them to do their projects work if they apply these tools definitely it would be helpful for them once if they join back to their industrial once they start their career in the industry so that is the reason why I have chosen this topic this is more important and quickly I will finish the introduction part and then I will move on to the IV ABC section and I will finish with one case study in the IB ABC with respect to buy a equivalence in Babubhai equivalents and the one case study with respect to the bio way over here the bio waiver is nothing but waiver waiver is nothing but giving some exemption for conducting the bioequivalence bio in the sense bioavailability study waiver is nothing but exemption BM given the title PEP is nothing but bio equivalence I babysit it but in vitro in Viper correlation so let me begin with the brief definitions first then I will go on to the other important requirements when the bio equal and studies are required when the by Youkilis studies are not required if by a class that is required do we need to do in Bible study or in vitro study if in vitro studies required what kind of in vitro studies are sufficient enough to get the vehicle is all these topics will be covered in the introduction then I will move on to the AIB ABC so here you can see just have given the image in vitro have represented resolution operators resolution operators is in vitro because most important quality attribute in in vitro is the resolution it has more relevant to the enviable performance in Vigo between the body upon administration how the dosage form will behaves as you all know any dosage form it is having similar APA and similar experience as that of innovator it may shows same behavior in in vitro conditions but it may not behave similarly as that of innovator and in by book because in bio it has so many other parameters will come into the picture like GI pH and gastrointestinal enzymes presence and microbial flora presence any efflux transporters and the blood flow rate so many other factors will come into the picture in in vivo conditions even body weight physiological conditions in the GI t all other factors will influence the dosage form so though our test formulation behaves similarly in in vitro it may not behave similarly in in vivo environment performance may alter so that may reflex in the bio equivalence testing so that's why many formulations will pass in in vitro testing but it may fail in in bio bio equivalence testing so if we have the correlation between in vitro and in vivo it becomes easier for a formulation scientist to predict the bioequivalence in our prediction itself if it is going behind the limit then definitely that formulation is no need to test for the by equivalence we can do certain manipulations manipulations in the formulation and again we can come back to the IV IV see if that in that repeated IV ABC if it is giving good predictable result then only it can be subjected further by equivalence testing so this IV IVC tool it will not give you any waiver for the violence but it will it will give you the predictability it will give you as it it will works as a tool to predict over by equivalence result and sometimes this IV ABC alone it will helps you to get the bio waiver also those are all factors I am going to explain in subsequent slides so here there are three levels of IV ABC as you know those are three levels of IV IV cell so I will explain in subsequent slides but begin with the definitions first by availability I mean just for having a quick recollecting the definition just have given the definitions here as if though you have already known about the viability definition and bioequivalence just unless we recollect the definitions it is very difficult to proceed further by availability as you know it is the rate and extent of the drug that enters into the system is circulation how much amount of the drug that is available at the system recirculation and it what rate it is reaching the system recirculation and of course ultimately beside affection that is a bioavailability by oh by your availability in the biological system how much amount is available and it what rate it is available in the system recirculation is known as bioavailability and the important other definition is bio equivalence by your equivalence is nothing but when the test product test product is our generic product when the test product by availability is equal into the innovators by availability innovator product is reference product our product is test product test product by all ability if it is equivalent to the innovators by all ability then these two formulations are said to be by your equivalent equivalent that means bio means bioavailability is equal but there is a criteria before testing the bioequivalence our test formulation chemically it should be equivalent and pharmaceutically it should be equivalent chemical it should be equivalent means the api using in our test formulation it should be equal into the APA used in the difference formulation APA in the sense it is active pharmaceutical ingredient it should be equal in the equal dose also APA should be if innovator formulation is paracetamol test formulation also should contain some opposite ama now set them all and if you innovate the formulation is 500mg test formulation also should have 500 mg this is nothing but the chemical equivalence if innovator is diclofenac sodium test formulation also should be diclofenac sodium if you know matter is diclofenac potassium test formulation also it should be that low final potassium that means even salt form also should be same and those also should be same in when the drug and those both are equal then these two formulations are said to be chemically equivalent when they are chemically equivalent the next part is pharmaceutical equivalence pharmaceutical equivalence nothing but if you know eighter formula this tablet your formulation also should be a tablet if innovator formylation is a capsule giver formulation also should be a capsule and if innovator formulation is through our administer through oral route your formulation also should be administer through oral route that means pharmaceutical equivalence nothing but it should be same dosage form administered through the same route of administration but we can have the Liberty to use the different excipient the track should be same dosage form should be same but we can use the different experience different packing configuration but it should mimic the behavior of in innovator formulation in in vitro conditions like it should have the same four critical quality attributes as that of innovator that means innovator formylation if it is a tablet given formulation also should be tablet if it is oral route you are also you should be oral route their dissolution profile your dissolution profile they have this integration time given disintegration time their assay you will see there are s your are s their identification you read all these critical quality attributes should be same in that case you these true formulations are said to be pharmaceutically equivalent so provided your formulation is chemically equivalent given formulation is pharmaceutical equivalent then you are allowed to do the vehicle is testing chemically equivalent should be proven pharmaceutical equivalence should be proven then only you are allowed to conduct the bio equivalence testing and once you are proven that your formulation is by equivalent to the innovator then ultimately your formulation is chemically equivalent pharmaceutical equivalent bio equivalent then absolutely this the these two formulations are practically equivalent because having the same Club administering through the same route and having the same those same dosage form having same bioavailability and ultimately the rate and amount of drug that reaches the site of action from these two dosage pumps will be same and when the drug is same amount is same rate is same definitely we can expect same therapeutic efficacy from these two dosage forms and in that case either doctor can prescribe the innovator formulation are the test formulation but as the test formulation cost is very less I mean because it is generic formulation patient can choose big is easily affordable you can choose either innovator artist from general formulation but obviously general formulation has more benefits for compared to the innovator because cost point of view so that is the major objective of generic formulation development but I said copycat is very difficult job mimicking the same as that of innovator formulation is very difficult job here the by equal and similar by a equivalents is nothing but as you know c-max value and AUC value these two are the critical parameters c-max is nothing but maximum plasma concentration achieved by the innovator formulation and test formulation should be same and AUC area under the curve achieved by the innovator formulation and test formulation both should be same because as I told you rate and extent of the drug patent of simple system recirculation is known as by availability rate and extent these are the two parameters weight and extent the rate is nothing but the c-max will give you the rate of absorption and AUC will give you the extent of absorption a rate of absorption extent of absorption for rate of absorption c-max extent of absorption a you see these two parameters are very important parameters in establishing the bioequivalence c-max should be same cases should be same same nothing but 100 percent is not at all possible even if you repeat the bioequivalence with innovated formulation versus innovator it is not possible to get the hundred percent but here there is a criteria 80 to 125 percentage if you were formulation c-max value in between 80 to 125 percentage as that of innovator you would see value in between 80 to 125 percentage of innovator formulation 80 to 125 percentage is the limit acceptance criteria given by the regulatory authorities if your formulation is infinity to one point of a percentage it can be said that your formulation is equivalent to the innovator formulation then has already proven that chemically equivalent pharmaceutical equivalent and by a equivalent you will get the approval as a general formulation and your formulation can bring into the market so patient can take either innovator are the general formulation except that all other parameters are same excellence can be different in this case chemical equivalents proving is easy permissible analysis proving is easy but proving the by equalist is very tough job for the any a malaysian scientist because in vivo performance of any dosage form is unpredictable it's so many other parameters needs to be considered while developing the formulation where IV IV say role will play very key role I mean I BAC will play a key role in establishing by equivalence in predicting the violence because in vitro we are correlating with in vivo performance so that is very important job that I am going to explain so this slide will give you an idea when by our equivalent studies are necessary and what are the types of studies are required you know all those ish forms all generally formulations may not require by a equivalence testing there are some certain exemptions and there are certain limitations where the by equivalence study is mandatory you may do anything you may do IV AVC tooling or anything definitely in vivo by a equal existing is required but there are few dosage forms even without IV IV C also by equivalent testing is not required so those things I am covering in the next two slides in vivo studies are required these are the list of those ash ponds where enviable bio equivalence testing is required that by a equivalence either it may be sometimes pharmacokinetic by equivalence clinical pharmacodynamic study or comparative clinical trial study in the following categories of drugs for the following categories of dosage forms this is required example starting with a oral immediate release drug formulations with systemic action when one or more of the following criteria place any oral immediate release formulation which is indicated for serious conditions requires I assure the therapeutic response indicated for serious conditions definitely in vivo by an equalist testing is required and any drug having narrow therapeutic window or narrow safety margin steep dose response code is nothing but I put in drugs I put in low those drugs definitely in vivo testing is required and pharmacokinetics complicated by burial variable in complete absorption our variable absorption window nonlinear form of kinetics pre systemic elimination first pass metabolism these kind of drugs are also should be tested for in vivo bioequivalence testing there is no exemption there is no bio waiver and any formulation have unfavorable physical chemical properties if that rug is having low solubility that rag is having instability in the TI t if that Rocky is having polymorphic behavior in the deity if that like is having poor permeability low soluble low permeable variable R is the dissolution profile in step it in the GI T and which is having the behavior to undergo polymeric changes in the DAT definitely we need to do in bio bio equivalence testing there is no chance of bio waiver and if there is any documented evidence that my availability problem is there that may be related to the drug may be related to the similar chemical structure our formulations in that case also my availability in viable testing is required and where there is a high ratio of excipient to the active ingredient APA to the excipient ratio if it is very high then I'll submit that means drug is very low excipient quantity is very high so even you have proven that you are chemically equivalent but the excitement is more how they these excipients going to impact the environments we don't know that's why in waiver testing is required and in continuation that is one category of or a limited release dosage pumps and other category non overall and non parenteral formulations like if any formulation is administered through transdermal route as a transdermal patch suppose a trace these are not administered through oral route but still in vivo testing is required and any modified release formulations like this sustained release control release targeted release colon targeted gast\u00f3n written to dosage forms and target I'm would release dosage from pulsatile to release all these modified release dosage pumps definitely they're going to act systemically after absorption from the administration site so that's why in my evo bio equivalence testing is required and any fixing those combinations we cannot give the exemption for the fix to those combinations the combination of two drugs paracetamol with the diclofenac sodium or any cough combinations are cough suppressants many combination products will be there in the single dosage form in that case also establishing the by equivalence by environment testing is required and Other category non solution like suspensions overall formulations oral suspensions oral emulsions nasal ocular thermal regional all applications maybe 40 local acting are for the systemic absorption comparative clinical and pharmacodynamic studies are required by enviable testing and this is the slide when byakuren studies are necessary and but under other circumstances like be he documentation is also needed to establish early and late clinical trial formulations like it is not a generic formulation it is a innovative formulation but you're done clinical trial is long back and you're bringing the formulation into the market now so recently fabricated batch versus previously conducted clinical trials match need to be established the correlation for that by excellence is required and formulations used in clinical trials and stability studies if they are different instability studies you use different formulation in clinical trials you use different formulation in that case among these two by April is testing is required and the clinical Grail formulations and to be marketed formulations because we do the clinical trials with one batch but we mark another batch between these two also it is required to establish the by equivalence and other comparisons like if you change the manufacturing process if you change any new formulations if you make any changes in the formulation and before bringing that formulation to the market we need to compare with the you know existing formulation I mean even after getting the approval if you make any major changes in the formulation if you change the excipient quantity or exit and your change replaced with other excipient manufacturing process you have changed in that case also we need to prove the subsequent formulations by equal into the existing formulation and the previously whatever we have discussed so far in those all conditions we required to do in vivo by a fulness testing but this slide will give you some idea where we can do the in vitro testing itself just conducting the in vitro testing itself it can be proven as by equivalents so in under these circumstances like any drug for which applicant provides the data to substantiate all of the following it is nothing but it is something related to BCS class one and this is class three BCS is biopharmaceutical ossification system the is to do strength is to do strength of the draw it may be 50 mg or 500 mg a thousand MD whatever digest those that is existent that should be soluble in 250 ml of aqueous media at the range of 1 pH to 7.5 pH at 37 degree centigrade this is nothing but the definition of a soluble drug if the drug is highly soluble and if the drug is highly permeable highly permeable is nothing but at least 90 percentage of administered oral dose should be absorbed on mass balance determination in comparison to the intravenous administered referrin stores if the drug is 90 percent absorbing and if the drug is highly soluble izing in 250 ml at the range of 1 to 7 point 5 pH it is highly soluble highly permeable and at the same time if 80 percentage of that drug is dissolving in 3 media's find one outlet CL 4 point 5 pH buffer this is fine monolith CL 4 point 5 buffer and six point eight buffer in these three media's 800rpm in the volume of 900 ml using operators two are 50 rpm using either it is one it's at a seven take it is integrated within 15 minutes if the 80 percentage of drug is releasing so there are three criteria one is it should be highly soluble highly diesel it should have high resolution rate and highly permeable in these three conditions it will comes under the category of BCS class one Abbas's class three in these cases by conducting the in vitro testing itself we can approach the FDA approach the regulatory authority to get the approval of bioequivalence and another category of drugs like different strengths if you have five strengths for all the five strengths by equivalence testing is not required only one strength can be tested higher strength and remaining strengths we can get that bio waiver by proving in vitro equivalence like the qualitatively it should be having the same composition I mean all the five sprints all five for example we have 500 mg and 250 mg 2 strains we have innovator also is having 500 mg to 50 mg these two strains 500 mg versus 500 mg we will do the by a balanced test and 250 mg versus 250 mg no need to do the by equivalence test because you are 500 mg and 250 mg these two strains are those proportional and these two are having qualitatively same excipients and issue of drug to the excipient is same in that case simply proving the dissolution profile in multimedia in three different media's like whatever have shown in the previous slide in fine enamel HCL four point five pH six point eight pH if you prove and if your formulation is those proportional having same ratio of excipients and having same manufacturing procedure and having same composition then in that case we can get the exemption bio the vehicle is testing with the lowest strength so this is another criteria those whenever we have different strengths but they are all those proportional are pseudo dose proportional in that case we can get the exemption by equivalence for the remaining strengths only higher strength we need to do the violence remain expenses will get the exemption these are the conditions where the by oculus testing is required there is another criteria in this case violence testing itself it is not required even dissolution testing also is not necessary you you might have got the idea where it is not near acquit if there are no such form is to be administered through parenteral route like it is IV injection or intramuscular injection interim in subcutaneous injection or intraperitoneal injection in that case it is liquid or such from directly administering into the systemic circulation there is no absorption step in fact there is no absorption step when there is no absorption step there is no definition of bioavailability if there is no absorption because directly you are placing the dosage form into the system recirculation in that case by equivalence testing is not required and if your drug is a solution for oral use and already it is in solution form there is no dissolution step only permeability permeability is the drug-related parameter your formulation trap and innovator formulation drug is safe but it is in solution form no by equalist testing is required if the new drug is a gas when the new drug is a gas again there is no by oculus testing is required if the drug is powder for reconstitution before administration order for reconstitution like price drops by suspensions if they drug new drug is otic ophthalmic topical product prepared as aqueous solution not suspension again by ulis testing is not required if the inhalational product nasal spray tested to be administered with or without any essentially same device as the difference product prepared as acme solution it may not to be have the same different device but still if it is a quite soluci\u00f3n a traditional throw nasal root as a nasal spray then again that is not required but provided in all these circumstances under all these circumstances the formula a PA present in your formulation and a reference formulation should be same because it should be chemically equivalent and it should be pharmaceutical equivalent that should be remembered qualitatively quantitatively it should be same as that of innovator then only the bio waver can be applicable here mean by a polis testing is not necessary under these circumstances so that should be pharmaceutical equivalent chemically equivalent and at the same time qualitatively quantitatively even formulation should have the same composition as that of innovator formulation then only by a plus can be exempted so here now the introduction about the importance of violence testing and where the violence testing is required where the in vitro testing is enough and the way in why were testing is mandatory valid explained so wherever the bio equivalence testing is required under all those circumstances chance of getting failure is more unless you have the practical bio relevant tool to predict the violence value so where the IV IV see in that case by I establishing the correlation between in vitro testing and in vivo performance will come into the picture I hope you aren't you got my point here there are a few dosage forms for which by equivalence testing is not required like injectable formulations oral solutions nasal solutions and powder Furi Constitution because already they are in solution form other they are administering into the system is circulation directly there is no testing required and there are other category of dosage forms if those proportional lower strength no testing is required and there are few dosage form pieces class one drugs high soluble highly permeable B it is not required but the first slide where I have shown several categories narrow therapy window drugs drugs to be absorbed through the ETA T trust to be absorbed through the other part of site of administration and high variable drugs in that case in vivo by your equivalence test is mandatory wherever the environment by equivalence test is mandatory it can be either pharmacokinetic by equivalence pharmacodynamic by equivalence are clinical into point by excellence we have three types of by reckless testing one is pharmo kinetic second is pharmacodynamic third one is clinical clinical by equivalence pharmacodynamic by the equivalence are pharmo kinetic by equivalence this testing is required though you were formulation is generic formulation you have already proven that you are chemically equivalent you've already proven that you are pharmaceutical equivalent but you also have to be proven that your bio equivalent either by pharmacokinetic are dynamic are clinical in two point in this case most of the formulations will fail because sometimes you know we will do all formulation developmental trials and we match the dissolution profile in different media in the in vitro conditions and among all the formulations one formulation will be selected and it will be subjected further by equal it's testing but while we may expect that we will get the value in between 80 to 125 because even resolution profile innovative resolution profile point-to-point it is matching in all the media's it may match dissolution profile is same as innovator in all the media's and all other parameters disintegration time is same hardness is same forever t is same as say same your view same xep and same quantities everything is same but manufacturing process may be different we don't know how what kind of manufacturing process innovator have followed and we are using different follow with different process so and api source the innovator source of api our source of APA may be different particle size of innovator may be different particle size of your APA may be different and polymorphic behavior of innovator may be different your formulation may be different these are all will not be considered it will not be reflected in in vitro testing but will be reflected in in vivo performance that's why though the formulation is passing in in vitro it may fail in in vivo and exactly where the ibmec roll will come into the picture in that case we need to establish we should have a strong correlation between in vitro testing versus in bio performance and if you build that correlation and using this tool before conducting the by equal is testing we can predict the violence value then we can proceed further by equivalence testing and according to our prediction we may get the similar values but for that in-depth knowledge on the product behavior in any way go and actual physiological conditions in in vivo and actual appearance actual behavior in in vitro is required then only it is possible to build the correlation because this is a core it is the heart of the formulation development many formulation scientists will fail because of lack of knowledge and the IB ABC so friends because please focus from the next slide onwards it is very important to understand how we can build the core how we can build the correlation between in vitro and in vivo correlation in vitro and in vivo performance so we have as you all know in vitro in vivo correlation is in shock it is being represented as ibi bc i in vitro v's vitro II's in weeds vitro IVs in bio and c is the correlation in vitro in vivo correlation we can build in three levels one is level ii a second is level B third is level C just though you may already know about three levels of correlation just as a quick understanding again I will give you a brief idea about level a level B level c correlations here so everybody will do the dissolution in vitro first of all because the ultimate goal is to build the relationship between in the trend in vivo here you can see this is level a correlation how we can do the level level a correlation I will tell you here level a is nothing but we need to take in vitro and we need to take in by both in vitro is nothing but time versus percentage of drug release time versus percentage of drug release will give you an idea about a graph how it behaves whether it may follow zero order release or faster release but a profile you will get percentage of drug release versus time I mean time on x-axis percentage of Dracula's and y-axis everybody will do this but since this dissolution profile in different media's we need to do first level in different media's you take you start from point one normal axial then go up to 4.5 pH then 6.8 pH 7.2 pa 7.5 pH because GED it has increasing at a pH of increasing or in ascending out and starting from one pH to ending with 7.5 pH in entire g80 we don't know it from which part of the GA the drug is going to absorb and the conditions I mean prescribing conditions is it to be taken on an empty stomach are unfit straight we don't know I mean if you know accordingly we have to decide the pH at which it is going to dissolve the pH at which it is going to absorb so that's why we need to perform the dissolution various media's the first level is we need to perform the dissolution in various media's with different rpm with the different means sometimes you know if it is sustained release dosage form initial two hours it will be exposed to the HCL I mean in the stomach then followed by it will be exposed to the alkaline pH in the intestine then these two media's are also should be covered in the dissolution profile so first level is to get the dissolution profile in different media's with the different conditions we can have 10 media as a 15 millas in them but forget about it as maximum as possible I know generate the dissolution profile individual several media's then from the literature you can collect the information on plasma concentration versus time that serum concentration versus time this will be available in the innovator formulation details the plasma concentration at different time points versus time or else at least one by equivalence testing if we conduct a pilot level that information can be utilized plasma concentration versus time similarly here percentage of degrees in a system as in vitro and in vivo blood concentration versus time as another graph you take this this is available in the literature in this boa summary basis of approval of the innovator because innovator formulation is already available sometimes you know even in the patent also they may give this information in vivo performance of innovator formulation because already it is available so now innovator formulation in vivo performance from this we need to do the deconvolution deconvolution is nothing but converting the plasma concentration into percentage absorb there are several software tools are available at this moment because giving the other details of how to convert serum concentration into amount of drug absorption is not possible but you may know how to do this Magnussen method we have a standard method of converting plasma concentration into percentage of drug absorption this is nothing but deconvolution by Wagner Nelson method we can do all plasma concentration values our serum concentration values should be converted into amount of drug absorbed now time is constant here time versus amount of drug release here time versus amount of drug absorbed in this - now you remove the time remove the time factor bring the amount of drug release here and amount of drug absorb here now you take the graph by taking person drug release and x-axis / centric absorbed and y-axis again you try to build the correlation now here in this example you got a straight line but always it is not possible to get the straight line you remember because if we have done the dissolution profile this we have generated the resolution data and several media's with the several RPMs all media's we may not give you exact correlation because if we let us have let us say we have 10 dissolution profiles but this is common person drug absorbed is common only one percentage of drug absorption we have but percentage of gradual is different media's different behavior you try to build the correlation between any media I mean all the media's individually first percentage of press release in find of anomalous CL versus percentage of drug absorption person dia Brazil is in its 4.5 what's this person drug absorption person DM drug release in 6.8 vs. person day of drug absorption with a 50 rpm with honeyed rpm with 70 rpm with 500 ml media with nyan animal with a 50 ml in different several several several experiments we need to do and our target is to build the correlation between in vitro performance versus in vivo performance in percentage of drug release versus percentage of drug absorption in different media's every media you may not get the straight line but in one media in one rpm in one volume of resolution media and definitely there is a chance of getting the correlation between in vitro drug release versus in vitro in vivo percentage of drug absorption that media should be chosen as IV IVC and in that case it is level a correlation sometimes in all the media's and also it is not possible to get the correlation then we need to move on to the level will be correlation level be correlation if the point-to-point matching if it is not coming then we need to move on to the level B correlations where exactly we need to take mean dissolution time versus mean dissolution time in in Bible this doesn't mean absorption time this is a statistical moment Theory non compartmental pharmacokinetics by using non compartmental pharmacokinetics we can have main dissolution time and x-axis mean absorption time and y-axis and then again with different media's and mean dissolution time different media versus mean dissolution time we can plot a graph mean dissolution time versus Ben absorption time of different dosage forms and different strengths are different time points that is level B correlation and if level B correlation as if it is not possible we have the other option anyhow we have the percentage of drug release and you have the C max value maximum plasma concentration what is the percentage of drug release what is the C MAX single point directly single point correlation see max value versus percent a miraculous how much person a of drug release within the eight hours and what is the C max how much person a of Rockville is within four hours what is the C max so like this we need to correlate this is level C correlation so as a overview we have level a level B level CM of course we have level DL so this is simple rank order process qualitatively it is not useful for the regulatory purposes level T but level C as I told you it is single point correlation very less probability of getting the success using level C and if you do the level B this is statistical movement analysis mean dissolution time versus mean to instance time and multiple level see also we have another option it is a little bit useful and informative at least three different time points covering different stages of dissolution profile but the most information and most useful is level ei correlation in industrial point of view a point to find correlation if this is possible then definitely there is a possibility of getting the success in predicting the bio equivalence now as of now I told you if we have the in vivo plasma concentration data then only either level ei a level B and level c as possible the question is here it is very important if anybody any any person from the industry if you are attending this session you may understand in a better way most of the times we may not hire the plasma concentration values in our hand in my evo data if it is not available we have never done any by equalist testing and we don't have the innovator information we have only the dissolution profile of in which dissolution profile of test product we have the dissolution profile of innovator product only dissolution data is available if only the dissolution profile is available then what is a solution how can we build the in vitro in vivo correlation how can we predict the bi8 fulness this is the question if we don't have the plasma concentration and then definitely there is no possibility of knowing about percent a brach absorption we don't know main dissolution mean absorption time we don't know main residence time we don't know the C max value exactly what is this a max value of innovator we don't know anything about the innovator formulation and we never done anybody a palace testing can we predict the by equivalence yes still it is possible to predict the by equivalence that I will explain you in the case study so let me begin with the case study this is more important part of my presentation today this is actually practical problem what we have faced in our industry we have done you know in industry generally once the lab scale development is done once the formulation development at laboratory level if it is completed then it will be transferred into the technology site mean where actual manufacturing site GMP side we need to do some scale-up studies then once the scale-up is completed once we optimize the process parameters then finally we need to do they exhibit batches X min batch is nothing but the submission matches for the approval and using these three x big batches are required with final commercial scales as it is minimum one lakh is the batch size is expected by the FDA so once the similarly like this 3 X feedbacks are required for 3 batches by equivalence testing is not required only one batch it can be tested for the by equivalence again is the innovator formulation and with this one batch if we prove our formulation is equal into the innovator then remaining 3 batches are also accepted or subsequent all commercial matches sir without conducting by a cooling system we can release them into the market so this is the procedure actually so generally the required number of subjects are also then the 18 subjects minimum number of subjects LD volunteers are required to prove our formulation is equal to the innovator so what we have done this this case and if I explain the if I explain the statement of problem you will understand what was our problem and how we could able to resolve by using IV ABC so we have done one pilot by there are two types of studies pilot and pivotal pilot is nothing but using less number of subjects to get the confidence before going for the pivotal pivotal is the actual bio equalist testing pilot is a small scale by using the scalar batch also a pilot study can be done and then by using the X bit batch begin to the pivotal study because directly if we do in the large number of population if if you get the negative result then the cost of the by equivalence is very high it will go into the way so that's why generally a pre industry will do the first pilot study in less number of subjects they will get some confidence what is the exact value of C max and the exact value of VA you see we are getting that once the conference is coming then they will go for the expert batches and pivotal testing large number of population so what we did earlier a pilot bio equivalent study of an exhibit batch directly we fabricated 3x big batches three batches with 1 lakh commercial batch size that is an extended-release formulation with approval of ursa to release profile it was evaluated in 14 volunteers first directly actual number of valid is required for our study was I don't fortify subjects quantify number of subjects was required and directly if we do in fortify number of subjects the cost of the study it was going beyond 1 crore so over the sponsor have decided in spite of going for the fortify number of subjects directly let us test it in just small number of valid is 14 then that to be required to do two studies like one is fasting state other one is spit state fasting is nothing but on fasting we need to do Freddy's after taking the break first we need to administer the RO system at the breakfast at the lunch that volume of mail how much air to be taken also has to be it is by prescribed by the FDA so two studies are required fasting and fit among these two studies fit study is more critical if we get the fit study pass if you pass in the pit study definitely we can expect that fasting study also definitely it may pass so I ask well the drug Facebook and good properties and others be other characteristic futures we understood we concluded that fit state is more critical and directly our sponsor have suggested to do only some testing in 40 volunteers in sheer level we did the 14 valent is testing in fit state you can read here and outcome it made the acceptance criteria for all the parameters outcome means the total seen x value and AUC ratio in the year it is called as p by our ratio tested to the difference ratio t by a ratio it should be as i told you i t to 125 offer this MX 82 125 further a you see also so now in these 14 volunteers in fit state when we have done the study all the results were met the criteria 1 not file t by our ratio we got it and 100 T by ratio for the a you should be got it so what we feel as food in volunteers have shown one at Phi because one at 5 is in between 80 to 125 based on the pilot results using the same test formulation using the same reference formulation we have conducted the pivotal study pubertal setting as I told you request large number of subjects for the submission purpose so they the test product failed to meet the by equalist criteria for seimetz both infant condition as well as fasting condition now it was surprised because the same formulation of test and same formulation of the reference I have given first two results fast you outcome in 14 volunteers when the number of island is were increased the result was not meeting the acceptance criteria it was Supra Supra bio results we got it supra means higher than 125 it is it should be between 80 to 125 we got 133 something like 133 134 it was our self to our surprise earlier it was one not fine now it has gone to 133 so now there is a need to find out the root cause of the failure of pivotal studies why it is failed in they'll buy it is passed in Pilot by building in vitro in vivo correlation and finally deciding way forward but the success of pivotal by equivalent study so this case study as a statement of problem I will try to explain how we have built the correlation by using the dissolution profile alone and by using IV ABC alone separately as I told in previous slides level a correlation only we have built how we have built the I behave is seen using plasma data of this failure and how we have brought a conclusion how we have drawn a conclusion based on the dissolution profile alone you can see here the data obtained in pilot as well as in the Fed I have represented in a table and followed by a graph in the town are the pilot and pivotal studies are conducted properly or is there anything went wrong because in the pilot we got positive result and in the pivotal we got negative result is there any scope to use the same exhibit batch for the repeat testing if we repeat the testing again is there any chance of getting the positive result that was our question first of all so they're here the C MAX man is because the formulation failed in C max only AUC was good you see it was in between 80 to 125 both in pilot as well as in pivotal but see max value it failed in pivotal but it passed in the pilot in pilot as I told you we helped and remember we have done only fit study in the pilot but we have done both the pilot and fed and fasting in futile so here pivotal fasting and pivotal fit failed and fasting in pivotal and pilot fed only so these three C max values of test three see max values every friends so we takes more time to grasp and to understand is very critical but only as a jest I will tell you as a main crux here you see the difference between C max test two versus reference the difference between these two for 87 and even in the fasting also fed and fasting both say match between these two it is for 85 for 85 487 the difference between see max value it is not the ratio am telling it is a see max value difference is for 87 for 85 and even if you look into the data fed to - fasting the difference is to 74 see max we Fred - - pilot fit pivotal fate - pilot fear it is 144 and reference in case it is 484 484 484 here it is matching reference reference is behaving similarly but the test formulation here 148 148 but pilot versus pivotal if you see Fred Fred only 148 here the difference here the difference is 487 the same tester formulation when it is repeated why it has behave differently in a small number of volunteers and large number of volunteers then the systematic approach we have done completely individual subjects values when we have plotted as a graph team a our ratios frequency distribution of city by ratios of individual 14 subjects now we can liquid to the 14 subjects individual T by ratios one subject is 74 another subject is 80 another sub did is 81 and three subjects are just around 103 subjects were 100 and remaining 8 subjects are a 100 and it is few subjects 173 129 117 also there now this is the these are the results of 14 volunteers in the first 14 valent is this yellow color 3 volunteers these three violent Eve's actual frequency distribution plot if you see it is cueing towards right side because frequency 100 is in the middle yeah it is in the left side 125 in the right side if you see more number of subjects are coming towards right side of the graph not to the left cell if said there are only 3 members but right side there are eight members did not know how many are there segi eight members eight members are right side three members are left side three members are in the middle and if you have the graph of frequency normal distribution skeeving in both the sides center point in the middle bell-shaped curve if you get you will get the average value accurately but only three subjects are lower side and the eight subjects are higher side these three subjects louis and subjects they have misleading our result to have the one at feisty max value that they are the culprits to get the lower set see max value there they are not there if these three members are not there and there definitely we would have got high FC max value in pilot also that was ever conclusion I'm repeating once again in out of 14 Valentin's if all the valent is behaved similarly you would have got 133 seen 133 T by a ratio in pilot also in pilot study there are three subjects they are playing out layers that three subjects have shown completely different response than the others these three subjects led to the misleading the results completely and we thought because a piece of these three subjects this statistical analysis we have not done before proceeding for the P order and if we had done this statistical distribution statistical comparison understanding then we would have not gone for D pivotal so because of these three subjects misleaders these three subjects were the culprits of getting forgetting the one at five as the average severe issue so accordingly we are increase the number of subjects and when we have repeated we got 133 because upon repetition these three this kind of performance was not there in 45 number of subjects these three are the culprits because of these three people overall total see max value have come down so for this again we have done and we we wanted to do some correlation we wanted to build the kinetics we wanted to do the correlation between in vitro and in vivo correlation if current formulation is not suitable for the repeat by appellant studies then what is the correlation to predict the violence then we thought of conducting the in vitro in vivo correlation now here this graph just I told you know you know we without having in vivo data also simply from the resolution also we can get the there is a chance of getting the correlation between bio performance here this is the dissolution graph in Fineman armlet serial in final normal HCL dissolution of innovator dissolution of test this is the difference blue color is reference and rigorous test you can see here higher side test formulations higher side that itself it is indicating your test formulation is faster than the innovator and when we have calculated the this is the equation equation from the log linear equation at twenty four point nine seven six linear x plus fifty one point two eight two in case of reference and twenty eight point four point three in case of test 28 verses twenty four this 28 divided by twenty four if you do the ratio is 114 that itself it is higher side and similarly another media this is another media 4.5 ph 4.5 pH this is both the zero order as well as first order both it is following because a square value will give you the idea whether it is following zero order kinetics or first order kinetics this linear is nothing but linear as a fine 9:9 linear also fine 9 5 that means and in case of log linear fine 95.9 9 both it is following zero or the combination of zero order as well as first order because if R square value is more than fine 9 we can conclude it is following that relationship so here if you see the ratio in both slope ratios in both the test as well as the difference in zero Advent past order the actual value is 138 and 133 from the resolution only this is also from the dissolution from dissolution data just slope value ratio of the slope values of test versus a different p by a ratio is actually 138 and 133 now if you look into the overall data not the overall rate this is another type of correlation from the IBS as I told you find one normal axial percentage of Dracula's versus percentage of drug absorbed we have taken but Sunday unreleased we have taken an x-axis person day of drug the observed way of taken on by axis this is in Fineman normal it is if I not banana HCl or the reference and this is for the test and this is four point five pH for the reference 425 pH for the test formulation here also be having different slope values and from all these female ratios calculated deviation from in vitro as I told you previously 114 in find one amylase CL and 133 in 4.5 and I Vav say of all subjects 53:59 I really see if you remove those three subjects 116 and 132 and actual values what we got 118 in fasting and 130 in the fed now in the bill summarized table you can see from the dissolution also our prediction if we had done the prediction before proceeding for the pivotal 114 is our prediction actual value 118 133 is our prediction actual values 130 so never see the difference just 4 percent difference between in vitro and actual in vitro and actual 3 in the Fed for person in the fasting how closer we have the total range alone is 80 to 125 you but here actual prediction 114 actual value is money 18 prediction 133 actual value 130 in case of IV IVs in case of dissolution this is the value in case of IV ABC considering all subjects 53:59 that means they're only it went wrong if we have removed the three subjects then 116 132 116 is very close to 118 132 is really close to 130 then removing the three subjects and if you do the violence prediction then we would have not gone for the pivotal study you would have not gone for the pivotal study and subsequently we have alter we have made some changes in the formulation we have made few changes in the formulation and again we did the IV ABC we did the dissolution kinetics both alone dissolution kinetics and I'm a VC in Fineman Amalek CL and 4.5 pH when we did the IV ABC and dissolution kinetics prediction 100 it was in Pioneer over normal x CL and 1 R 2 it was ph 4.5 ph buffer and same results we got it in the actual pivotal bio equal study of course three more by x big batches they are fabricated and we got 101 at to the same 100% ages our accuracy in prediction so that's why we have reduced the number of batches again if if this tooling I had been not there then how many number of batches we would have been fabricated you can imagine in that way just by making only one batch we have get the success in getting the bioequivalence so this is how the in-vitro tooling are in my IV ABC will helps us to reduce the number of batches and to get the bio success moving out of the case to second case with respect to the bio waiver directly this is another formulation it is earlier as for the guidance clinical endpoint bio study was required clinical endpoint bio study clinical that means the testing should be done in the patients that formulation is for the it is to treat the ulcer it is for the ulcer treatment ulcer patients we need to sell it and we need to do the clinical endpoint testing by taking test formulation in one group and administering reference formulation one guru administering placebo formulation anther group that was the guidance testing in the patients ethical so we approach the FDA to view the bio waiver by simply conducting the in vitro studies these following studies have been proposed from by our side then they have accepted and given the clearance and they have removed they change the guidance from clinical endpoint bio study to the in vitro studies so now onwards any formal for this particular formulation testing in the patients is not required just testing in in vitro is sufficient enough in that there are three levels of testing first of all as I told you test and reference formulation should have the same APA and they should have qualitatively quantitatively same excipient except flavor and color and they should have physical chemical characteristics comparable and finally acceptable bioassay of the test and rld formulations like APA sameness establish say APA similarity can be shown by APA composition and fda spectra UV spectra solid-state 227 aluminum enema differential scanning calorimetry TGA and power powder x-ray diffraction by getting the data by all these techniques we have to prove that our APA innovator APA is same including the particle size and in vitro we have to check the pH of our formulation and reference formulation specific gravity viscosity change in apparent viscosity with addition of acid release because it is suspension radius possibility time sedimentation rate and comparative acid neutralizing capacity comparative release at pH 1.2 all these are the in vitro testings are made to be done as part of establishing the pharmaceutical equivalence and as part of bioequivalence clinical endpoint bio is been replaced by in vitro equilibrium testing as bioassay that was in vitro equilibrium binding study with human serum albumin our bovine serum albumin in vitro equilibrium binding study with the bile salts in vitro kinetic binding study with the bile salts in vitro enzyme activity study by binding with the pepsin these are all the in vitro bioassay tests have been proposed by us and if they are accepted in this if we prove our formulation is equal in all these fists both in APA in vitro formulation and bioassay then we can conclude that our formulation is equivalent to the innovator formulation in that way we have succeeded and we have proven that combination is equal into the innovator and we have submitted our application form as an indie application to the FDA so that we have get the waiver of clinical endpoint bio testing because getting the testing in the patients is very critical job and even it is unethical so we have some approach the FDA by proposing these alternative inventory fill-ins testings and if they also have accepted so here with this brief understanding on these two case studies i would like to conclude with the role of formulation scientist in getting the bio success we should have the thorough understanding of the APA knowledge because APA means if the if it is paracetamol paracetamol pancit ml itself it is not sufficient as I told you we should have the idea spectra UV spectra HPLC spectra and DSC XRD and all other possible techniques we should see and Palmer fil behavior hydrophobicity and dynamic way perception and particle size especially solubility partition coefficient of all over APA and APA from the innovator we need to extract answer that we need to check thorough understanding of the APA is the first step thorough understanding of the innovator product how it is behaving physically how it is behaving chemically by means of reverse engineering we can do all sorts of testing then a second level and then we need to match the dissolution profile in multimedia and where in multimedia similar factor similarity factor we can use F 2 and as it only a dissolution kinetics we can do the zero order release our hostage release kinetics you can consider the slope value and by making the slope ratios ratio of test formulation by the difference formulation we can have some certain idea of bioequivalence bio value T by ratio in actual in bio testing and then if we have the plasma concentration values of innovator we can establish the IV IV C by the convolution technique by taking percentage of release on x-axis percentage of absorbed on y-axis that that will give you another idea of predicting the D by a ratio then we can finally predict the PE results IV ABC and Molly kinetics then the getting the success rate will increase then you can become a successful formulation scientist in for Malaysia research and development so with that conclusion I would like to bind up the today's presentation so this is our team from new height research team both formulation and analytical team and I'm really thankful to work for the new head form where I got very much mint reminders knowledge because I'm working under a legend family legend dr. Vivian traditional to sir is my guru in my be form and fortunately I'm getting I got another opportunity to work under him and to gain more knowledge and to update our knowledge every day so he's expert in the bio so under his guidance we all working and thank you very much to him once again because he gave me this opportunity accepted my my request to share my knowledge with you all people because to practical case studies I have used in the presentation and thank you very much once again I am thankful to the polarity college team management and the faculty members especially mother it is her and her profession he was my junior in my inform she requested me to share my knowledge in this presentation and thank you very much thank you once again and if you have any queries in with respect to IV IVC our bio waiver or violence testing you can text in the text column so that if it is possible from my my end I will like I will try my level best to answer all of your queries if not I will get back to you laughter thank you very much now a sheep hello now see buddy there ah yes I think there is some technical problem so mr. Nassif ashes is enjoined Thank You mr. Vijay Kumar we'll just go into the questionnaire at home now so we have some questions from the audience okay with regard to initially there was a question with regard to the dry powder in her nation formulation sir do we need to do this ibid see correlations no actually tripod that that is what I have already mentioned in the slides dry powder inhalation systemic absorption we need to do the clinical endpoint by equalist testing based on the requirement as per the guidance if it is only oral solution form direct gaseous form and then it is exempted powder for reconstitution powder inhalations for systemic absorption definitely we need to do as per the guidance requirements and there is one more question from machine firm is it possible to evaluate bioequivalence offer tester that is the immediate release and the modified release can be compared between an immediate reaction under modified previous formulation yeah I got a question Shilpa question actually preliminary requirement the foremost requirement to conduct the pipeline's testing is our test formulation should be chemically equivalent and pharmaceutical equivalent and already defined clearly chemical imbalance is nothing but our API and those should be same pharmaceutical equivalence means our formulation and the test form of reference formulation should be same dosage form and same route of administration if innovator formulation is immediate release our formulation is modified release we cannot compare these two formulations as by equivalent because you know the in this case bioavailability testing will come into the picture rather than by equivalence our formulation behavior is different innovators formulation is different if you do any modified release dosage form it comes under a separate category finer 5b2 it is a hybrid NDA is Nadia completely because it is a new dosage form whenever it is a new dosage form new strength new route of administration new fixing those combinations it is not possible to match that Israel to match the bio Equalists with that of innovator because in the freighter formulation is immediate release formulation is frequency of administration daily 3 but your frequency of administration maybe you make you want to come up with one single day dosage form modify tool is dosage form and if you conduct the violence testing you definitely will get the failure because the rate of absorption and extent of absorption from your formulation is different their family is different rather than by a equivalence generally by your availability testing is required and this will comes under finite 5b2 it is a separate application form it is neither nd an RA in da it is I prayed in D and a and EA that is separate session and requires other additional studies are also sometimes FBA expects to do some clinical testing also in addition to the bioavailability study soil depends on the type of molecule used yeah you also also have a session law tomorrow that is on this final five so I think that they doubt with a better plan filed in that session and that there is one more question from khushboo so in this they have forgiven it out in your example fiber others where you have given that different a strength of the dosage form the higher strength the bio equivalence is performed where asked for the remaining strength it was given below Weber and that the f2 the similarity factor should match with the vehicle and strengths in all media so with regard to this ratio is answer yeah that's it that's it the question yes that is she itself answer is given already in the question itself for is for example yeah for example if we have high sprints and all the my strengths are those proportional are pseudo dose proportional there is two difference those proportional is nothing but not exactly proportional quantity of blend will be used for the comparator sooo Rhodos proportional is nothing but will be having the same weight tablet 2 tablet for example one strength is 200 in one strength the total weight is 200 mg another strength the total weight is also 200 mg but that dose is very less 200 micrograms in one and another man is having hundred micrograms so except the drug remaining excipient everything is same in that case it is called as pseudo dose proportional so if our formulation is pseudo those proportional are those proportional only bio testing will be done for the higher strength and sometimes if it is a safety concern if it is there we will do with the lowest strength also as either the higher strength Aloha sent one dose one strength only will be subjected for bio excellence and remaining all the Sprint's should be similar in dissolution profile in all the media as that of your bio strength not be the innovator now no need to compare with the innovator our formulation one highest strength for Malaysian resolution profile in all the media versus remaining strengths resolution profile it should be same f2 value should be same I mean f2 value should be higher than 50 f2 is the similarity factor there is a formula to calculate similarity factor it should be more than 50 if we get more than 15 all the media is suggested by the FDA then that itself it is sufficient enough to get the bio waiver for the remaining but we should have the same composition same excipients ratio those proportionality and say manufacturing procedure and remaining all other quality attributes are also should be same then only it should be subject I mean we can get the bio waiver for the remaining strengths and that there is a one more question enough from mr. mother suden so he want to know the correct category of drug which is used for clinical endpoint in your case studies what he of discussed he just wants to know the therapeutic category of the drug which was used a category in other way I can answer this question actually it is not based on therapy category based on the site of action like locally acting Turks for Malaysian is locally acting in the JIT only it is not undergoing any absorption for example as I told you in the bio waiver the clinical into point one case study it is for the Assessor treatment also it may be in the lower part in the upper part sometimes : colony culture also it will be there sometimes gastric ulcers so our formulation is subjected for the treatment of ulcer it will not undergo any absorption if the drug is not undergoing absorption but still if you want to do any pharmacokinetic endpoint study because the drug itself it is not coming into the blade if you do the pharmacokinetic study by collecting the blood sample of your nel sample and more variability absorption options means at least definitely sometimes 1 to 2 percent they have drugs there is a chance to absorb and if you want to estimate that drug in the plasma and if you want to compare that drug in the plasma between test and reference definitely more or ever will be there because you had some technical problem just for 2 minutes participants yes Ari will join soon from sunset s circum point it is not with respect to the category of therapeutic category of the drugs if you AskMe therapy category i can say also anti-ulcer and the colonic cancer colorectal cancer so that kind of molecules will comes in many skin related fungal infectious diseases topically infectious diseases also can be placed under those category but it is some technical problem from the speaker said he will join soon prashanta Madame Marie audible is our model yeah speaker will join soon and meanwhile we'll have a few announcements regarding assessment some feedback please visit Jeep will already Kalia from see Hyderabad YouTube channel for assessment some feedback for please visit www.dsucc.org if I see a Hyderabad YouTube channel for more updates assessment come feedback link will be activated after one hour of this session and it will be active for 24 hours on day and tomorrow that is racist 13th of July 2020 the first session will be at 10:30 a.m. on words on topic overview on scope of drug degli read effects by speaker dr. Santosh Kumar gnarley' energy manager US regulatory affairs at a radius laboratories limited Hyderabad and session - that is tomorrow they are they 13 sorry they seized up 13 July the second session starts from the 3:30 p.m. onwards which on the topic which abbreviated approval pathway to choose for a drug product why not 5 b2 or a and DF by speaker dr. bank at issue 802 Krishnan associate director new ventra Pharma Sciences Goodman North Carolina USA for assessment come feedback after 1 hour after 1 hour of this session it will be activated so we are waiting from the speaker side due to technical issue he couldn't join [Music] hello yeah speaker has joined SF sorry for the interruption technical problem that's not it clear yes okay okay Michela is termed a screening is not a require at this moment no it's an awkward search engine is not good right I'm highlighting few questions please the answer to those questions oh sure sure sure yes sir is it possible to evaluate by equivalents of test immediate release and test of medium release formulation this I think as he said already answered I mean this and one more question sunnier area this exam over at the body yes sir five strands are higher strength B is performed already have to cover this question I once heard this one only actually I was giving the explanation but how far repeated category of drug use memory I know that elliptic a degree of drugs used Berkeley yes sir and one more question boy yes sir is there any bio waiver for brain targeted drug delivery system through nozzle Road it's not based on the targeting to which part of the brain to be each part of the body the bio waiver is being given and as I told you based on your dosage form design what kind of our Malaysian it is if it is when brain are getting nothing it is at once the delivery system and definitely by however is not at all possible and in fact bioequivalence also it may be not possible because unless we have the reference product in the market approved product in the market and as the question itself it is indicating plane targeted delivery brain that we have very few brain targeted delivery systems through nasal root are available up fruit in the market so unless we have that kind of formulation in the market we cannot do we cannot expand the center finite vibey to new formulation new formulation designs separately everywhere it comes under finance a bit to do bioavailability studies and the video certain psychological studies to get the approval yes sir one more yeah do we have to do by availability study for nano formulation given by IV root no yeah I we wrote any formulation either it may be nano or Micro or any conventional formulation if it is given by the I be rude I'm you know generally it is a solution form simply if we match the Q and Q to Q 1 is nothing but qualitative composition Q 2 is quantitative composition if Q 1 Q 2 is same then no need to do any bioavailability R by equivalence kind of thing because by availability definition itself it is indicating the weight and extent of the drug that undergoes systemic circuit that reaches system is circulation here in IV root there is no absorption strip whatever that drug directly where information we are injecting everything it comes into the system is circulation there is no point of him in no viola voltaire by equivalence requirement in IV formulations Pratibha power e I said bcs class two three four products can be asked so by ever no for bcs class one and class three the as they are highly soluble drugs there is a bio waiver applicability but it says class two and class four they are suffering from business class two especially having low solubility class for low solubility as well as low permeability and we can never expect that by a waiver though you have excellent ibid see also so it is not at all possible to get the bio waiver for a class two and class four in certain cases class three providing other justification like matching the dissolution profile in all the media and having the IV ABC pooling we can get that by a waiver there is a chance for the class three but not for the class two and class four yeah next question please are there any limitations to IV IV c by not definitely because every advantage definitely will have its own limitations besides having so many advantages so similarly ibmec also having the limitations because it is very difficult to difficult to get the IV ABC in most of the formulations with all the formulations as i told you it is not possible to get the IV IV c because sometimes you may have the dissolution profile immediate release formulation everything will because if it is v says class one or this is class three whatever [Music] hello Masha boys no tomato gram variously area no they speaker a voice is not coming it's miss man sorry honey and energy some internet problem here we were there in the last question are there any limitations to I di VC so that is what I was explaining besides having advantages there are so many limitations similarly although such forms it is not possible to get the IBC by the level a level P sometimes level see also maybe not possible that is one of the limitations other than things that we have moon DVD appreciations from the participant sir so we want to be your tank no sir as there are no more questions and if any participants are want to further ask questions that you can also mean to being speaker it will be providing the main ID that's better if you have any further questions definitely I will ready to share responses mention I am going to propose the tank no myself dr. Dean Frusciante associate professor on behalf of g-body College of Pharmacy and the participants of e FD p on research updates and pharmaceutical formulations analytical method development program organized in association with IPA callahan estate branch would like to express appreciation for your presentation so on the roll with drop back up in bioequivalent studies and so now highlight the importance or any IVC correlations and they have started it from the basic definitions of fire velocity fire each one's the Terra Cotta key to events and the chemical equivalents the different levels and I di VC Co nations when ballet equivalent studies are required when bio members can be up in the attic at home sir then a pilot when in studies are not required and can also discussed the role of the foundation scientists the case studies which are being presented it shows your contribution in the years of research and also your depth of Alice cancer and that the session really informative and I can also as you the participants who are majorly faculty member can incorporate in the research in the coming years that is a with regard to work without being invited studies how we can proceed for the idea is equations and the other methods and they are more appreciations of something like YouTube chat which I would like to share sir others the session was knowledgeable it was informative it was nice and excellent session I can also as you the expectations of the participants from first topic have been met and that they have gained some knowledge from this presentation and also they have cleared their understanding of the importance of the ID IVC correlations and today's generate market well we have the generate which is a the pharmacy market which is at present in the world and I thank you so taking the time to speak and accept our invitation in spite of your busy schedule I once again thank you sir on behalf of our conveners doctor be mother ready sir since fellow of Florida College of Pharmacy and dr.

Halloween is here and I have to come see I thank the miners and organizing secretaries and organizing committee members and special friends no today's erica data n is a FEMA intangible everyone is we appreciate you being here we'll see you tomorrow that is racist of young happy thank you and today your sickness abortion thank you", "aoJP4AaVi4I": "good morning everyone uh welcome to the session entitled pediatric hiv treatment old drugs new drugs i am ellen chadwick a pediatric infectious disease specialist at northwestern university in chicago i'm happy to introduce our first abstract presenter dr theodore rule from ucsf benioff children's hospital san francisco in the u.s he will be reporting 24-week safety tolerability and efficacy of diutegravir dispersible tablets in children four weeks to under six years of age with hiv results from impact p 1093 my name is theodore rule and it's my pleasure today to present these results on behalf of the impact 1093 study team i'll be presenting data about the 24-week safety tolerability and efficacy of the dollar tag for dispersible tablets in children ages four weeks to less than six years of age with hiv deutsche beer is recommended for first-line treatment of adults and children with hiv due to its potency high barrier to resistance and tolerability a five milligram dispersible tablet pediatric formulation is being evaluated at impact p1093 an ongoing phase one two open label pk safety efficacy and joe's finding study today i'll present our 24-week results among participants who received the dose proposed regulatory authorities lab of fda actually approved this formulation on june 18 of 2020 with a hyperlink to the label provided at the bottom of the slide this slide summarizes our methods children were enrolled into three age cohorts four weeks to six months six months to two years and two years to six years children had to have an hiv rna of greater than one thousand copies per ml of time of enrollment this could include treatment i.e for treatment experience treatment prevailing therapy dispersible tablets with five milligram units and dosed by dividing weight bands as shown on the table below children also received an optimized background regimen that included two other agents which one had to have genotype predicted activity clinical and laboratory assessments occur between days five and thirteen and then at weeks four eight twelve sixteen and twenty four with three day visit windows safety data including this analysis we're currently april 30th 2019. additional deals about the protocol can be found at the impact website shown by the link below this slide summarizes the characteristics of our study population including 51 children of them 55 were female the majority were recruited from africa representing 70 with an additional 12 percent from thailand four percent from the usa and 14 from brazil twenty nine percent of the millionaires were aot naive intermediate and rna at the time normal is 4.3 log copies per ml the optimized background regimens are summarized in the table to the right you can see that 47 received a block of air plus the moving an additional 20 percent received xaidavity the xyz and the diversity of different regimens um received by the other children but worth noting that 13 of them receive lenigra retinovir as part of the regiment and one shall receive both the favrens as well as derivative this slide summarizes our viral logic efficacy results it was assessed in 34 or 67 of participants who had 24-week hiv rna results available at the time of data freeze in the figure you can see the proportion of participants who achieved a viral load of less than 400 copies per ml at different time points in the 24 week period the table on the right summarizes those at the 24-week time point the first row represents those with viral loads of less than 400 copies per ml 29 or of 34 or 85 percent participants achieve that end point second row summarizes those who achieve less than 50 copies per amount that included 18 of 34 or 53 percent you'll know why the confidence interval is reflecting the small sample size of this population ultimately we've also included for reference results from similarly structured sailing trial and adults which reported that 87 comparable achieved a proportion of less than 400 copies 79 achieved less than 50 copies at 24 weeks in that trial slide summarizes the viral logic and immunologic outcomes of children receiving the dispersible tablet formulation of dollar tegaver that's stratified by age cohort so across the first row you can see the three age cohorts defined with again four weeks to six months and that was included 17 children nine children were six months or two years and eight children were two years to six years smaller numbers across the first row you can see the proportion that achieved hiv rna of less than 50 copies per ml at 24 weeks that proportion was 41 percent in our youngest cohort 67 in the middle and 63 percent of the oldest cohort across the second row you can see the proportion proportions have achieved less than 400 copies in comparison these were much more comparable across the age cohorts with 88 percent the younger school or 89 of the middle cohort and 75 percent of the oldest cohort across the bottom two rows you can see changes in cd4 count in cd4 percent without going into details you can see that most achieved some degree of recovery but there were wide ranges of diversity met among them in some cases even declines these data were difficult to interpret when overlaid upon normal age expected changes across these time periods safety and tolerability is summarized in this slide all children who received the proposed dose were included in safety analyses no grade three or four adverse events were attributed to study drug and accordingly study drug was never discontinued due to toxicity table below summarizes adverse events of any attribution or overall of grade three or greater severity the first row summarizes clinical events or participants who experienced clinical events this included 13 of the youngest cohort 17 of the middle age and six percent of the oldest cohort laboratory events are summarized in the second row fifty-seven percent of the underscore thirty-three percent of the middle and nineteen percent of the oldest cohort experienced laboratory events laboratory events included anemia neutropenia and clinical events included common infectious diseases such as pneumonia diarrheal illnesses that are unfortunately commonly experienced in the study population in our study settings and in greater incidents in the yucca populations tolerability of the dispersible type of formulation was excellent palatability rated as average good or very good for 98 of respondents in summary the dispersible tablet formulation of dollar tega verb was well tolerated had a favorable safety profile and demonstrated viral logic efficacy among infants and children ages four weeks to six years with diverse prior art experience the variable cd4 changes seen likely reflect multiple factors including recovery or laid upon age-related normal changes we believe our results support the recent fda approval of this pediatric formulation of dilatography for the treatment of children living with hiv globally the authors would like to advance the entire p1093 protocol team sites staff and most importantly participants and their caregivers we'd also like to acknowledge vive healthcare gsk for their team and financial support and overall support from the niaid and nichd the impact trial network thank you thank you dr rule for that very interesting abstract dr rajendra singh from vive healthcare in the u.s will be reporting pediatric wteg revere dosing recommendations derived from combined p1093 and odyssey population pharmacokinetic analyses hi i'm rajendra singh thanks for providing opportunity to present my recent work i am presenting results from population pk analysis of toilet revere for supporting pediatric dosing recommendation the population pk analysis is based on data from two studies impact peter 93 study and panthers odyssey study peter 93 study was a phase one to multi-center open level pk safety and tolerability study uh while odyssey study was a randomized trial of dtg based antiretroviral therapy versus standard of care in children with hiv infection starting first or sec switching to second line drt the objective of overall analysis was to perform pop pk analysis to support dosing recommendation derived from combined p1093 and odc data and to assess whether there is a correlation between dtg pk parameters and selected safety endpoints overall 239 subject provided data for population pk and pk safety analysis baseline age was 6.3 years and baseline body weight was 22 kg black rays constitute almost 80 percent of data with white and asian corresponding to 10 percent each fill coated tablet granules and dispersable tablets were the three formulation used in peta 93 study in odyssey study film coated tablet and dispersable tablet were used data was collected under fasted or without regard to food conditions one compartment model with first order absorption and first order elimination was used to characterize thermokinetics of toilet review in periodic participant the base model includes allometrically scaled clearance and volume of distribution model also include a maturation function as defined by anderson at all inter occasion variability was used on clearance as well as rate of absorption the relative bialability was estimated for granules and dispersible tablet related to film coated tablet based on poppy model estimated oral clearance was 1.3 liter per hour volume of distribution was 13.6 liter rate of absorption for granules and dispersable tablet was more than 2 fold higher than film coated tablet the relative availability of dispersible tablet and granule as compared to fill coated tablet was 50 percent higher and the biology without regard to food was ten percent higher than viability under fasted condition interoperation variability on clearance was thirty four percent and the inter individual variability on clearance and volume was less than 30 percent while for rate of absorption it is approximately hundred percent the extrapolation of doses in periodic participant is based on adult equivalent exposure that means if auc c max or c trough in periodic participant within a weight band is similar to adult exposure then efficacy will be same for pediatric dose selection therefore targets were predefined the targets were based on primarily adult geometric mean data coming from 50 cubit doors for auc the target geometric mean was 46 with a range of 37 234 microgram per ml for trough concentration the target was 995 with the range of 697 to 2260 nanogram per ml maximum lower limits were also set they were set based on e-max model in hiv infected subject corresponding to 95 percent of maximum biological response for auc it was 25 micro mr per ml for c trough it was 500 nanogram per ml one compartment population pk model was adequate to characterize data from two study for del tegravir in pediatric subjects this slide shows proposed doses based on population pk model and simulated exposure corresponding to those doses for example in 3 to 6 kg weight band for subject greater than 1 year 1 month of age 5 dispersible tablet dose is proposed accounting for maturation function in 6 to 10 kg weight band two different doses were proposed one can make disposable tablet for subject below six months of age and 15 make disposable tablet for subject greater than six month of age in all cases the exposures were within the predefined target range for both auc as well as c drop no target were defined for c max for dose selection based on modeling and simulation and exposure safety analysis doses were proposed for film coated tablet as well as disposable tablet for 6 to 10 kg weight band as shown in left panel doses were proposed by accounting for maturation function and they were stratified by age for subject greater than six month of age tanmay dispersable tablet dose was proposed for subjects greater than 6 months of age 15 mig dispersible tablet dose was proposed in discussion with fda that age stratification was removed and for 6 to 10 kg weight band only a 15 make disposable tablet dose was finalized to conclude the model described data from both study and associated variability adequately based on simulated and observed data those stratification by age was proposed in 6 to 10 kg weight band where 10 mcdos was proposed for subject less than six months of age and 15 mg dispersable tablet dose was proposed for subject greater than six month a of age in discussion with fda age stratification was removed and 15 big dispersable tablet dose was approved for 6 to 10 kg weight band at all the proposed doses both auc and c-max were within target range the safety exposure response analysis demonstrated no relationship between pk parameters and adverse event thank you for your attention thank you dr singh for that interesting abstract dr eva natacunda from joint clinical research center uganda reporting safety pharmacokinetics and efficacy of low-dose ecf taff in biologically suppressed children over two years of age living with hiv doctor ivan from uganda on behalf of the research team i present the safety pharmacokinetics and efficacy of low dose ecf traffic biologically suppress children 82 years and above living with hiv i report no conflict of interest young children especially those weighing less than 25 kilograms living with hiv have few erv options there is no single tablet treatment used or approved for this population in the u.s or european union taft has been shown to have a safe bone adrenal profile in adults older children and adolescents in association with low plasma tendonophobia exposures compared to 10 of overdiesel proxy the fixed dose cognition tablet of lv demographic copy system in pristine and taft is a once daily concrete era of regimen recommended as uninitiated men in the u.s in adults adolescents and children at least six years of age and weighing at least 25 kilograms this single tablet regimen has now been co-formulated into a low-dose tablet for children who are at least two years of age and going between 14 and 25 kilograms we report today the first pk safety and efficacy data of the low dose tablet vcf taffy children three years and above living with hiv this is a simple um open labor study with an external design the primary endpoints of this study are to determine the plasma pk of immunography and taft and evaluate the safety and probability of ecf2 through 24 weeks of treatment the primary results from code 3 are the focus of the present analysis key inclusion criteria for cohort 3 included a viral load of less than 50 copies for at least 6 months cd4 count of at least 400 cells per mma and egfr of at least 90. 27 participants were enrolled on all underweight intensive pk testing at week 2. the primary endpoint of this cohort was reached at week 24 and secondary endpoints at room 48 after 48 after route 48 participants are offered continued participation in the extension phase of the study of the 35 patients screened 27 were enrolled and all have reached at least 40 weeks at baseline the median age was six years with a lower age of three years the median weight was 19.3 kilograms and 63 percent were female almost half were enrolled in south africa with the remain half enrolled in thailand uganda usa and zimbabwe 89 percent of participants were black all were biologically suppressed that study entry had a median cd4 percentage of 37 and the median cd4 count of 1600 and a good renal function most were infected through vertical transmission most baseline era virus means prior to study drug where nrtis and two nrdis the pk parameter ovary under the curve for every degree and tough was the primary endpoint in the study the geometric main auc of edg and half encode 3 were compared to adult auc values and were shown to be modestly higher in children than adults the illegitimate tough constitution was slightly lower in children than others but was still nine-fold above the inhibitory constitution for wild-type virus exposures of evd are from within the range of historical data in adults adolescents and children that have been shown to be both safe and efficacious additionally exposures of co-resistant ftc and tenancy also remain within range of historical data there were adverse events of any grade reported in 74 percent of participants but not grade three or four adverse events no adverse events leading to drug discontinuation and no deaths the most common and perseverant participants the most common advancements were respiratory tract infections cough decreased appetite and vomiting four participants had adverse events considered related to studying drug consisting of diarrhea vomiting acetylene and decreased appetite the one unrelated serious adverse event was pneumonia one participant had a grade three laboratory abnormality of decreased platelets egfr remains stable over 48 week period one minute density analysis showed that participants minimized born according to their reference population additionally no participants had a four percent or more decline in spine or total body less and bmd by week 48 over 48 weeks body weight improved while fewer gains were observed with height consistent with what has been reported in the literature which would be living highly unstable originals biologic efficacy by fba snapshot analysis at 28 showed that 89 percent of subjects encode three were below the threshold of 350 copies per year due to coping 19 restrictions data was missing in the analysis window for 7 subjects no subject met the criteria for resistance testing the cd4 count should then initially decline a quick two that was not reflected in the percentage both remains stable to 48 weeks acceptability and palatability were also assessed by questionnaire requesting information as to whether the tablet was broken in half to sell which was allowed by the study and how easy it was swallowed and how acceptable shape size and test of the temperature for participants mean adherence assessed by pre-countryside at 97 swallowability a component of acceptability and palatability were assisted baseline and between 4 and 24. the number of children who needed to split the tablet decreased from 4 at one might be 24. ease of swelling was high in this population in which the youngest age was three years and improved over the 24 week duration and this was also mainly rated as good news for good throughout the 24 weeks in conclusion in virginia suppressed children each of them flip those single tablet treatment was well tolerated all areas were mild moderate there were no adverse events that led to this continuation essential demonstrated excellent adherence and maintain biologic suppression the low dose tablet had a high level of acceptability exposures of evidence on top are consistent with ranges of exposures observed in adults in phase three trials of ecf staff efficacy and safety were consistent with results from phase 3 trials which showed high proportions of viral suppression no resistance and good durability these data support further pediatric studies of ecfta which may be an important integral inhibitor option for which had infected young children aged three years and above a potential determinant thank you very much this study was funded by geared sciences thank you dr natacunda professor juliet wanga from epicenter uganda reporting on safety pharmacokinetics and acceptability of the ibaccavir 3tc lopitovir retinovir granules 4 and 1 in children living with hiv three to 20 kilos in uganda the lollipop study representing the labor study interim results on behalf of all the authors lollipop is a phase one to randomize crossover peak safety and acceptability study of four in one fixed dose combination of a barca bala movidin lopinava and returnable compared to lupine return over pellets plus a backup aluminum dispense with tablets insulin living with hiv weighing between 3 and 25 kilograms children who are dosed as furtherate away pound dosing schedule children from wet band 2 to 5 are reminds to either receive the 4 in 1 or the reference formulation for that one day's decision is performed and then the treatment arms are switched and children receive return days of other formulation the second intensification performed and then children are returned to their standard of care children from westbound one are not randomized they receive a four in one for 21 days followed by intensive pk and then returned to their standard of care the four-in-one formulation also called quadrimune are granules the size of the granules are optimal for very young children and this formulation is well test masked here we see the environment per weight band 44 children were screened and the three were enrolled into the study of these four patients were in weight band 1 and 29 in the highest weight band 15 of who were enrolled into the four in one first while 14 were assigned to a reference formulation first data sets available for all but two children not included in the pk set baseline characters for gender age and weight are as expected all the children were already on the pinava best therapy and 76 percent of them had been on interactive for six months or more at the time of enrollment 21 29 of the 39 that three children had viral load below 400 copies per meal at this line the proportion of children with very low less than 400 copies per meal increased from 87 percent at baseline that is the blue box 97 percent at the end of the study that's a red box the proportion withdrawal drivers less than 50 copies per mail increased from 48 to 65 percent when excluding the missing data the median change in cd for sale count was on range and on average there was no change in 64 percentage in terms of safety 101 treatment emergent adverse events were reported 96 were mild four moderate and one severe non-led treatment discontinuation one was seriously broken ammonia which started while on reference um formulation the most common adverse event we are vomiting 52 percent of the episodes and all treatments related adverse events were of grade one here we see the pk results for back cover the blue cultures are back over in the four in one and the red cup shows up back over in the reference formulation these two exposure curves overlapped nicely the area under the cup target was set extracted from the arrow study and the back of our package inside the geometric mean ratio for area under the curve is 49 percent a c max geometric mean ratio for abakava is 24 percent lower thereby equivalence criteria we are made for our back cover area under the curve here we see the peak results for three tc as before the blue curve shows the three to six in the four in one and the red cup shows the 3t c in that reference formulation the geometric mean ratio of four in one for every under the cup is 82 percent and the c max is 69 percent neither under the curve nor c max made by equivalence criteria but we're comparable to historical exposures in adults and children interestingly through tc exposure with four in one we're closer to historical values here we see the peak results follow in the foreign one and in the reference formulation the gmr area under the curve was 12 percent lower with the four in one and lower confidence interval lay outside the by equivalence range filipino c-max geometric mean ratio was 19 percent lower absorption of la pinavac was slower with the four-in-one overall the lupine over exposure was comparable to historical data in adults and exposure with a foreign one were closer than those with a reference formulation two of the four children with weight band one and one child in weight band four had sit half below 1000 nanograms weight band one includes heterogeneous population of children and we are currently gathering more data in this weight band if we look at the characteristics of the white band which will drain the first two heard with a low exposure at 8 less than five months at the start of the study and presented either with comorbidities or suspicion of prematurity but two other children eight eight months had a very low weight of screening with severe malnutrition all children gained weight in 21 days and and their radical suppression improved on treatment food did not appear to impact on exposure here we see the exposure of la pinaba by formulation according to the expected upper and lower target exposure stratified by weight band in weight bands two three and four extra sloping is very close to the expected ranges observing adults we band one the target range is based on that observed with liquid formulation in children we see white variability with the with our four children all enrolled to date given the small number in the wake on one children uh we cannot yet draw upon conclusion and so more children are being ruptured in this way and as conclusion weight band two to four demonstrated comparable drug exposure two children in weight band one had c12 below one than nanograms four in one was well to related including in women one children and seven percent of children who are violent suppressed at the end of the study hearing red band one had a decline in viral load after 21 days of exposure the study is ongoing and final results will be available and details about accessibility of this new four-in-one formulation are presented during this conference we thank children and caregivers who participated in the lollipop study in uganda as well as all study staff partners and the sponsors we thank unitate for their support and thank you all for listening thank you dr malanga dr jason baca from baylor college of medicine children's foundation tanzania reporting on the dtgs of dtg for children and adolescents living with hiv or cal hiv descriptions trends and gaps of rolling out dolutegravir in cal hiv in mabella tanzania hello ladies and gentlemen and friends and colleagues my name is jason bacha from the baylor college of medicine children's foundation tanzania and the baylor international pediatric aids initiative and i'm excited to present the findings from our study titled the dtgs of dtg for children and adolescents living with hiv descriptions trends and gaps of rolling out dola tegravir in children and adolescents living with hiv in mba tanzania background to the study as i think we well know efficacy and safety data of novel arvs in children often lag behind the adult data and this lag can lead to hesitation and slow uptake by prescribers of using new arvs regarding dtg specifically some of the early trial data has been reassuring um in children specifically the impact in odyssey but of course it's small sample size and hard to know how it will translate to real world settings where the medicine is used and needed the most um in 2019 tanzania procured dtg updated guidelines and began a country wide rollout and therefore to try to understand better the use the safety and efficacy of dtg in tanzania we studied and described the characteristics and outcomes of this rollout in children adolescents living with hiv treated with dtg in our clinic in embaya tanzania the methodology we used we did a retrospective chart review to describe these characteristics and outcomes of children who were prescribed and given dtg as part of their arv regimen the site again was the baylor college of medicine children's foundation tanzania center of excellent in embaya tanzania which is in southwestern tanzania the inclusion criteria of our cohort was children adolescence ages 0 to 19 hiv positive who are on art and in care at the baylor tanzania clinic in embaya and the dates of analysis were through the 1st of march 2019 when dtg became available at our site through the end of that year 31st december 2019. also of note we defined hiv viral load suppression as less than 1 000 copies per the in country guidelines what did the results of our study show we had 681 patients who received dtg at the embayo coe during the time of study in 2019. the 681 made up 46 of all patients on art at our center and 60 of patients who are eligible to receive dtg defined as having a weight of 20 kilograms or more the pie figure below shows the distribution of regimens used you can see the majority of patients receive the tld fixed dose combination the table on the right shows the baseline characteristics of our cohort there was a nice split of male female the average age was right around 14 years of age ranging from five up to 19. the time on art was average of five years again ranging from new initiations up to 14 years of arv exposure baseline who stages of the cohort showed over 60 percent with a stage 3 or 4 reflecting the complex care and complex patients we see at our center but thankfully through the course of the study 98 percent of patients were able to be a wh or treatment stage one also of note we had about 60 of our patients with some form of severe or moderate malnutrition again reflecting the complexity of patients and care at our center and as for the art status of this cohort 12 percent were new irt patients with new initiations the remainder were shifted from prior regimens with the majority 62 percent that had been on nnrti regiments as for our outcomes data we had very reassuring data with zero patients having any severe drug toxicity or negative outcomes of the patients on dtg 95 of the cohort remained actively and safely in our care while the remaining five percent were successfully transferred out and we had zero deaths and zero loss to follow up also of our dtg cohorts 77 were able to utilize multi-month prescribing the figures on the right the upper figure shows viral suppression rates pre and post dtg among stark cohort with viral load results prior to the dtg 77 percent were virally suppressed and at the end of the study post changing the dtg regimens 84 were virally suppressed the bottom two figures on the left it shows of patients with viral loads pre and post who were initially unsuppressed we were able to suppress 63 percent of those patients by using a dtg regimen likewise of patients previously suppressed who were changed to dtg 95 percent were then suppressed through using dtg so in summary our study showed that dtg was very well tolerated and quite effective in our clinically diverse cohort of adolescents in children living with hiv again there was no toxicity no adverse events no deaths no issues with dtg it also showed that the use of dtg resulted in viral suppression for many of our previously unsuppressed patients and these results we hope are very encouraging and that they show that dtg can successfully and should successfully be used in children and adolescents living with hiv thank you very much for your time and listening to this presentation thank you dr baca and finally agaron collin from macarrera university uganda acceptability of a new four-in-one ibakavir lamividine lopinovir ratanavir pediatric fixed dose combination the caregiver child dyad's perspective i would like to thank the organizers for the opportunity to present the qualitative results of the lollipop acceptability study i am again calling a qualitative researcher on this study so we set out to investigate a new four in one pediatric fixed dose combination of above la miuvedin lope nava and retina which was brought by simpler in partnership with dndi for use in low resource settings where infants and children have challenges swallowing tablets overall this study is also presented at this workshop so what was the objective the objective was to assess caregivers perceived acceptability and related factors of the fine one formula compared to pellets and tablets under the methods we are saying that it was an open-ended randomized crossover from a coconut safety and acceptability study and we purposefully sampled an administrative 18 semi-structured interviews to caregiver diets between three to 19.9 kilograms interviews were conducted after the 21st day of the foreign one as shown in the figure in this slide we use an inductive thematic analysis with support of a computer software called in vivo version 12 so now i move to the results and i first want to talk about caregivers perception regarding characters acceptance of the foreign one and later on i will talk about the factors related to their acceptability in overall the caregivers had a better experience of the four-in-one than any other formula for example the syrups and pellets that they previously used hence the foreign one was highly acceptable on matters of children's acceptance i want to say that most children enjoyed it because it was sweet as one of the caregivers noted she likes and enjoys it because she responds very well she does not become nervous when she is taking the formula now i want to move the acceptability factors relating to the formulation and storage many felt that the foreign one wasn't easier to store this was because it is kept at room temperature unlike previous formulas in addition the formula four in one had an average five minutes time taken for administration compared to others and this gave caregivers a better perception about its as one of the caregivers noted another good thing is that it is stored at room temperature then the first era was set up which required someone to find a fridge to keep them safe now i want to talk about acceptability factors relating to the packaging and testing so generally the packaging was received well by most of the caregivers however for a few who said the bottle was too big and then for the children the test was nice for the foreign one as i said earlier on so it was swedish and this is backed up by experiences where one of the characters noted that their experience has been good and easy oh this formula is an easy form because you just open the capsule and pour it in honey porridge or medic and give it to the child now i want to move to aspects around factors related to caregivers acceptability and here we are saying information and adherence another information endurance caregivers learned easily how to correctly administer the foreign one because they knew the effects of a missed dose as one of them noted not adhering to the drug the child soldiers reduce meaning a high viral load under motivation they are the caregivers had witnessed positive results of the foreign one in the short run or in the short term in terms of weight and growth of their children and this gave them a real hope that their children's future was bright for example one of them said when my child grows up i would like him to become a doctor so that he can also treat others now i want to move to issues around caregivers skills and innovation and understand many of the caregivers adapted innovative approaches to remind them and keep time for example alarms and on their phones and others as one noted i set my alarm at 8 00 am and 8 pm and that is the time i give my child medicine finally i want to move to the aspects of support needs and we are saying caregivers through counseling and tips to administer the following one by the health workers were very influential in acceptability yet this study was short so in the short run adherence as one of them noted the first day i started using the four in one formula i poured the powder that is like millet on a spoon and put it in the mouth of the child but it made him tend to vomit so i asked the doctor who advised me to mix the medicine into little product and then give the child this method worked very well for me in conclusion i want to say that the four-in-one is a better accepted pediatric formula than other farmers previously used i also want to say that acceptability was greatly influenced by the formula itself in terms of test is to administer and storage and finally i want to say individual motivation and tailored specific support to caregivers influence acceptability thank you very much for listening to me and i want to acknowledge all those who supported this study to take place thanks a lot", "D4ax4PteBTM": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay as marijuana Control Board we are back in session and we are on operating plan raspberry routes hello general scene raspberry routes and I believe Kim is on the phone the conference is no longer in listen-only mode sozin time are you there you might not be on the phone yet I just texted her but this operating plan change is essentially updating and modifying the c\u00e1\u00f1amo capsules packaging potencies and so instead of having five milligrams in each capsule allowing for I'm sorry for having right now it's ten units at five milligrams per capsule each we're just changing the packaging sizes to have ten ten capsules at five milligrams each so 50 milligrams in each package two capsules at five milligrams each with the total of ten milligrams per package ten capsules at three milligrams of THC each so lower than the allowed five milligram dosage that I would amount to thirty milligrams per unit and then fifteen capsules at three milligrams a phd each which would equate to 45 milligrams a THC per packet and then probably best Erica speak to the end or question that she raised in the memo it's just something the board's been discussing and I don't think has necessarily drawn a conclusion but it's destroying it to your attention and so basically what that issue is using either water-soluble gelatin for the capsule or veget vegetables vegetarian capsule or equivalent thereof which is or aggressing there I'm the unknown third or but other kind of okay that's for a non THC ingredient and then you have any approved any approved form for Canada concentrate as an ingredient right is this is this a preview do we approve yeah in April 2007 clean I only use them were those would that boarding any correct and I think I don't want to think for the doors I think she'd bolded the part that was a concern or I didn't know if you lose yeah I mean that's I just wanted the board to decide how they wanted to address this yes particularly the the the soluble gelatin oh actually it's the capsule as a vegetarian codeine example and there would be a gelatin some such a beef product right or a vegetarian one or sewing I gotcha I gotcha that was already approved but I think so you will have been having a discussion the director wanted to bring it back to you I'm Way less concerned about what a capsule was made out of than just about anything else okay so am I correct in my understanding that the description and the makeup of the vocal makeup of the capsules and the contents are unchanged here unchanged with the only modification to that response is that we're instead of five milligrams per capsule raspberry routes wants that opportunity to do three milligrams per capsule lower dosage okay so they're just just changing the quantity of the capsules in the mouthpiece and they might be credit Thanks so Kim are you on the line the conference is no longer in listen-only mode him caller you with us what I was going to ask you know the difference between putting five milligrams of THC or three milligrams of THC in a capsule that's uh that's some pretty pretty careful measuring yeah careful either way you do it five milligram or three milligrams but they also have to be tested right right ready because and so she get it right the first time which does after testing you know I don't want to speak to that know I don't know okay all right I don't think she's made the three milligrams yet because we haven't been approved all right any other questions comments concerns okay so to change the operating plan to basically allow a 3 milligram cap for raspberry routes license 108 five six manufacturer is there a motion move to approve a second second Luke in the second a mr. Schulte and mr. Miller all those in favor of proving the operating plan changed since I was saying aye aye opposed all right move on to good titrations caramel seen attorney for good titrations and your principal was over something yeah yes Brandon is out moose-hunting Shawn tacking maybe on the phone but there was some confusion of the executive session and when you guys are clean back so my taxes and I peed on the phone but this is very similar well actually a little different than the last tab Erika has told it in your memo you already approved in May of 2018 this Kamath oil for vaporization and you approved it with the standard production crew two procedures dating cannabis oil or distilled cannabis oil and I believe and Erica contributing correct me if I'm wrong she wanted to bring that to your attention from your previous approval from 2018 since you've been looking at the end or and then just the change that we're requesting is an addition of MCT oil which is that which is which I would hope whispering in with your yeah they carrier oil okay so is shot online yeah okay I'm gonna sign of him okay mister I'm sorry we just got a text message from Sean he's in a candidate for him he's running re running for I'm sorry running for re-election for the assembly all right okay yeah mr. Jones thank you I'm sorry they're not here I was hoping to dr. Brandon you know we've had some issues on vaping and sort of additives to oils and you know I don't see anything related to you know vitamin E here no I mean yeah sort of the propylene glycol I think is part of the carrier oil stuff that makes it but what is the food grade chirping and I know that I know Brandon has talked to us about the terpenes before but I'm my memory is not all that great I wish they were here but I don't have any problems with that I just had wanted to ask that question and I was really sorry that they're not hearing I can do my best to answer it um with the caveat I might get sand for any moments but my understanding that the food grade terpene is terpenes that are nationally direct from like strawberries or bananas not artificial flavoring but directing the actual fruit itself and you've always wanted us to include that as a separate ingredient so that you knew what was going on yeah no I understand that I'm just I'm trying to think about the issues nationally on vaping that particular attitude songs we could call it in two to five minutes if you like I don't know were fun alright alright so for uh good titrations lights when a week six did you have any other concerns that you learned to talk about for you right here I mean this this has a to me it seems to have a distillate and a non distillate option of cannabis oil and and those are two different processes right because one is just filled one is one one has a finishing distilled I'm filtering out more of the plant waxes and so it's a lighter color regular cannabis oil it does not go through that those roots right leave just one product though to me that seems like two products but I actually think that this deploy Oriole is its own product and the chemist oil is its own product but what you're saying is that it's an end or well that this product they're changing it to say cannabis oil for vaporization non distillate or distillate option no under one product they're saying well we have these two different processes mm-hmm and to me that sounds like two products well yeah no so you know it to be consistent with what we've done before if it's there that's how I get talking to I might get in line um if it's their intention to sell dis distillate cannabis oil cartridges as a discrete product and non distillate cannabis oil cartridges as a discrete product then they should probably be described as two discrete products if it's again a matter of what they've got on hand I mean it's a matter of what is that on hand to do a run of cartridges you know that then then they should probably say so and we can look at it from that perspective which is the best when we looked at one other product earlier this week I think separate them out and then minimum to Erica so it will prove with that delegation yeah we do that I mean I would I would much prefer and again getting back to the current level of discussion about vaping in general the more transparent and that's not a fun thing but fun pop fun but the more transparent the manufacturer can be and what the product is you know when you continue you might see two different cartridge see suppose they have two runs of cartridges in one store and one looks really clear and one doesn't and the customer is going to go what's the difference it's labeled that way yes I have a different variation so we should probably be approving them as separate products I think we can do that with delegation okay and then awesome e'terica all right okay and with that for license when we have a motion for one oh eight eight six good titrations manufacturing the floor with delegation for cannabis oil / distilled cannabis oil cartridges no move is there a second second okay and so the delegation is that it will be till do a you'll do another page of the 15 for what okay very good and and we'll see the yeah it's already on the label there it says not distilled ones this Magister can I just point out that I believe your action when we considered products earlier was it in a similar situation you requested both separate products we brought back before the board again I'm not saying you can't do it this way but I believe you thinking with stony miss kitchens back on tab 23 you provide you said they had to provide separate applications for separate based ingredients but that they didn't have to pay the fees okay and these were not for new these were already licensed ingredients students but where the application is to come to us those were for new products and yes they were to come to you all right but they're already making these they're basically I don't even approve you've already proved this language so mr. J okay okay justify something here so is it the case that these bill was already approved with this language correct and why why we're saying it again no because it the borders Erica a sales are the born has been under a lot of discussion and I don't want to pre really so on page eight you can be approved at the May meeting was something called cannabis oil for vaporization and they submitted a change document to change the name to cannabis oil for vaporization non distillate and distillate option and to me if you don't distill one aisle and then you distill a different oil that's two different processes which is what I understand to be different product so but that's the board's decision and so I didn't give temporary approval to this change but I brought it to the board for your consideration so you know we actually brought this ourselves because we felt that we needed to um just identify sure the name was identified more with the product so the language was already approved in May based on the board discussions I felt it was important to bring it back and identify so we can pull those out have cameras aerial distilled Senate Erica campus or it'll not distilled Santa Erica if that was work board and in a hopefully she could approve it with her own delegated authority okay all right then all those we had a motion Gabino motion all those in favor of license 108 eighty six operating plan change with delegation for two separate applications to be spinner to the director under delegation before canvas well distilled in Kenema soil non distilled some good titration this right manufacturing Fairbanks all those in favor say aye hi and he opposed okay very good thank you moves us on to alright bakery mr. chair yes sir quickly here yes I would note that if you read the current product it for a vape oil it says cannabis oil and or distilled cannabis oil if you go up further to the new description its cannabis oil comma distilled non distilled cannabis oil comma glycerin comma the wording has changed and so usually commas aren't ands or ORS that's actually hinting that there's both non distilled cannabis oil and cannabis oil in the product so there's two products to in there it's not an and or and so I think that means to get clarified to is part of the delegation because they they literally have changed the description by removing the words and or yes and I'm not sure that the table or we meant to do that so I'll work with Erica to sort that out that way hint at the first cannabis oil was distilled the second one isn't but trying to get that one you get it will point careful attention way to do everything right off okay Artie bakery gelatine for artists a curry and this actually is something that you so Erica temporary proves this for us prior to the survey is our debate where you wanted to start producing these products but you actually already looked at these and improve them in the transmitters I'm not sure because we were in the transfer so I'm not sure if you want to relook at them or not but you look at them in the transformations on the caciotta we just want the trying to find again a counter to me and we didn't have time to wait for the transfer record like a motion will improve this again you've already okay let's move on petrichor score yeah good afternoon like fun okay Anderson petrichor LLC all right so what can we do for you so this is for the changes so the change of the stars is fairly straightforward we'll go from mylar bag to a child safely sealed jar pretty common package the UM the drink on the other hand a little bit with this was so straightforward um so we're doing is going from a what we had tried to get going in the first place which is a child safe bottle as much as we try to can get that to work those don't work with carbonation above about one 1/2 atmospheric two atmospheres so the vacuum we're proposing we're going from a child's a bottle to a child safe exit bag that has the bottle with it with the beverage inside of it that's going to be provided by us to the retails and we'll have language for proper storage instructions along the lines of uh you know shows product is stored in the package and that's for the consumer you got a sample of that with your bare hands jacket yeah sure shows you the one we're using a slightly larger but it's the same zipper setup the same bag so it retains its child-safe properties as long as it's the bottle is stored in this if we change the child say property of I can over do you believe it's a steam certified fact it is okay you bought the bottle will go inside of here what's in there that's right oh I can't open this door oh okay so you got a push down on you push it down at the far end or that little divot of I push it down and break that feel going backwards oh those are those are correlative products products community so the idea is that a person doesn't finish their soda they will put it back in the nest and that will be and that they'll be language to that effect for proper storage instructions on the bed now the bottle when you drink half of it and put it back in there's like a leak isn't no nut cover back on good yeah and that's why I mean we're using basically conventional soda bottle at this point because we tried it to see our lids and you had leakage problems with the see our lids they don't know pressure you can get two atmospheres but you got about that yes cast blown off and it becomes a safety risk oh hey I'm secure bottle or do do you heard yesterday what was going on with the hash aid yesterday's story if you guys ever get together and compare notes hell equivalent no so there's there's a so no thing other characters whose products that shelf stable for up to a year including the oil and water there's a certain amount of tradecraft it doesn't know listen okay I always add I'm up formulas but you know stuff like response to Africa is fun honey this way I'll sweat got easy yep yep okay you go how many of you that are doping on the first try okay all right all right so that is for the packaging okay questions of packaging okay uh looks like we do anything is gonna make a motion to approve the packaging for the oddball infused soda that was not every correct you're gonna did you have any questions about this any issues well the issue is that every single beverage that the board has approved in the past has required to have a childproof lid is there such thing as a lid that is both childproof and tamper proof um or child with child resistant and tamper resistant I'm I'm not sure it may be out that it's definitely none the whole pressure we tried last month and a lot of money ordering bottles and seeing what we can make work and having stuff a little interface is essentially I mean yeah you're you're pressurizing coca-cola pressurized about 50 psi 50 to 60 psi that's a lot of pressure so it's possible this is I mean I don't remember all of the beverages the board certainly hasn't approved that many perhaps this is the first carbonated one but in the past every beverage has been required to have a child resistant lid well let's talk about Evers one second so a bottle of coke is 50 psi lies you don't shake it up you can open it it's got that tight band on it that's not it's baby resistant it's not a child resistant so what what would be considered a child resistant lid for a beverage basically medicine balls those are about the only ones there was one person that tried and fire eater and quite frankly they probably should have been here having this discussion so yeah on their product how's it been a lot of success flat it doesn't really work you can't get that tight seal thank you a tight seal and you can't put much pressure not things gonna blow up in this is and then if it's cold then that that pressure is is dissolved that co2 pressure dissolves us in the the products but if it's warm you have it shelf stable at room temperature like these products are and that co2 is gonna come out of that solution it's going to put pressure on that cap so even and you bottle up really low temperatures so that it's stable that way so once you get to the what's the ones you're shipping and banging around boxes and stuff like that like you're gonna end up putting a lot of stress on these bottles and you could have end up stepping up boxes and these days how does it travel on airplanes but how many different designs have you tested we've we've we've tried about four I believe and these are just the the samples we try to class one that was just a Boston around the child sake would have that pop up later with the coffee nothing to we have a lot of products coming in that are still beverages I hope you are making yet we are using child safe caps for those that's because they're not going to have that problem potentially you know that safety issues and a lot of other products in this in this category shelters bubbly waters bilities there's a lot of other ones too and so this is I think it's a different class of products and there's but there's nothing in the market there's no solution in the market currently and if there is I would love to hear it to be honest because this is about twice as expensive to do it this way so just to clarify all liquids or any kind of drinks with my husband cats in the past all that has been part of the board's approval today but this is the first carbonated one well you said no you said one other person is making it with a tamper with a child-resistant cap and you're saying it's not successful because it's been flat they have no they get to keep carbonate so if you call the packaging company like evolves so first thing applies no we don't have anything else child resistant but you can use a couple of we'll say we've had people have success at the two atmospheres but that's not done certifying it that's somebody trying it and it's worked so far we live gauging it actually work done of them are actually rated for carbonation mr. chairman yes I'm just looking back on the regs here that pertain to packaging and labeling and this was actually an extensive discussion that we had five years ago correct me if I'm wrong here but I'm looking at three AAA C 306 345 packaging and labeling and what it says is it marijuana marijuana products sold in sold is packaged in opaque resealable child-resistant packaging when the purchaser leaves the retail section or licensed premises and we had there was extensive obstruction discussion at the time about the the relative merits of making every single individual packet child-resistant versus having it leave the retail premises in a child resistant packaging there was there was a clear distinction between those two so so I submit that the individually packaged product is not required under our regs to be child resistant and and in fact I I think we even discussed at the table put some public comment at that time about the challenges of making child resistant packaging for carbonated beverages for exactly this reason so unless I'm missing something here I feed sounds like what it's proposing is consists of our regs director when you say based on board action is there is there a regulation that says that a beverage has to have a child proof Camp resistant ah I don't believe there's such a regulation but the board has the authority to make that requirement and you have done so so this is really more about consistency well I consistency is also about appreciate that okay there any other questions or discussion on this Jonas okay then for the funding for approval of the of the packaging for I ballin whose soda which would be in a sealed carbonated beverage bottle and taste in a Chinese as a packaged in the retail store with construction that's for its reuse live delegation all those in favor of approval of the oddball few sort of packaging signify by saying aye aye any opposed okay and then on the bad habits ours what are you doing there that's just a very simple upgrade we're it's more attractive but it's also because it retained with the child safe properties after the photo when we say public consumption and the mylar bag was okay then on the petrichor license one-eighth 493 are we a motion officer did we have a motion on I apologize we have a motion we didn't have a motion for the last one only child we need a motion to approve the factory now we can do both now we can do both so mr.

Jones and imagine look at these pretty hard not really alright okay you don't have the or word in here anywhere in your uh cannabis or cannabis clocks great okay so what is your where it says cannabis mr. cure okay so those are reflecting what is in cannabis butter so if you look it says Candice butter then there's a parenthesis in cannabis butter contains creamer milk salt cannabis or cannabis

product manufacturer still until keaton inoue products peanut butter balls and frontier sour the ganja gummies all those in favor signify okay there you go you're proved appreciate it thank you okay the conference is now in listen-only mode food products okay did you jump again and grant anderson pokey coil okay so you are not gonna make it concentrate yeah just some enough basic olive oil extraction and that's the other seven can't concentrate this is so that's a uh that's the the oil and hua or motion process that goes into basically all the beverages this makes it or head what have you been using for your beverages we don't you spin it i am using and it's old Sol infused Sol Sol Sol Sol uh somebody was talking about their POS computer system earlier okay Sol infused coconut water what is that is that gonna be a beverage yes it's just a basic basic coconut water I think uh by in fact we use the same sweeteners today tasted coconut water wish you luck psycho not infused energy that's that's another one your beverages this that's light carbonation yes alright so okay the flavors you get that handwritten in here it's okay we can we can read it so you read it while it's what series retool so that's a uh that's a exercise a sugar alcohol sort of sweetener um has the same characteristics of sugar except that it doesn't absorb into the body so even though it technically has carbohydrates it actually lowers blood sugar postural it's only being yeah but you're not advertising any characteristic as that new product and I'll just remind you that there are or notes in a couple of these so infused cold coffee boom if you have to say this is a I think the right verb for your description I've been given staff plenty of headaches I've okay pumpkin spice dude that was gonna come up and these are all going to go in the bottle we approved is that correct now these will be with child safe lives because they are in pressure yeah they don't have pressure this villages so you've got all right so you've got can't concentrate or next year so that's a those are post a salutes basically the same thing I think the list of the languages in there along the lines of if they can't concentrate got denied whatever isn't then the papers that they're paid to the same time good Roger I just have two questions on the first two so the cannabis oil which appears to be all the way on the cannabis you understand that that's only for your use or for a wholesaler straight okay and then the second one canna concentrate the ingredients are water olive oil emulsifier and then cannabis oil or distillate it is this something that you intend to sell it for retail no to be purely for you some an art burger Jerusalem okay thank you oh I everybody's putting everything in water these days huh hey I'm looking here soul infused water now okay for a second because the label look like on this and the reason I ask is that every time you know my grandkids go to the store they said get me bottle of vitamin water which is a very popular product with kids now and it comes in all different colors so this is going to be in a child resistant talk okay but what's it gonna it's going to be a straight side bottle not like this water box third side straight side bottle wash which it looks like you know some consumer products but so the the you know what's here what's your I see you've got that you get the back label on here but what's your cuz you got the logo label in here somewhere I'm gonna think I have it in here arm I can't think of a way to provide it really quick um but we are conscience of that particular aspect the bottle be using this is most likely a Cosmo around with child safe would the inspiration time most of our labeling right now is a microbreweries don't really know okay on your uh and your pops how many servings is that just one serving so that'd be two servings 10 milligrams total in a bag I'm of bags are resealable at some of them here something so they're gonna be sold with a can be sold warm right yes okay and so that's that's not it would be a little bit problem I mean everybody loves water pops you know I might have so I might have some trouble with this one I understand so the the bag that we're sending out the door in it'll be that same way bag that appear earlier so you won't go see inside of it and presumably you know if somebody takes one out that I'm not just going to take the one serving plate a compose we can reduce it if you want to just 5 milligrams in each bag that's definite something willing to do yeah that's that's good I'd rather you know I'd rather initially err on the side of caution I mean we've been we've we've been we've been fortunate so far that we haven't heard from you know the vision of puli health or anybody else that there have been you know incidents of children consuming edibles that we've licensed you know I understand but I would much prefer to err on the side of caution looking to the future for the industry like it's reduced yeah you're not just 5 yeah and that'd be what about that big Oh have you carry something to grow but thank you yeah I also look at that - yeah I appreciate it that's what was in there wasn't it ok this yeah let's have a heck of a production line all these things open and fill them up and pretty impressive I want to point out to you that with the process we use the effects this and all the other beverages about there's less than 15 minutes for onset of effects alright so that means but you know the worst case you know child does get their hands on it they're gonna go pretty quick all right away yeah sure sure and they do come with a kick you can definitely taste it put a little mystery yuck label one or two you know yeah for sure it's definitely not the same language on each one of these bags that we help me outside yeah because this is of a lot of the products we've approved this is one that most resembles so I understand kids and and the say and the same thing with the with your water quite sure how much shame okay we got any more okay that's all the product so we have a motion do these products separate and just make a motion for all then we can talk about individual ones those kind of comments I'll make the motion a if that's good motion to approve products cannabis oil can a concentrate soul infused coconut water cycle not as a huge energy soul infused cold brew coffee soul infused cold brew tea so infused water Yeti infused ice pop with the milligrams down to five four hipper package second for license let's do all that for license one eight four nine three petrichor LLC okay it's the movement seconded any other discussion on these products okay I've seen a delegation and and yeah you know we I think obviously the office would like to see what your labeling ends up looking like that listen you know and think you know that with a couple these things that you know kids are gonna possibly be looking at just like I say something like a there's a you know a little mystery yak or whatever you know we'll work something out okay good we appreciate good citizenship in the industry thank you okay then with that for Product Approval the how many was that eight products for pet core license one eight four nine three manufacturing facility in Fairbanks all those in favor signify by saying aye aye any opposed there you go thank you thank you mr. Anderson don't leave members of the board if you could go back to tab 123 there were actually two MJ 15 in the tab the first one had two requests on it the board handled both of those but we didn't go to the second day 15 have 123 apologize yeah so the second part that is just striking language it said I wasn't going to do extracts and introduce it it basically says it just opens the door for us at that if we're going to do them that we're able to and then it also recognizes that if we start especially when gets too volatile that we start getting the volatiles that just a lot of fire marshal requirements there's a lot of forms before plan layout so we're gonna have to be submitted and don't okay so you want to take extraction off of here collaborative plan situation no no we're straight we had a bunch of language in the original application so we weren't planning on doing extra work planning to okay we're just opening that door oh all right okay all right knowing that once the door is five thousand feet up jump to the phone oh yeah for sure especially is that for sure there's a lot of cadboard that comes between caramel okay there's a mode is there a motion uh going back tab 15 the amendment to the operating plan changes language or petrichor push into a proof there a second site okay discussions just ads ads you'd be coming back for all these yes surprises okay all right then all those in favor of approving the operating plan changed language for petrichor license one eight four nine three at or LLC manufacturing project manufacturing marijuana product manufacturing facility last time say it today so right in Fairbanks signify by saying aye aye any opposed all right thank you take care uh yeah you better of course of course we can of course we can you you you you you you you you you you you [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I'm recording okay welcome to the rock collection okay we are we're about done we've got a couple of things that came up earlier in the meeting that we'd like to go over all the list is buried under the rock collection one is to prioritize legislature requests when is some guidance on business names and then mr. Schulte would like to talk about maybe we all would like to talk about the method of dealing changes that that metric develops on their own just fields that suddenly appear and that let's talk about that first okay you know you drafted up a resolution I don't know that's necessary I'd like to ask the director and I don't know if enforcement is on the line or not and actually I think yeah let's just try to have an actually into the conference it's no longer in listen-only mode yeah bankowski's if he's available otherwise we'll it but James wait but it sounds like to me that what has happened is you know metric will make a new population whole on the forms on the you and send out a bulletin that says Oh new feature start using it and some people and probably not just Alaska say oh I guess we have to use that and so that so the suggestion for mr. Schulte was that we resolved that nobody has to start using metric changes until they've been approved by the board I I want to learn more about metric we tried I hope you were there when we had that presentation by metric or not but that was that was not is an informing as I would like to it have been dirtier I don't I wasn't sure what you wanted to see in metric I mean they were going to walk through the experience of being a licensee in metric that you stopped them so I wasn't like we they're coming back in October so we could try to arrange something or arrange a WebEx or something I was like something watched something less than a sales pitch and more of a well from our perspective more of a this is what you guys you know what enforcement everybody looks at let me look at metric yeah short okay here's how you do here say a loading a transfer right but something a little more [Music] disappeared [Music] [Music] [Laughter] okay Philip Graham lacy can you hear me and yes I can can the rest of the board here because we can't hear you you see I'm talking the chairperson has disconnected the conference will now end you welcome to the GCI conference center please enter your access code followed by the pound sign that entry is not valid please enter that entry is not valid please enter thank you please stand by you are being placed into conference in listen-only mode there are 14 participants in the conference we are talking about metric and changes to it and I guess on these bulletins it says Alaska metric support all of them that might be one thing that people see that they're like oh that's a change that applies to us so is that a reasonable assumption that when people see that just it doesn't say it doesn't say it's sanctioned by the I am co or by the board but they see Alaska metrics support bulletin I saw that I would think oh this applies to me I guess one question I do we have the Amoco office have the ability to disable some of these features temporarily you know pending review and approval not on our own we would have to work with metrics to say don't make these changes you know we went to a new system recently and we can't change the format of it all they generally can't disable fields it's pretty simple food okay when Lynch metric coming up to Alaska October the week of I think October okay yeah I guess let's let's let's let's come up with some questions from the board for the director to present two metrics that's not okay for starters so I guess the first question is can we can we get a list of changes that have been made in metric since their contract has begun with the state of Alaska changes that have been done at the request of ankle changes their basic structure those are two separate things well that's that's that's that's that's that's no mr. chairman that might actually be helpful it and see a full list of changes and which of those cases were requested that true Yeah right yeah changes and changes we that have been asked for by the state of Alaska by namco and then once we get that we can promulgate that to you know metric users yeah um I would suggest perhaps that that would be a starting point before we actually put it out to all the users maybe you know we would have an opportunity to look at it and decide okay oh yeah are these changes relevant and are these things that we say we expect Alaska licensees to to follow reuse or whatever cuz it it sounds like that that was sort of a core problem was that some people had this chief changes sprung on them they assume now are to use them that was introducing some complications in the business flow if I understood correctly but I would also like to I mean most software companies have a stuff upcoming features and release date if they could bring that as well they usually call them client enhancements I have other coming for them but we'll go with that so I'm not real familiar with the metric system do they handle the distribution of all these bulletins to licensees or do they go to the amp go first kind of depends on the issue so for this particular bulletin 21 it was sent to AAMCO at all which I'm gonna assume was an oversight on their part because generally we get them but they get sent to the licensees through metrics so when you log into metric there's a little note saying there's a new bulletin or something like that we you know we had an issue in 2017 when we brought metric up to do in-person training and metrics advertise that through the bulletin but at that time a lot of licensees who had especially retailers had point-of-sale systems weren't even going into metric which created a lot of other problems and so they never saw the bulletin and we had very poor training participation and we sort of learned ah we need to also you know work with them through email so but there have been times when we have requested a new feature and I'm thinking of something like turning off the ability to create packages out of thin air to create packages without some sort of source I said I I could be mistaken but I think that was may have been one attention metric sent us the draft will and for our review we reviewed it and said yeah this is fine or please make these changes and send it back and they sent it out so again it varies is there any way we can modify the contract where we are the ones approving the bulletins that go out to Alaska licensees I don't I don't really know a lot about how to modify a contract that's existing with the state but I can certainly ask about that I think their conduct is up in a year I want to say and so we'll have to do a new RFP in a year but I can sir we I mean I can certainly talk with them about running all changes through us before they actually make them and then I can bring them to the board I mean whatever the board ends up deciding but again it may be possible I just don't know a lot about how to amend existing contracts with the state that's kind of in the big picture level drop oh yeah I simply forward that the licensees on this I mean they're getting these bulletins that don't apply to all but they don't really know it so they're trying to work with it and it's just convoluting a mess and we need to control that in not allow that to happen experiment I I'm just looking at the narrative in the first page of this bulletin and it and it says users users will now have more columns and information available so on and so forth for all license types that have the respective permissions so that that's that kind of implies that they have the ability on the backend to select who does who sees these changes or not and which is fairly typical for a lot of software so it would be I be very trusted to hear from them you know if we can the you know if there are such changes if we can if they can just be turned off temporarily until we say yeah okay we're good with that in Alaska go ahead and implement those I think I'm restating kind of part of the conversation but this suggests that the capability does exist perhaps mr. chair okay I think before we jump off a deep end here yeah deal with a lot of state contracts when I work for the state's a lot of sort of system contracts that were big wide that weren't specific to a particular agency I deal with some of those now at the city level and I know that we have some contracts that state you know you may not make any changes to software affecting us without our approval and we pay a premium where the city says the low bidder is blah blah software and they do software for advisory boards 4000 municipalities across the lap you know across the US and they will license you that software for 2000 bucks a year and then they will which you say you may not make any changes to this software affecting us without our approval that cost goes to 5000 bucks each and because they make their money by being able to one make one change and if they have to make one change for every different thousand municipalities then their costs go up and if the state is signed a contract that basically allows metric to make these changes and we say you can't do that without our approval we may be not able to do that with the contract of State signed and so I think some research needs to be done in terms of the contract I think research needs to be done on you know exactly what we have authority to change or not change you know we bought this system because it was you used in other states and so we were building off their model it wasn't something that we said we want X information and this company says we'll write the software to get you X information we were sold as software because we've been doing seed to sale in these states are legal we know what the rules are we can adapt it to your rules in terms of some of the software that they might write I'm not surprised that bulletin says Alaska because what would our providers do if we'd sent out and said this is Colorado's bulletin but I bet you if you go to Colorado the bulletin is exactly the same except for the heading and and so I I'm not surprised it says the last guy I would be surprised if it's in Colorado or Washington so I understand and the frustration of the users because I go through that frustration every time I update software on my computer or my iPhone and it screws me up and changes something and I got an interface looked at it's not the same but yeah we do with the city every time we have a national software voter registration uh managing boards and directors doing agendas for her assembly meetings you know we had clerks spend six months relearning a system because we change software vendors you know that was a hell of a lot of investment that that our city paid in our own staff because we opted to go to a company that provided us a software ten percent less than the last one but it probably cost us more than that ten percent that we saved in the training of our clerks so how to use a new one so I understand the frustration understand the board's need to respond to that frustration it just seems to me that that we could go beyond where maybe we can or maybe we can't if we find that there's frustration that we can't control their changes as clearly as we want and that becomes a condition for the new RFP and we find out if that costs us money but I just I just don't want us to try to come up with a solution that may exacerbate the problem because you know we don't sort of understand the source and and I don't know enough I'm not certified in metric I don't intend to get certified in metric I don't want to be certified in metric you know I want to basically be told we can track sealed seed to sale and when there's an issue enforcement can say here's where the mistakes were I don't know that I even read those ten pages the metric because they don't mean anything but I think it does mean something to other people I know we've been frustrated in terms of what reports can we get out of metrics you know can we understand what's going on out there and that's not a very good thing either but I haven't come up with a solution because I'm not sure what I want I build databases I never started to write any code until I wrote down all the questions I wanted answered because if I did it wrote the database before I wouldn't collect the data to answer half the questions that I wanted at the end so I guess I just I just want us to be cautious and and and maybe before we give metric a whole list of stuff maybe it's more you know who approved the contract whose controls the contract you know the conditions of the contract you know and if we get into approving every change you know metric makes a change two days after our board meeting and three months later we see it and then we approve the change you know they may have already they may have delayed what goes into Colorado because they can't change Colorado system without you so I think those are the kind of questions we need to look at before we get into more specific yeah thanks mr. Jones oh that's real good yeah I I think would be hard for us to approve you know changes that they have made as far as changes that are requested I definitely know what we don't have you even have to ask metric this we would know this in-house if any changes in metric have been requested by AAMCO that just just so we know the only one I can think of off the top of my head is to turn off the ability to create plants out of thin air but I have to admit sometimes it takes metric a long time to make a change that we've requested so I would like the opportunity to go back talk with mr. Bren Kowski and mr. hull sure and refresh my memory to see whether there's something else that we asked for a long time ago that just hasn't happened okay and and you know there are some changes on this one on this bulletin there's reversing waste and pardon me the room one I can see that that would bug some people you know you know we should probably for sure when this comes in we should probably have Joe you know and maybe somebody else in the office review this and see me I mean it would throw us off just as much if people started using some of these new features here in Alaska and didn't you know I didn't tell anybody well they're in there we'll start using them and we're gonna start you know reversing waste and and all of a sudden when enforcement is looking at metric they're gonna have some confusing things show up so so for sure we have to we as in the office after review I mean this bulletin and the changes and see which ones might impact the state and then maybe provide some guidance and say okay you know there is this new feature but we don't expect you to use it or there is a snoo feature and we do expect to use it and but say because why also mr. Jeremiah I would just offer I'm either through this discussion I could see this this topic growing to be a huge time sock on on the offices resources yeah at the same time we have a lot of licensees it has ongoing daily business needs that need to be addressed by by the office so my my own part I think it'd be appropriate to prioritize the day to day needs of our licensees and their and and throw this to metric and say hey here's the problem here's a situation you've put us in addresses let us know where we're at with regard to your product because they did sell the state of Alaska a customizable system and perhaps it is exactly that or not we need to know that okay good and then just one more thing I would like to say that I believe that based on metric serving many different states it's obviously obvious that they can turn things on and off by state so if they do make a core system upgrade there should be able to turn that on and off by state regardless of all that I would like for the board to consider giving the guidance like this change room feature button if enforcement shows up and you're trimming half your harvest and half your harvest is in the flour room no one is going to get in nov for that because it's impractical and that's more of the concern as I guess I don't know if you want to call an optional button or not but use it or not you know you won't be penalized if you don't and and that's my concern so and at least looking at changes before they get put out would be nice by metric okay so do we want to give some guidance to the director we want we figure we've talked it out enough here and get out get a discussion of that well hello central mr. mayor come right in mr. mayor come right in we're gonna we're gonna suspend the rules and recognize mayor Bennett bill who has who has joined us well we love coming and down there we love coming on we appreciate the tour he gave a few of us last time yeah and by gum no we've been somebody brought us a nice weather day we gotta leave tonight yes it is it is ain't no lobbying thank you sir now we appreciate but I'm glad you I'm glad you stopped by thank you so much well have to see you anytime [Laughter] thanks for stopped by Richard all right in case you didn't catch all that that was mayor Bennett Ville stopped by to say hello ah okay so on metric so we have what do we what do we what do we said these are the notes that I have taken the board wants an orientation on the AAMCO side of metric arrange for the board's ability to take the intro the licensee intro class page 10a bulletin 21 is a the issue with bulletin 21 the board wants to know what change requests we have into metric the board should send me questions to ask metric including you want a list of changes to metric since the contract began plus an indication of which ones were requested by AAMCO plus a list of planned enhancements can to review the contract to see what it says about making changes and could we amend it to require our approval of changes or would that be really sort of a big deal we should review bulletins in house and let licensees know whether they are expected to use the features that are mentioned in the bulletins I miss something I would just like to clarify by in-house I mean the board oh okay all right okay so um on that point I understand that that could be a bother there might be some providers out there that actually like it we as a board say well we don't like the room change turn it off and we've had four providers that liked it using it and all of a sudden the feature doesn't work anymore you know if we do it in advance that's one thing if we do it afterwards that's more difficult process but just like most software doesn't fit all users not all users complain about the changes in the software so I'm actually like it some actually find it works around better to their business process you know I don't know what we see I mean Nick has a point-of-sale system and I assume it's not his homegrown and I would assume maybe he gets notified if you want upgrade from version 10.2 to ten point two point three click this button and he probably has no idea what changes are going to happen so maybe he waits until he gets version six point seven or something you know before he hits that button and then he gets mad because it changed his bookkeeping system I don't know we're in the same boat except we feel we ought to be more in control and maybe we should be but I just I just want to make sure there's there's some caution and what we do here I'd also like to say metric is is very complicated and there's only one licensee on the board who has experience with it and something that I don't know as well as I feel like I ought to know it because I don't have as much time as I would like to have to spend in it so I'm a little concerned about the board members who are not licensees who have even less time than I do to understand it sort of taking on the responsibility to review something that you know you don't have the knowledge or the experience or the access to really understand what it is you're reading and I have a feeling that could just end up being very frustrating for everybody except for mr. Miller because he would be the only one who you know gets into metric and really understands it so I'm not saying you shouldn't review these things but I just kind of want to caution you that it may be something that isn't really how most of you want to spend your time okay enough on metrics I'm sure we'll talk about it it's the next meeting and the marijuana mailbox is a if anybody's got you know any any metric users out there who tell us about metric you know our mailbox so anything just to be clear on the guidance no one is going to receive an Nov for not using the change room and everything that's correct all right which brings us to legislative requests and so we had a few in here in our packet turning let's add four so we've got tax structure which is ongoing and there's ongoing questions this is the Commissioner and Industry and board members and Department revenue so that is and sure when do you when do you think you'll have some ideas to give to the governor in time for the legislature please clean up they are working through right now I am not sure if we will have our proposal ripe for this legislative session as most legislative proposals from the governor specifically are probably going to be determined in the next month or so but we are working on it and if we have something that we believe is is good we're going to put it forward and hopefully if if the governor agrees he will you know him and his team what the team will evaluate it and put it forward but as far as the timeline I can't give you one we don't have a man that's okay [ __ ] everybody should know that it's being worked on at a good high level it right with the transportation license types this again would be a legislative fix to allow us by regulation to authorize delivery transport distribution receipt purchase Merril are between license types and that include backflow and we want to we want to have this as a legislative priority again we're gonna have to be pretty tangible in what we would like the legislature to do because they'd be amending 1738 i think it's very important okay as an industry member mr. chair if I may the Department of Law has looked at this and determine that in most in all likelihood this is just an oversight you know 17:38 is just eight pages long it's really fairly skeletal and this would be a pretty simple fix okay then only that we want we would appropriately go through the Commissioner accomplish to the governor's office so that's that's something that would would kind of be a priority how soon how long do you think would take to proposed language not long could you could you put something together and would everybody be alright and just receiving that as a memorandum and you know individually respond to the sender and if you know it looks good to all of us we can ask the director to push it up to the commissioner's office I don't imagine to be anything too complex okay hopefully we get that in within the within the month indemnification for minors again that's similar to alcohol where they can recruit minors to do controlled attempted buys we don't have that authority in 1738 that is also that's just copy with some title for I would imagine mr. Jim yes I have a problem with this because I think it blurs the distinction between AAMCO is a regulatory body and other enforcement agencies as a unfortune enforcing criminal statute I would propose to remove this this section i think it's sending city miners into stores for the sole purpose of entrapping people into failing to check for IDs on like I don't dispute the the rulemaking imperative this just makes me uncomfortable this is um I don't think that it's appropriate for a regulatory board to be getting this far into criminal enforcement across statute well okay if I made you but a regulatory in quasi-judicial agency in Accra the same as the enforcement powers that were given by statute to the alcohol board so really this that's where this comes from the distinction though is that the alcohol regulations are our codified in statute by the legislature our regulations were created by this body you relations are created by the body but the enforcement powers exist in the statutes okay well I stand by with my search I don't support inclusion this I think it sets the wrong tone well well would would the state troopers need this sort of indemnification to carry out a similar activity or do they already have that the indemnification relates to the person under 21 so not not to the law enforcement or peace officer who's who's overseeing the situations mr. cherrick yeah Makana when when I was working for the state we we did a lot of this both in alcohol and tobacco and sometimes it wasn't the the office on alcohol and drug abuse for the division of alcohol derbies but often times it was working with either the local law enforcement or with the state troopers where our prevention agencies were asked to identify individuals that we thought were stable enough to do this they went through a training there was a usually a police officer either nearby or in the parking lot they were instructed not to use a phony ID they would use their real ID and you would be surprised at how many times they were successful in purchasing tobacco especially alcohol got better and better over time but also part of the federal requirement for alcohol Gary's block grant from the feds was we had to show that we had a compliance rate of over 80% of tobacco vintners so we were required by the feds to do exactly this and mr. Scholl he's correct we had a lot of people that said they're uncomfortable with this that you know we shouldn't be going after vendors this way but this isn't sending somebody that's 19 with an iphone e ID that says they're 22 n this is somebody who is nine using an ID that says I'm 19 not like better and 21 and a half 12 [Laughter] welcome to the GC icon Center thank you please stand by you are

neurotransmitter and a psychoactive drug it is a precursor to gaba glutamate and glycine in certain brain areas and it acts on the GHB receptor and it is a weak agonist at the GABA B receptor ghb has been used in a medical setting as a general anaesthetic and as a treatment for cataplexy narcolepsy and alcoholism it is also used illegally as an intoxicant to try to increase athletic performance and as a date-rape drug it is commonly used in the form of assault such as sodium gamma hydroxybutyrate or potassium gamma hydroxybutyrate GHB is also produced as a result of fermentation and is found in small quantities in some beers and wines beef and small citrus fruits medical use Synnex mi aldehyde dehydrogenase deficiency is a disease that causes GHB to accumulate in the blood the only common medical use for GHB today are in the treatment of narcolepsy and more rarely alcoholism it is sometimes used off-label for the treatment of fibromyalgia GHB is the active ingredient in the prescription medication sodium oxy bate sodium oxy bate is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of cataplexy associated with narcolepsy and excessive daytime sleepiness associated with narcolepsy ghb has been shown to reliably increase slow-wave sleep and decrease the tendency for REM sleep and modified multiple sleep latency tests GHB is a central nervous system depressant used as an intoxicant although it produces a stimulant effect at lower doses due to its action on the GHB receptor it has many street names including G liquid G liquid X liquidy Georgia homeboy juice Mills and fantasy its effects have been described anecdotally as comparable with ethanol and MDMA use such as euphoria disinhibition enhanced libido and M pathogenic states at higher doses GHB may induce nausea dizziness drowsiness agitation visual disturbances depressed breathing amnesia unconsciousness and death when death is associated with GHB it is sometimes in conjunction with other drugs such as alcohol or benzodiazepine which influence the same neurotransmitter the effects of GHB can last from one point five to four hours or even longer if large doses have been consumed consuming GHB with alcohol is dangerous as it can lead to respiratory arrest and vomiting in combination with unravel sleep a potentially lethal combination in general the doses used recreationally are between 0.5 grams and 3 grams when used as a recreational drug GHB may be found as the sodium or potassium salt which is a white crystalline powder or as GHB salt dissolved in water to form a clear solution the sodium salt of GHB has a salty taste other salt forms such as calcium GHB and magnesium GHB have also been reported but the sodium salt is by far the most common chemicals convert to GHB in the stomach and bloodstream gamma butyrolactone is one such pro drug other products include one comma four butanediol there may be additional toxicity concerns with these precursors one comma four b and g BL are normally found as pure liquids though they may be mixed with other more harmful solvents when intended for industrial use eg as paint stripper or varnish thinner ghb can be easily manufactured with very little knowledge of chemistry as it only involves the mixing of its two precursors GBL and an alkali hydroxide such as sodium hydroxide to form the resulting GHB salt due to the ease of manufacture and the availability of its precursors it is not mainly produced in illicit laboratories like most other synthetic drugs but in private homes by low-level producers instead while available as a prescription for rare and severe forms of sleep disorders such as narcolepsy in some other countries notably most of Europe GHB was banned in the u.s. by the FDA in 1990 however on July 17 2002 GHB was approved for treatment of cataplexy often associated with narcolepsy GHB is colorless and odorless GHB is often taken because users find that it enhances their experiences of being in a club party or rave small doses of GHB can act as a stimulant and aphrodisiac GHB is sometimes referred to as liquid ecstasy lollipops liquid X or a liquid II due to its tendency to produce euphoria and sociability and its use in the dance party scene despite these nicknames GHB and MDMA have entirely separate chemical and pharmacological modes of action recreational use some athletes also use GHB as GHB has been shown to elevate human growth hormone in vivo one study found that it doubled growth hormone secretion in normal young males the growth hormone elevating effects of GHB are mediated through muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and can be prevented by prior administration of Pyron Zevon a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor blocking agent as certain succinate salts have been shown to elevate growth hormone in vitro and because GHB is metabolized into succinate some people have suggested this plays a role in the growth hormone elevations from GHB there is however currently no evidence to show that succinate plays any role in the growth hormone elevations from GHB GHB is primarily known to the general public as a date-rape drug the drug is sometimes used to numb the other person making it easier to rape them when unobtrusively administered in a drink the victim will quickly feel groggy and sleepy and upon recovery may have an impaired ability to recall memories of events that occurred during the period of intoxication consequently the evidence and the identification of the perpetrator of rape is often difficult however a survey in the Netherlands shows that the proportion of GHB in rape cases is greatly overestimated by the media like alcohol and potent benzodiazepines such as flunitrazepam GHB has been labeled as a date-rape drug the sodium form of GHB has an extremely salty taste but as it is colorless and odorless it has been described as very easy to add to drinks that masks the flavor GHB produced as a sodium salt may provide a noticeable salty character to the drink though individual sensitivity to the taste of salt varies GHB can also be produced as different salts some of which do not have a taste as distinctive as the sodium salt or much less commonly in the unstable free acid form ghb has been used in cases of drug-related sexual assault usually when the victim is vulnerable due to intoxication with a sedative generally alcohol it is difficult to establish how often GHB is used to facilitate rape as it is difficult to detect in a urine sample after a day and many victims may only recall the rape sometime after this although GHB can be detected in hair hair testing can be a useful tool in court cases or for the victims own information over-the-counter urine test kits only test for date rape drugs that are benzodiazepines and GHB is not a benzodiazepine to detect GHB in urine the sample must be taken within four hours of GHB ingestion and cannot be tested at home GHB can be detected in hair four months after GHB ingestion other drugs such as muscle relaxers are sometimes mixed with GHB therefore it can be beneficial to request that the hair sample be tested for multiple drugs there have been several high-profile cases of GHB as a date-rape drug that received national attention in the United States in early 1999 a 15 year old girl Samantha Reed of Rockwood Michigan died from GHB poisoning Reed's death inspired the legislation titled the Hillary Jeff arias and Samantha Reed date rape drug prohibition Act of 2000 this is the law that made GHB is schedule 1 controlled substance in 2007 germs drummer Dan Balz was arrested by Orange County California police after his bottle of dr. Bronner s soap field tested positive for GHB more sophisticated tests yielded negative results and he was released after five days party use sports and athletics since april 28th 1999 GHB is illegal in france under the opium act date rape drug United States other countries adverse effects combination with alcohol in the Netherlands GHB is illegal since January 1st 2002 under the opium Act previously under the law on medicines until May 7th 1996 the drug was available as a legal chemical the healthcare Inspectorate has sales prohibited by the law on medicines in order to circumvent the ban on GHB do-it-yourself packages were put on the market with which oneself could easily make GHB these contain the basic raw materials to be mixed as well as instructions in order the main ingredients for homemade GHB are still freely available commercially in the Netherlands or 1 , for butanediol which is used as the alkaline industrial cleaning agent sodium hydroxide which can be found in drain cleaner and distilled water or ethanol since 2005 GHB is medically used under the brand names Iram for the treatment of narcolepsy with cataplexy in 2011 the party drug was placed on the list of hard drugs by the Dutch government making it illegal other than for medical use prescribed by a doctor also it is an addiction clinics used during detoxification of GHB in a reduction schedule to prevent severe withdrawal symptoms a 2006 study suggested that there was no evidence to suggest widespread date rape drug use in the UK and that less than 2% of cases involved GHB while 17% involved cocaine in humans GHB has been shown to reduce the elimination rate of alcohol this may explain the respiratory arrest that has been reported after ingestion of both drugs a review of the details of 194 deaths attributed to or related to GHB over a 10-year period found that most were from respiratory depression caused by interaction with alcohol or other drugs deaths:1 publication has investigated 226 deaths attributed to GHB of 226 deaths included 213 had a cardio respiratory arrest and 13 had fatal accidents 71 deaths had no Co intoxicants post-mortem blood GHB was 1840 400 mg / L and deaths negative 4 Co intoxicants one report has suggested that sodium oxy bait overdose might be fatal based on deaths of three patients who had been prescribed the drug however for two of the three cases post-mortem GHB concentrations were 141 and 110 mg / L which is within the expected range of concentrations for GHB after death and the third case was a patient with a history of intentional drug overdose the toxicity of GHB has been an issue in criminal trials as in the death of Felicia Tang where the defense argued that death was due to GHB not murder GHB is produced in the body in very small amounts and blood levels may climb after death two levels in the range of 30 50 mg / L levels higher than this are found in GHB deaths levels lower than this may be due to GHB or to post-mortem endogenous elevations a UK parliamentary committee commissioned report found the use of GHB to be less dangerous than tobacco and alcohol and social harms physical harm and addiction in multiple studies GHB has been found to impair spatial memory working memory learning and memory in rats with chronic administration these effects are associated with decreased and MDA receptor expression in the cerebral cortex and possibly other areas as well in addition the neurotoxicity appears to be caused by oxidative stress although there have been reported fatalities due to GHB withdrawal reports are inconclusive and further research is needed a common problem is that GHB does not leave traces in the body after a short period of time complicating diagnosis and research addiction occurs when repeated drug use disrupts the normal balance of brain circuits that control rewards memory and cognition ultimately leading to compulsive drug taking rats forced to consume massive doses of GHB will intermittently prefer GHB solution to water but after experiments on rats it was noted that no rat showed any sign of withdrawal when GHB was finally removed at the end of the twenty week period or during periods of voluntary abstinence neurotoxicity P has also been associated with a withdrawal syndrome of insomnia anxiety and tremor that usually resolves within 3 to 21 days the withdrawal syndrome can be severe producing acute delirium and may require hospitalization in an intensive care unit for management management of GHB dependence involves considering the person's age comorbidity and the pharmacological pathways of GHB the mainstay of treatment for severe withdrawal is supportive care and benzodiazepines for control of acute delirium but larger doses are often required compared to acute delirium of other causes baclofen has been suggested as an alternative or adjunct to benzodiazepines based on anecdotal evidence in some animal data however there is less experience with the use of baclofen for GHB withdrawal an additional research in humans is needed baclofen was first suggested as an adjunct because benzodiazepines do not affect GABA B receptors and thus have no Kraus tolerance with GHB while baclofen which works via GABA B receptors is cross tolerant with GHB and may be more effective in alleviating withdrawal effects of GHB ghb withdrawal is not widely discussed in textbooks and some psychiatrists general practitioners and even hospital emergency physicians may not be familiar with this withdrawal syndrome diction overdose of GHB can sometimes be difficult to treat because of its multiple effects on the body GHB tends to cause rapid unconsciousness at doses above 3500 milligrams with single doses over 7,000 milligrams often causing life-threatening respiratory depression and higher doses still inducing braddock Ardea and cardiac arrest other side effects include convulsions and nausea / vomiting greatest life threat due to GHB overdoses respiratory arrest other relatively common causes of death due to GHB ingestion include aspiration of vomitus positional asphyxia and trauma sustained while intoxicated the risk of aspiration pneumonia and positional asphyxia risk can be reduced by laying the patient down in the recovery position people are most likely to vomit as they become unconscious and as they wake up it is important to keep the victim awake and moving who must not be left alone due to the risk of death through vomiting frequently they will be in a good mood but this does not mean they are not in danger GHB overdose is a medical emergency and immediate assessment in an emergency department is needed withdrawal does detection of use from GHB can be treated with the benzodiazepines diazepam or lorazepam even though these benzodiazepines are also CNS depressants they primarily modulate gaba-a receptors whereas GHB is primarily a GABA B receptor agonist and so do not worsen CNS depression as much as might be expected because of the faster and more complete absorption of GBL relative to GHB its dose response curve is steeper and overdoses of GBL tend to be more dangerous and problematic than overdoses involving only GHB or 1 , for be any GHB / GBL overdose is a medical emergency and should be cared for by appropriately trained personnel a newer synthetic drug SCH 5 0 9 1 1 which acts as a selective GABA B antagonist quickly reverses GHB overdose in mice however this treatment has yet to be tried in humans and it is unlikely that it will be researched for this purpose in humans due to the illegal nature of clinical trials of GHB and the lack of medical indemnity coverage inherent in using an untested treatment for a life-threatening overdose ghb may be quantitated in blood or plasma to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients provide evidence in an impaired driving arrest or to assist in a medical legal death investigation blood or plasma GHB concentrations are usually in a range of 50 to 50 mg / L in persons receiving the drug therapeutically 30 100 mg / L in those arrested for impaired driving 5,500 mg / L and acutely intoxicated patients in 100 1000 mg / L and victims of fatal overdoses urine is often the preferred specimen for routine drug abuse monitoring purposes both gamma butyrolactone and 1 , for butanediol are converted to GHB in the body in January 2016 it was announced scientists had developed a way to detect GHB among other things in saliva cells produce GHB by reduction of sux enix mi aldehyde via sux annex mi aldehyde reductase this enzyme appears to be induced by camp levels meaning substances that elevate camp such as firs colon and ving Poseidon may increase GHB synthesis and release conversely endogenous GHB production in those taking valproic acid will be inhibited via inhibition of the conversion from sucks Inuk acid semi aldehyde to GHB it is important to note however that direct administration of GHB or endogenous GHB already present in the body will not be affected by valproic acid people with the disorder known as sux annex mi aldehyde dehydrogenase deficiency also known as gamma hydroxybutyrate acid area have elevated levels of GHB in their urine blood plasma and cerebral spinal fluid the precise function of GHB in the body is not clear it is known however that the brain expresses a large amount of receptors that are activated by GHB these receptors are excitatory and not responsible for the sedative effects of GHB they have been shown to elevate the principal excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate the Benz amide antipsychotics a missile pride solver I'd have been shown to bind to this receptor in vivo other antipsychotics were tested and were not found to have an affinity for this receptor it is a precursor to gaba glutamate and glycine in certain brain areas ghb has neuroprotective properties and has been found to protect cells from hypoxia GHB is also produced as a result of fermentation and so is found in small quantities in some beers and wines in particular fruit wines the amount found in wine is pharmacologically insignificant and not sufficient to produce psychoactive effects ghb has at least two distinct binding sites in the central nervous system GHB is an agonist at the newly characterized GHB receptor which is excitatory and it is a weak agonist at the GABA B receptor which is inhibitory GHB is a naturally occurring substance that acts in a similar fashion to some neurotransmitters in the mammalian brain GHB is probably synthesized from GABA and gabr jyg neurons and released when the neurons fire ghb has been found to activate oxytocin urge ik neurons in the supraoptic nucleus if taken orally GABA itself does not effectively cross the blood-brain barrier GHB induces the accumulation of either a derivative of tryptophan or tryptophan itself in the extracellular space possibly by increasing tryptophan transport across the blood-brain barrier the blood content of certain neutral amino acids including tryptophan is also increased by peripheral GHB administration GHB induced stimulation of tissue serotonin turnover may be due to an increase in tryptophan transport to the brain and in its uptake by syrota nergic cells as the syrota nergic system may be involved in the regulation of sleep mood and anxiety the stimulation of this system by high doses of GHB may be involved in certain neuro pharmacological events induced by GHB administration however at therapeutic doses GHB reaches much higher concentrations in the brain and activates gaba B receptors which are primarily responsible for its sedative effects gh B's sedative effects are blocked by GABA B antagonists the role of the GHB receptor in the behavioural effects induced by GHB is more complex GHB receptors are densely expressed in many areas of the brain including the cortex and hippocampus and these are the receptors that GHB displays the highest affinity for there has been somewhat limited research into the GHB receptor however there is evidence that activation of the GHB receptor in some brain areas results in the release of glutamate the principal excitatory neurotransmitter drugs that selectively activate the GHB receptor causes absence seizures in high doses as do GHB and GABA agonist s' activation of both the GHB receptor and GABA is responsible for the addictive profile of GHB GHB z' effect on dopamine releases biphasic low concentrations stimulate dopamine release via the GHB receptor higher concentrations inhibit dopamine release via gaba receptors as do other GABA agonist such as baclofen and phenibut after an initial phase of inhibition dopamine release is then increased via the GHB receptor both the inhibition and increase of dopamine release by GHB are inhibited by opioid antagonists such as naloxone and naltrexone Diner Finn may play a role in the inhibition of dopamine release via Kappa opioid receptors this explains the paradoxical mix of sedative and stimulatory properties of GHB as well as the so called rebound effect experienced by individuals using GHB as a sleeping agent wherein they awake suddenly after several hours of GHB induced deep sleep that is to say that over time the concentration of GHB in the system decreases below the threshold for significant gaba B receptor activation and activates predominantly the GHB receptor leading to wakefulness recently analogues of GHB such as 4 hydroxy for methyl pentanoic acid have been synthesized and tested on animals in order to gain a better understanding of GH B's mode of action analogues of GHB such as three methyl GHB four methyl GHB and four phenol GHB have been shown to produce similar effects to GHB in some animal studies but these compounds are even less well researched than GHB itself of these analogues only four methyl GHB and a prodrug form gamma Valero lactone have been reported as drugs of abuse in humans and on the available evidence seem to be less potent but more toxic than GHB with the particular tendency to cause nausea and vomiting other prodrug Esther forms of GHB have also rarely been encountered by law enforcement including one comma for butanediol diacetate methyl for asset oxybutynin ethyl for asset oxybutynin general covered by analog laws in jurisdictions where GHB is illegal and little is known about them beyond their delayed onset and longer duration of action the intermediate compound gamma hydroxybutyrate a height is also a pro drug for GHB however as with all aliphatic aldehydes this compound is caustic and is strong smelling and foul tasting actual use of this compound as an intoxicant is likely to be unpleasant and result in severe nausea and vomiting both of the metabolic breakdown pathways shown for GHB can run in either direction depending on the concentrations of the substances involved so the body can make its own GHB either from gaba or from sux annex mi aldehyde under normal physiological conditions the concentration of GHB in the body is rather low and the pathways would run in the reverse direction to what is shown here to produce and dodging SGH B however when GHB is consumed for recreational or health promotion purposes its concentration in the body is much higher than normal which changes the enzyme kinetics so that these pathways operate to metabolize GHB rather than producing it synthesis of the chemical GHB was first reported in 1874 by alexander zaytsev but the first major research into its use in humans was conducted in the early 1960s by dr. on relay buret to use in studying the neurotransmitter gaba it quickly found a wide range of uses due to its minimal side effects and short duration of action the only difficulties being the narrow therapeutic dosage range in the dangers presented by its combination with alcohol and other nervous system depressants ghb was widely used in France Italy and other European countries for several decades as a sleeping agent in an anaesthetic in childbirth but problems with its abuse potential and development of newer drugs have led to a decrease in legitimate medical use of GHB in recent times in the Netherlands GHB could be bought as aphrodisiac and euphoria and in a smart shop for several years until several incidents caused it to become regulated the only common medical applications for GHB today are in the treatment of narcolepsy and more rarely alcoholism in the typical scenario GHB has been synthesized from gamma butyrolactone by adding sodium hydroxide in ethanol or water a popular children's toy find ease produced by Melbourne company moose was banned in Australia in early November 2007 when it was discovered that one comma for butanediol which is metabolized into GHB had been substituted for the non toxic plastic Iser one comma five pentane dial in the bead manufacturing process three young children were hospitalized as a result of ingesting a large number of the beads and the toy was recalled in the United States it was placed on schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act in March 2000 however when sold as sodium oxy bate it is considered a Schedule three substance but with schedule I trafficking penalties one of several drugs that are listed in multiple schedules on March 20th 2001 the Commission on narcotic drugs placed GHB in schedule four of the 1971 Convention on psychotropic substances in the UK GHB was made a Class C drug in June 2003 in October 2013 the AC md recommended upgrading it from scheduled for to schedule to inline with UN recommendations their report concluded that the minimal use of serum in the UK meant that prescribers would be minimally inconvenienced by the rescheduling this advice was followed and GHB was moved to schedule 2 On January 7th 2015 in Hong Kong GHB is regulated under Schedule one of Hong Kong s chapter 134 dangerous drugs ordinance it can only be used legally by health professionals and for university research purposes the substance can be given by pharmacists under a prescription anyone who supplies the substance without prescription can be fined HK dollar 10,000 the penalty for trafficking or manufacturing the substance is a HK dollar 150 comma zero zero zero fine and life imprisonment possession of the substance for consumption without license from the Department of Health is illegal with the HK dollar 100 comma zero zero zero fine or five years of jail time in New Zealand in Australia GHB 1 comma 4 B and G BL are all Class B illegal drugs along with any possible esters ethers and aldehydes GABA itself is also listed as an illegal drug in these jurisdictions which seems unusual given its failure to cross the blood-brain barrier but there was a perception among legislators that all known analogues should be covered as far as this was possible attempts to circumvent the illegal status of GHB have led to the sale of derivatives such as for methyl GHB in its pro drug form Gama Valero lactone but these are also covered under the log by virtue of their being substantially similar to GHB or GBL and so importation sale possession and use of these compounds is also considered to be illegal in Chile GHB is a controlled drug under the law laid a substantial psychotropic as why is to officience in Norway and in Switzerland GHB is considered a narcotic and is only available by prescription under the trade names Iram sodium oxy bait is also used therapeutically in Italy under the brand name alq

web says a rot updated in run by the local consultant single high school wwp ET org the reason I draw your attention to some quite handy things for you the probably more significant of these as an opioid those converter and well if you've got patients on taking a variety of things or single agent you want to do a conversion you can put in the doses of all the drugs and then it will give you a nice handy conversion without twenty five percent those reduction so it's quite a handy thing to and there's lots of other resources including all these it talks uploaded to this website so if you ever miss any you can always come back in refresh so just to give a an update on the drugs and medications that we use in a chronic pain service I'm just going to push through and touch one most of them and with a bit of gonna focus on author the guidelines particularly the same guideline and what is recommended so before Binford's just quickly go through a bit of a history of analgesia see pictures here the one level on the left as well Oh tree and the bark of which spawned the advent of aspen and the picture in the middle is called tar and that is the rustics a precursor to paracetamol eventually and on the right we've got a poppies which we all know as where opium and morphine came from so opioids earliest reference is about 3000 BC a Sumerian civilization of our advanced civilization around the Euphrates River the Persian Gulf and referred to as a joy plants or was recreational before there was medicinal ancient Greeks used it for both medicinal and recreational purposes and then it's a long time between then and is a relatively modern era with the imported this laudanum and to Europe which was opium with 40 percent alcohol and the bomb of the time and so as it was used obviously medicinally as well but often for recreational and misused Pops's morpheme is isolated from opium in 1800s and then certainly 1800s and buyeth german company manufactured diamorphine as a non-addictive alternative to morphine a called heroin and it was discovered to be more potent and more addictive and so also it's mentioned it was back to 1500 BC Egyptians noticed that fever reducing qualities of the well bark Hippocrates used a will apparel to treat headache then extracted south and from willow bark which then got a synthetic version acidosis salicylic acid again made by buyer which is this a parent non-steroidal anilines which is origins of paracetamol so drug dispensing era which a for treating intestinal worms and they discovered the coal tar was an effective reducing fever by oh what a die producing company and they use lots of cool Tardos quilt our waste products and so they the wonderful they could do with it and they developed a fan a certain and that was the that was the change of the bios company from being a die producing company to be and that there's no company and acetaminophen was developed but found not to be as effective as other regions but it really became popular when concerns about GI side effects of aspirin grew and those were fee you know some entity of our g64 for many years were all be familiar with the WH all analgesia DAF which developed in the nineteen nineties by the clock prescribing giving the right drug the rate doors at the right time it's an expensive strategy it's very effective was developed for a treating cancer pin and it's been adopted into treating all sorts a pin but you see there's only three steps through there on the slider and it's not very versatile and if it's feeling effective at stage two they're still on too strong opioids which is a dangerous place to be those are different versions of the analgesic ladder and just don't if you can read it text at the bottom but there's a new model which is an analgesic platform so at the bottom there's two minutes which involve no medication and if you have to use so non opioid medications and other treatments available things physiotherapy psychology these kind of things and then you can take it off and up but there's more options at each level and that's probably more appropriate model for today's you know so we're just gonna go through the principles of pharmacological management of pain and drug treatment pharmacological management is really only one piece of the pie and it's important to discuss limitations of treatment with patients and trying find out that expectations and if patients expect and complete pain relief and the drug Allah gives on 30% pain relief then they may view as a failure and you view as a success so it's important to manage expectations and being aware of the efficacy side effects review your patient regularly reassess and offer reassurance and an important strategy we often see in the pink Anika's patients on multiple analgesics all of which they describe as being an effective anomie well being effective at some stage but if a drug treatment as an effective it's wise to discontinue it if you so it's not even talk to any drugs basically mention about a physiology of pain and four main processes that transduction is real physical or chemical war heat stimulus is turned into an electrical signal just transmitted to the central nervous system into this the dorsal Horn crosses over up the spinothalamic tract where it's perceived and then those descending modulation from higher centers no these are all areas where we can interfere with the pin process pharmacologically so we'll talk about them variety of agents topical agents non opioids to opioids anticonvulsants night of the presence these are the broad categories of talks that we would we would use also going to mention a little bit of interactions and as we go through talked about some of the guidelines that are available it's very I been my background is actually in their primary care and I don't know how limited we can be with things which are formally non-formulary so as you go through the talk I'll get to symbols if it's any tailor Glasgow and Clyde everything across its then the formula T let's go across it's not and if there's any special things that be a brackets next to it okay so um topical analgesics there's a range of options capsaicin there are three different strengths low strength creams which is 0.025 and 0.075 generally speaking the low strength gym as in the bincer antenor set to for osteoarthritis and these are things there's slightly strongest team is generally made to be more anti new neuropathic but they're both the same when you look at the studies was much stronger preparation which is an 8% patch corporate tender so we'll talk about by then not going to really talk about Derby fashions there in the s-saying guidelines but the I'm not a great deal of evidence to tissue that there of the defect and lidocaine patch is something we quite often use we'll talk about with that talk about the topical NSAIDs and it that mentioned gabapentin as a topical treatment this weird then using a glass cool but in Forth Valley they were doing a trial of using gabapentin AQ and those evidences they're useful involved there now and stop mate come up in the future so capsaicin it's the active ingredient of Chili Peppers and there's a selective agonist the trip v1 receptors on nociceptors and a delta and C fibers it's a um so novel treatment can be quite difficult to sell to a patient sometimes you're going to put chili pepper on my skin okay why often see if the patient sick it kind of I'm not sure how effective is but if they know someone who can eat hot curries and perhaps they can and it's that is taking it really hard curries they've been desensitized in those receptors over a number of years and that's what this the effect we're trying to get with using the capsaicin as continuous stimulation of these receptors to don't regulate them and you get a noodle degradation and I'll show you just a picture of that so this is really won't maybe school picture offer of a skin and that's the baseline showing up the in there fibers and then this is seven days following treatment with em that ends up actually you can see that the the number and and the amount of neural tissue is actually less and it's receded from the epidermis so we know no outlet that definitely works um okay so there's the low dose cream the point zero to five and zero seven five is in the formula very few control trials the evidence shows there's a benefit over placebo in patients with osteoarthritis so it can be useful across to a flight as the needs or RC of lightest of the hand joints there's conflicting evidence about neuropathic pain and so in the st. Galen doesn't actually make a recommendation for using neuropathic pain for the low dose team the recent Cochrane review of the OPSEC study suggests that there is some benefit and in Europe a thick paint worth of either the Lord o supreme person humbly did tree of sex and Cebu you often use capsaicin cream as an option given that it's apart from our it perhaps a skin editing effect there's variable side effect profile so even in patients who may not get a huge benefit we'll still give them a trial and how those patches is recommended in the same guidelines and having us a significant benefit over placebo particularly post herpetic neuralgia with on our money 3007 also HIV neuropathy this are all number needed to treat and but despite the benefit which can be a long-lasting expensive and needs specialist initiation an application normally and at the hospital setting and we usually apply it by first marking over the area of pain applying some local anesthetic Jim first of all because it's very very elephant and we use the rule applies to a teaching to go beyond the margins of the credits or would then applied if you by apply their patch with gloves and then live on theirs even using local anesthetic in some patients who find it intolerable very quickly I will try and reassure them and but some pages we just have to take it off take off others tolerate it better and just useful useful even for participating in our journey HIV neuropathy and we've good more experience using it and then post herpetic neuralgia um lidocaine patch a 5% plaster that's in the formula but it's lesser than those specialist initiation um it's got a juju affected box sodium channels to interrupts the pain transmission from nociceptors to the central nervous system there's also quite cooling and soothing then if anyone's ever tried one I had one go on my arm and it's really quite nice yeah and I can imagine if something's saw that you know it's a two-minute patient patients would like it's really it's licensed for books are petty you know our job which there's significant benefits over placebo but there's not really any real evidence for other indications or limited evidence for other indications we will find that we suggested contained a time for for patients who don't have poster pet in your house or have other neuropathic pain conditions and probably even for that is it's got a variable side-effect profile as a treatment which patients do like and if it avoids us going for a strong opioid then it can be quite can't be useful but then it's only in the formula for post-op hitting your knowledge uh so maybe that'll expand in the future you can apply up to three plasters and set turbos on two hours off a treatment so practicalities of using it um for example if you want if you can on your food quite difficult to fit on junuh day so my species to maybe bit on in a tank so it can be different we practical things which need to be sorted out to use it saying gay things recommended for you some poster petting you know Alger but only with another fast line therapies of field and they don't give a recommendation for any other indications and topical nonsteroidals most evidences for topical deco fennec but that's not in the formula for as in the formulary as peroxy Cameron kita proven and there's no difference in efficacy with topically applied non steroidal compared to to oral and they've got a better GI say the effect proof room which is comparable to placebo so for patients who have you know reflux or upper GI symptoms is an appropriate appropriate treatment and and they recommend for use particularly when normally it is not not tolerated and obviously it's probably useful for particular areas of the body if someone's got widespread musculus little plane you can't expect them to put G me everywhere so again it's got some practical implications when you talk about some tablets now um particularly mentioned non-opioid analgesics policy tomorrow nonsteroidals again cox-2 inhibitors and a Neff upon and not gonna mention never Pam and him really anymore it's not in the base was mentioned in the saying go thanks but there's no studies or anything to back up its excuse and it can be misused so Neff apparent something which wouldn't be recommended as a as a useful choice for non-opioid analgesics the paracetamol M as useful south-central Cyclops do you need inhibit also reduces central prostaglandins and that's how it exists it's pink killing and and and I think effect although no one's actually proved that satisfactorily it doesn't really have a peripheral anti-inflammatory action and this end the formula as you would expect that a cheap medication but it's a the tablet is preferred you know that the effervescent the spaceball ones are discouraged but part of the reason for that is this the effervescent dispersible ones have got very high so within content of eight grams and if you that's higher than the recommended daily intake of sodium so if you've got a patient who's hypertensive and you're the one effervescent tablets I could be one way to discourage them from promise to say you know this is such a high sodium content were it's going to be counterproductive in treating your hypertension but they should only be really reserved for people who have proper swallowing difficulties and it's saying guidelines the indicators a small benefit over placebo for osteoarthritis and that the recommended it should be considered either alone or in combination with known stories for osteoarthritis once the Royals primary reaction is an inhibition of cyclooxygenase and does to the oceans of the Cyclops Jeanne's enzyme one being the constitutive enzyme to being the inducible form the constitutive one is protective in GI tract and you may have it's also protective for your kidneys and the prostaglandins are important for real vascular tone and also expressed and platelets important in platelet aggregation the enzyme that's blocked and for most orders as they say option is enzyme when on the left there blocks production of prostaglandins process icons and from balk scenes but this is the the whole pathway you can see if you block that path fee probably there's more substrate and down the opposite path we producing more look at rains and this is thought to be the mechanism why you here and exacerbations of asthma for patients who have sensitivity to non-steroidal this is probably a bit more information than we need them but this is just a diagram of how a non-selective a non-steroidal inhibits the enzyme and it's a small molecule we can get inside their booth cox-1 and cox-2 embark on a Kidani acid whereas crops - for example silicon of this crap there's a big molecule can get into cox-1 and but he can get into cox-2 and that's how it selectively differentiates between the two and you've had a bit this study about Rafa Crocs herb is a big study to look at the side effects of Rafa Crocs have compared to naproxen and this the main reason why they Rafa it was a withdrawing although that sure that there was less GI complications with the cox-2 inhibitor of aprox if there was a 4-time leg piece and myocardial infarction although the overall what I'll today was was similar it was eventually withdrawn and other nonsteroidals and cox-2 inhibitors also shown to have increased risk of myocardial infarction card our death but naproxen seems to be the exceptions for naproxen that appears to be is safe in that regard side effects role of a familiar with the side effects gastric complications reading I just mentioned coronary heart disease renal impairment bronchospasm and there's other miscellaneous things same guidelines would suggest that was moneth modern modest benefit patients with low back pain and musculoskeletal pain compared to placebo but the important thing is to consider gastrointestinal cardiac arrests before commencing is quite common to prescribe up proton pump inhibitor and there's no guidance on who should have a proton pump inhibitor to cover those throws but that generally if over 65 certainly should got a history of reflux or also GI symptoms we would and if you've been if you're prescribing the maximum those who's commonly ibuprofen see 400 milligrams but if you're given a 600 800 milligrams certainly give a proton pump inhibitor to cover that or for prolonged periods so if you're prescribing nonsteroidals for for several weeks and it certainly could prescribe a proton pump inhibitor and so what's on so there's lots of NSAIDs on the formula didn't list them all but the the preferred list includes these three ibuprofen let's get the lowest GI side-effect profile the non-selective NSAIDs and this is also one of the more useful ones from a pain point of view naproxen is at the lowest risk of cardiac events of someone on that long term and it's a useful one to consider the celecoxib as the as a selective cox-2 inhibitor on the preferred list although I'm generally reserved for patients with inflammatory joint conditions okay so milling to opiates to opiate or opioid opiate there's a naturally occurring occurring substance and opioid is a broader term which includes all all substances including since in synthetic ones we've all got an endogenous opioid system which is important for a number of functions yes all these functions so and it's important for a pin perception for sleep regulation stress gastrointestinal function your immune system helps you to Lam actually feel good gives you is important in controlling your appetite and so so although I didn't dare put a Google image on it's important porn and sexual function as well so instead ranges functions which can go of control if someone develops a problem with with opioid misuse so there are various opioid receptors and most of them regularly some analgesia new opioid receptors responsible for physical dependence no reason to mention the receptors there's a another type of opioid receptor called nociception it's berry similar to the classical clawed receptors but it has pool nociceptive and anti analgesic effect it's got ruling tones to opioids and it's a area which will be of interest probably quite far into the future and the treatment of pain and to do to develop nociception AG antagonists which hope hoping would with either treat pain on their own and help with treatment of tolerance or used together with an opioid to reduce the the overall those of an opioid so that there can end the pipeline for the future and tolerance is a big problem with opioid analgesics and Mister finders a decrease in the pharmacological response following repeated or prolong the administration it can be metabolic as and you tab lies the drug differently over time or can be functional they can be cellular mechanisms and adaptations which mean that the drug is less effective over time that may be internalization of receptors or changes within the cells themselves and it's just that a graph of what period receptor sensitivity over time and then there is a graph of tolerance and adult response so even after after a week there's Torrance will started to develop and you can still get the same response but to get the same response it needs to be a higher concentration of the of the drug that's one of the major drawbacks of of opioids most of the month ago phase 1 metabolism in the liver morphine doesn't the reason I mentioned metabolism is that them it can lead to polymorphisms of or inter-individual variability and the way things are metabolized particularly with codeine you beware of rapid metabolizers get quite good analgesic response to cooling and poor metabolizers get who around easy responsiveness is don't - a cytochrome p450 - two years and that enzyme is inhibited by ASUS our eyes so if someone with quite a lot of patients are on to tau from fluoxetine and that can interfere with heavy a metabolites and drugs excreted being released so metabolites which are an active and hydrophilic can lead to toxicity so morphine if someone's good we know feel more things probably quite a bad choice lipophilic drugs with an active metabolites are probably more effective or more appropriate okay these are the video I'm gonna just get past them okay so a desirable qualities about an opioid the one which from a chronic pain perspective a long-acting preparation and immediate release preparations are more prone to misuse and can increase your risk of they accelerate tolerance and dependence and we want one which is effective at a low dose and choose preparations which I have a low potential for from su so thanks to a long-acting tablets transdermal and certainly no injectable therapies the common preparations which you use a coding week opioid which I've mentioned has variable metabolism the head recording again we call power within the formulated tramadol is in the form early but it's not first-line it's got a separate mode of action which is noradrenaline reuptake inhibition enhance serotonin release which can be useful when you to Pathak ping MST and obviously cool down the power the mainstay of the strong opioids that we would use the morphine's chip to Everly dozing in reliable oxycodone has got better bioavailability than than MST other preparations issues transdermal preparations fentanyl again it's in the formula but not fast lane Bipin often view trans patches or some something which we will recommend fairly regularly probably less regularly now than we did but they are not and the the formula formula M attraction or using buprenorphine is that there are doses which are a you know that stronger than than what you would be able to offer and I we call pro but not as strong as as a full step the opioid to the skin of a nice middle ground and the transdermal was go so low low risk of a or low potential for misuse but that that has its own controversy cuz they're not they're not in the in the formulary and quite often who may suggest him and they're not being prescribed we can talk about that at the hint and depends at all as has been started and and lesser than the formula as a specialist initiation and that's um again it's got noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors if you can imagine it's a bit like trauma dog bite instead of being a step to upload as a step three opioid we've got a little bit of experience used in that and it's reserved for patients who have been on one been on at least two opioids before either MST and oxycontin on a misty and fentanyl and had problems either with them have been an effective or intolerable side effects and we've had probably about 30 to 40 percent success rate it was to pentathol and method 1.soak not something to use frequently at all it's got an extra effect has been an NMDA antagonist and by saying I don't have a lot of experience using using meth don't abuse occasionally to do use it and was it seeing the same guidelines does suggest we should be and using strong opioids they are considering them for patients who have a long-term painful condition such as low back pain and osteo arthritis but the important thing is to start them as trial on a trial basis only to continue them with us ongoing pain relief and involves regular review and the regular review needs to be a system in place to pick up the signs of misuse so we've in classical we've got the GGC opioid prescribing guideline which is available and the pinned at a-- website and i think it should have been the same if it's through primary care and it really reflects all of the stuff and the BPS guideline they all pros for proposition pink okay so moving on to other medications who've frequently used anticonvulsants useful when treating neuropathic pain which is the vein they're defined as pain resulting from a lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system broadly fall under two categories calcium channel blocker which gabapentin and the formulary feed to use and pre goblin again which is Anna for me but not Leslie there's been a frost line agent and the other broad category of sodium channel blockers of which carbamazepine is one which was occasionally occasionally used but mostly for treating trigeminal neuralgia so it's gabapentin there's no commonly used as superior possible as long as you're given daily doses of at least 1200 milligrams number needed she of 6.84 abroad to canopy of neuropathic pain conditions post petting your alger painful diabetic neuropathy and makes you to Pathak pin there is some evidence of benefit in fibromyalgia although there's no fun recommendation in this same guidelines under said it should be considered for patients with a neuropathic pain so broad broadly speaking it's a general neuropathic pain adverse effects aren't important things about adverse effects with gabapentin they often occur first before you get any analgesia and business somnolence or the common ones they get disturbances as possible but one that people were most worried about is swelling weak in peripheral with the amounts boat the incidents about spokes are eight to ten percent titrate it does be recommend two different titration regimes one would be East and 309 grams three times of the increasing Optimax of 3604 elderly or there are concerns about side effects a patient's worried about side effects we would see well let's start at 100 milligrams and Taichi up and up 100 milligrams steps pre Kaplan's very similar and take up a painting although it's more potent and they're possibly fewer side effects and it's been shown to be superior to placebo doses of 300 milligrams and above and it does is lordos is 150 milligrams is not as effective there's some evidence of benefit for patients with chronic pancreatitis that's a very difficult group of patients we could often see them at the the pain clinic and they're very difficult to treat and the there are some evidence coming out that the this may be a useful useful treatment and reducing the pain intense chronic pancreatitis and listed in the BNF is another indication of pre Goblin as generalized anxiety disorder and so that sometimes if I'm choosing between gabapentin pregabalin if someone that has generalized anxiety disorder which is not treated by other means made knows me to zero was try three carbons instead of the pies or foster adverse effects are very similar and again can I cut before you get up again or teaser just listen same guidelines recommended that it's useful for you know Pathak pain but not as fostering and also has a recommendation for treatment of fibromyalgia and the titration regime for assist start 75 milligrams twice daily and increase after seven days and you can start of the war and those is less than 150 are often not affected um antidepressants they broadly fall under three categories tricyclics which are mature to the north we know the ones who use the Moose as the SNR ice M which of which duloxetine as the drug of the Moon and SSRIs fluoxetine which is it's a classical one for using in fibromyalgia now it is the action of antidepressants is mainly due to the nor adrenergic effects rather than this sarah phonetic effects through the tricyclics and the snr ice appear to be more effective than it than the SAS alright these things not surprisingly could be a little benefit there for things like wall back pain the more useful in treatment and euro Pathak taping there is some benefit in five miles off with dry cycle kind of the presence and in particularly if those are a sleep disturbance as a major component of the fibromyalgia and that's finished probably most useful and as superior to possible and of a variety of neuropathic pain stings there's a I'm sure you know was a wide range of adverse effects with try psychic antidepressants and that's don't to multiple mechanisms of action that did not only blog reuptake of Nia means they also got calcium si sodium channels and they've got anticholinergic effects so there's a wide range of of side effects over the a long history of of safety and normal disease not Red Queen has got a better side effect profile than amitriptyline and if someone's has some benefit with amitriptyline good side effects are an issue often a switch turn off trip clean air can be helpful um same guidelines recommend we shouldn't be using them to treat a chronic low back pain but should be considered for five mile journey no Pathak pain and they've mentioned they all just said about no alternative tricyclics for example nortriptyline it can be appropriate to try and reduce the side-effect profile and we would normally have to again two titration regimes one standard ten milligrams and get up in ten milligram increments every three to seven days or once done at 25 and if you're worried about side effects or patients elderly we would go for the for the war titration schedule snr eyes and see there's probably a drug of the moment we could for the least experience with them compared to use an amateur clean and gabapentin and and there are new indications came out for the locks for the Hochstein similar all the time there's evidence of it's been effective a in chronic low back pain reserve and so we've been effective in five major and austin with riotous as well as neuropathic pain states and in the recent sign guidelines said it should be second a third lane for the info diabetic neuropathy but should be instead of a patient with fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis all this there's little of marketing approval for but for usin osteoarthritis as in in the guideline um who don't have a great deal of experience using it and osteoarthritis to see or our experiences I'm sure I have more information than I in the future titration regime for this is usually 30 or 60 milligrams up to a maximum of 120 in debated doses so there's lots of different agents which you can use for you know Pathak pin and really i wonder which which one would you go for first you could look at the same guidelines which suggest starting with hammer trypsin and gabapentin and then going for if that's not effective go for pre pre gobble in a second line the gabapentin if they're not effective trying duloxetine um all those nice guidelines which suggests you can offer the patient any one of amitriptyline gabapentin pregabalin what duloxetine in carbamazepine zone therefore really as fast lane for trigeminal neuralgia and of the guys on the clinic had different my take on it is um after the patients get significant sleep disturbance I'll probably pump for something which is hopefully going to give them a better quality of sleep so I'm a typically and if this generalized anxiety and I may go for a pre goblin or if the patient has in Compton untreated depression and you want to give a decent antidepressant mental oxygen maybe use useful it can be if you start treatment with another antidepressant and then add something different then you can probably endure with problems with interactions so that's how I would look at it and if a patient has trigeminal neuralgia would use carbonize of other agents which you can which you can use which you've talked about there topical agent such as lidocaine patches capsaicin and then these things at the bottom are for specialist and poops who I put opioids in there but you know for neuropathic pain we were thinking of putting something on to step three approach we probably like to see them before that happens contains a nipton a shear that in the in the hospital as I called you we'd be easy access to that a noodle modulation as we can get up obtains machine they were talking about advanced you know modulation there may be things like spinal cord stimulators which they we would refer to tell CDC I was before and then we spend too much on interactions just to mention the one that we all worry about is really serotonin syndrome and symptoms can be really mild to can have a bit of agitation headache and could be a bit sweaty and it may not actually be apparent as being a medication problem or a serotonin syndrome probably exists across the community and quite low levels you know if someone's on tramadol I'm a trip Sweden and citalopram they could quite easily have symptoms which could be put down for other things but could could be related to an increased level of serotonin so a simple thing to do is to if you consider it as to look at the medications and perhaps take one of the least effective ones off but it can obviously just be more severe than that in and it's positive must form can be severe life-threatening and so just to be careful when describing per heart multiple medications with a similar effect on on serotonin levels so rattled on about pharmacology painful for a while just like to summarize by seeing really it's only part of the overall management we would like to consider alternatives and non pharmacological therapy really before you're saying to the next level on the WH will be in like that I mean maybe we should be considering it more as a a pain platform telling your therapy to the individual can be useful can take time you know to get things just right but getting agent and for regular review be assessment and given them reassurance will help with that but all guidelines to take ADA's saying produced guidelines nice guidelines bps guidelines local guidelines and and most of the options which are available available to us are in the end there GGC formulary for you to use and if there's anything that's not then it should be available through us in the specialist pain service
