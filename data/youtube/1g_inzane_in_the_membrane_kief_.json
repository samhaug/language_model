{"bgb79lu5E0Y": "what's up we tube it's Mario wanna hear your Massachusetts home cultivator and today we are giving you a look at the insane and a membrane this train is from ethos genetics I personally bought these seeds and any cannabis convention I believe in Boston or Worcester like I said this stuff is super duper then this is something that I grew it definitely something I'll be crossing Australian with yes none guys thanks for liking sharing and subscribing it's greatly appreciated continue to grow along with me and grow big my friends and saying in the membrane", "UhtEo14_XQ4": "oh nothing wrong with that [ __ ] so we're back at our reciting man that makes any sense reduce Wizards they're just like what the putters that Eric's everyone's go-to Wow right that's my like 20-foot platter right there alright so today we're gonna try out the first phenome of the blood orange and I got something from Harborside that I felt smell kind of Tangier so I guess you could say that's what I was going to tell you like there was nothing in there that had attained juice no hmm so there's like kind of like kind of blew me off a little bit like I was kind of surprised it is too much [ __ ] ain't no one got the goods you know like we do insane is a membrane okay so it was a closest smelly one so was that insane was from barber side as well yep okay just like the last time I guess so we're doing two of them yeah yes they name is train after me I guess I know from harbors I I think it it's in there now yeah yeah yeah it's a packer Packard yeah stadium thirsty Steve yeah there was something before we did in the last time you like I thought so last week we did it cuz well I like I said I grabbed the - I don't know why I grabbed three I should describe - in the first place but I was like oh $100 off [ __ ] yeah otherwise you'd have to go back yeah you know wait so what's the name of the strain man Waymar beside these are also you don't have a string called arbors no oh we have two right oh okay the blood oranges from the DNA sorbet collection and I found the [ __ ] hot joint it has the dose it\u00f5s just the dose double stuff which is dou C go across the sorbet no sure really teenager okay which one is it well change it yet smells like insane remember this is the one that you thought smelled like it yes yeah I was like at Angie has a weinery fruit yeah kind of that orgy sour grape for what are you doing lady go lay down so we is that what order to cross of tangi in and the sorbet that's what it is okay I assume not I assume no one watches it actually you're really what happened I mean here's the reality though is asking because I'm so somebody recognized me from the show like on the street I went to a dispensary now the dispensary this guy kept looking at me he says no that's not that whatever my friend says hey Rudy look at this and the guy see it that's where I know you from I recognize that voice face - no [ __ ] man right or not your celebrity now a roadie let me see if I can parlay this into Tennyson there you go no he said he's uh looked at several shows and then I got it today I got a message for one of my prints he told me he looked at shows he really enjoys it okay did I saw that for the first time yesterday on the internet and I was like and now you have it but what the [ __ ] of the chances Mia's kind of we had ever even heard of the stream before until yesterday yeah [Music] [Laughter] what no dad it just won't close after eight thousand joints yeah well that's why I don't see it out here on the table so there you go well this is that ol Dirty Bastard yeah this is whoa oh yeah that sucks no work I guess oh wait a second so there's nothing Reds there's no threads yes so when you just kind of oh it's the turn and snap thing okay I see well that's actually pretty neat that this is stay closed well to the point where it's got so much buildup on it where it's like I use scissors now I just I use all my Brides was sitting over the corner all [ __ ] up exactly yeah that's so easy always two seconds in there they haven't done and then it's inconvenient your cuff so you just tuck tilton into your roll doesn't make it too funny no well that's why you don't sit there for ten seconds you with his weed yeah you're probably fine but the weed I was smoking in Sweden with the dust oh really [ __ ] you Swedes he didn't mean that yeah actually I was looking to see the hell of a research facility in Sweden dealing with cannabis oh [ __ ] Oh that'd be your turn sweet dude I heard behind your guy five people are no got hired by cannabis growing you know really five people I know they went to a symposium okay didn't they went to orientation Tunisian and they well they've like a weed jobs in here yeah and they got jobs one guy transport stuff thank you for coming here house to the grower do the job you got a job there you know at the prom they can't work yet they're not allowed to actually start we're no they're still building two of the buildings Wow place you see it was it was not in Detroit already Township mostly they have a cannabis park there I like yes surprisingly there was we went to meet him actually there's me and him went to this [ __ ] by the way we got Walmart we'd wait this lady we went to at the Sahara where the guy was there and he's the one that acted trans dude no the dude that was yeah but the dude that was that basically was the real estate guy oh yeah we've met the real estate guy that actually set that up whoa like his whole calm he basically boom was they started his company a couple years ago and that's what they do is they basically find green zone buildings get them an insult that's a pretty good gig right that's the place to do it gonna be working is right outside of Pontiac dude that's probably the 100 90 it does or a year well Pontiac itself has three green zones that are pretty decent it doesn't really I thought they were gonna be a lotta ranges on the entire loop the HUD tire inside yeah yeah she told me something this place used to be something else do to be a great spot for to spend write your score on saying I mean right in the dead center right cuz the Oakland Press buildings for sale right now for 2.7 million that's right there is no loop in 59 right yeah yeah they printed there's yeah in that zoned yeah dude they can be vertically integrated with your dispensary storefront at the same building that would be fun to learn we do like guided too easy [ __ ] that would be like a beer factory I'm sure they'd do that for founder's and [ __ ] like that all right I want to get this one over work yep has everyone got their scores I do I'm gonna start it cuz I'm not really doing this for the next one so you know this doesn't have much flavor but it's not horrible it doesn't have a strong tangi taste so it's not making me grossed out but at the same time it's a bit there in its growth it's not very tasty I don't taste much of it but that's just because you're right there's not much in there I didn't get much glad to get much either actually I geek I gave the same school you game fine yep Bruce I'm actually downgrading the whole point of right now I'll tell you why though we do seven seven I mean that's a good school I'm convinced it was an eight because I have chai tea in my mouth drinking a chai tea while I was sucking on this peppermints oh yeah so it's like peppermint dude but my really smooth like roasted chai tea yeah that's what I'm saying I was like it had a nutty taste but then again I have chai tea so I'm not judging it based on taste but I think it's smoked really smooth all right and I'm getting a pretty good high from it what do you think I gave it a six it's actually I'd say it's slightly above average it's got like a like a half tangi half og kind of taste to it like we're gonna see a little bit of earth yeah and you know I mean like that I mean if somebody passed it back to me I'd hit it again yeah I don't know if I'd buy it but see that's right what you give it don't break the cipher I gave it a six yeah yeah I mean I'm a guy and if users atiba leanings then that gets next you're bumping me but yeah I didn't really get a taste for something that's no this is yeah exactly that's the smell was stronger than the taste and that's that was my because if I'm gonna give him a tan go7 that's gonna have to be something the head it's like you said the og with it looking the complexity of the because there's like OD taste I know but if you have complexity with just if you just have straight tangents to me it's just overpowering like the 24k right yes like we know you hate that I don't hate it but I don't smoke it fair enough it's a weird Tirpitz tough to smoke a lot of my friends don't like Braden gets it all the time he loved whenever I get it I have to literally call Braden he's got this one guy that comes and gets it and then shows back up for the rest of it within you know right on and it's like whatever works the other right right that's the only time I smoke it is when he's like here and he you know passing me I'm sure to roll up and you know yeah that's it's great then cuz then it's like oh I get something new something different it's a different flavor but then I don't want to smoke the second one I just it's just me it's never on top of that I think I need a lot of mercy to get high yeah Mert yeah yeah there mercy there's no mercy in any other use kind of thing I feel like that's got a hair were seen in it it's a hair I'm mostly not that high right now no I should I should be weighed I think the u-19 yeah it's hard to judge the high doing this stuff though it really it is and I don't base a lot of them I don't base my score on the high I hope base my score on what I get on the flavor you're gonna taste in like you smell was better than the actual flavor if the flavor come through a little bit more money give us six very woodsy flavor to me a very nutty creme", "E5HmfY7jcxE": "[Music] hi guys welcome welcome welcome bettan here taking a look at my babies we're going to do a quick little review here on some insane in the membrane I picked this up at best buds I don't know if you guys can see oh goodness best buds t-shirt this is a dispensary I had not been in before it's cute little dispensary had a little bit of everything just like most of the dispensaries do I really like the way that they packaged this and it's childproof but their label actually has a section on it for and it's not going to pick up very good whether or not it's an indica or sativa or a hybrid cut the confusion simple as that cuts the confusion I really like that I wish everybody did that unfortunately yeah unfortunately it doesn't always happen sometimes I'll get on weed maps to find out whether or not it's a sativa and indica and it won't even be listed on the menu anymore because they don't have it in stock anymore well what am I supposed to do then guess I guess okay so let's light this up it's Friday night see how this looks there's a little bit of it I don't know well you guys can't even see it sorry hmm yeah anyways I mean it smells good alright this is a sativa where I'm trying try and see if it'll get me perked up a little bit not bad so tell me what you guys are doing tonight are you smoking on something are you dabbing are you using a distillate are you munching on something good tell me what you guys are doing in the little just comment section down below also if you haven't liked subscribed please do so I would appreciate it I would really appreciate it guys I'm having fun doing these and I'm always into trying something new but I seem to be going back to the same old stuff here lately because I found stuff that really works this plant right here believe it or not I started in a coffee cup in January this plant has been growing since January I found it which means hold on just you guys can see this but there are four stems on this there's one two three and then four and then down in between are several more that are popping up I found it I actually intended to top it yeah it actually turned out better than topping and then this baby back here that Cola oh she's Purdy that's about five inches that one actually was turning in a coffee cup too and then this was a Skywalker clone that I purchased at mom Paul's Kenna shop I made huge mistakes growing these plants and it being a brand new person growing yeah I made some huge mistakes some of the mistakes I made with these plants were not watering often enough because all I had read was don't over water don't over waters well I ended up under watering which caused them to not grow very fast I also did not feed them I'm only growing or I'm excuse me I'm only using the loca Coco Loco from eerie oaky and I didn't use really any fertilizer I just recently started using the general hydroponics three-part system and I can't really tell a difference because it's so late in the game to be giving them nutrients I think but I'm gonna see where it goes I have been feeding them and keeping them wet I don't know what stage I mean stage the flowering is in but I know that they look pretty for somebody who has no idea what they're supposed to look like they look good all right you guys I'm gonna wrap this up because I'm starting to COFF a little bit a little bit goes a long ways for me yeah she's out and I'm not going to relight it but that little bit right there was a lot for me so yeah it tasted good it looked good it smelled good I'm sorry I don't have any other information for you that's something that I feel like I'm not doing a very good job at in the reviews is actually having the information because I watch other people like from other states and they have an idea of what's in there you know it gives them some description of course like in Washington most the products or prepackaged so that stuff is all on the label it's not up to the dispensary to put that information on there this is coming straight from the dispensary I wish Oklahoma had some sort of system like that but you know I can't complain too much it's legal here and that's a major major major win for Oklahoma guys thank you for watching sorry for the ramblings we'll see you in the next video bye", "QPv-laaFs9U": "hey everybody yeah that's creations here and welcome back with regards to the channel there isn't really anything new taking calculus so I'm gonna have to slow down with the videos again I'm still gonna put out regular contact as I do but you know whenever I can other than that I had a pound sold for me so I'm not happy about that either but that that's more so personally that doesn't affect me and you know but for this video we're really just going to be talking about ethos genetics and my opinion about them as a company as a whole generally speaking I think they're a great company they've achieved a lot of success in the last couple of years since I first saw the mythtanic on I saw them carry on 2018 in Massachusetts and I purchased a few seed packs room and even right now right actually right next to where the cameras recorded an attempt of four movies in there which I'll show you but ethos genetics to me has always been a it's they're almost like Apple products for for cannabis seed people they the service presentation they have is phenomenal they're at almost every event they give out free packs all the time they have great user interaction on social media they produce obviously the most important thing they produce fire genetics the only issue I've ever had and which is why I say is sometimes you'll get a little bit of hermaphrodite strength like insane the membrane was one of those dreams where I talked to other people who were growing it and they had hermaphroditic characteristics meaning they expressed both male and female sexual traits which often results if you have exceeded bud which to the eyebrow is completely up I mean if you're hoping to make money off of it you're hoping it's okay you don't want to so there's that criticism but that to their defense ethos your guys's defense the process of making a seat feminized does increase the chances of mutations such as that like you know such as that happening there that's not even the only communication that there's like plant albinism there's there's parts of the planet that'll just randomly blowing nose like I'm haven't seen like a leaf just growing up this is because cannabis plants are mast cells meaning any of their cells could convert into whatever they need at any point which is why the chance for hermaphroditism even exists in case there's no males if there was ever a population where there were no males that one of the females will turn into a male still the role that's just how it grew it is a weed now what I'm going right now this is oral cut cookies and I really like this one a lot it's not I can already tell it's not going to have as much of the yield as the in Sangamon great but the way the notes look is how I want them to look their very trunked out very colorful I'm going to show you footage of that if I haven't already I'll should probably show you some more gonna do that who the [ __ ] cares but yeah overall I've been pretty happy with each ocean X now me personally I haven't been able to get the nose that huge yet but I chopped it up to my own user error I'm still kind of learning as a grower I am using Remo nutrients a couple of other supplementary brands as well but mostly Remo nutrients any you guys have advice to give some you know if so what's the secret they dig about them over to it I'm all ears and as for the [ __ ] that stole my pound you're an [ __ ] enjoy the video guys I hope you enjoyed the footage my criticism if you're thinking about buying because genetics I hope this video helped you a lot and if you haven't already smoked while watching this video that I hope you get hot right thank you", "h4iNPpz7h10": "34 thc uh i've already smoked one blunt of this literally like after picking apart the bud my [ __ ] fingers were like glued together i'm not gonna break this butt in half because this one's huge and beautiful but let me get another butt out of this bag and break it in half for you guys here's a good one let me put the christmas tree back okay oh did you hear that snap oh my god do you see how there's like a million crystals in there what the [ __ ] what am i smoking on guys look at that insane in the membrane i am so glad i have this weed uh i cannot wait to try it on camera shazam", "1PwwKxUL0AA": "all right welcome back everybody purpose of this video is to try to teach people how to determine female seeds for male seeds okay if you have feminized seeds they're female don't even try this okay so this is this what I learned a long long time ago I wouldn't say it's exactly 100% because it's up to you know your own discretion so there's a lot of human interference in there but it's about 90 95 percent accurate if you actually are really like really a you know quality controlled about I was gonna say anal whatever but you know if you're really anal about it and you really really really only go for strict strict looks then you can pull it off 100% okay but this is what I come up with okay the female seeds look look a lot like this okay and if you see these seeds here see how they have like a little top to them okay now if you were look to look on this top you'll see a perfect circle where's my camera okay you'll see perfect circles it kind of looks like a little volcano maybe something like that oh look what I just found out guys so my cameras over here but when I put things over here it gets blurry when I put things over here they become clear oh you look nice I can work see how blurry though we did just remember that when you guys are trying to show stuff you put it right in front of you camera is blurry if you put it over there look how clear so so that's a perfect circle in there and it's like the volcano shape okay so you want to look for on the top of the seeds you want it to have like a little Ridge it doesn't have to be that defined these are pictures so you completely understand what I'm talking about okay they're a little over exaggerated so you're gonna see a little bit of a climb with in the middle will be a perfect circle okay and that's where actually the seed attaches to the actual button okay so you can see the top of the seeds it's the round piece and then you'll have you know the the sides of the little volcano that you'll be able to see from the top it'll look like you know you know it look like puckering up and then you have a complete perfect circle in the center and then from the side you see will look something like this okay the male seeds have a smaller Ridge or no Ridge at all okay do not confuse male seeds with immature seeds okay these are immature seeds they're super flat on the top but you can tell they have not grown yet okay those are immature seeds okay they have not completely formed do not confuse this with a male seed okay now mind you this probably would have formed into a male seed although it is not fully matured yet but this is how a male seed will look see how it has a kind of slight bump to it okay let's go to a male seed okay see how it's got slightly kind of inclined raised okay see it but it's flat it is flat it looks like a but okay and there is a circle in there but the circle will not be perfect it will not be centered perfectly normally and it will be flat looking and look kind of like you know it'll be like that you have a circle and there will be a weird thing around it and they look like little bloodshot lines spitting out of it and they'll look like these seats here these are 100% sure for sure mail seeds okay no doubt in my mind so this is just the easy way and I went through a whole bunch of different seeds to find males from females but um it's just an easy way if you're going through stuff like this and you want to find female and male seeds okay yeah yeah yeah that's a lot of seeds I got a couple of these okay I'm sure all you do to these right here people these are all skunk baby all skunk you see there's some immature ones in there blah blah blah whatever but yeah that's what these are so I hope this helps you guys you can determine your seeds a lot faster before you ever stick them in the dirt okay so try this technique out you know give me feedback see if it works for you works for me I know mother nature it also does this way works for her that's how we do it you know and like I said it's all up to human discretion you know you might look at you might look at a seed and say on all about by what he was saying that that might be a male but that's a female female seed perfectly round circle with the but you know the volcano look to it okay male seed are me female seed pardon me okay that's how we do it see that male seed see that you can see the volcano to it but look how flat it is okay male seed so I hope this guys this helps you guys I just thought I'd make this real quick while I was doing the harvest I forgot I had told somebody I was gonna make this for them so hopefully they watch this and you know pick up a future a few tricks are just bit my tongue so now I'm gonna get back to harvesting people so have a good evening", "Mzdkqa7za3s": "hey everybody welcome back it's Master\nBlaster and we're at Johnny's and today instead of blasting bud like we usually\ndo we're gonna have some fun and we're gonna blast some Keef we don't do this\ntoo often this is a nice canuk cookies Keef very powerful so let's get started\nwe're gonna fill up our extraction tube with it this always makes for good\nquality shatter you guys okay as you can see that's pretty compacted in there\nand it will be if you ever try this you guys you should never ever ohhhhhh alright\nguys we've got our tube filled here I just want to say if you're ever gonna do\nthis this is basically like a solid plug in here so you can't use coffee filters\nyou should either use some steel mesh filters or strong nylon filters these\nare a hundred and sixty microns were gonna slap these on and we're\ngonna go outside and blast this alright everybody we're outside we're ready to\nblast this Keef and just remember everyone this is not like blasting bud\nit's gonna be a lot more pressure in this - so we're gonna activate our green\nmachine let it do the extraction for us and we're gonna walk away at a safe\ndistance and watch this alright everyone here we go check it out you guys look at\nhow dark yellow that is wow that's gonna be powerful that's looking good all\nright you guys we're outside now and we're just boiling off our butane liquid\nthat we've blasted our Keith with soon as this evaporates our going to throw it\ninto the vac oven alright guys we finished boiling off our\nKeif here we blasted the Kief and we boiled it down this is what left is left\nand now we're going to throw it in the vac oven all right you guys we're back and we\njust pulled these concentrates out of the vac purge oven on my left here this\nwas our keif we blasted and this was regular bud and there doesn't really\nlook like there's too much difference so I'm going to give each one a little\ntaste test for you and see how that goes ok  you guys we're gonna start off by\ntasting this shatter just heated this up here we go oh that was very tasty this is to keef\nblast here let's try this you know what they are so similar you\nguys I can't believe it I could almost hardly tell the\ndifference so it goes to show that blasting your bud is probably just as\ngood as blasting you're Keef okay everybody the channels growing a little\nbit and we appreciate it so much we're starting to get subscribers from\naround the world now so we just want to give a big thank you to all our\nsubscribers and I'm just gonna mention a couple names here that keep in personal\ncontact with us all the time and that's Andy from Sweden

and one more from the US we have the green snapper and green\nsnapper I know last year you made a suggestion on to blast Keif well\nbuddy we finally did it for you okay everybody thanks so much thumbs up\nsubscribe peace and we'll see you in our next couple videos I'm thinking maybe\nwe'll do a cloning one and we might even be doing something totally different\nlike blasting some mint leaves or some sort of herb  ok guys", "kBu2G1-upTU": "okay so if they were making hash bricks have two bowls 47 grams of Bruce Banner keep two bowls of 45 grams gold and ice aluminum brick and a couple of these parchment pieces brick is presses a brick of hash perfectly take a spoon take our key oh my cause on us so very pretty stuff press it down press it into the corners to the edges gently this is a fluffy Keith takes up a lot more space than it usually does and every strain is different can you grab me a business card kind of just flatten it out on the top roll around the edges this is because you want to be able to tuck your parchment into these edges nice type of cover battle machine in search ii parchment drop the top of the brick very carefully say you know ship the parchment around we lost about a third of a gram right there but such as like things happen give it a good squeeze we're gonna wrap it a couple of sheets of paper towel and we were going through our vise Jimmy because it will not fit into our press unless we clamp it with everybody so I'll be back in just a minute one all right so we're starting with our brick this thick and we are going to squeeze it down until it is about half as thick squeeze it hand tighten the vise at room temp flip it over just so this is even as we can make it and then it's back to the heat press it's now that thick so we have our heat press heated up to 105 degrees ours only presses on the bottom so we have to keep it sealed to get heat to transfer to the top and because it only heats on the bottom we're gonna take the thick chunk of our plate and put that on the bottom that's where most of the heat needs to penetrate this top plate is much thinner and much easier for heat to just pass right through so it'll go on the top side which is warm but doesn't have the doesn't have the extra power that the bottom side has this will lose its heat very quickly we only have it up to 105 degrees because we don't want to squeeze our our hash out through the sides this will want to retain a nice brick form we wanted to only really hash over on the outer layers and have the inside remained remain as a pristine as possible so before I run and I want to show you what it looks like well I guess I can't this papers aren't your type it was very tan yeah it's a very blonde and yellow when we put it in open the press fixing it on the bottom Center it in the press lever shut I always forget yeah to make sure it's nothing it's not squeezing too far give about 15 seconds and then you're gonna pull it out and it should be a darker color with a really nice gummy consistency something kind of like oh I don't know yeah something like that now these little blocks often get stuck if they do you can use where's my little rubber string use one of these little things to get up in there kind of force the park I didn't take a lot did it down to parchment one does two fingers push it down a little bit the other side two fingers in the corner and fold it up okay very clean you get a look closely camera yeah not a lot of residue at all it's good brick has been sufficiently cooked trim up the edges a little should you do that with a knife but don't want to cut your little papers cuz these things take forever to make and there you go oh wow yeah break a hash and a consistency go a little lower with your hands there you go oh yeah what kind of smell would you just go coming off that very high and carry off lean carry a filing tomato tomahto very high in Mersin kinda like cheesy mm-hmm grandma's Bistro mouth mm-hmm yes that's how we make a hash brick awesome and then for chopping so plate clean this is for chopping we just have it Oh first we should weigh it we going wreck it this brick weighs 47 grams pretty much every brick weighs 47 I'm sure those chocolate we I set it long ways yeah something like that tell is epic and then yeah it's chopped but we want to do that here at here as well yeah thanks a lot elbow grease doesn't it oh yeah whole lot of love goes into this product if you are a consumer and we're unaware takes me a whole lot of blood sweat and tears to make your tasty hash there's no real blood here but yeah hopefully no sweat yeah making some nice tootsie rolls huh yeah this stuff stuff is quite gummy it's very easy sometimes it's kind of powdery doesn't want to cut up very easy every stream behaves differently and also ending on how old it is how cold it is ki prefers to be cooled and also just the different temperatures at which you press this break out if you use no heat it will not really form up into this gummy consistency a more powdery want to fall right apart to use too much heat it'll turn black nasty and might squeeze up out the sides of your press all sorts of problems this looks like chocolate doesn't so yeah break me off a piece of that fat hash bar seriously oh yeah a little farther down there yeah beautimous ha and yeah that's how we make it that's how we make it

by lime themselves um so any case yeah i'm curious about them though um i want to see what's going on i'm always curious about what's in joints and whatnot and the difference is today they actually included a little like a flyer i guess a little marketing thing here that kind of says what they're about so it's lime preroll zero trim zero shake lime pre rolls are packed with 100 california flower only never shake and then looking on this it's like they've got whole nugs on here which i haven't really seen in any pre-roll outside of in el blento so i'm curious if that's what's going to match up in here and i was also like is this the same joint that i have looking on here it's like probably because it looks like they might have changed up the packaging slightly but i believe this is the same j so in any case let's go ahead and pop this thing open and see what's in here see what lime is about they wanted to give me their little spiel which i will reach out to them and get but you know i mean i don't do that with other prerolls i don't necessarily get like the pitch or any of the marketing info before i open them and look at them so i figured it'd be just fair to open it up and check it out you know and we're gonna find out together what's good in here what i'm finding out now is this plastic it's pretty tough all right cool we'll move that and the lid just jumps right off and there we go that's what's inside this is just a regular flower one no infusion oh i didn't even go over the tube itself and i got so caught up in all this marketing stuff here so here's the information we're all curious about before i get in there lime hybrid pre-roll ignite inhale and enjoy uh there's the batch information thc coming out to 19.71 percent source broadway alliance and a little bit of a cbd in there and uh that's about it manufactured packaged on 924 so not too old a little over a month at this point but relatively fresh government warning there hybrid 100 california lime and it's shining so it's a little out of focus but yeah i think that's all the information there all right follow the vibes that let me lime all right so there we go all right so let's get into this j and see what's up in here another one of these veins here as i saw on the last j interesting i don't know what's going on there somebody mentioned in the comments that it could just be uh something to go that it's like the seal of the raw cone i guess but yeah i really haven't seen that let's go ahead i don't even know if this is actually a raw but it looks like it let's do a crutch check it looks a little weak not the weakest though still standing on its own feels decent not crazy tight at the top so that's all right um but yeah let's cut this open i don't expect we're gonna see nugs in here if we do that's gonna be pretty crazy i don't even know how you roll a j like that but uh no shake no trim according to this little square here so let's cut this open and see what's inside because i have a feeling that this i mean that it's not a bunch of nuts you know i mean that's just my feeling but all right here we go let me go ahead and drop this out of here real quick and there we go and i'm seeing some i've got a little material jumped out at me there but i am seeing some passengers already quite a big offender here actually right out the top i don't know how he survived the packing process because that seems fairly significant but yeah we've got a few other ones in here looks like basically these sugar leaf stems and whatnot a lot smaller ones but this one was just like he jumped out thing right at the top i didn't get a dry pool on that but let me go ahead and get a sniff on this material but there's a good amount of sugar leaf in here let me see smells decent i mean it smells like outdoor to me that's what i would say this is for sure um i mean lime can chime in and let us know but i'm really just getting kind of a planty smell off of it it's yeah it's not really anything distinct maybe a little bit of mint but not too heavy so that's pretty much it um not looking horrible not looking awesome definitely not looking like this promotion um so yeah i mean i'm gonna say this thing definitely was not cherry picked for me so that is what's in there so yeah not not awesome not i don't like to see this especially though that is huge and it looks like there's maybe a couple other guys here that i can i mean it doesn't take me much time to find them so that's we're getting there but all right let's check the weight here but uh yeah not too stoked on this so far and let's see now the caveat about the skill is always that it could be off by a point so if this comes up to point nine or higher then we're okay so let me go ahead and get it teared out over here get you guys over to the scale when i collect some of this all right there we go zero this out there boom cool so yeah so if we come to 0.9 or higher then we're good there but i'm just not too stoked on this material you know uh it's not atypical to see something like this in a pre-roll but it's not something that i would i mean i would make a little poster about it talking about how we only use awesome nugs and then show a picture of that like that's what's going to be in there but there we go it comes up to a gram so it's probably at 1.1 there is a little bit that i didn't even manage to get in there because it kind of exploded onto my counter when i opened it up but it's like you know the material weighs out so yeah uh you know i don't know i don't know how i feel about it it's not the greatest i wish i knew the ticket off the top of my head i would say if this is sub 10 bucks then it's par for the course but not something i'd be stoked about so that's what's in there and now you know", "0YBA3ljcRwU": "it's mrs. and Oberoi just got to give you a quick video today's day 52 so let's take a look get some big ones here they really set my stack up nice nice and Cod dense I guess the board they look really good really good who sticks I'm telling you they really help they really did some of these babies down and yeah that was so solo up really nicely sat in the bud so you can see how the crystals looking really good all right just wanted to give you a quick look of day 52 have a good weekend guys", "o-9nPcTithM": "okay cool so today in the name of what's in my pre-roll we've got this one gram birthday cake joint from circles so this is part of my e's joint grab they put some money in my account after a while that's what happens with these if you don't order they throw like 20 bucks in there trying to tempt you back so i made the best use of it that i could and just bought a bunch of js so this is one of them and this is the ease house brand as far as i can tell anyway um a little while ago a bunch of this circle stuff just started popping up on ease never seen it anywhere else so i assume it's their one of their house offerings but uh yeah let's go ahead and just jump into this and see what's good so we've got circles there indica and it looks like this down here is gonna be the testing information so let's take a look alright so yeah something i did notice i didn't see it here before but uh circles dash loud pack so this is another loud pack uh effort uh they are it's like they've had their tentacles and everything you can buy different products with different names and then you look closer and you'll see powered by lab pack on there so um let's see so that's just i thought that was the testing info but i guess not so let's take a look around here so there's birthday cake here's some cultivation info 523 so a little older at this point um this is nine dollars out the no not out the door pre-tax so this is nine dollars pre-tax just skating in under uh under that ten dollar mark but not after tax unfortunately and the batch they're easy so kind of makes me feel like that that this is an ease effort a an ease loud pack effort because as you can see they're powered by loud pack birthday cake and so at this point we're looking at about seven months old well a little bit before that six to seven six and a half months more or less so yeah not too great there's the government warning they're always watching so we'll see how this holds up this is on the cheaper side 1g as you can see there um but yeah i'm not exactly sure what to expect oh there's the thc info testing out at 13.345 they went for that extra decimal place instead of just putting 13.35 on there but um yeah that's i mean that's low thc doesn't mean everything but it does mean something a little bit of cbd in there too so so yeah i assume this is probably greenhouse at best maybe outdoor so let's check it out together and see what's good here with the circles so yeah i think this is supposed to be a more affordable j for for the ease customer so i believe they're trying to get into the whole vertical integration thing um you know or get that going so good luck to them if that is the case this that i was just smelling the tube it smells like i don't know it smells like stew kind of like beef stew that's weird i never really smelled the tubes though so i won't comment on that let's do a quick crutch check here and see what's good uh so i can already see before i mess with this that there is some kind of wrinkle here so i'm guessing you guys go you can see it that probably that's the point where the crutch is weak and it looks like yeah pretty much the case so i'm guessing these are all machine packed and it's probably very tight fairly tight up here and looser as you go down so yeah i'm not sure what the tech used is probably just a knock box or something like that but whatever it was they didn't take care to pack the bottom first and then you know drop in the rest because yeah it's hard when you're mass filling j's you got to go with that it's like time is of the essence you know and this is probably fairly cheap material so yeah i mean it's to be expected with something in the said subtitle or price point i'm not trying to hate and here we go clipping our way down to the crutch taking a moment of zen a deep breath exhale and that's the end of the j and there we go so that's the material inside yeah not looking stellar i mean nothing out of the ordinary though for a sub 10 j pre-tax um i mean right off the bat i can say i wouldn't be like stoked and there's it seems kind of sloppy too because you can see there's [ __ ] in the crutch there some i don't know yeah it's again i can't be too critical because it is very cheap or it's attempting to be cheap it's not that cheap considering that you could go to jungle boys you'd have to drive there you couldn't get it delivered and if you have your medical card you get a j that's usually over packed and weigh generally or generously for uh like 16 bucks out the door so for six more dollars you could be getting you know like a g and a half of nice indoor not guaranteed you'd still get a g guaranteed but uh but yeah just from what i've seen so anyway enough about that let's talk about this joint as you can see there's already a passenger hanging out there plain as day don't even have to go dig in trying to get a zoom in there on it there we go so yeah there he is didn't even have to get my pickaxe out didn't have to [ __ ] spend a lot of time we already find a fairly major first offender but again this is probably greenhouse at best so imagine that it's filled with that and that's probably just a bigger piece but you know this stuff looks really ground down not as finely ground is a lot of other stuff so i guess i can't hate but as i run my fingers through you can definitely pick up here's another one right there pick up on a few stems here and there my fingers are fairly keefed up though so maybe the material wasn't too bad um i'm gonna go ahead and set this back down you guys can take a look see if you see anything while i get a sniff on these grinds and then we'll go for the way and see what's up does have like a kind of pleasant freshness of mint i would say there but uh not really picking up on a lot of other smells i didn't do a dry pool my bad i should have but yeah that's pretty much it's like a musty mint but more minty than must maybe a slight hint of sweetness in there but nothing fantastic not super gross uh it doesn't look as bad as i would say the material looks but nothing really potent nothing to write home about basically par for the course when you're looking at a j of this uh price range so anyway let's go ahead and get this scale going kind of clean up this area so we can do that all right turn this bad boy on i got stickers all over the place now there's one stuck to my freaking hand all right let me get that off there all right so here we go moving you guys over to the scale so you can get a better view on that there it is all right can you see it not exactly let me adjust here there we go let's zoom out just a little bit here and there is a good view on it so let's go ahead and get this going zero that out still not zeroed there we go and i'll put my sticker there just for fun and here we go let's see so if this comes up to point nine or more it's accurate on the way material is not super stellar but whatever you know it is what it is when you're playing in that sub 10 range coming out to a g exactly 0.9 rolling back so yeah it's a g i mean there's a little dust left on the paper but i'm gonna give it to him whatever it's uh it is what it is so i mean if you come across this and you like it you know for the price point then fine go for it i've probably saved my pennies i may go to jungle boys like i was saying earlier or just find another j that's of a little higher quality for sure indoor i mean even at catalyst like fresh baked js or 18 bucks so it's like you're not really saving a whole lot when you consider tax what you are saving is a trip to the store though so maybe that's worth the convenience but that's what's inside circles you get a technical pass but i would say i'd give this if i had to letter grade it which i've been doing weirdly on the japanese grading scale this gets like a b maybe um definitely nowhere near s rank but it passes so there you go", "h-sNabzRd1M": "[Music] what's up y'all this is dr. greenthumb it's not

what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna just tell you about it you know I'm saying because a lot of people are curious alright um first of all it's an OG straight up OG Kush and no no cross it's one of our

insane so um the latest test that we had on it you know it tested let's see twenty twenty point twenty four point seven for Delta 9 THC and for THC OS twenty one point twenty seven percent no I'm saying and it tested clean as it should test clean because we don't [ __ ] around CBD levels 0.6 and the tetrahydrocannabinol total potential twelve point seven milligrams going out to one point

definitely told you about a nameless genetics celeb vote G you know in a number of them we just did the Alpha og which was also [ __ ] awesome so you know there's a lot of great OGIS out there and I would like to think and and buy some of what the fans say this is one of the top I mean so if you haven't had some insane OG you should definitely try it if you're in Los Angeles you can go to CHR and most times they have it right now they're sold out but we're about to restock them in just a minute there's not so much I could say about this particular strain we've been doing this a very long time and and you know we've you know honed in on our craft on producing strains this insane og is one of the top shut the [ __ ] up sorry guys sometimes that happens in the temple no people smell this weed down here and they want some and their goal crazy up in the treehouse because you know they're like he's not even doing a spring review menu just telling people about the weed why can't we just go down there and share it with him no one day guys one day but anyway I just wanted to you know check in and let you know about this insane OG no I'm sad and go to odd and the insane oh gee Instagram and check out what shops are carrying it where you get it and along with the concentrates get run with it on top of the line [ __ ] you know I'm saying and you the facts the the people who have actually tried it can actually tell us how many thumbs up you think it should be for you guys who haven't tried it just shut the [ __ ] up with your outside [ __ ] cuz you ain't even really say

the jar and you look at these Nuggets and it's a nicely fresh batch of this [ __ ] it's like a snow-capped Mountain you know I'm saying there's so much frost in this [ __ ] [ __ ] right here and

you know though non-compliant and whatnot but I got to tell you this [ __ ] is flavor anything that you get from seed junkie genetics if the farm is right and the farm is tight everything is gonna be alright this [ __ ] is so pungent so flavorful and it does have that cake flavor when you know on the exhale even on the inhale if you take like little hits not not big pressure hits like Jeff Spicoli hits where you [ __ ] take a hit and half the join is gone in like five seconds now if you if you take a slow hit low pressure savor the flavor neighbor because this [ __ ] is fire and look if you close up if you get it close up on this here joint you will notice the white ash popping so clean so nice such a great burn on this 10 mill funky field tip that's all we roll on glass tips over here

[Music]", "CMIUegZZcZs": "hello senior stoner fans is the real senior stoner back at you for a instructional session on how to make Jimmy joins I'm gonna be rolling eight so I'm gonna be using two cans and here's what we use in addition to that if you don't already know we use easy wider one and a half gold only we use THC distill it this is Applejack we use vaping it extracts moon rocks farmers reserve out of Mendocino County we use Keef custom-made for me diesel and we use what I call dry sift moon rock dry sift diamonds I have these made for me they are dry so I can crumble them into my Jimmy joint the first indica strain we're gonna use is King Louie King Louie's one of my favorites this was actually collected in January this is very very fresh flower but I want you to take a look at it and remember I told you my evaluation process from flower so let's go do it before I roll I inspect and the inspection process goes the following way I like to verify what I'm getting at all times I think it's very important so I put everything I buy under light with a magnification of tent and it frankly helps helps mid mrs. stoner understand the cost factor in better weed and really understand that we're getting what we're paying for take a look these bugs have some of the prettiest red hairs on them that I've seen in a long time okay so this is gonna be the first bug we're gonna use and what I like to do is put it up kind of so I know what's going on and then take a very close inspection with my tweezer light okay this bud is for you is what the said to me now what I do is go with the process here's the process distill it gets rolled on the following way you hold the paper with your finger and then right next to your finger touch the table then go all the way to the end so you're basically leaving enough room for you to take and use it as roach because it's gonna drip down you know distill it really melts into the joint that's why I like to use it a lot but you don't want to use too much distill it use about 1/10 of a gram of distill it in each joint and I'm gonna show you what a line looks like that's a line of distill it you see it what I encourage you to do is play with your own formula you might not need joints as strong as I roll them you know because I put so much into them it increases my per joint cost obviously now these cans are nitrogen sealed for freshness the brand is Queen of Hearts you can look it up the very popular commercially available brand but they've got a lot of traction that's why I use them they've got a lot of traction they've got a lot of credibility they've got a lot to lose so they really have to do their homework when they're adding streams and such because those of us who are queen-of-hearts people we know the streams we like we know the strains we don't like it's not as simple as just discontinuing something so now what I do is I take the buds and hand crumble them and when I say hand crumble I mean hand crumble this is not a time for a grinder I've really perfected these joints to another level and just so you can see this is the texture I like to get the flour to like to get it to that texture let's proceed it's gonna take me a little while to roll up eight but I want you to see the concept the concept is everything gets done the same way to every single joint that is really the key to the Jimmy joint is that I make them all great okay now I only go one way in Jimmy joints that's up what I mean is I only add to the formula I never take away I would never call just the joint of marijuana Oh Jimmy toid you Jimmy's way it's a very very specialized item frankly it should give you the effect of a vape pen a bomb and a DAB rig all in one just watching mrs. stoner smoking Jimmy joint at night sometimes it's very gratifying to see how medicated she gets just not a few hits not like taking a few hits of a regular joint I've made in that way I think what we're gonna do is we're gonna roll for for you guys because rolling eight might just take too long and I'll make you suffer through the video I don't want to make you all do that but let's look closely once they move my hands and what I've done here let's move closely let's get in a little bit here here we go okay so can you now see up on it a little bit better I'll move that and you see where the weed is how the flower now is equal I have equal amount of hand hand ground flower okay now remember historically what I would do with it Jimmy joints is I would have flour mixed already in Jimmy joint mixture and add that in since I started using Queen of Hearts flour there's really no need to do that this flour is already Emeralds best kicked up a notch flour honestly I've never had any better no matter what strain I get it's just magnificent the Queen of Hearts let's go into the next part next part is our moon rock now with a moon rock it's a really unique process you almost just want to wave it over it I'm very serious about that moon rocks are really hard to come by the real ones so you want to just get a little taste of moon rock into each joint a crumb of moon rock I went to Amsterdam once make a long story short - the cannabis cup with a buddy of mine we were judges and I brought about a gram of hash back I was so scared to bring stuff back I made that gram of hash last year's years I was putting a grain a little grain into joints here's my teeth what I do with the Keith is basically a pinch a pinch spread out over the whole joint a pitch spread out over the whole joint a pinch spread out over the whole joint a pitch spread out of the whole joint you do it the same every single time that is the key to Jimmy joint consistency now what I do is I go into the diamonds the dry diamonds and I put some on my finger don't laugh and then I crumble them into each joint individually so it's like a powder it's like a very fine dust that gets into the joints now what happens is when you smoke that dust you're basically smoking solid dab that make any sense so I mean we're talking about really strong joints because I put a lot of dust in roll that up safely but then what you do obviously is take the joint make sure everything is in its proper place now remember you put diamonds on this thing you gotta be more careful than you would be with just a regular joint you don't want the diamonds falling out so you try to crimp the sides as best you can and roll these are one gram or 1 point 1 gram joints with all the other things added in they come out pretty thick we do the same thing and repeat it and move on the key once again is consistency you know one of the things I don't like having to do is reaching into my joints and worrying about which one I'm gonna get oh did I get the strong so for me it's about knowing they're all the same in terms of potency they're going to taste different because I use different strings I'll use the brand Queen of Hearts but I do use different strains this is an indica roll I will I will roll indica heaviest I'll make a 10 or 20 roll indica then I'll do a 6 to 8 roll sativa and a 3 to 5 roll hybrid keep them in a different pouch so they're easy to distinguish the buds look really different between sativa and indica it's really cool when you start rolling different strains like that when you go from indica sativa it's really an interesting feeling and your fingers because the buds actually feel different when you crumble them you know the size of the buds are different it's a very interesting process I encourage you to think about rolling in bulk you're rolling more than a few joints at one time it's more efficient for your time it really lets you put your ingredients out in front of you that know what's going into every joint consistently hope you enjoyed this Jimi joint demo haven't done one in a while for you all it's a real senior stoner have a great day out there Cheers", "KuvCwFELKMc": "what's up what's up billy tcs fam today we have another [ __ ] smoke video for you guys it's the unboxing for the molino glass available at www.melenoglass.com we have the double chamber bomb guys this is [ __ ] insane stemless

absolutely insane i don't really want to talk too much more but i have a bowl here packed and full of keef i thought [ __ ] it let's just get lit and try this bad boy out and see if it you know lives up to what it actually looks like this looks like a [ __ ] beast and i'm sure it's gonna smoke like one let's get it [Music] [ __ ] [Music] yes", "eYobbQTJRQ4": "hey everybody me again okay it's creations here and welcome back to another video so for tonight we're doing another episode of pack pick up which is my regular series in which we go over the types of weed I picked up recently and I just show it off to you for you guys to enjoy you get it I get it we both get to look at someone's videos it's overall good time um feel free to share your own experiences in the comments about what you you've you know seen from your area whether it be better whether it be worse I'm from a medicinal state where we don't have dispensaries yet but it's still medicinal illegal so I am NOT surprised if you've seen better or you know maybe it is the best you've seen in a while who knows but I appreciate your input then you know nonetheless regardless whichever you prefer and let's just continue out of the video Oh before I forget don't forget we have a giveaway happening at a thousand subscribers I'm giving away a free pipe by liberty 503 Glocks American blowers they're really nice stuff I got a sasquatch bite featured it on my Instagram if you haven't already you know seeing it Caleb's creations on Instagram - be sure to follow me there - doesn't hurt you got some even nicer pictures than what I generally post on on my YouTube account but I digress so for for this video we're going to be looking at the punch barrier I got recently which I'll show a few videos on on the screen right now it is a beautifully purple blood purple as I've seen in a while especially locally I know for a fact that these came out of Cali I got somebody shipped them up here and eventually found its way to me I I don't often see purple like this and last time I did was almost a year ago of blackberry cush and this is just far more vibrant and a purple than even then it do have to say and to top that off I even threw on for this bull pack I'm about to take a route for y'all I threw on my own right you know brand of solidness hash you know bubble hash 90 microns specifically of the insane in the membrane and this is something I managed to learn how to do recently I wish I recorded my learning process for you know record with you just to show you but um fortunately I didn't do it at the time I will for next time I promise I have a form cut cookies growing in my veg tent right now that's probably gonna be the next one that's gonna flower and be able to make hash with I'll be sure to you know share it with you guys make sure you do it with me and you know we will get high along the way together so let's start off um so there's this this bold red you're about to see me take a hit of normally but this ideal to do with bubble hash is to and well for the lower grade ones it's okay to put it with your wheat and smoke it as normally but ideally the goal for both hashes to be damned because you know you want the saltiness you want the oils you don't want any of the particulate matter getting caught in there you want any of it being burned and the epitome of that is to have a full melt bubble hash something that doesn't leave anything behind and something that leaves you getting a really nice medicated feeling or high feeling whether you're recreational or medicinal by the way I don't judge I'm recreational so that's high for me anyway cheers y'all hope you get a chance to take a hit with me thank you for joining me again for this episode of pack pickup I hope you enjoyed the footage let me know if you liked it mmm feel free to leave any input on what you think I should do for the rest of my videos thank you so much Cheers [Music] so going so I love about hash it kind of like catches like incense you could hit it just like that just off the smoke it's really different I do recommend people trying hash if they get the chance of not making it yourself if it's not available in your area don't feel bad I had to make mines I had to grow my weed those for you who are familiar with my channel I had to grow my weed just so I could be able to figure out how to do this it's not really economical for you to be practicing with wheat you buy unfortunately you can only practice on wheat you grow yourself if you don't want to dig deep holes in your pockets nobody could afford to experiment like that that's too consuming but people tend to forget that neither the renewable resource it grows for practically free and once you are this source it doesn't really cost you more than the electricity and nutrients that you use I wish I've been growing for almost a year now and I haven't even finished one of those bottles I've been using these 1 liter bottles I swear to God it's pretty efficient once you start growing yourself and I recommend it for anybody out there watching this video right now I'm serious if you want to know how to do everything yourself the only way to do it is to do it yourself and you can't expect Pete one day like weeds just gonna be legal in your area and all this information it becomes available well guess what and everyone's gonna be learning just as fast as you are and they're gonna be people like like the Pete the guy who did everything himself he's gonna already know what to do and he's gonna get the job first that's what my job is well not job as my goal is that's when I do a job I'm hoping to have in the future and honestly I wish more people would take this mindset you know just just do things yourself learn yourself you don't need somebody to tell you to do it it helps to have other people's information you know open information out there to be able to share it with but ultimately you know you got to do things yourself so what I did myself was I drew the weed and I made the bubble and then I purchased the weed in which to throw on top of the bubble hash so you could kind of mix it in with that and it's been fun I really recommend it for everybody now I know I've been dragging this on a little bit too long so I'm just gonna cut the video right here thank you guys for listening me babble it's been really fun hope you guys are hi", "DVNSSHr--Yc": "[Music] [Music] [Music] what's going on guys my name is Jeff I'll stood on this platform welcome back to my channel if you've been here already if you're new I don't know what you're doing you better subscribe so you can get some more content in your life I've been posting two to three videos a week keeping the streak going hope you guys are enjoying let me know in the comments if there's any videos you want to see I always think you guys suggestions and that's what this video is all about somebody on my snapchat messaged me and asked me if I would break down this little grinder on my YouTube there's a lot more to it than you think I picked this up and I've been showing it off haven't talked too much about it the company's called like cubis or quipus qub us this looks pretty [ __ ] cool they advertise it as like an airtight smell proof [ __ ] alien great quality grinder and I've been really liking it at first I had mixed opinions on it because it is not like your traditional grinder but it has enough unique qualities to it that made me keep coming back to it and it's actually cut my new daily grinder this is my old grinder I loved it it's done a lot of good but recently it has gotten pushed aside the Cubist's or kumis I'm gonna call out the Cubist because it's a cube it's literally the same size as a rubik's cube actually which is partially what caught my attention to it now if your typical four stage grinder what I really liked about this is the compartment that holds your flour that has the screen that goes into your cave catcher can actually be removed from the grinder so that you can have a three piece grinder you'll have a bigger compartment for your flour and then you also don't have to have to keep compartment now don't get me wrong I love Keef actually like a lot of Keef in my day it gives me a [ __ ] but honestly it's not totally worth it to me anymore ever since that came out because keith was like if I'm trying to get like super lit just looks at Keef now it's like I'm trying it super lit I take blob so the point of Keith has kind of been replaced in my eyes but I keep having all these grinders with screens in them and then all of a sudden I just have holy [ __ ] like why didn't I just keep that with all the lead and I could have just enjoyed the weed a little bit more because that Keith does come from somewhere look how much you keep I have in this guy it's literally built to the brim I have this key thing like half built I just started using this grinder like three months ago so the last three months I collected that much Keef that is insane that that much gave it's just been thrown away from my weed so I prefer to have a bigger compartment to hold my weed and then you also have the Keef actually staying inside the flower also today I have a sick woven blunt rolled by my looming toxic iris it was a pre-rolled he made for me it was totally empty and then I just filled it with my own flower and today I'm smoking on some llamosa I'm a big fan of mimosa it's a nice daytime eye and just keeps you going and it's nice like uplifting like conversational high there's some strains that has no clue man I just do not want to talk after I smoke them but mosa is not one of those it definitely keeps the conversation going not a big fan of blunts but I'm making an exception because this one's woven so that's pretty cool has the little checkered pattern on it love these what about tips nothing I'd like to say about this it just looks cool it's one of a novelty thing there's no reason to only smoke one of them once it does the same thing as normal one which is better that better how about great guy I always have them so I got this rounder for free I hit the company up and asked him if I could try it out and show it off and they said yeah but I didn't like this at first because of the two magnets on the top when I was going to grind it it just felt really Jackie because I just kept going over the magnetic connector but then when I realized you needed to do would you flip it around and then once you give it like a 90 degree turn so the magnetic connector isn't touching anymore you have like a full 180 degrees to turn the grinder and actually get a nice sufficient grind out of it even though I am liking the grinder still I do admit it does not grind wheat as fast as the grinder I had in the past I don't know if it's the fact that the holes are a little too small well it's just not enough teeth but it just does not grind it enough just takes an extra 30 seconds to grind up your weed and if that's a deal-breaker for you you're gonna do one you seeing these things retail for like eighty two hundred dollars which is like your typical high quality American grinder price if you're buying a grinder for like $30 it's just not made out of the same grade of quality metals the fact that they say it's smelter if it's nice if you're leading in the car but if it is truly airtight that means it's also watertight so that means that I can submerge the schooling in water and it shouldn't leak through which I'm gonna try out right now first thing you pump the weed out but look how much more weed you can store when you get rid of a little compartment this tiny little thing can hardly hold any weed so sacrificing the key compartment to store more weed is totally worth it in my eyes you can probably fit like five to seven grams in the bottom compartment if you don't have the third stage of the grinder in there all right let me try not [ __ ] this up I try give you guys a little bit angle if I can so we have our water we have our grinder and we are going to fully submerge it then I'm going to smoke this so it doesn't go out see a couple air bubbles that's concerning me salty little ones it's probably not a big deal alright alright rant try this [ __ ] off hill we will decide it is completely dry so water did get into the crevices where the magnets are but these o-rings that connect it are strong enough that it did not leak into the grinder at all so I can confidently say that this is airtight and watertight not gonna lie did not know how I was going to go I'm very excited that it passed the water test and followed the company on Instagram a little bit and the owners just seemed like genuinely cool people which is another reason why I wanted to make this video definitely has a lot of great qualities to it one complaint is doesn't grant me the fastest if there's one thing I could change about it it would have more teeth so everyone grabs me we done faster these things are fully customizable but you can make like the middle black orange you can do like red red white and blue you can do anything you want almost at the end imagine you're like [ __ ] kayaking down a river and you flip your kayak and you're like bag goes underwater and you're like no but we drew it but then you realize you have this grinder and you're like yes no it's fine like I wouldn't even be worried than iconic look alright guys my battery's dying so I guess that's time to wrap the video up I hope you

materials viewer discretion is advised tonight on the weed connoisseur piece the trichomes from the bud the crystal the THC there's a lot of things that people call Keith we're gonna get into that tonight keith is a powder so you can troll or joint with it now you can roll a joint and sprinkle Keith along the top Keith if you did roll a joint would be too packed together you'd be pulling on it would be burning on the end it wouldn't come through best way to do it takes em in your fingers you roll it all up in a ball make a little meatball out of your key and you can do hot knives with these you can make a few of those put them in your pipe if it's going through your pipe a lot of people will make us bed I do a bag of weed and then I'll lay to keep on top so the Keith doesn't just get stuck directly into the pipe then it's a dust so you have to watch how you do it very fine not good for joint Keith is great if you want to roll it in little balls four blades or if you want to put it in pipes and getting big rip off that way a good way to collect teeth THC crystal whatever you want to call it slip your grinder you may notice that the bottom of your grinder there's a separate compartment and there's usually a screen on it that filters it all through so you'll have your bud in one area and then on the very bottom usually filter down and get your teeth you can emit collected in a pie plate like this it's a great way to do it you scrape it up you can use a razor blade now remember keith is very potent and will get you very high because it is the trichomes the crystal the THC that fell off your bud that you collected so it's no way and telling how much THC we're gonna have in this particular one so take it slow like anything is your first time or if you know what you're doing go nuts wait take a rip ring down I'm gonna use my favorite Gandalf the gray pipe today it I never used the balls and make a bed with this one it has a good small filter screen on it but it's still gonna get sucked through but I don't mind I let it get through it's the only thing I smoke with this is Keith and then when I am outside in the wind or anything it's all stuck in here so I can just smoke was filling it up cuz it's all taped in already all right that's low to little Keith up into the pipe here a nice healthy scoop call that Kiefer Sutherland all right [Music] whoo-hoo quit flipper quickly hit hmm I think I can save your time [Music] it's so potent we need to take a good Oh Keith feel it in your job it's a real the different Hall which you can tell you're getting really stuff now let's roll keeps Clippard okay so Keith to powder and we got some weed in here we're using red number one if you wanna know more red red number one you can check it out in episode number five here we'll dust the top of the joint well it went to a big ball and I could break that up just dust the top because like I said it's a lot of it's fine you don't want to put too much in there or won't burn correctly that's nice tuck that in a fine-looking specimen [Music] we got old key splits all rolled up here he's a fatty to give that keep it go okay let's get this under way we won't be doing that ever 225 to keep so we'll just have to tell you my thoughts so far my thoughts are I'm pretty baked already from the bomb rep and there's a pretty fat joint so I should be talking nonsense by the end of this now people used to say this isn't like the weed we smoked back in the day and that's just too potent nowadays people didn't know they were getting they put up seed in the ground they get a bag of somebody you don't know but just sativa you don't know if you're gonna be wide awake you don't know if it's gonna put you to sleep you'll be falling down like an indica you know maybe someone thought you should try weed to help your joints or whatever and then you got some crazy sativa and you didn't even notice that your joints were loose you know it's better now that's legalized you know we're doing it's tested regularly every year it's gonna get better it's just so much fun people used to talk about the spreading peace that's with it when you first got into this is all about the peace and love movement it's true how can you be mad it's very different from alcohol you drink in six beer six shots you can fight with somebody didn't nobody's fighting after smoking weed if you're fighting over the skittles look I remember when I first started kind of reminded me of the movie half baked to the scene where Jon Stewart's like you ever seen we gotta like what it was I remember smoking and thinking wow like what a nice cue to see the world through it's almost let go they are sunglasses you put on everything gets a little sunnier now all of a sudden that wanted to do everything already did but again he had Legoland John said I've never seen we personally be a gateway drug or anything I find people want to escape they'll do what's best for them maybe this wasn't strong enough and they went on to something else but for me I love a bit white go on I know what I love and I'll keep on loving it now let's finish this off one down for my final thoughts like you didn't hear enough of my today my final thought on teeth is collect all the teeth you can find something you love to smoke it in and continue to smoke it in it you will love Keith and it's a great end

we'll be taking clones these two areas here are desperately needing to be flipped as you can see they're overgrown in both areas so we're gonna do some take some quick cloning we'll be doing two techniques today over here now Myers hydro tent we'll be doing actually top topping when we're taking our clones and then over here we will be loudly popping and taking clones and cleaning up the bottom so hope you enjoy this week's absolute help date let me get my stuff and we'll get to it and raise the light up here just to even be able to take this shot they were so overgrown after last week's super cropping be right back sorry about that and video decided to pause on me for some odd reason but this in particular time we should be able to get you know a few clones up here will bolster up usually like at least a hands with my clones go ahead and I like to pull this skin back a little bit I'll trim these leaves back in a little bit probably cut it this year skin back just because we're gonna do some more toppings I'm not gonna beat that horse to death once again came to cut out on me sorry about this it's gonna hit pieces yeah so what we're gonna do now is just work our way with the established tapping height around the plant go ahead do a little bit of debriefing here let's make up not necessarily worried about ear getting it up in these because I'm gonna cut them a little bit higher so I can have baby you know we've got our topped up a little bit I'll go through and pop off some of these bigger families so the light can get right down in there lots of clones from this pine Bailey's I'm making sure take some because I've just got a gut instinct up we're really gonna love this dream we started out with eight we ended up with four females in this tent we're gonna end up with one one gallon one ten gallon pie which I'm sure is gonna kill it in the end under the smart hydro finish-up skin in these last couple girls here for you go back in and cut some of them leaves off later before we pop them into the corner which will be an icy corner in the scene same solution and Families because I'm sure will love this dream you know get the chance to get yours I got four he knows that I'm gonna take guts from all right now deleting when I go in and delete I like to pick spots like this the bigger leads on them that have already have an established branch I might take pills he's a big what was big grants will take that big branch everywhere there's a why I'm going to take those big leads and opener robbed and that's the way I like to defoliate and flour as well right around week three anything that's a leaf on the branch are on a bud bud site if there's just a branch or a bud with a leaf sticking out I'll let that go but if there's a branch with the leaf and it's not a bud I'll pop that off like you down in there really get in there and this she's gonna regrow all this in no time no time let's girl time she's gonna flower here I'll probably wait another day day and a half give her two days anything that's big and branch site or anything you know I'll probably come in trim not for clones just cleaning it up even though light is penetrating down that far I just want some big hulking bugs send all that energy up some so we'll probably clean up some of this probably up to about here I don't know these little guys branch go get a good feel yourself what's going on here debate is ugly visit these in my opinion these bigger leaves are just a waste their energy collectors yes but in the same my aspect they're just spent energy they're just using more of what could go up into the branch and push up higher get rid of a shit get rid of shit alright well we've done taking our tops off the top you've done somebody weeping now comes the horrible part these sucker branches as they're called sucking the life and energy for one here tab colas we'll be using saw this take that now this time if you don't like these ugly ugly leave this one here let's take these bigger leads off but I think I'm a hood leaver you have it one pretty lady under the Mars ts 1000 ready to be flowered here in a couple of days I know that this light this lieutenant which is 1/3 30 by 30 is good just tell it again this is a strain as pine valleys we are feeding it Blue Planet nutrients there's a 10-gallon pot under this chunky chunky growing cocoa from general hydroponics I'm gonna go ahead and get my little Messier cleaned up get these clones in the comment and I will get right back with you for the other tests and the lollipop mounted and in that ten right here will be doing lollipop over here we did top top method over here we'll be doing lollipop taking the clones from the bottom basically the app set what we just did so I'll be right back okay back here in the active la dt-5 tent we have a few different strains they were supposed to be the same but I call it what it is I messed up and threw in an oddball here so we have three buttercream haze by Kenna clean genetics and we have one insane in the membrane by ethos the object in this tent is to clean these scales up to about in here get rid of all this crap down below take a few clones pull them out and be folate a little bit I don't know how much of that I will video but at least get these front girls here and get back in there and if it isn't too long I'll film it but it isn't too long I'll throw it in if it's a too long so but we'll catch up and give you the after-effects after they're all cleaned up put back in okay as always you want to clean and sterilize your reasonably which I have done already but in between plants of course you always want to clean your blade again with some alcohol so if one has something you're not transferring it over and to the other plants so with that in mind again we have garbage can right here for waste justice you got a trusty garbage can here for waste we have multiple jars of multiple strains for our clones and that being said let's dive in I'm just gonna go ahead and start snapping off yeah I'm only gonna take a few phones from the bottom here because I've already have standbys of bees cool go ahead and pass along needs of course of garbage we want to be able to judge here obviously we're not getting a whole lot of light under this so we're gonna clean up anything after that and we've taken four good clones off of this one so we're just gonna get in here says your hand style very quick you gotta do smaller branches bug sites just picked up worries we talked about this it's already a little branch here established so I'm not worried about pulling that leaf off nice and clean - this down take a chance on this girl here we're just not pulling it right up to the top Oh [Music] again while we're doing this and we're in here we're also getting rid of some of these other leaves in here that we don't like that are that are too big again if there's a nice big leaf and there's already a well-established branch there let the other girls hold her up as well once you get it back into her file dressing police all to general here balls we're just looking there over for the lead we hold off I will do this week to week three to get that extra energy just last up into my bugs it's too small you don't have to worry about have a day or two to heal before she is flinch sorry just live boring I guess I should be talking a little bit to this I think overall that's as far as taking her up that's what we're looking for so now we're just gonna want to look through here and pull off some of these bigger leaves they're too big in my opinion wasting the energy or just blocking so for using teeth eyes we don't really have a lot of blasts going down into the canopy so we're more worried about what's gonna be up top [Music] it's hard to believe this was all just beat up man this was pretty much done like a week ago ten days now I believe all right the most part I'm happy with that I'm sure as I'm moving around and putting her back into place top off another leader to ready to come out this is what she looks like outside of the tip this is one ethos insane in the membrane what's a beautiful girl ready to be flowered she is uh everything hoped her to be we'll go ahead and push this guy out of the way and start working on this other girl your camera down oh you're out of the way like this gal down a little bit of rubbing out I always keep these all my plants up on casters both it makes it easier to move over your plants are brown but moreover I do it because I like that aeration underneath my plant I want to here to go under there I don't like the thought of watering somehow Moisture what not getting under the saucer of my plant and just causing a bad scenario so I just I've always felt by keeping my plant up off the floor that I'd be eliminating that problem for one for two I like it because in the winter it helps keep my new base warm because this is a calm Creek floor that they are sitting up and it does of course get colder in the wintertime so it helps keep that warm as well and in the summertime reason for the zone other than just keeping things easy two moons alright with that being said we have obviously one big ol bushy plant here that needs a lot of work again we're gonna come to what right in this area just shear off all this stuff I'm not gonna really worry about clones there's obviously three girls here that need to be cleaned up so we'll just go ahead and clean this one up for you real quick and then I'll go ahead and pause this video and clean the other two girls up and get back with you as a start the video again after they're all cleaned up and ready to go back into their homes so let's get worth it let's get at it and being kind because we're gonna take the clones off the other girls later [Music] one who should get over here I've been pretty happy with this genetic so far this is its third run I don't know if she will stay after this wrong I have genetics coming through save them all but it was a definitely an emetic strong I appreciate the genetics anything is gonna be staged will be cleaned up a little bit be foliated we'll get some of these little sucker branches off of them swinging it up for aeration and just kidding not to drive this point home but just some energy further ahead further up the plant no sense in wasting the energy down in this space these plants are very resilient so if you want go ahead scissor all this stuff off or use your razor blade feel free I feel pretty confident in my techniques and how long I've been doing this I'm not necessarily too stressed out here about what I'm doing it's we pulled out really cleaned up she is even bushier than I thought as you can see I'm sure not sure where the video gave out there but we are still working on this you know delete from the top over it's gonna be a little bit of a lengthy video I'm sorry for that it can be a little bit of a process one beautiful gal ready for flower this is also a good time to you're gonna do any pest management your have to do any sprays this is your course last and final shot at getting in there and doing so anything after this point I hope you'll be using some type of bio technics if you're in need of that problem nobody's in need of that problem as you can see there's absolutely good reason to be getting in here and doing this defoliation before she gets to for our crazy again these inter branches here I'm gonna want to clean those up to right about six inches from the top of their branch because that's as far as SH stretches the lights gonna be down in there anything that don't feel like the light will be hitting later on will be gone now see what I'm not gonna do awful work on camera but as you can see I'm getting right every brand it's kind of trying to go branch by branch getting rid of crap it's just gonna fog her down bring the smaller bugs it probably got away with fewer plants in less time looks of things make them last but of course I will get this all cleaned up and of course as CBD tattoo you are looking on the back of that arm there love that like Edward says what stain like words here but sometimes you get a focus we shoot in here you can watch it all over the way see the light starting to penetrate down into here further just like [Music] getting inside for the length of the video but I guess I'd rather have you see what exactly what I'm doing I'm cutting in and now all right go ahead and pull this girl please a lot pull this girl out to the girl's back by these 16 inch casters at Walmart 7 bucks [Music] there you go that big old girl there's always no takes that's a buttercream get the insane in the membrane we're gonna get back in here and you know that - oh shit and we'll get back to you after we eat this all cleaned up and start putting these girls back into place we're gonna go ahead and raise the light up here and get things ready to flower so so you're gonna all right welcome back all these girls have been defoliated and they're ready to go back into the tent they're gonna go back into the tent in which the order they came now makes around the way things look stuff these girls back in there and get ready for the next the light has been raised to accommodate for the new growth one canopy ready for ready for flower we will check back in a few seconds at cloner finish up the video alright here we are back at the corner for the last segment of this video right here we're showing three different types of cloning methods in this easy cloner here we are running nothing but air into the water and letting it bubble no air stones here I took this tip from Jeff lowenfeld to actually he he discussed putting the air stones in there and he said you know they employed more crap than their they're worse it's easier to just stick there the bubbler in there and just let it bubble and I did that last round and things along just fine in fact a cloned seven days quicker than this method here of just oh just using the pulp that will mess clean up now there's a pump in there just blowing that water wrong time call to be honest with you and that's it so this the air method took seven days sooner than this method both cloned with great great roots but the street appear cloned a lot faster this method here is pretty much the bubbler method same-same this is usually just an older full method for me I I called this the mister tyke method because that's where I learned it from he used it a little bottle coke bottle or whatever and just through his cuttings in there this here is I oh gee oh gee oh by ethos of genetics I ran that one and I even though I do have seeds to repot that one I'm just gonna I'm just gonna clone that bud and be quicker than less than what the rest but I really enjoyed this stream it was a great day time smoke it was a good up lifting heavy tasted super great although it wasn't as hit heavy hitter as I like it was a great daytime smoke so I'm gonna keep her wrong so this is the cloning my food they'll be taking small cups later of some other strange primal punch F tubes and yeah quick look [Music] and thanks for watching I appreciate you all happy growing great luck in your gardens have a great one Thanks", "Ymusjc736Rw": "[Music] what's up y'all this is b-real AKA dr. greenthumb for b-real TV with another strain alert and i got a fire strain for you alright um this one today that we are focusing on is called the insane holland spacecake HSC for short right now it's not in a custom bag it's in one of our insane red bags meaning white bag red stripe it'll say insane HSC on the label but this [ __ ] is the fire I tell you and it's gonna have a custom bag pretty soon this strain was brought to us by the seed junkies I cannot tell you what the crosses are I've been sworn to secrecy on this one but I got to choose it and it's fire let me tell you this is sitting on the shelves of all of our dr. greenthumb stores right now and you want to pick it up when you pop the bag it is soap it is the sweetest [ __ ] milky as' aroma that you can think of this is just fire in a bag as we like to call it down here you know it'll it'll torch the [ __ ] building and on bag appeal like when you pop the bag open and you pour them nuggets out on your tray you're gonna like what you see whole lotta Frost lotta trichomes done right by the right cultivators this [ __ ] is its business I gotta tell you it's it's it's one of my favorite flowers in our pantheon of flavors right here the HSC and we named it HSC you know as a tribute to the Holland spacecake did exist in Amsterdam because this [ __ ] tastes good but it is devastating and if you smoke too much of it by yourself you gonna go to sleep baby so let me tell you but it's it's a whole lot of flavor the crosses that make up this strain are ridiculous I got to tell you you would love it if I if I wasn't sworn to secrecy it and I could tell you you'd be like oh I need that flower right now and you do so I highly suggest that you get yourself on down to dr. green thumbs near you there's five of them if you're in California and rock with this pollen spacecake in this time right here you know stock up because you know you got to stay home don't go out unless you need to but when you go restock at one of our dr. greenthumb stores Holland spacecake make sure you try breaks up great if you got a grinder get it get it grind it up nice put that [ __ ] in a paper and a glass tip roll your own smoke your own and enjoy because you will not regret it there's been another dr. greenthumb strain alert have a great day and stay safe [Music]", "ixiDV_203SA": "what up YouTube and welcome to week 6 in the grow today I gave them a little bit of this recharge mix it in what is it at eight teaspoon a tablespoon and I can't quite read it but that much into a gallon of pH water and I gave that to the girls today and gave them a little bit of that water y'all looking really good like I said this is the first day of week six for these girls and it's the first time I gave them any type of nutrients actually that's more of a nutrient for the soil to break down to microbes and add sugars and help to break down what's in the soil too so it can uptake it easier to make it the nutrients available for the plants and so far so good this thing is working great over here - humidifier it's been keeping humidity in here I ate at like 60% give or take a little bit teeny bit as it runs but it's been doing an amazing job no I haven't been sponsored by any of these companies this is just stuff I bought and what's working for me so far got a couple fans going because it's just in the early stages of edge and to light up here and that blows air through it so it makes a little bit of air circulation not much but some actually it's blowing out you know and keeping the temperature it's expelling the heat so it does a wonderful job for keeping the heat out of right about 70 degrees what is it 72 degrees and 58% humidity both of them this one went to 59 58 this one is 57.9 this one just goes in whole numbers it doesn't have points like this other one does I'm not using this Inc bird right now because the humidifier itself has automatic shut shut turn on and said it for the humidity you want like right now I have it set for 55 and it's next setting of 60 when I put on 60 you got a little over 60 at the canopy height so it's holding right now at 58 59 I'll go to 60 and that's just perfect with 72 this one says seventy two point five temperature in there take one more peek at these girls they're starting to get to where I'm gonna top them I'm gonna wait till their fifth node give them a time pinging and when those get another few nodes or so then it'll get another topping right now everything is looking really good they looks like they took awesome to the putting up in these bigger pots and putting them under the LED lights definitely making a difference [Applause] he will he made a fire just turned on that'll run pellets I don't know I guess just above 60 and then it just shuts itself right off I come on and do that on my phone like I've already said and then I got it set for the Oh take fan here too which sucks it out through the carbon filter but that hasn't been running yet I mean with it the way it is right now it's not getting over temperature to turn the fan on but we have fans blowing around inside the room I'm opening it up every day checking on them so that's letting in more air they're not totally sealed and the air can come in through that hole that's the only one I have open right now so that's where it sucks in and goes out the exhaust someone did ask which I like if I still like the ACA infinity better the Inc bird Wallingford like I said has its uses for sure hey you could use it to run a humidifier a dehumidifier fans whatever you wanted to plug into it it'll run a that you know whatever there's many multiple ways of setting it up and this one is the AC infinity fan which does both temperature and humidity see though the only thing ain't buried is you have to plug ins when for temperature related things and one for humidity related and this has a both all in one line so this same fan will turn on whether he get a too high of a temper if he get to high humidity it turns the same fan on which the other one would have to be separate and then I got a run in goes there he doped out window got it insulated for winter I just gotta finish putting that up better up in the ceiling put some straps across the whole that yeah and the girls are doing awesome little humidifiers working exactly how I wanted it to I would like to get some better lighting that's gonna have to wait unless someone's willing to sponsor me and get some stuff going on back to another day in the grove these girls are really getting bigger now mm in size I'm have to check and I might off the top top some of them you've got the humidifier on them it's keeping it a good 60% humidity in here haven't watered them in a couple days so this is the last day of what weeks it so I'll be giving them a watering maybe I will pop them but they should I pop packing on some ties everything's looking great and see everybody next week on week sixes video so that's it for week five everything's looking awesome plants are getting bigger and we'll see everybody then please like subscribe leave a comment ask a question have a good one", "zVQruAIpxWk": "[Music] welcome to wheat entertainment and we love talking about grandy flora strains and this bud is something called yada da and it's really a unique looking bud but it was crunchy dry when i got it i opened up this bag and then i set it down and now it's even drier because i think i got this thing i don't know three weeks ago a month ago it just sat in the back i don't know why i didn't review it but i didn't do it so today's the day for yada da and let me load my little scooper into vapor cup straw i've already got two in here we're gonna add the third then we're gonna tamper and we're going to stick this down in the vapor cup then we're going to talk about yadda da yada comes in this bag and i got this at cookies maywood i got this at the apples and bananas drop down there i ran down there they held that for me and there were some comments on wheat entertainment so i grabbed it when i was down there and this flower has 26 thc and people are asking for the package date and uh so i'm going to give it that but to get that date i need a magnifying glass because my eyes aren't so good anymore so this is the package manufactured it is 9 29 20. oh no wonder it's so dry it's been in this bag for months right and you know what's crazy you would think that they're saving money on the jars right so at least they would give us some kind of moisture pack in here so these flowers when they come out of this bag are more fresh so let's say i got this the beginning january was harvested three months before crazy just crazy but anyway it's not about the dryness i don't wait for that so even though i note it that has nothing to do with my ratings my ratings are all about the something something and everyone's got their own something something that they're looking for but what i'm looking for are heavy flowers with focus that could grin me out i have to stay active i have a lot of responsibilities have to take care of i need flowers that can let me do that now i'm also a heavy hitter so a lot of the flowers even though i call them focus flowers they could stone you to the bone but it doesn't necessarily do that for me but certain ones do like the couch lock flowers but this isn't about catch lock i'm not looking for those type of flies this is about focused flowers that can grin me out so today it's jan dada turn to get the review we're looking for the best well let's check it out so you can see that's about amount a time it takes for vapor cup to work you can see that right there that's the terpenes the cannabinoids the water vapor and the oil vapor you can see it condenses right on the straw it takes about a minute and 20 once this cup is hot and also a lot of people have vapor cup so make sure your cup is hot if the cup is hot you need less time in the chamber if it's a fresh you just start it up you're going to need more time in the chamber and that's one of the things when you get vapor cup you got to learn use but i love this thing this thing changed my life but today it's about yada da so let's check it out yada da by grandiflora at 330 degrees out of vapor cup let's do this again so this flower's got a light og taste with a pungent pal but there's much bigger pungent pals than this one but it has it and the pungent pal it's i'm gonna say it's something like the chicken wing you know when you go buy chicken wings you smell it it makes you kind of like the ammonia taste people say ammonia but if you try vapor cup i'm going to tell you it's a pungent pal this flower took me a lot of flour to get stoned actually but it definitely got me stoned this flower's strong enough but not super strong and i thought it was good so what did i rate yada da i'm looking for the best and this flower you know at first i'm saying it's not strong enough but i used a really lot of it i used up half an eighth on the session i mean i really used a lot of it and in the end the feeling was actually kind of good it wasn't heavy it wasn't you had focus or didn't have focus i would say it was like a cruiser a little bit i wish it personally would have been a little heavier this flower gets an 8.65 which means it's a good flower if you're not a super heavyweight yeah it's a try but for someone who's a super heavyweight this flower may be not strong enough for them it was good but there's definitely better out of granny flora if you want to get a vapor cup this item right here and i'm telling you instead of smoking your flour up and joints get one of these things that little bit of flour that i put into this cup can last you 10 minutes and stone you to the bone i love this thing makes so many opportunities for use i love it and you can see it at vaporcup.com if you want to see my favorite picks you can see them on wheat entertainment.com that site's just getting updated right now it's going to have my top 100 strains in la out of 1500 strains i tried this is my journey i'm looking for the best thanks for joining in if you have a tip for me leave it below the video i'm the doctor i post every day but sunday it's my day off party on my friends [Music] you", "tAD_3ObeYRs": "practically every one of the

John Willard the third coming on because he see how much more important his name sounds than yours John really the third Colin Gordon Esquire okay yes I forgot about that part but so we really don't know what that means from Willard's like I certa God I really don't know what that means like is that like it will be joining us in a little bit have you heard of willows water Willard's water say the name again Willard's water you haven't heard of me it's Millard's of water yeah it's a plant Katalin so anyway we're gonna talk all about it with him on the phone I feel like that sounds familiar good I'm go ahead maybe you'll learn maybe you'll learn something instead of just jibber jabber and are you like sit still jibber jabber learning is he is the jibber-jabber they're mutually exclusive parts of my brain we got kind kti in the studio you know as usual MTI wheels steel and one's got acronyms to [ __ ] I throw are you there interns they get that Kyle the interns I can't give him some marquee names here just know she means here just cool acronyms just acronyms acronyms all around we got a bunch of talk about with you about our little soiree we talked about we have a soiree and we'll talk about that during the show we'll talk about what's what's goin down with these those blowing up and everywhere all the world loot and we will talk about your theories that you'd love to put out there and get blasted yes and they are theories by the way I've never said I've had evidence I was just looking for responses but actually ironically since those posts or not ironically I think actually that was the intent I've talked to several plant wheelers on the case all right he's been waiting for weeks hello there is this mr. John Willard the third himself was there a second you know no oh the interrupter the interrupt yeah he's quick on the interruptions yeah I kind of as I said it I was like it's not him it's for sure you I already knew was you I was like I was like wait a minute who would call that quick right so uh hello mr. 420 how you doing how's how's it out there the ether world oh you're gonna not hear us again and get all weird on the hi he always know I yes again oh oh yeah Michigan sorry I just you never tell me where you're secretly I hate to say this I hate to say this but could you turn him up a little bit in my headphones it's not very much obviously I'm just going real quick and say hi anyway guys I'm a Michigan setting up an R&D facility for a be normal for 24 in April on your spot a lot of films like hi and I'm kind of stuck I don't get to watch you because I'm not actually somebody else's plate they paid all my bills I'm just hanging out working for them right now so thanks to nice to hear you're working that's always a good thing you know I don't know if I called it working it's the way to keep it got to keep it so it doesn't feel like work but yeah so we'll be seeing you a couple weeks that's a that's for sure and yeah just tricky like I said interrupt the show as usual you know keep keeping it keeping it for calm and keep it consistent you know that's the thing regularly it's really not an interruption as much it just becomes like a part of yeah he's a babaji's a bubble yeah exactly the same thing like he's a regular yes I was gonna call and prank and be like oh yeah if any of the walls there you got the yeah you're definitely our test that you do the actual test for us to make sure where our lines are open so we she ate that test all right man I'll get back to it you guys have a good show I'll probably have to catch it later but we'll be seeing you soon anyway brother peace see you man thanks alright so before mr. Willard calls and we say some shout out so just shout as quick as we know he's gonna come jump on he's been waiting on that's just last week so so I know new millennium what did you run into them at the yeah just randomly person I got a message that they have three ski passes for you two this is so perfect they wanted to hand those off to you before you leave back home so bonus nutrients new body of nutrients exactly let me talk about this but you got some of this cannabis right here was grown a new millennium digits oh wow there we go see you know superset blah blah blah blah but actually grow that's true they say I said we run to do this and I use it on this run and that's a how how coincident it's almost like we planned that actually well what did you think about the formula was quite an easy walk yeah it was worth you know it was it was good across the board did you actually follow the formula or did you just kind of get a weird yes both first of all the formula and then I kind of try to figure out was doing but like in general like I could feel my plants you know and I mean I know what's in the balls but I try to run as close to the formula as possible just to see what they get that from 5-8 and there was going to be able to direct right yeah I made it yeah I'm not going names okay Neil's a guy one of the guys yeah whoever made it he sent me like 5 gallons everything and yeah the quality was fantastic the yields were great you know the thing is it's like I don't measure a lot of stuff and I'm doing runs it's just like how many how many grams tell me this it's like you know dude if I had different bulbs in last time it's gonna make those nutrients last time look like the yield more you know I mean so I just run it to get a feel first you know just to see how it just kind of runs and it was it was obviously very solid there's a lot of parts to it yeah it isn't for a novice grower it's definitely more professionally orientated and it does work really well though even those setups when you have all your dosatrons and you can't wreck [ __ ] together cause you can like I don't people to love a lot of parts of their system if you want a lot of control and you want the highest quality quality it was a plus you know I mean as far as like it definitely maximized trikes chirps blah blah blah the structure was excellent as far as yield it's up there yeah it's not it's not a house and garden situation where it's gonna grow blow out and go huge and it tastes the same but you'll do really good I always thought it was I was just solid yes so something I don't care about what the yield is a shot it was so I thought it wasn't like a great shredder was more of us what I always know I mean I've been growing from when it was about three years and what I've noticed is it's it's very plan specific it's not like it itself has got to like hype up your plants like if your plans it'll just give your plants the ability to do what they do whereas this with house and gardens and those kind of things like I've Oh suppose all of a sudden you see like everything grows like a pyramid all of a sudden when did those plants ever grow like that you know I mean they never do that but now they're all like they put jibber like acid in their formula that literally changes the morphology of it and that's why it grows like that right so it's like yeah tested it when I used to work at grow big and then that was what we kept finding and a lot of those systems that quote-unquote pushed the plants were like man we're getting more yields Baker yields but is it again there's organic gibberellic acid right and it definitely what happens which is that probably takes away quality 100% takes away quality it also turns it into like more like a the the structure of the bud less of the bud you know I mean like it's like wow you got a lot of structure there and then you got some buds at the end of your bunch of [ __ ] you know yeah and it's like it's that's where you see how it's like growing but not it's not focused on the way that the plant grows and that if you took a picture of the plant from a distance it looked like you got way more yeah and the plan was way healthier yeah and once you got into it exact Sherm's it all up yeah got all into the weed yeah you're like so we great for pictures but I wouldn't want to go get that with new millennium from new millennium new blade nutrients calm these were grown with only new millennium niche they were no yeah that's awesome and you can also go on their website they've got a really good calculator could store find are all easy stuff to get some in your hands and did you like the Ruby folic that's my favorite product actually because it's different did you give you the hype on that one with a nine different sources of for vixen stuff yeah I already I already because I worked in the Hydra store for a while I kind of know all the science as far as like I know the one-on-ones an area right that actual product out of there so you know how every company has like a super stellar product yes like they're gonna have good but then there's also one that's like oh [ __ ] that's it's all I use from it and after a while they pick up so I just ran it when they gave to me like three months ago so it was like it's our longest commercial ever for new millennium this is my first run so like I'll get back to you let me we're gonna cut more times as only enough okay I'd like to run some a few times to really come yeah and like I said I will see us I was absolutely pleased yeah and as long as you don't mind mind running a lot of parts I would totally wear it exactly and and and to be quite honest when you do you're never really using more than certain amount per time like it's just there are like yeah nice and all at one time very like week three flower I think I was like I did right right but it low it was a hell of a week three pillar products from new millennium just I check those guys out and we're gonna have them on the show thanks for the products new blending by the way like that was they said me said that he wants to come on show yeah it wants to come on the show for sure he's gone on I guess Jaron has a podcast yeah of course he's gonna go enjoy his podcast cause he's like works for me yeah but it's easy enough but yeah he's gotta come on our podcast now yeah definitely get meals in there and I wonder blending my tags on my pics I just put up on those big nails so and I think next week actually we're gonna have the Incredibles and over at the new spot if they have a fixer [ __ ] yet and probably not even doesn't matter because but apparently the batteries were dead it hasn't been driven in months I was like oh then it needs to come out in [ __ ] to be taken care of but if you want to get taken care of and your battery's low pick up some Incredibles in energize yourself no those are the best edibles here in Colorado of really creepy beautiful you like that weak is creepy right creepier by the week don't you worry so performance art it is every time is different that's why I love it but in Incredibles edibles Incredibles edibles I would guarantee if you come here to Colorado and you go to any single dispensary they're gonna have them on the shelf because they have covered this entire state like like a plague no but they're also available in Nevada in California in Massachusetts coming up and in Puerto Rico place wellness products I got CBD products I got microdose product so you don't have to get all loopy can just take a little bit a little bit all day regulate regulate yourself go I love Incredibles comm check up and check out their website Sandy Hill store finders I don't think they do a calculator of how much you're supposed to eat do they just like even though feel that what's that you got a calculator yeah they have a edibles 101 oh well that's sort of like start go slow and eat a lot just eat a whole bunch grab them all eat at the same time like journalists came in and just like blindly not knowing well that was anybody like I'm afraid this 200 run around see what happens that's like which one the reporter that day there was a lady there was a woman reporter from like a major and out where sure yeah she actually like stayed at her hotel room oh she's actually the way she explained her trip was like yeah new stuff pretty well you know for your first trippin your face off but a couple of people that as well that one cop that called the police himself with the two cops I thought he was going yeah the two cops dead yeah they said they were dead are there's a huge difference regardless of the context but yeah it's just like that's a beautiful thing with Incredibles is they're all got the DOS on them so you know exactly what you took you don't have to guess there's no guessing involved everybody not as far as the DOS DD yeah sure and and I'm really super accurate I usually do too much that's my main thing and then I don't feel it for the first day I feel the next day the next day I'm like ruined that's when it hurts you you're like that's mommy I know when it hit when it kicks into I know when it kicks in to quickly know that's like I don't know it decidable few minutes I'm like why am I feeling this already well that's not a good thing I don't know yeah you're like oh no it's doing you're way worse the next 20 minutes you know like if I stare at the window for the next six hours bring me water you know walk around in circles in the you know the thing about edibles in general though it's always about the dosage is so important and it's one of those things where it's really hard isn't even matter if they do the exact dose every single time it's just it still changes every day like you know one day you wake up you don't drink nothing you go out the door if I can throw down if I can avoid I mean it looks like even smoking you know your mood your energy is obviously going to play into it but like I know if you like in high dose and not get the loosen genetic effects that I definitely get and I know a lot of people get well I'm not getting like I just a law an acid I took too much acid effect I get affected that physically I feel like I feel like somebody's pushing me from behind all Ike stopped [ __ ] pushing me right like people say I feel like someone's like pushing me the whole time like you know keep on trucking at any point like you know we when were you like holding yourself up we get to the wall or like totes yeah he was just there holding himself up on the wall like that but he's dead so yellow twitchy though too sometimes would be like switched out after paying way too much like oh yeah I could do it I don't get I don't get like I got to the point where I had my inner monologue for six hours where it's just weed you're not gonna die you're not a pioneer you're not going to be the first one to do anything you way too much you're fat fat people don't die from overdoses a weed that's not a thing it all sounds like I'm good it's good I live Incredibles come check out the website version yes no you dose doses kids building soil that come build a soil these guys are in full steam right now I'm sure this is probably yeah the busiest time of the year for these guys because when you're growing organically you don't matter what even doors outdoors whatever it's spring just gets you excited cuz you can finally do those things but you wanted to do but if you allow the Sun so much if you want to plants get the best in organic amendments and IPM products soil consultation whatever you need give guys that build the soil calm a shout and check out what they've got they've also got some great deals if you're inside of Colorado or I think was it was it New Mexico Mexico you definitely if you're trying to get into over 500 bucks free shipping which is super dope when you're talking about soil you don't want to talk so I'll shipping blows that's like one of those things it does yeah it's like hey I'll take a couple bags also remember you got to get it off the truck just now have a friend or two oh yeah when they pull up and they say where's your loading duck and you're like I live in a tool oh we get a crowbar what we do but I can also go to eight five five eight seven seven soil and get off right off and that will get you a direct line on a thing called a telephone if you know how to operate those still I don't know mostly non Millennials listen care show so I think they all could still operate telephones quite well you text it or call it no you call that number has an actual no I'd say what happened like you use your voice yeah then someone says yo and you said so what's another line freeze talking to like a human not there's two humans of all two at the same time so technological I don't think it's amazing what you can do with the phone these days it is you can two people both sides that's the technology that's the last thing you can actually talk to somebody do it you could do anything in those things but if you get a chance in your want to get deeper into the soil situation and you want to get like some more specialized products you can go to our next monster which is mr. Braun Wallace from wow wow wow wow calm what's a Wallace Wow Ron Wallace is the world record holder for giant pumpkins and he is a rhizosphere master and so he sells mycorrhizal products that are obviously of the highest caliber and he also has a couple other products that are his lines if you check out the website you can check out all those things and you do we had a code didn't we know a do we say ATS 420 every time but I'm sure you just get that in phone at him and I'll possibly figured half for for today because every like custom make it for cannabis like he is well he's I think as funny is that he has always had people because when people see giant anything they're like give me that I'll try it so he's always had cannabis people working with a store anything anything okay I'm going with that go yeah baby fruits anytime we see large pumpkin going you get really pumped up and earth is the way I can use it utilizes no thing is of course there's the whole ecto and and oh and we're not really yeah we're not using a lot of the same stuff but for sure we want endows we think we might not want to take those but I think is that it's all collaboration yeah right you have to have endo for sure and I think the ecto kind of helped the communication exactly he understands it doesn't make it worse that's for sure so he's kind of so he's moving into the cannabis world a little bit more he's growing his first couple rounds himself and you know it was fun just because I was infused by a guy who was a weed growth became a pumpkin grower because then wanted who wanted to join the two world seem fascinated of mycology so in every way like how it helps plants how it helps roots that's where I got started well they actually went backwards into like how mushrooms used to I used to take mushrooms a lot and now I like follow different things on YouTube about all different my ecology as far as like eating them being parts of deities even for focus what they do for plants it's just it's fascinating to me yeah I mean also the the best the best part about cannabis and growing a cannabis in my one third of the total biomass of the earth is mycorrhizae yeah it's I mean that is that I actually didn't make that up that's a thing yeah there's a lot going on and that's one of the things with a lot of fun G once you realize that how that's the and especially when you're tripping balls really right that's exactly where I thought about that you wanted to buy my system I feels like now what is it I'm like I don't know yeah because you don't have any answer that was rhetorical now that I think about it right but that's a lot those are the moments where you're like the holy [ __ ] all this [ __ ] is connected in soul it really is though and like they actually like speak in some version of their own like Morse code and they can communicate and I was in Washington I think the largest organism in the world is I get the housing footlong with micro eyes I change it's all connected it's trippy yeah yes it's a it's a fascinating world you still don't know much about micro eyes I and how it works with roots and plants well this is that guy that's what this guy is a master of and he's in Rhode Island also which gives him that like that that perfect kind of thing like that yeah if you think that climate and that's what yeah you know you're the same area I understand I said [ __ ] yeah and get get in touch with him and pick up some of those products because this is the time of year again that you need to be on point ready to roll and of course this is what about these guys what do think about these guys these these jokers Tokoyo hooker jokers the toker poker Joker's CT no calm the no end the toka poker yes we love someone look at that I got you have your season hello it is pretty good it's pretty originally it's a good color sit someone nobody'll steal that was a perfect choice black went always with minor rose black because there have been show of course in all those appointments to find it everything one of the one of the most sought-after toka pokers in the world I would have to say Caesar now calm seas another come see to do it sadly sometimes and encina holux calm of course Alfa fair there you go mr. microphone bro [Laughter] so the guys from seats here now are where they had now risen XOR they were just a boss they're just in Boston Boston passionate now there's no window Expo in dough Expo coming up next yep it's gonna be what - I think they're actually in their home I think there's the thing in Oregon they're all over the place man they are all over the place every week they have a incredible staff that will get you the products you need this fast and discreetly and also guaranteed which is awesome because it's so pretty guarantees in this world but there is one was he tuned out are calm and anything you can't not say yeah by the way are free packs of ggs one right now and some giveaway like everyday they're gonna be like a bunch of packs away give it away back or they read website check it out it on the deal but it's like they're it's like we have 100 packs give away two months you're so kind it wasn't matter kind it's marketing that's so kind uh we had extra packages so go to see dear dad calm okay picture them check out this awesome James if you're right it is nice to give proceeds away though it really is like it's fun especially when you see them like on Instagram whatever like dude that's that freebie I got much I like this very nice track of stuff and also we don't have a thank you searcher hashtags you where's the treasure we need a treasure the picture from the our buddies in Barcelona our buddies in Barcelona with you should get on Instagram you can search your hashtag instead of following people you have all hashtags you know so put all your strains in there and did your feeds all of you it's the best Instagram is amazing you could just follow your shift I know everything every hashtag about you you just follow that [ __ ] I'm just good yeah you're like finally I don't really talk about stage a lot yeah oh yeah they did so it's a bug it like it really it pops up like I said you could follow it you could file your own hashtags and you'd be amazed there's thousands yeah yeah every so often all especially some self Americans and Europeans for some reason they just love [ __ ] talking about your [ __ ] thanks thank you for that stroke they're already doing it I'm not stroking to their [ __ ] hey get on any odd Eastern European thread man you are the [ __ ] yeah well there is like a weird retro thing I think in certain areas of the world including pockets of America where there's an old Dutch retro thing where they're like no we're cool with what we have I'm very happy with everything that's going on you do your thing yeah I get it and the thing is like I've gone through that and I'm going back to it straight through boom hello there is this mr. John Wheeler the third yeah oh hello sir thank you for calling in to the Adam Dunn show yeah thanks so much for having me yeah we missed you last but it was a little crazy so it would it was I knew I was gonna get that way too so I'm gonna give you the best time possible so we could discuss a bit about your incredible product that you've had for a long time which I was quite familiar with I had a sat on a panel at one point I think with you maybe did you do the show here what you did the show in Denver or who did the show in Denver a couple yeah that's right right yeah yeah we sat next to each other we said yeah yeah we sat next to each other there so I was totally familiar with her product from that time when we met and then later I had a friend who was just raving about it at one point from California so it all kind of you know I definitely know that there's a lot there and and it's one of those incredible products because it's so simple you know weird what I mean are simple but it is just like there's not not a whole program or anything like that it's just a interesting product so tell us a bit about how this whole thing came about and a little bit back I'll tell you how you how you describe it as a fairly simple concept it actually really is it's I was just talking we've been doing a lot of work in Zambia this morning or this last couple of months I was talking to somebody in Zambia and I said you know there's this tendency to just over complicate things and it's really not that hard basically my grandfather was a chemist he invented this product and 19 actually invented it in 1965 it began selling it in 1973 and we have been in continuous business that's then and basically what the product is it's a water additive and we actually still don't know exactly why it's doing what it's doing but what we do know is when it's added to the water it is it is somehow making the water a more efficient delivery system and we see that in in all cellular beings we see an increase in cellular absorption and utilization of nutrients and the practical effect of that with plants what that means is that you get basically more bang for your buck it helps your your plants better absorb and utilize those nutrients that the fertilizer or whatever nutrients you're putting with it and so what we do for example in in Zambia and Mozambique we're working with a lot of international nonprofits to help them cut back on farmers expenses and increase lumber profit tips and what we're doing there is we're reducing fertilizer we reduced fertilizer by about 50% and we see yield increases somewhere between 15 and 20 percent and we see that fairly consistently yeah and like one of the things I was wondering about is when this this product it seems it seems really stable because I've had seen it on the shelf at shops for for you know this week one of those things where it's definitely a specialized product and I definitely I was just always wondering to like so many questions you have so very good good jumping on the conversation at any given moment but what's the natural link of that what is the the the shelf-life of it like natural pretty long actually my grandfather tested a bottle over the course of about a decade and and saw no changes at all to the product and so that's that's pretty substantial and we've had people who have opened it and left it open and really you just don't see any serious problems with it it's a proprietary formula it's created through proprietary formula we just don't see any major changes that once those molecules are bound together they stay that way I see any specific but like it's a liquid form powder formula organic extract it's called Willers water so I would say yeah well is it's a liquid for powder we sell it as yeah plant catalyst willard's dr. Willard's water it's it's all the same thing it's just just sell something for a plant product in the United States we have to tap it registered per state and so we call the plant catalyst in the agricultural field because the government requires you to use different labels yeah this is such a weird weird business at home getting anything listed so it's is it it is it a tea basically it's a combination of different organics no no not at all it's it's I know it's difficult for people to sort of wrap their heads around it I'm trying to I'm going to keep asking questions I don't wrap it around but I'd like to get a grip on like half maybe in here you know no no no please just say so I might miss something so is the source source that you said or is that part of the price it's a proprietary basically it's a proprietary chemical solution and it's a water additive and when you call the chemical and somewhat in unappetizing it's made with natural ingredients it's mostly salt a little bit of charcoal lignite in there a little bit of castor oil my grandfather was basically playing around with lignite and what he was actually trying to do originally was to create a lignite water for her pits actually so he was trying to find something that was completely non-toxic and yeah it was frozen a time and looked under a slide yes my grandfather has done that my grandfather did a number of tests froze it heated it tested senator I mean they talked about that um you know how like live water like there's different things you change the water so when you freeze it like literally it changes like like snowflakes you get like the snowflake changes do a difference no flat and like they could no we've never done they're like different things different types of water depending on the life of the water that dictates the actual what the crystal looks like under a slide and it gives you like a hint of like like what it's kind of made of oh it's fascinating is they've shown that water actually can die like there's live water puts off this perfect snowflake type crystals right but once water becomes complete anaerobic or it's in some sort of negative situation when you freeze it it just becomes a little like strings of frozen crystals like like none of the snowflakes and stuff like that no it's not like we were looking at some different like magic teas that had kind these claims in blah blah blah but it worked you know and did same thing like all the crystals are frozen these very very cool structures were like I don't know I don't know what is the freezing school what is the freezing point of the Wailers water is it lower or higher than normal water I don't know we've never done eyes never doing that kind stuff my grandfather's hid it sure honestly you know I had somebody I spent a lot of time when I first took over the company about seven years ago I spent a lot of money on Saylor cellular studies and microbial studies and really trying to get down into figuring out how to work at why does it work okay so you're watering this in right it's just a good wrench not a foliar or both excuse me is it you're watering it into the plant into the rhizosphere versus like a foliar I'm just trying to grasp how I used sure sure we put we put it foliar and on the roots but I have okay think it's actually better used as foliar spray okay but but anyway to finish the thought sorry about that I spent a lot of money trying to figure it out that's alright I spent a lot of money trying to figure it out and and I had a friend that said to me basically why do you care all the matters is that it works and you should be spending rather than spending your money trying to crack the code you should be spending your money proving that it works and so from that point on I spend all our money on research proving that it works rather than trying to figure out how it works it's easier to prove that it works and find out sometimes what it does there could be so many complicated you know variables it's tough it's tough to prove well I mean actual metric is it deficit effectiveness so it's not organic and all organic it's it's all natural it's here about its 99 well if you're in there you only put if I were in the if I were in Misha the European Union we'd be we were gaining unfortunately we're in the United States and it's not organic so it yeah there's there's one ingredient called sodium silicate that represents about a thousandth of a percent of the product and that's not organic and that's it the rest of it home and it's actually benign okay that's great okay so so so realistically it's organic in the sense of good organics is okay is it toxic is it potentially toxic how whatever no not at all order its effects because I I see all these different definitions of organic for different states different you know you hear the pay-to-play blah blah blah and honestly like the bottom line is like if it's a nutrient or some version of that if it's going in the roots you know it's once it's absorbed regardless of its source it's the same the difference is like okay what's left behind there you know but I find that it's a very confusing murky subject so yeah so in the candidate really is it's it's a terrible subject actually I spent a lot of time trying to get it organic certified if you basically find that money in the back you I just tell you how crazy it is is we like it so sodium silicate is one thousandth of a percent of big concentrated products of the time you dilute it down at sonic distant and that's what keeps us from getting organic certified but if you're a fruit grower and you soak to your fruit in a big fat of sodium silicate and there's no preservative ground that would still be it's a it's a well it's in our product it's not but normally it is use the preserve as it is a suspension yes yes I got it yeah so you have to but or iodized yeah that's how ridiculous it is you could use the humans are bad when you soak the vegetables and everything in it and those would be considered organic but ours wouldn't be considered organic because we have one thousandth of a percent it's not plastic in that area yeah I mean it's a and it's crazy because there's so many other types of organic labels that are definitely not just because of the fact that they they're in a different cat in a different you know category or whatever but so so how big of a scale of you have this product been uses it like only been delivered has been delivered on like large-scale agricultural things like 3,000 acres or or is yes yeah money to prove so proof yes where did you do it yeah what was your like how'd you do it we sponsored we started out by sponsoring a green house study about it started about five years ago and was a three-year green house study was actually South Dakota State University which of course is our local University a professor became interested in it and he was he was interested in a bunch of different things and he wanted to get it done for whatever reason he had this theory that he he wanted to test it under the most extreme example so we built a greenhouse up in the up in Colorado actually right outside Steamboat in Colorado we built we found a greenhouse growers yep yep we found a just cold call and also called a new extreme environment putting like Steamboat right off like this slide out you know ski out a spot you know so elevation huh how high was that 9,000 oh well it was it was a quite Steamboat it was gosh securing of the town it was between was between 70 and Steamboat you went north on our 7000 South oh yeah yeah I was in it was in the mountains I mean he wanted to test more extreme conditions and so we found a greenhouse for actually a guy who owned a greenhouse supply storage right outside of Steamboat and he was a grower as well he had a couple of greenhouses and so what we did is we just built another greenhouse on his property and said you know run it just like you normally would and and then dr. Rees from South Dakota State flew up to excuse me the steamboat area a couple times a year and gave this gentleman scott was his name and said this is what I want you to do with it just run it like you normally would it way I'm like you normally would if one half of the greenhouse would be treated with plant catalyst and one half the greenhouse just be left alone and basically what he would do is he had these different stations and he would flip a coin and he would say okay the one on the left is plant catalyst the one on the right to control or the one on the right is control or plant catalyst oozmas one on the left is and he would do that throughout the greenhouse and and then he would just grow them as normal and he would cut the fertilizer he cut the fertilizer to the plant catalyst tree to plant 50% and he used Johnny seeds just plain old Johnny seeds and then he used a liquid fully or we looked with fertilizer and a foliar feed as well and then just you know basically just put plant catalyst he put two ounces of plant catalyst his revs was 27 gallons and he put two ounces of plant catalyst in that every time he changed it out how are you worrying you're reading with it was a hydroponic it was a hydroponic operation yeah rock will drop fully up so they also by the way they also spoke to the rockwool he also soaked the rock wall in a five-gallon bucket and in the control it was just five gallons of water and soak them and inserted seeds in it and then in the the plant catalyst once again put two ounces plant cat dr. Willard's plant catalyst in that and soaked them that way as well and tested germination rates to this we got much better termination rights much better strength outta germination so Rohan cetera cetera gibberellic acid in what that does gibberellic acid in if you improved your germination rate no that's not it that's not correct nope it's like did lose your blood I don't know of any chemical I can actually well it it like do you think the germination percentage or like or how well they germinated how strongly they germinated both both actually live in dr. Rees with that without enhancing gibberellic acid it does not have that no it doesn't have any of that in there it was just water or plant catalyst no I'm saying the plant hands I'm not saying it's a Lee they may have some in there it sounds like that's the solution that's anyway so okay cool so like I said don't don't compare it to anything else because I mean I know this down I'm self-serving but there literally is nothing else like it and it's kind of fade and no I'm open I'm gonna playing both skeptic and open I'm told you know I mean I'm totally I'm assuming that it works but I'm also skeptically saying okay let's if it works that's also breaking I know like I'm giving you benefit out but also want to break you down I mean I like that you're answering the questions like at this point a lot people just panic call me a dick yeah I'm really just curious like I'm not even trying to like I just want to know yeah well I mean I guess I'm totally down because like I've used a lot of things I have no idea to this day how they worked and they worked so I think that's a crazy part about a lot of products it's like you know the ones that are like that that just [ __ ] work I mean okay hard to argue some things real life you can give it a name but that [ __ ] yeah there's the results right you know and there's a few products out there like I'd resign but things like that would you like you don't know kind of like hmm you know does this work or not in public if there's a lot of weird like it and I think especially when it comes to the rhizosphere when it comes to the roots having feet all this all bubble or whatever you can get all under the mycology all these bacteria there's so much you just don't know so so so there's a lot of mr. Willard's other visitors there's things that we wouldn't understand how they work what about human consumption and don't drink it yeah we have we have someone human consumption as well sorry I cut you off not can I digress back so you said he used it in a side-by-side one where he used it and you know there were and yeah end results we your weights did you have a like a metric that you came up with like that yes and this was this was tomatoes lettuce a healthier peppers and green bell peppers and he ran for three cycles so three successive cycles so basically over three years and and then he would just have Scott weigh them and you know weighed how much how much weight we got out of these today how much weight we got out of the control etc etc and it Scott would just write them down and then he would email them to dr. Rees every day say you know I picked X number of tomatoes and the gross weight was this and etcetera etcetera and he took pictures and he had to measure the roots and then what he would also do is he would he would randomly dr. Reece how to program a computer that would randomly assign a number and so you know each one of the plants had a number assigned to them and he would say okay pull me plant number three break it down put it in FedEx and send it to me overnight and then dr. Rees would would measure the roots and measure the stalks and all that you know and that happened weekly as well and so dr. Rees basic collected all this data and then he published it in a peer-reviewed journal and it went through a pretty intensive peer review process where a number of scientists reviewed all the data of slam that I am yeah they knew I'm making the Mogul lie to try to like [ __ ] up stuff it seems like yeah he said it was the most intensive peer review process has ever had and we came out of it how long that was that was published in 2016 it was published in July of 2016 and it showed the using plant catalyst once again we reduced fertilizer by 50% by so maintaining yield on it so okay sorry what's that I'm sorry interrupt so reducing a baby he basically yeah I usually just use 50% less fertilizer you can see miss um use X you just basically cut in happens what he did to be able to get the same out is that what that was the the goal is to get the same result with half the fertilizer yeah but he got better results and the goal was actually had better results and so we ended up with half the fertilizer increased lettuce 13% include Crees the yield on tomatoes 24% increase the yield on bell peppers 48 percent and increase the yield on how Pina peppers by 52% with half the fertilizer okay so I have to ask a couple questions because those are big numbers and they're big they are professional pepper growers I've I met one once at a bar very strange man what are you in a jalapeno so Mike what so so I guess part of those questions is understanding is one do you check water weight versus dry weight on these fruits and like is there a significant like increase in water that actually is lost so like is it the turgor that's adding the weight or is it actual plant material it would be one question I think he tested both actually he the the the water weight was the most aggressively test of course because basically what Scott was doing was he was picking the plant and he had a scale on site of course he's a greenhouse growers there's a scale on site and he would send measurements he would take those measurements every day and so those were obviously water weight but then once again he would he would have to send a random sample mean to me couple of them as you take weights that rise it's a combination of water and material and then he would have to he would have to then send a certain sample of those fruits vegetables back to dr. Rees via FedEx and then dr. Rees would dry them out and put them in a kasha just lost my train of thought everybody's drying out the same amount pretermit water weight yeah and like the different samples actually let me ask I refused it poorly I guess is the is that increase based on the wet fruit or the dried fruit like I'm at it's based on the wet fruit based on the wet through it absolutely okay and is there a significant loss I guess there's my follow-up it's like there's a ton of that gain water now I'm not saying loss like you're gonna sell the fruit dry but I'm asking is like is a significant portion that gain in water weight versus actual like carbon you know I mean like material as a cycle different I will say that after you dried them out yeah he didn't notice that assistant statistical difference between the plants so the Willard plant or the willow tree plants were bigger consistently across the board so even was right you know 10% row I went they were also 10% bigger dry he didn't notice a difference between the dry fruits and the wet fruits in those in the percentages so in other words he felt confident in publishing those numbers keep in mind he's a professor you know I get it yeah you said you did I take that very saying oh I said I take that very seriously when you say it's peer-reviewed and you know so I said I'm giving you a benefit of that all the way I'm actually fascinated like with with with how you know with how it may work that's you know my mind just going in a creative way you're like in the fun way but uh I want try it out it's a curious I love stuff that I will obsess if you if you've no one's ever figured it out maybe I won't but like I may be like I might be 85 of my deathbed like I still don't know how that Williams wonder works yeah well I mean you guys have been in grow shops free for quite a while right does that mean that's one of the million that cuz a lot of a lot of companies like don't want to venture into the world of canopy well who was the first person to sort of pick up on that do you know I do I will I don't know that he was the first but he certainly was the first who really started selling the product it was in the early 90s it was like 91 or 92 was a guy named Chris from Canada and his mother owned a health food store and his girlfriend British Columbia has had has had legalization for quite a long time the entire country hasn't but they allowed the province of British Columbia to grow sort of like what we have today I guess in Colorado and in California and so yeah so Chris is one of his friends and his girlfriend were growing and they were having problems with their plants and he said that the plants were dying and he asked his mom his mother was also an organic gardener and he asked her if she had anything she said oh you should you should put some Willard's water on that she put in a spray bottle and just spray it and it'll help those plants recover and he did and the plants recovered completely and so he began to do more sort of like his own personal research to try to figure out how it worked and then eventually he began to sell it and today he says this is his claim he which I think you guys have talked to him you can you can follow up but he says that just about every cannabis grower in British Columbia is using our product today that was you know 30 years ago but it's not actually a good thing because here the reputation is that was the worst weed ever grown on the planet was 30 years ago in British Columbia I'm not kidding we call it be stirs it's actually like an adjective that came around making fun of how bad the the cannabis was I'm not making this up I like I'm not trolling you no no no this is a really good but hopefully it's better today and I know we stopped getting it you know here's the thing yeah who knows you know it's all look it's all about who's growing it and the you know what they're doing with it that's a lot to do with it and it's not saying it was he was in the same product you know I mean so there's nothing not saying there's an actual correlation I just find it ironic you know I love you talk yeah no I mean no I mean BC is a big place but uh it's a I saw I would ask that you know why isn't AG using it everything especially on peppers 50% increase how come not all the reason how expensive is the production cost is it was my follow up that's a very good question good question I would and I think that's a very legitimate question I get it all the time and honestly if you've met my met my dad and my grandfather you know why we're not bigger I mean it's not it's not a knock on them it's just that they didn't care to and they didn't produce they didn't promote it so if you talk to farmers in South Dakota they use it if you talk to farmers in North Dakota to use it quite a few of them what does that mean so let's say I'm not gonna do this because I'm not only file flip through on [ __ ] but let's say I was gonna actually try to ask South Dakota farmers like how many of them use it like what does that mean like they use it like half like more than half because I know it's probably not happy but like a significant third maybe a third yeah a few farmers yeah okay weird like it's kind of a weird development like where we have parts of South Dakota they're really big reports of Kansas like western Kansas right we have a lot of farmers in western Kansas or we send gallons and barrels to them we have like little pockets of people really you know what I mean like we're neighbors talked about it or we Wisconsin we have a lot of farmers in Wisconsin and you know your port numbers similar to the ones that you guys got in your test yeah at least ballpark number I'm like I don't know if they have ever said okay this is what the numbers are but they share with their neighbors and then their neighbors call us nothing so it's kind of grown that way but like I said my family never really spent any money on on out reefs or anything like that my grandpa's way of doing things was he just said here's my product do what you want with it there wasn't even like a specific agricultural business plan so to speak there was you know people would buy it and they didn't have like had like this white label on it that was just like said Willard water and there was nothing on it at all right and it was Hill website starting bacterial sure well sometimes there's too much information like I'm dr. Bronner's soap just like so much information you know my God is taking a week to read this and then to get other products like that where it's just like use it I remember labels are from people's printers well the thing is there's no real there's no real toxic level of it obviously you can't just go pure but it's not like it's not toxic in any way shape or form right so no not not at all it's completely once again it's also sold as a drink I mean in Denver if you went to well geez probably all over Colorado if you went to Bible College you could buy a vitamin cottage to drink you could buy the whole foods to drink at Whole Foods and and so it's not toxic at all it's the same it's the exact same product it's just remodeled because like I said we've regulations require us to sell a plant product with a plant label so people do it as a tonic type thing and yeah it's yeah it's the same general concept it'll boost the absorption for example of B vitamins we have a couple of studies on B vitamins we have some studies on antioxidants that it boosts the absorption of antioxidants it's recharging interestingly enough recharging some antioxidants in the cells and not others which is completely baffling why would do some and not others but like for example vitamin E really boost the recharges the hell out of vitamin E but it doesn't do the same thing to vitamin C it just increases absorption but it doesn't recharge it so so who knows questions so when it comes to cannabis often when you add a product that increases your yield there's a loss of quality regardless of what that product is have you heard that at all as a possibility or side effect from some of the people that have used it like you know a little less resin less less smell yeah I've not I've not heard that but I do know a lot of our people also use it in the flush that they feel like it get to their flush if they use it in the flush as well and so that might be part of it it's a big part of what people do with it so it they may it may be not as good I guess I'm just speculating here if you don't use it in the flush but people are pretty happy with it but you haven't heard anyone say that like hey I really big yields but a little bit lost in quality I don't know I've never heard anyone say that to me and I know that I'm a spokesperson people can do that [ __ ] but just doing a super basic finding like a grow or you can do a control of take you know everything being equal then give one your tea and then do the yield but also test the oils cuz that's really a big part of it so if your oils you know if your percentage of you know oils are the same as well as your yield that's that's a huge deal versus if your yield goes up but your oils go down like percentage-wise well if you know anybody who wants to I don't have a good facility to do to do side-by-sides if you know anything what have a slender squared R&D facility that's just for plant physiology and genetics I do it for you I'd give you I give you product if you want to do the test you know give you the product then dope London affair I'll give you a give me an address I'll give you a docking bay consented to be yeah yeah I think I'm I'm at least interested I look III don't like proving people wrong you don't waste my time proving people wrong I wouldn't do this if I didn't it was the chance of it working and if it does work cool you know because I'm with a person in fact if I get something that's three percent like legitimate three percent increase across the board it helps me that's a big deal you know I don't need I don't need forty you know if I get a product that's like you know consistently everything's up three four percent that kind of thing that's it and I can measure that that's a that's a number that's I'm fully happy with you and I don't need big huge blooded numbers you know if it's measurable it's it's usually it's a good thing so I'd be very curious yeah I know I'm not I'm not afraid of it at all I didn't want to do it I actually know I sense your confidence I feel like you're invented and like I said I look here's the thing I don't typically ask people to try stuff I get so many bottles so many things laying around but I'm here if these 50% of me is in the other fifty but I was like well they were sounding me like believes that the guys have a guy in California have a guy in California has had the same same room for you know 12 years he's got his numbers pretty pretty dialed in and the another friend of his gave him this product just like kind of like hey check this out wasn't he's not a grower at all he just said oh and that guy came back to him honestly like you know slack-jawed like holy [ __ ] do you think if I try something and I get a result less even that I don't like I'm not unhappy like I just like trying stuff anyway side by side so I'm sure something beneficial will come I'm curious to see if I noticed any like I said maybe I noticed a slight terpene decrease maybe it increase hey you know I mean I'm just curious to see especially if it like you say it's a product that works differently I know I understand that cuz it's hard to explain how some things work that it quantified or whatever maybe but I'm curious to at least if it does work differently I like seeing where things grow differently so I do side by side especially strains as I've grown a bunch times and yeah are we happy to try it out see what see what happens yeah yeah okay I'd really I would like to know as well I mean if we do see differences well I mean that's something that's really good for me to be able to say yep we do or no we don't or you know those are so what you do is you know the total it mass you know in an area and then the total oils you don't I mean and and then see you know if there's let's say there's a decrease in oil percentage but there's such an increase in mass that that small decrease in oils is fine that kind of thing you know that's where you go wrench some numbers in there a little bit that's often where that that fine line is like well it 30% higher yield but 10% less oils you're like okay I'll take it you know I think I think you always I think with a lot of products I'm not saying it's gonna lose oils by the way I'm just saying that's something that's common like we're like okay that's it I'll take that loss you know yeah I think that I think with everything that you put out like whenever whenever you add a product or into a plant and it produces more you're almost 95% of the time do lose something some along the way just because that's that's just nature of the beast I mean like there's usually occasionally a lot has a homeostasis occasionally change to the right amount of everything occasionally it'll work on that without sacrificing it but you know and that's why it's nice when it is like 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 percent then it's kind of like nice right K so when it gets up to a polity with 2 or 2% once it gets up to like crazy numbers and like the fingers with peppers and stuff like that it's a lot different in cannabis cannabis is such a yea specific type of plant where it grows it doesn't you know it's not like putting on so much water weight hopefully and and if it is it's a total do it actually does raise the turgor in the water weight of the plant that means the plants can be healthier and you're doing others better but then you get those curious just to see you get those I mean and I think because I think a lot of it depends to grow hydro or soil so you're gonna see difference in probably of course because hydro plants when they get activated in that do you need microbes to break any of it down or is it already all salt soluble it's all fall voluble know so it's fine either way it's gonna be the same yeah All Right game on you'll see some interesting things with pH as well I mean if your if your hydroponic you know I'm actually more of an amended cocoa highly aerated so it's like - ish hydroponic ish but it's in cocoa Tripp cool so how does the sec pH it it seems to stabilize it a little bit and it's actually kind of interesting because the concentrate has a fairly high pH it can be like 11 9 in the concentrated of course only putting like a couple ounces into a large large container and so it's it's not affecting theoretically it shouldn't affect the pH at all but you would think that if it did affect the pH we raised it but in fact in this greenhouse study that they did it outside of Steamboat they actually they notice that whoo it's actually helping to bring the pH down a little bit so they actually used less pH down than pH up that's crazy yeah well I mean it depends on where you are like some places it's hardly use any pH up and then there's other times like where I'm using organic material as you aged up and down in years yeah yeah I don't like tubby blacks and they get mad and they want to control if you're in hydro it's different yeah but uh cocoa I don't know I don't know bottles I didn't even bother it's it's it's not those charts that were put out with the 6.5 and phosphorous and 5.8 well I didn't travel rx we ran one of them at 4.0 and the other 5.8 and we couldn't tell the difference for months and then here's the thing that the runoff at the end was the cocoa we tested the cocoa a bunch of different places it was five point nine and one 5.8 in the other that's the only difference we could find was like so the cocoa just buffered everything out almost instantly because they're stabilized yes so we were watering it for and like even later testing it was like right 25.9 you know within minutes the miracle of cocoa well anything about soil sure but yeah I don't pH anything and there every it was just funny because every time there's an issue like I don't think a Facebook like what do things going on first was like pH and Mike peach which like I read this chart and like that's not a real thing that was a color thing that some guides put out in the 70s well I mean it's an organic you can you can go break down if you're on hydro you can go off the rails pretty fast with without pH points I'm talking eight buffer to substrate once you're in soil and other things you can you can be a little more flexible but still a little it's nice to I dare anyone to try it it's unbelievable how any buffered substrate am I talking hydro I'm not talking to deep water culture just for fun get a small plant and don't ever pH like that plant and see if you see any difference whatsoever you won't a pH and Peter Jose and you lose your crop you just believe I said one small plant way more plants than most people both on purpose and not on purpose but like I have purposely killed stuff sometimes just trying stuff out and push it push it but oh okay more is not better it's fun that's part of how the learning is yeah yeah I don't think I'll be just like hammering one of the plants with Willers water just like that's all you get bro it's mainlining that stuff right in there just get yeah so so what do you know what they like with the general dosage is just like what a gallon tell them with what's the protocol here so just enjoy you should go for quite a while I mean it depends on how quick how big your friends is how often change resin you recycle what if I would not let it let's just like like I feed in a coco top so we like everything's made right in there and fed so we don't change our res that's not a thing we can always add that to it you know so yeah how do you water though drip emitters drips yeah it's pretty common and how does it how do you feed the water out of there how do you where do you get the water from you don't have eyes where the water comes up now we have dosatrons yeah so it's like we have basic concentrates and then it pulls it up and it puts it at like a 1 to 50 or 100 so it sort of drips into the lines as it's in the lines it mixes as it goes instead of filling up a reservoir yeah yeah there's it skips the reservoir all together so then you do ok directly for the concentrate so you'd have a willard water looks like a detector that makes everything perfect on the way out it's basically like it's basically like how you get add willard's in there at any concentration you want you can have anything at any point yeah it's like having a gun at the at the restaurant there we can just mix it he drinks it's custom you could add as many lines joints it's one more pump just to put on so you could add it and just add it in at the you know whatever desired amount is it's it's a it's it actually literally mainlining Willard waters it's as if we're making you are and then watering right away just without the reservoir but we do have reservoirs there where we could make some top feed it sound like we don't have options of you know usually other have no reservoirs bro I got a garbage pail I got Home Depot buckets like a mother be able to just feed it right in there and you know we just send you a bottle you complete it right in there too and just program it in and but I wouldn't yeah on the side I don't want you in the top feed if it's some small you mean skeet on sides like it's not like you know I don't need to like I could just have everything else running fine and just do a couple plants off the side with it and just do a little top feed yeah but yeah I love trying new stuff out the kit and we got coming down do a whole thing hold coverage of the of the of the grow here it'll be so maybe if it's amazing you'll get quite a quite some coverage there we go cool yeah that's cool it will be amazing but I want to make sure that you really I did I truly hope I see all if I just see a difference I'll be happy I don't even need to be measurable if I'm like huh I think it's working so has the has the dr. Willard's Lyon expands it anyway I say only because I've tried almost everything just the same simple Dwight one simple product or just just like you said before like you can get it in health food stores guys so as the two lines you guys are doing right now yeah we have the Willard water line and we do have a pet product line as well let's get the same thing and it's a plant line and yeah was really it's really big in pets we got 47 I got enough you ever heard like to hold the whole dog during all they they've done a couple of articles on it and there was an encyclopedia of natural pet care there's who is this Willard and what did he do house this was this miracle Aztec formula you've got what is going on so uh you know he was he was just you know he only just at the chemist and he always that when he when he said he invented this he just did you know I just I just got lucky he was not intending to invent it and started that means yeah doing research yeah but you get some guys that trust me he's just genius and also got a problem sure there was some catalysts that help with the luck but when people say they got lucky and stuff like that that just means they're just crazy genius and don't explain it and so I got lucky on one thing that so before so what did he do when cool when the the what year did he die my grandpa died in 1991 if the how was so at that point in time like what was it like as that transition went over like what was this or I mean obviously it was smaller companies not bigger anything but did he get a chance to see the product kind of used it by some major players at that point or we what was his what was his feeling at that moment like it was about to change the world or was a kind like you to have people like at that moment in time is there whole it's their whole thing or was he like kind of as is that sort of a little bit and different and really give a [ __ ] now he really you really wanted it to you know my grandpa had worked on the Manhattan Project the development of the atomic bomb when he was he was teaching at that time us Marva Street at DMI and that really affected him and he always said I didn't want that to be his legacy that he really hopes that it could be something although I have to say he hopes that this project would like cure cancer do something really crazy like yeah maybe it will and it does help plants through the record what's that it does not help cure cancer or anything like that yeah like the only person you're not claiming that right now as a product that's good that's good yeah let's not let's wipe it off but it's you know the reason that I've gone on to the international development world it and where we're helping farmers where I put a lot of my focus onto that because it was something my grandfather always talked about he always would say to me you know you ever take over this business this is really important to me I want to make sure that we leave some sort of positive mark in the world and it sounds cheesy but it was it was you know literally his dying wish sure well that's awesome and the thing is I mean also right now it's really interesting just because you know obviously he didn't get a chance to see the transition of people's like at the Cannabis II economy of America which you know there's like millions and millions and millions of square feet of canopy right now of plants being grown on a regular basis which didn't exist five years ago you know what I mean so it's like that's a just a huge volume of there are a lot of products that can't bag can't afford at a monster level that we can also like is it much different mark well the thing is that cannabis growers and that's the car are always you know we're a little bit more like you know willing to spend extra money for that one or two percent you know because we see and don't try stuff they try new yeah they will and then and you know - when I go to a gross store or - you know I'm always like oh what's you know like I'll I'll of course you want to try something new or look and see what's happening you know and it's like occasionally something pops up and it's really really a good product and then you're like okay this is something solid and you can go into like I mean college to work in the grow shop so you have the same sort of experience as far as like you go in and you really know like okay there's really like this this this this the rest of the shoots all [ __ ] or you know I mean and a lot of times it's because there's a bunch of people who are trying to make money in the industry and they did the exact opposite if they would already have like dr. wheeler is this a doctor will is that doctor really this doctor dr. Willard pH of Doc's really finished yeah like bunch of [ __ ] that you don't really need but the fact that you got the single product I think is super it's actually the way to go in a sense because it's much easier to promote a single product and prove it than it is to try to like have a whole line and actually there's one good thing that here well also it makes sense but what you have one if you have a product what we interested make all be all product what I have five but I think you should do is you should you should have my kinda odd if you came up and talked to about three or four different nutrient lines right we have a couple that we work with and thing is have them do side by sides with their particular product that they are already used to and they know exactly what's going on and then they can really see you could if you do test results with those people who are already doing like you know their own test results like I think we can get to I don't let me people that would do you think you could really well other thing is it would it would be interesting because there's products like bud swell which is a guys who have been around for a long time and one of the brands that I work with they they use it specifically in their professional formula just even though it's just like an oldest product to add a [ __ ] woods you know it I mean it's like literally two farmers who makes the [ __ ] with paddles and cover old swimming pools it's like it's some funky [ __ ] and I still worm castings is there anything better than worm castings and kelp yeah tomatoes organically well that's you know and as and and that in this sum you know these guys just get some great guano and they [ __ ] mix these things up and then they're go snowboarding the rest of the year that's their business model you know I mean it always has been paper paper labels paper labels hand written [ __ ] you know I mean it's like it's very much like your grandfather style you know just like not putting too much but that product works awesome and the fact that they're now being recognized by major you know by brands I think that'd be great waited like co-brand to your products because it's just another you know it's an easy additive and I think we could we can help you with that maybe I'll definitely works oh yeah I'll definitely try to link you up with a couple of people that I know that are doing nutrient lines and see if we can get them to you know advocate it and put it towards their pro get people to use your product because like I said I had guys raging about it and that was the kind of what I need the guy's been growing 12 years of the same room he knew his number so well and he said that he normally gets normally gives like 12 pounds he gets 13 and a half pounds 14 pounds but but way better you know what I mean like that was a huge thing he's like like holy [ __ ] so he noticed an increase in quality yeah it was that somebody who's like really you know here's the thing an increase in quality will often lead to increase in yields yeah and it wasn't because it was if you have an increase in the health of the plant you know that's just across the board and I think that's a huge thing overall health is way nicer to like kelp does all that kelp will increase everything because the it can make the plant healthier which then in turn makes everything else healthier so it increases everything creasing everything this thing I'm like I said it my miracles 2% 4% li if I just noticed any different I'm like oh cool that's awesome so well I was tell us I'm just it's not it's not miraculous now we say you know at the time you know think about it what people first started using fertilizer they thought wow it was miraculous and I tend to think that's the same concept here is if we're just we're doing something a little bit differently it's just helping the plants better utilize that that fertile it's not anything really all that crazy it's you know it's not new to us but it is new to you so that we fellowmen yeah a general theory is it the fact that but you have a lot of wasted fertilizer because people like don't understand it properly or doesn't uptake as well or is it the fact that it literally needs less fertilize like it's all used in both methods but it's used more its utilized more efficiently so I think it's both actually I do I think it's both especially when you start looking in the soil and also up taking delivery is a big part of it not you know like just they fit yeah the efficiency of what's already there yeah we feel a lot bigger root growth out of out of germination as well and I'm sure that's got to be a big that's got to be a big part of what we're seeing although you know we're elemental to be tested like we had a guy in Mozambique didn't start spraying it on a tomato say a weak war and he damn near doubled the amount of yield now he wasn't using any fertilizer but you know that was week four he started spraying it on there well it's hardly wow it's hard to correlate any of that like I had one guy tell me about a keep PK booster tripled his here yields any threats um he wasn't using any fertilizer also but uh I like I said it I have to put it to cannabis you know I I don't doubt that if it increases the health of the plant it could definitely help I'm just curious to see in what way it helps just you know is it fatter is it denser just shinier well you know it'd be great I mean it'll be great for you to see it I guess I'm interested as well because obviously I know Chris puppet well you know British Columbia shitty but I know up and years ago the 88 we're talking is this too like 95 notes I know some guys in in Denver who are using it as well there's a high tech art supply guy in Denver are they're doing some really interesting stuff too I have to say if you're really curious about it these guys they play around with it a lot and we've got we've got one guy here to kind of blow out his plants he's blown out the fertilizer and fertilizer sack what kind of fertilizer I don't know that's really important guys you have very different feeding programs you have some people that are mentally have some people that organic you have some people that are different different substrates so you would think that you're gonna have different effects on different applications can be pretty dramatic yeah I don't I don't know all the did you manic I know calling me and he said he says hey this is what I've started playing around with you said I found that it can absorb more fertilizer and we have nito's 1800 ppm at at the budding stage yeah so it can handle more or can absorb more it could absorb more and he doesn't so he's emerged so he's so he's measuring the the ppm and then doing the feeding and then he's measuring the ppm after yes and I'd recommend giving him a call at garden supply in Commerce City you know like I said those guys are all doing a lot of research this one I wouldn't call it like peer-reviewed research but they do know we don't have that we have I took my best shot and as far as I know I think you know when we accept it I know HTG we just we just need like peer review is not a thing we just want to know let you try it hard and you did your best to think to do it well you're like and what what are you and anecdotal evidence is really all we have in reality yeah and almost everything obviously you sort of connect with the basics the macronutrients once you get past that and a few the micronutrients there's a lot of anecdotal and if it's evidence and and that's acceptable if it's presented done like presented well like I said like I only need ballpark key numbers you know I mean just as long as I know that whoever did the test was like hey as far as we know do did this right this was a baseline you know I you know the you know as you like to say proof is in the pudding yeah I know William has been doing it for about he's been using it for about three years now I mean they're they carry it and he's been playing around with it for about three years I thinking you know the hell of a lot more about it honestly than I even do when it comes to cannabis so much locks period sure yeah cool yeah and I think it's it I think it's one of those things where a little faith goes a long way too with this stuff too because if you come in with like you know a fad like there's another product called photosynthesis from a microbe company called Mike I know this is plus and it's like it's it's way more its way obviously it's microbe microbial base it's not gonna be the same as your product at all but yeah but it is like miracle [ __ ] that doesn't nobody knows how it works you know I mean when it comes to like you spray it on the plants or you give it to him its root zone and then within like an hour your shits like standing up like wow like praying to you and say you're like I think some people know it works and you know and it's one of those things where you're like he signs you might come back an hour later and go like it literally made me call the guy up I know like what the [ __ ] first time I ever had any microbes like before I knew what microbe was worried I was like here microbes I'm like small stuff and they like try it no like I saw I think as I can however like my plants took her right up was like yeah I was on to something I don't even know there's like 10 years ago probably right no microbes are overlooked the part of the whole treatment I think now they're really oh now they're not yes it wasn't even a thing for a long time and then I remember like thinking it was gimmicky the first or anybody else is there I mean obviously there's nobody else in the market with your particular product but is there other plant catalysts that are like calling himself my catalysts that are side by side on the shelf or anything that you know because I ever really heard no no nothing no nothing like that you know we own the name of course but the name actually he's been relatively new I mean I just I came up with a name well actually our guy in Canada came up with a name and register slapping it on like two or three years ago so and of course dr. Willard's there's nothing else like that either so no if you're buying it it's our stuff honestly I'm not aware of anyone who's selling anything no just right you just want to do is another if there was another product that was like similar as far as like the idea like using it to you know help facilitate because there are there are naturally obviously we're talking about kelp and things like that your other products that are like you know cover a lot of the same interesting elements but they're but in such a simple form and the stability is what gets me because I was like when you were saying 10 years I am you know literally I've known people who have had you know five year old bottle and still you know and I was like it's at one one-thousandth bro it's hard to well it's just hard to like that sighs another imagine that it works you know and then but still to this to if you're saying that at ten years and they were still seeing activity activity that's pretty awesome and that was that was my grandmother she could want to get argue that but he was being defiant it he was the best in it though science isn't real there at this flat that's right so the thing is climate change I have been real yeah warm isn't even a thing imagination so so how many stories you guys distributing to now you know I have no idea now basically the way it was really on those metrics I believe really more because he doesn't but typically the way it works with us is we sell just sell exhibitors and they're like warehouse people and then those warehouse people then sell to everyone else and so actually I did I honestly just started this week looking like Amazon cousins like holy crap they're like a hundred people on Amazon alone selling our product right well I mean people get the hustle on hopefully it's more than more of those people are doing it for the right reasons they're doing because they realize that's the thing is a lot of these products you know they have I'm looking at right now they've read good rings there's making a small profit being distributors that's what they're doing they're just being little mini distributors right they got a bunch of products but they're all like lollies guys like really good ratings yeah so I mean yeah it's good if it's if it's people that are you know getting involved just because they know the product works and they got their buddies that are growing or whatever and keep moving some stuff around I mean like it was like it was so about hydrants I'm earlier that's like one of those products but you don't really need it but it really was nice and it was very stable which is weird because most enzymes are really blame and they know yeah it was oddly opening two years later and it's the same it was well it would get a little bit darker so I get a little tinge to it and and but if it still work it was like wow okay I really was and so that stability is like one of the keys and the I surely know what's in it no nobody then again it's a [ __ ] same deal where you're like I don't know what's in it no I don't know but it works everybody started it and you're like once in a while you don't have it you're like when everything was 1,400 a pound but it got really really expensive MSRP what's the MSRP on dr. Willard's right now how does that work that you what was the MSRP right now for the we were like a top 45 at 45 bucks Accord a quart hello you know what's the you said two ounces per gallon yeah two ounces not per gallon no two ounces Perez yeah yeah Reza's fifty each of your residents fifty or hundred gallon it but what if it's you know I really my res is 850 yeah really so it doesn't matter between 50 or over serious oh but it is so it's 850 yeah we have people with people who love it and my grandfather said I'm saying what's this Cobb really think about it if you think about it logically water doesn't have any walls so it's somehow altering that water and it will filter all the way down through the tank and so he said that yeah we have people that put it like a pond I mean it's it's that much I mean I think about it so if I go there you literally the dilution rate so okay so because I have flags all the place we're now so I don't need two ounces what if one ranky gallon can I put a chlorine in what that if there's no walls and whatnot why can't I just put like a teaspoon into a gallon why don't any two ounces well there's a amount that that needs to have and have an impact and it works all they work like it is like synergy like they work off each other in the water kind of thing I'm sorry could you like it works off like it works off itself in the water like there's some sort of synergy kind of thing like yeah I don't like I said I don't really know we still don't know why it works or how it works we still don't know that but we do know the you know application we were we use two different two different resumes actually three different resumes well dr. Rees did in in that greenhouse study he used 27 gallon Reza's and 50 gallon Reza's and then he didn't happen flow there was 100 gallons and it was just two ounces every time and it it made no difference and the effectiveness so I I realize this is it's odd that you don't have a baseline but like I'm surprised you have a baseline where you have a pro-rated amount along with two ounces like it doesn't make sense well I really should actually if I were smarter at business I would know no but like no but you said your doctor did the test though so that they would have had to have done that so they would have your basal doctor chances and I intend and you know they would have done a larger program out on the larger amount they're not gonna just write in 27 gallon but how do they see singing arbitrarily and every time you just use two ounces because that's what I told them to use well walkabouts is per reservoir so your doctrine of faith it's just two ounces per res no matter what their size of the res is literally thank you that's my that's what my grandfather said but well that's I mean it's definitely strange but you said they were destined and if someone was testing this and you're talking about this forty percent yield and stuff like that you don't have a base yeah yeah you have to have a basis yeah that was the baseline it was two ounces no matter the first arrest that was the base one two launchers no matter the size of the res so he had three different types of reservoir operations three different operations he used so you got 27 gallons one of them had 50 gallons and one of them had a hundred gallons but he put two ounces regardless of the size of the reservoir but right so that just it just doesn't make sense because I'm a small reservoir whether you aerate it more like you should be able to use less than two ounces this is an impossible thing you would need some sort of fixed amount within of a solid within a liquid like you can't have a fixed amount of dissolved solids it looks and uh some sort of magnetic magic going on in there you should be able to use level right molar amount and you should have to need more definitely same effectiveness it's definitely magic go I'm not saying there's not a wider range of usage but like if you're amusing a thousand gallon rez and you're using a 30 I want like up at a couple times deceives itself more juice up it can't be you're not activating water let's let's let's imagine or something like Howard Prince is like let's change subjects but let's just compared to DMT right well DMT if you have a tiny you know you can barely notice the effects if you do a bigger amount just because it's so effective right off the bat with such a small amount you know I mean so it could be just one of those things and the thing is crazy about DMT is like if you take a test at your fingertips take a hit of it it's at your fingertips and then a militant microsecond because it goes through every cell in your body like geez yeah there's very significant differences so effects at every single dosage that's the worst analogy you know if you inject it yes but if you smoke it you're like oh two hits like yeah but but but at a certain point if you take a bit of time it's already on the fingertips and within its milliseconds you can try it out like I said what I know for sure and that's what I was saying is I I know my grandfather always said it and I know for sure work to 27 gallons I know for sure worked at 50 gallons and I know for sure work to 500 or 100 gallons so I know for sure worked at 5 gallon so I would be safe doing 20 ounces in a thousand well is that so would be safe doing 20 ounces in 1,000 gallon reservoir without like oh yeah like yeah like I'm not say just like I might try literally like made one of 20 and one with to look literally just see if you know to see if you like could see a difference but it just seems to me especially with these large reservoirs that you know if I'm going to do it I would like to have the full effect of it and I don't know what the point of diminishing return is but there has to be some point of diminishing return between 30 gallons and a thousand gallons so yeah thanks we haven't died we didn't see it we didn't see it in the like I said this is what I know for sure we're just a pre she ate that he did you know I appreciate now make it something up and you know no I think I think I think it just to me it sounds more like it clicks a switch you know I mean if it does that what switch tell me what tell me what switch talk about maybe maybe if you polarize the water you know it could create a current it could it could activate the water but there would still be amount of relative dosage relative to the amount of water once again there's no walls now I'm not saying there's none rugged bit I don't I don't know the science behind it all I know is that's what my grandfather said and that what we I'm not saying it's not working and I'm not yeah I'm not saying it doesn't work I just want to like try to maximize it out it's it's uh no I think that's cool I mean look like I said it's probably not good business for me to say hey put two ounces into a thousand gallon tank it's not good business for us and if it gets a little same result yeah there's like half it's horrible business because like how you're losing business but I have it's amazing business because you look wow how could I not look at that value everyone who runs a large reservoir I would have to get it so yeah you can show that it's bomb at the two ounces per thousand gallons I'll pay that now is this like a heavy pour two am ounce or are we talking like like chiles we're like they got the line on it like I used tablespoons so I just use 4 tablespoons ok cool right well I am interested I'm using it and I do believe that it works I'm just genuinely curious the parameters of how it works yes that's cool it's definitely an interesting product for sure in it and I don't remember remember it went the dough see what does it doesn't say on the bottle then it just says 2 it says 2 ounces just hold on tight yeah so maybe it was just because your grandfather see a take 10 milligrams or a hundred milligrams it's like the same no-no so hey guys I've got to get rolling because I've got to take my dad out to dinner tonight my dad is 78 years old and about five minutes past 6:00 he's gonna kill me yeah tell him happy birthday for us for sure do that and when I do want to try your product and I will be honest and fair with it and that like I said but for me if I see any results I'm excited yeah so please do send me an email where you want me to send the product and I will product set it up and how to use it your operation yeah I want to hear what you have to say as always I would also think that if there's bad stuff that I need to know about I need to know about it I'm just curious yeah I'll try it good stuff chewy enough but that helps me figure out where I'm like I said I've never looked at the maracle's you know I mean I'm looking for just any noticeable difference you know means and then that to me is is a big deal so it'll be good stuff you like it cool I'm looking forward to it say congratulations from us and yeah we'll keep an eye out for anybody out there who's listening to the show keep it now for well as well what's your what's the website what's your official website you're the best one that for people to go to this plant catalyst all one word.com it's got all the studies on it if they want to read about the studies that we talked about on this they want to read about the background they can actually read the study that was published and you can you can go in there and you know dr. Reiss explains how we collected the data and what not so if they want some information that's the best place to get it playing catalyst calm okay go that's putting into order it also directs them excuse me they can order it from there - yeah cool sounds good all right man thanks for the thanks for calling in thank you all very much yeah no problems nice talking thank you okay babies thanks that's a lot of questions because like I feel like it there's results actually had so many questions because I actually believe it I believe in that there's results so it's like so I'm genuinely trying like versus I'm not trying to like I wasn't trying to pick them apart like oh you're wrong I'm trying to like well how's this [ __ ] thing work and and the thing is like I said I don't need 47 percent increase in peppers but like if it let's say increases to 3 percent and increases quality a tiny bit which there are things out there that could do that that'd be and the cool part is I mean anything that makes your plants healthier you know right it's helping them notice them noticeably healthier you know for sure everything across the board is going better yeah and there's times when you know there's times are your plans are just not I'm feeling it and then it's I'm surprised you can throw anything at it and it might not work yes I mean there's no way that this is gonna be like a silver bullet we understand that could just be a good tool but it's a having that you know in the toolbox for sure and then top of that I think just the fact that we're talking like a court in a hundred counts I was like pretty much in other way over him we're talking how many ounces he said like two ounces in anything yeah well no but I generally even if you wanted to go top dose let it [ __ ] around different tastes I'm not gonna go crazy but I'm definitely like try a couple different like Devon just yeah yeah again if you can do some scientific side-by-sides for him with some actual give you a quasi scientific side by side yeah we're out top feed it appropriate amount next to a plant that's very very similar and I'll Chuck you them a similar as possible I just have that one differential you pay back for me to douche because oh that's cool no I was very him but like he had good answers for things and he didn't make anything up you didn't like deflect anything like that's why I believed him you know like the reps and people who sell stuff yeah like they deflect or like they'll make [ __ ] up and they like if he didn't have anything no we just don't have that answer right like he only gave facts that they were vetted and I appreciate that and you're not supposed to make the other [ __ ] up but like I was most curious cuz I really leave like there's results the question is like how good is it and then I'm excited to try that I don't anything that someone that I trust it's more free [ __ ] but I do you love free [ __ ] Italy has old stuff from the show take home I think my guests I've got so many all right so so now I'm curious to you though this guy who thinks it's his show over here it's cold you forgot hey get off McCord miss dude they listen to you all the [ __ ] time you're on the show like constantly that's not even me that's me that's just the thing yeah but I mean you're stepping on my feet no stepping on my court over here so did you get somebody got questions there was this question a short chord [Laughter] Hayward's okay bye you might have to yeah so yeah so you've been you've been busy you've been a busy boy over an ethos yeah we have actually which is it's been really fun it's been a it's been a really fun some some some hits he had some hits of the banana hammock was probably big hit Mandarin cookies really took off the sheer kind was a thing cut above dispenser he was hammering it out and they had just people coming in there and they won some local awards and stuff that were pretty cool and but uh you know like our social media helped us tremendously like we've never really spending money on advertising anything but also like you have to get seeds out there and then like it takes it like about a year then all of a sudden like you know what yeah pretty good you know and then so you have some people follow other people it is wave so like you released you released a strain and like it goes good and four or five months later it picks up a little bit but then like eight ten twelve months later if that's really where the wave comes where you have people who are actually buying the weed from someone or smoking the product or seeing a friend growing it and getting a clone and that's where you know waves take off yeah that was the that was the problem back in the day which was like everything was weird because you know like say early 90s mid 90s people who come over for the cup they buy your seeds and you wouldn't see him for a year and then after years the Grammy tag 27 seconds later right like what is bar like dude my hands in the picture exactly have you detected and so that cool that I filed 4000 like seven every and so the and so the whole thing that was like you know you got these like reports back occasionally and it was really like sparse he'd sell you know hundreds of packs and you get one guy would come back and tell you if I can story compressive and of didn't start him yet or you know what it's like oh my god come on guys sure but there'd always be like you know one guy come back give you a report and I mean that's kind of when almost all the companies thrived on because the testing locally was I was skewed and and you know difficult and most people just went from still group from her purpose what's your well it's so different now because like what a lot not just social media but the expansion of the laws to where timing-wise we ended up like a lot in East Coast in a lot of metric systems so it's like it's not something that could happen before we were like oh in Maine we're huge in their metric system because one person happened to buy a bunch of packs like two years ago get him on there and like so there's some random cool things you're like what like we're laying in Florida when three of the five gross yeah you know well that's the crazy part now like we become like a much bigger brand much more quickly you know with Instagram like if Europe if you see so on Instagram for every day for six months that's forever you should take 15 20 years like build a reputation you know but I mean well you're gonna talk about earlier you're gonna see these I mean some of them are strictly hype so there's not much behind it you know you know we have to still deliver that's the key to the whole thing so I mean that's been that's been with you guys put a lot of [ __ ] that's other thing it gets called out quickly though hype now doesn't last very long right because like it takes like six months before the hype is over cuz really like [ __ ] that [ __ ] yeah NASA's long very quickly very quickly I think I think I've noticed and that's the thing about the whole social media world is like you know we all we know each other or we see each other around there's so many breeders out there that are you know who knows what they're [ __ ] that they're just like a breeder with the with the name on Instagram and distributors don't know where they are well the reality is that about Instagram is not a business model it's actually just a sure about that well it is it's more people to make a lot of money by the same legally it's not illegal Kim Kardashian's not legally it's it's it's a lot of seed companies only exist on their back it up don't trust I get interesting on its own it's not a business model they understand to believe that because you have an Instagram account at one time Kardashian do but but there are plenty of people that's gonna worth yeah there's plenty people that that's their literal structure of their whole thing because there is no filed paperwork there's no you know sure this model of any sort no no I guess it's definitely like a new thing a new hustler Instagram people like we a lot of people I hit us up like we get a discount about five packs we're gonna sell them like it's not a distributor yeah right you know by five that's not how it works I'm like wait are you hustling packs and they're like yeah like it's legal time and it's better than weed and like sweet yeah no but now I am like I saved five packs at some but like it's like I think like a pack hustles a thing on Instagram but also like people just random pollen Chuck and making a pack for anything well the problem the problem now is that it's definite thing a lot of people are doing the you know the idea of like okay every single seed bank up and when one of them's gonna give me a free pack of seeds of some sort you know they did and they'll hate you up with you know you know your stories of buying or whatever [ __ ] you and I'm sure you've heard this story exact the vet the fake vets is the one that's like I get all these fate I'm a vet blah blah blah blah help me out and like I look into it and they'll go and you're like [ __ ] and you'll see people like oh this guy's a fake I'm like like you know what right you know and I like giving free stuff away I could genuinely enjoy it well you know I I has it you know always back in the day I was always kind of like the same thing like a peach I always say if you come to me I will give them to you I'm not gonna [ __ ] oh dude I'm not gonna Santa Claus if you like I'm not gonna I'm not gonna send of deer because that's what do you know you're gettin closer you gonna write to my mom or our mail stuff I tell you like I'm not good at that you know I've did people you just said you sell seeds I'm like not me I've never died just don't even mail stuff in general yeah but exactly the same kind of thing but it's a there's a lot of people asked there's this gammy type thing I got to a point on my Instagram where I can't actually answer messages from people I don't know it's like I get over a hundred a day and ninety five of them are asking for something for free it's just yeah sucks yeah well it's early or spam or something it's a lot of people fish it you know [Music] no it's look it's navigating our part but the bottom line is I'm happy with it because I'm able to expand my brand but also what I get to do is a lot of my pictures are all these other people who I don't even know growing my stuff and I'm sharing their pictures so it's like it's not just showing what I do with the gear it's showing what this is what regular people do in closets or in Kansas or in this or commercial rows and so I think it's kind of cool like that is something Instagram gets to do is they very quickly like you know some strain came out in December at the Emerald Club and people are already you know showing all their different pictures of it now in Instagram and sigh dude that just came out like three days ago like in December but like yeah it's harvest it's all right now so you can catch on quicker you can vet it you know so i don't know i think is upsides and downsides it's a tool you know but I enjoy it because it brings a lot of dialogue we have a lot of I like bringing up you know subversive stuff to get people thinking about the constructs who runs who runs only one who's ever made it social media post okay yeah yeah it's one-man show like yeah seven thousand seven thousand a hair bow bow post whatever I may have ever seen one my posts and I handwrite everything and nothing's cut and paste because like well sometimes just put very little I'll just put a picture of boom mega sometimes like every 10 pictures or so like I just really don't want to talk about so like I do like bringing up subjects sometimes it's basic sometimes it's you know just bringing up stuff it's a little controversial whatever but the whole point of that is just to get people actually talking about it because I looked into it there's a lot of presumed science I guess you could call it in cannabis people like this is science cannabis I'm like no it's not they get all mad I'm like find a book where it says that so you know I like yeah I guess although I saw that like people get like Google Google stuff that's all I just googled something I saw that I saw that my contention that is intensely dated like trigger people I was like like I have an impregnable contention that breeding and feminized seeds is better than breeding with males I I did that just to get people go home I don't know if that's true I have a little bit of evidence that think that may be true short term for sure yeah well term I have no idea but that my whole point was let's argue about it let's talk about it because I what what what I did was I actually talked to a plant physiologist and I talked to a plant geneticist and they told me there's literally no science at all that says that male female breeding is better there's nothing to support that at all there's nothing to counter that female I'm gonna say the other way around there's literally nothing done period yeah but but there is there's a lot of stuff on s wanting mm-hmm that if you don't understand the exact context it does sound like feminizing can make plants weaker but they were just us wanting plants over and over and over and over and they showed that it could became weak versus I'm talking about crossing two different females and a hybrid and then finding that money Fino and then finding the parallel sister to her and breeding those two like an f2 and said or took our - because it's reversed but instead of guessing even at all like alright this is the one perfect you go through 100 of me like this one's almost exactly the same you cross those two and now you almost homogenized a strain in one crossing and now I could pick all my favorite fee knows and we're doing all these are twos and I'm gonna release all that my favorite fee knows of all my strains and in a homogenized form and people like oh you're bottle necking the strains above what yeah I could still cross other stuff I'm also to say that homogenizing and stabilizing Australian is bad is insane you're like oh at f5 no you could do it that way but no we don't want you to stabilize the strain through feminine feminized see what are you talking about you know Shanti Baba back in the day that was great that I'm a [ __ ] demon right now if your if your goal is to do what you said there in time stabilization and homogenize ation period of specific phenotypes or specific varieties that happen to be fantastic and not talking about s wanting them I'm talking about doing the f1 f2 f3 process except using reverse and also we're vetting the females we're stress testing them and making sure they're good before using them and stuff like that we're not just breeding with him right away right what's using well depends I mean if you're talking about something that's like a clone only that you're trying to save then you know you're you're you're obviously not working outside of the outside of the genetic game pool of those that plants so you're you're gonna increase stability and like homogenize ation like you're looking for in line or that crossing or what do you mean the way you're talking about it like I think that makes sense but at the same time everything's a saying everybody I think everybody took it more as you're saying that superior this is what people did here they took it as something as an affront to them because this was my point there's no science everyone's like you're if you're going to go against science this is my entire point and this was not a hypothesis I have no evidence that's what hypothesis is not presenting something I asked for a contention which is Lilly an argument by definition I'm asking you to argue and what I'm saying is I cannot argument it like you know yes or no depending on which side you want to oh and I'll take either side I know you're gonna like you in jump entitled let's pick pick a subject I'll pick a side I don't care but I'll take people switch so but my point was my and when I when I got to the actual biologists the PhDs on there we got really get down to some real good [ __ ] so if you got into that 500 people trolling but there's some really [ __ ] good information and we found out there's literally nothing published in the history of cannabis on male-female braiding versus female breeding there's nothing published in plant history on male female breeding versus female female breeding in any plants period there was like what about bananas and what about this know this these are all s one case there's no actual stabilization creating new constantly bringing in new genetics we're not talking about s ones we're talking about back crossing in line breeding just using females using vigor to induce this pollen it's a sex expression isn't as if you a therm Aphrodite has to do with athlean in gibberellic acid it's all this it's just a ratio so there's no reason not to breed the f2 is the most difficult problem one in the entire process when using males for me because usually when I use a male in the f1 I already know it's about ask man so Google might in my mouth now I got so left to you I often will use multiple males that I think are gonna be amazing well you have a better chance if you write cover all babies right most likely you choose the Terr piece four or five and one of those is gonna be this is the best ever and you're gonna cake it's gonna come up okay but I'm saying is find the best one period and no guess find the other one that's just like it that's it and it's done and in less than a year you four modernized a strain and I've made this massive yielding so I did a basically without getting too much detailed cookie Kim O'Keefe cross and I got a cookie no caffeine no ogp no the og fee no and one of those massive like very chemi big and blah blah whatever you want to call it where it would take me a long time to be Exodus properly to get that size and get all that quality back well guess what I have one in the room that's almost identical you know because if you could put hundreds of them you're gonna find them even if you do outliers you do hundreds of females you gonna find the exact copy and then boom there you go as long as they're not too extreme outliers there almost homogenized on the out on the f2 and here's the thing like oh what it's prone to her me know that's every single plant is as based on the genetics and its stress tests is whether it's prone to her me nuts genetic so once you make that plant you test that plane whether it's made for male female or or femme and you take that plant on its own merit and there's this is this plant a breeder and you stress it well I'll spray a little silver one time and see if any nanners come out we go to three weeks long and see if any nanners come out things like that once we qualified the plant I don't care where it came from so what I do is I find these identical plants I qualify them and if they you know actually right now was crescendo I have six of the same one I'm going to go through all through them I'm gonna choose at the end and then the two that are best vetted the most stable the most consistent I'm gonna breed those two to make my are two and you know it's it just makes sense and people join everyone who argued with me argued based on nostalgia and emotion and and everyone's like you think you're better than me Mike dude I don't I don't like you better than you I'm not I didn't invent making feminized seeds I'm not saying it's not the process I'm saying genetically speaking just based on the fact it's easier to see all the expressions of a female than it is a male there's an the most important one which is intersex expression is the easiest identifying a female that's the hardest one to know on a male you can pull a lot you could Terps you can predict on the male stacks the height the vigor the morphology the routing it's a lot of things but you can't get that subtle nuance when you do 100 seeds that makes that one or two oh my god those two are so special you can't pick that out in that mail I mean it's more like with males yeah there they come I don't know don't quote an art we're talking about nostalgia it doesn't even make sense and I promise you there's nothing anywhere in plant breeding that says there's anything different in DNA in the male and female except for a Y chromosome which produced three days after the seed comes up that's it that's why there's no studies because it's not a real science only countess people think it is there's no plant scientists physiologist plant geneticist who think this is even a discussion hmm only canvas people because of nostalgia like you're like I'm upsetting the system no [ __ ] sorry I think it's also it's not a real system its perception at all I think everybody who likes to grow cannabis and he's all about stability right we just don't get it's too personal timeout civility genetically means a modernization it has nothing to do with intersex traits so let's just all that out there cuz I mean they pick on that so right so we're looking for consistency yes we're looking for non intersex traits we're all looking for that for sure I've been doing for 25 years with male females it's not like I haven't done it I appreciate the art I have some good males I've made some really good meme Alfie most rings it takes me gears I've made thirty group strains to test over 30% that are massive yielders this year because I tested them all as females because we would go through thousands of seeds and find the prize cuts and combined prize cuts and hybridize them that just makes more sense than trying to you know vet a male with all these different ways hoping you know run 2,000 of these seeds bring it back the best three you run these to thousands of bring back here I mean and let's cross those and guess what they and you know what also breeds true teat see you can't test that as well you could see what strikey but you give me to 30% strains and we cross them you know what the amalgam THC in those what have mini grow them is it's about 30% it breeds pure you can predict the cannabinoids so when you have two females you have all the expressions all the cannabinoids you put them in different rooms have a couple different growers grown go one two three weeks long they'll one you know I mean so you can you could really pull all that expression the other thing is that you can see everything that's recessive in that plant by s wanting it and running it and you see every recessive trait in that plane yeah I mean it's uh I think I think I think a lot of growers are like I said nostalgic about about I get it they mail breeding in general and and I mean also we we don't want to go down the rabbit hole everybody like it's great when certain people go down the hole for it sorry yeah but at the same time I mean obviously not everybody will fall in line and be like oh no no I promise you anymore that like 99% of people within five or six years when actual science is done because no it hasn't there's no been no reason to do the science right and not saying I'm gonna do unequivocally unequivocally it's already shown that the DNA is identical and although through epigenetic you can [ __ ] up the DNA by reversing it improperly all this is based on all of the genetics they're used is written in Somis book so much he said he used coil silver he's gibberellic acid and he wasn't able to get pollen properly so he and all of his people would find plants that at day 60 put off pollen because that was perfect it didn't put off till then well that's a genetic trait so the entire Dutch system and the chem system was all based on all of these plants that they specifically chose for Hermine and that's why all those plants hermia are they they call it her me it's not to intersect straight so the entire process was built on these plants that they chose ones for intersex traits because they didn't understand how to get the pollen properly otherwise so what I do is I take a plant that in five years is never shown a nanner ever even at one time I forgot to harvest it and it went three weeks long I guarantee if I reverse that it's solid as [ __ ] period one question from the chat room for Colin yeah they want you to elaborate on the XY chromosome in the seed at three days okay so we've been testing seeds to see are a lot of our theories up until recently because the Philo's or that you could actually stress a plant into becoming a male or becoming a hermie which we haven't proven yes or no whether becoming her me that can still be a thing but as soon as the the seed pops up you can start taking swabs of those leaves it takes about three to five days after it sprouts out and that plant will produce a y-chromosome or it won't period I think that's also where there's any by the way with stress can still [ __ ] it up and make it hurt her man actual math that it can produce next one why through stress so not like it's guaranteed but you are guaranteed if it's a why it's a male you have an accent like you're guaranteed at that moment in time to is where you you know temperature is really important there's certain things that really can affect at that point and that's where the first four or five days 100% play I've actually thought it used to be two or three weeks kind of like it was a lot of discussions we had but in fact I think now based on this it's the first four or five days yes also even possibly from the moment it germinates yeah all the way until it actually produces that chromosome where it first the leaves come out yeah and that's and that's where call seven or eight days from actual like putting in the maybe in the water or the think you know to cold means more males you know there's like certain things I haven't done enough testing no way to say that I've seen for sure I don't know too cold to do more males and and also overcrowding to can can be at that same situation I've heard that so several people that sound like they know what they're talking about so put a bunch in a pot together because you think that's gonna help out you get more males than if you just like set him at their own pot I just feel like got a ton of ridiculous amount of seeds like all the way like I start with a few in the pot I live to a bunch just to see just been [ __ ] around I got like 40 different banana hammocks all pHEMT coming out of one pot just forty colas all stripped up all the way just to see what happens I still don't know what's gonna happen but we'll see if any intersex traits or something pops up because it is definitely like a little over credit but I found that the best number for the big pot was six I think twenty thirty was doing thirty was six six those six seeds and a fifteen gallon pot worked out amazingly don't top any of them kind of strip them down give them like a month month and a half and they get huge and then flip and it looks like just one big huge plant and then like you can call one if you don't like it you know any berry if they're like squeeze them all together and you start a minute yeah you just started in a small pot and then you like so we started in a square pot and you put them in their friend I like through three weeks then put them in a fifteen right so it looks like they're out you know growing outward mmm so I could actually I'm actually taking pictures and documents yeah but they come out like this so like and then so also you know seeds go floppity so we'll give them like eight inches and we keep putting Moore's cocoa here so it really looks like they're just coming from one place and coming out there you go one place don't come to man those kind of things usually I mean the problem is when you do multiple play by the way I'm just messing around I don't know this is a good thing yeah I don't condone this I've always seen come back to me in ten weeks I've always seen where you know like the one turns into the Beast I've seen that before yeah here's the thing I feel like that's so some strains especially if they've height issues in some route faster not not a good idea once again I'm not condoning this I did go strains though I thought that uh we're like didn't have a lot of height differential so like but I have had a lot of seeds like I had to call or like pull out and put in pots and stuff like I'm learning like I definitely know that not any of these is the way to go but like I'm learning that some of this works pretty well you know I mean like none of them will be perfect but like I say it's fun it's interesting you know I have a lot of seeds so sure hey honestly almost everything I learned was either a mistake I made or someone I know made we had to figure out what happened or [ __ ] around and then figure out what happened after that's almost everything I've learned like really it like it and then like you do your research but like the research is all based on all that [ __ ] around and you're like you know what that thing keeps happening let's figure out what that is like you know like people asked what's the best place to learn on four she's not a lot of great sources I said people dive in you know start growing starts and countering on stuff you know it all starts with the seed doesn't it do III think that or when I grow propagation maybe but I really love the way seeds grow I love seeds I'm like a seed addict I'm all those people that like I turned my addiction into my professional right eye because I couldn't stop buying seeds for 25 years and ended up having really good seed collection but like I made seeds because I wanted more seeds and couldn't afford to buy more seeds they say you know he became an addict to know your and now my collection is there I'm jealous of myself I want to go back to like five years ago what dude look at this bag he's that but it's fun it's like I could trade other with other other you know breeders and sometimes like someone like I don't even know I know loot here come over some special pack it's fun welcome to that I've done show who we got to the house pop how's it going hi Scott oh good good I'm just listening to the the controversy between Mel pond and yeah there's totally controversy yeah yeah did you you follow the thread online or you just heard the one today today on YouTube okay cool so uh what's your what's your take on it are you guys talking about that open forum open bring it on I had something that I enjoyed talking about and it's it's something that like I said it's a contention of mine where it's like I have not proven this I believe it to be true short term I have no idea if it works long term but I am welcome to questions like I because that's actually where I'm getting a lot of information just people coming up with your questions so what do you want to know oh cool yeah yeah I just wanted to like put my what I found out was with it and this is all I had on my observations by the way so I don't have sort of hard Evans so your observations I do so I'll take all the anecdotal evidence I can get so what have you seen Thanks yeah so like I think I agree with my uncle a couple years ago and he grew up in a rural sing in the mountains okay and he was a you know he's like an old-school grower you know he didn't buzz at me with the soil in the dirt kind of thing yeah well on the dirt yeah in the ground okay yeah big plants like one pounder five pounder oh yeah have like eight pound plant okay biggest [ __ ] yeah cool yeah and they're pretty nice and like a plan it's already nice yeah yes only pollinated himself and he is like you know not mature mellow plants and then some of them like where seeds that I've gotten from AG G okay right you know like they propagated themselves not yeah and like yeah between my friends and I we found out so far like with the like the hermie plant that got pollinated from a hermie or a plant let's say a female okay so let's define what a hermie is and I'm not all to berate you I'm just gonna just clarify so hermaphrodite is a plant that has both X and Y chromosome and it's pretty much consistently throwing up both pistols and male flowers the whole way yeah versus there's females that throw intersex traits which there's females that throw pollen sacks here and there so okay it's down sometimes it's hard to tell outdoors cuz you know it's a little itchy but typically you have females that are throwing pollen sacks but you know there are actual Mac right stuff too so just traffic I just want to clarify that a little bit yeah so sorry go on yeah so like so from the Hermey plants that has the traits of the male and female we found out from growing those seeds you know you still get to her me go you could get a bunch of seeds in it right and sometimes you would get like we would get one or two females right that would have layers you know maybe top five season buds here and there right and yeah from that that plant smoking those plants we get it's like a saint I think flavor you know you get a nice flavor but it's not nothing powerful you know lip-smacking the house water is like very fans you know it's like it we just pretty much called it like her me that's so mid Z you know obviously but genetically you know you have this predisposition and it keeps passing along you know which is why I often bag seeds have that same kind of thing day 18 they put out pawn sacking that lateral branch on the bottom and then like I didn't know why that had there that's how the first see okay yes exactly and then from the ones that I found bag he that we propagate themselves but now we get alright Oh like you mean like a random like single seed yeah or you know like yeah I got a chem doctor you know sure exactly yeah and like from those geez I would get the full flavor hoping he exactly the full profile the female plant so those are actual real hermaphrodites who were talking about like yeah earlier yeah that those are actual my friend it's not just sexual expression yeah you know when he's when you love the G sometimes you got to make some sacrifices and I can you see it here there oh it's kind of scary when you say you love the deal I didn't I've heard but do you do that I did it I did it I did it to making there was more right ever whichever it was excited same saying I think it's all brain chemistry definitely definitely got me nervous so so so you're sort of reinforcing his idea that the Damned version had a bit more of a flavor profile like the original fever yeah kind of but like Russell you know the feminized seeds you buy online I would still also get that faint flavor mmm-hmm yes that and once again I'll go back to what soma published you know some are published to use these plants that that gave this and it gave a huge up rise to all these plants that were then used for another 10 or 15 years that carried this this gene so the entire feminized line out of Europe is purely predicated upon these plants that have intersex traits and possibly our actual Macra bites but it was it was from the original selection that they did from the beginning having said that chem dog they were smiling near Manila Manor it'll happen that's also genetic tree cam don't forget sometimes a [ __ ] little branch perhaps you'll have a whole branch that about one out of ten and you're like what the [ __ ] is this about one at ten Kim dog crosses is so [ __ ] up yeah so there's definitely something here I'm trying to actually remove that I'm doing an experiment but back crossing it's a bunch of old skunks and then seeing if that's somehow I'm like I [ __ ] here's the thing I've able to cross with the skunk and make it and get rid of the the nanner stuff but if they had lost a little it does it's not quite chem now so I got a back cross it again but I'm trying to get like that man that's stable or Kim I haven't gotten it yet but I'm working on it all right it's fun but yeah I think you know anecdotal evidence is all we have and like a unfortunately is not a lot of good discourse on social media we have a little bit on my Instagram page we get a little ornery sometimes but we do try to like answer questions but we got to share each other's you know stories and stuff like that and that's that's where a lot of these conclusions come from a lot of live live evidence to choose from here yeah exactly that's what I'm trying to do is just put my observations out there everything I came to I saw I went right the first time I talked about it was a couple years ago and Adam show his observations that I had made like none of them were things that I had done their observations I've made and other gross only one of the grows that I it was actually one that I was even working it and I was like saw the same thing same thing it was like this weird thing I thought you know so a lot of it's just anecdotal and in and these things come from you know from strange places but like I said my contention this is one of those things I believe that stable breeds stable in the sense that intersects traits and a little bit hairy with little hairy you know way regardless but once we're regardless of where that plant came from what you have a plant and you know whether that plants strong or not strong blah blah blah then it's are gonna breed how it is regardless if it came from a female or a male but yeah exactly so particularly we're talking about hybridizing and filial breeding not s ones in at least short-term I'm noticing that my are twos versus an f2 are so much better and just straight consist in this F bro just like yep that's all the same you know so I know at least works now three years from now I'm gonna have some story where I'm like remember how I was telling you blah blah blah well now the whole line collapsed because I thought you'd learned that I needed the Y chromosome I don't know I missed it but for now I feel very strongly about typically whatever I'm talking about but for now I feel very strongly about this because because I'm seeing about two years of results and I'm seeing other people and they're having results that are same and like it's just so easy to predict where I could just take to bond like ohiolink up later and a high yielding cup winner and we're both stable and we're gonna breed them guess what you get really good [ __ ] strength every time yeah cool name damn it after dessert boom you win yeah we're now two desserts people we're running out of desserts we're gonna have to be like brand names like snackers that's Snickers it's not satisfying yeah I know well thanks huh thanks for going in he's in the mountain ice talkin to you we're gonna go now look thanks for contributing thank you ladies straight from space yeah so there you go you had one one call in for Colin there you go show is by exact I said yeah I saw I saw you see I see tryin I already has a couple calls yeah driver yeah yeah you know there's no point there's no point of me pushing back right now so I'll let you I'll let you do you think a few months I know that's for obviously profit raisers for obvious reasons a they let me out yeah well what does it look good well one of the main one of the main reasons that I wanted to get to other shows for the obvious that we're gonna be hosting your event yeah she's all right we can talk about that let's talk about the soiree and what that's all about because I know now there's gonna be way too many people because everyone's going to see the show okay well if you literally locked in or the ones that already sent me an email yeah and then of course you have you have like a plus ten and you'll have a plus one maybe maybe if it's a [ __ ] plus half you can't so here's what we're doing so I act into this it's not like I came up with an idea for a party cuz I don't party I don't even go out but so we were doing a female hunt and I was looking for crescendo I was looking for a few different phenotypes for crescendo and I hadn't actually grown weed in a while I was at pollinating everything and if people don't know much about the Colorado weed industry sex as far as selling it so like I don't even know a new sells weed anymore it's [ __ ] weird I'm like really I don't know any weed salesman's so I decided I'm just gonna give it away so what I need is I need input so it's like a lot of different strains I'm trying to pick to see what I'm gonna put in the cannabis cup and weeds not really worth anything anymore here so uh well have a good tasting party so we're gonna have a bunch different strains and a bunch of different like feedback if you want you don't have to give it down little cards if it's optional and like if you have if you would like something if we hate it you know we get feedback in like every 15 minutes gonna like a little grams of this I'm also like it's a BYO glass you know we'll have papers and blonde traps and bunch of nice Afghan Kush and some oh geez out for rolling and stuff like that it's a little old fashioned pre cannabis cup party it's just a nice gathering people like it's chill feel free to bring your own beverages what will be supplying some basics and they'll be plenty for you if you don't bring anything but a little potluck you know never hurt anyone you know bring us neck you know bring a nice sixer but no like it's a look I see once I thought about it I was like this it was a no-brainer because like there's just no good cannabis just get togethers like it unfortunately Colorado's not a good place that allows that I was like that sucks you just can't go hang out and smoke just talk yeah yeah I think hopefully that talkative that's all gonna change I really I genuinely really hope that like I like and I don't even like going out I don't like people yeah especially but uh but uh well like I really think it's a thing because like it already kind of makes like when you smoke it makes you kind of reclusive you want to be around like-minded people but like you'll go out to socialize in a cannabis club but otherwise like I'm not going out yeah well you know I mean it's a different body gets more and more difficult that's for sure like like this somehow just like on this show I know a lot of people that we didn't even want any money would get off the couch for the show but in general no I love couches I know I'm at couches bro-bro flat couch yeah alright I lost my because the weeds again this shows gonna be pretty much about yeah people coming in kicking it smoking we can we kicking it with some way to see how you remember it and get feedback and and look you know honestly it's just have fun you know we'll try to get everyone in and whatnot maybe like staggered a little bit maybe have a few people come kebab later kebabs earlier but uh it's just to have a little gathering and just of like-minded people and not be in some lab and drinking bar where everything's gay like gay bars on bars and go to because you're not gay like you know what look I literally like you know in that essence yeah I can't believe you say okay I can't go to a straight bar cuz everyone acts it so in the old fair you know if they act like douchebags I can't handle the douchebag in this douchebaggery like any sort of like downtown toilet bar yeah I wouldn't say can't handle it you crazy stupid its I can't but I really do go to park a bar smoking I don't judge bro I don't judge you're good I'm not saying I'm gonna pick up like that but you like the negative vibes there I got converted by a baby it's all feminized seeds you make or something it's just [ __ ] you up do ya see that totally masculine women twisted you'll see masculinity twisted your psyche there no is it you know actually a friend of mine from few years ago she started taking me to gay bars with her because that was her Jam and her friends and I was like well it's just so much better yeah this is such a different higher quality higher quality better music yeah better conversation and there's you know like it's but there's something about like young men under 25 that are drunk that just saw intrinsically including me whoever it was like when you eliminate that you're like huh you know there you go tip the day for me those genetics gay bars actually true I stand by it yeah I will meet you a blushing bride and we will [ __ ] hang out well no I I have noticed that going out is a chore is man I've always had my own spots go that was way easier but it's your own spot they could just like grab grab a drink with you you know but soon come soon come so we're looking at that's going to be for today the 14th and you need to contact you correct we already had to have contact you already would have had to have contact and there's no more tickets and forget about it so why are we talking about this [ __ ] now it says I haven't told the people I'm gonna rub it in your face so those who already do know or at the same time if you're super duper you know so indicated this one contacted us not obviously you know my endless list sound shortlist if you've got it you know use promo code three or twenty you get three but yeah you know we could actually have you a giveaway if you want to do a couple yeah sure we could do how do we couple pass we do lost the plus one hardest part you have to come up with some crazy like what the contest contest I'd argue with you for like ten minutes I wouldn't whoever argues with pick the subject and decide yeah so yeah I don't even care outside everything like whatever I'll tell you later if I don't believe in I really don't like I'm not an island I just a natural skeptic who's super curious you know like I think it's this final things that my guys basically me thank all the time like I think this is it yeah can't be it I believe so come up if you usually it's like an animal sound or I say it works it we have someone do an impression really the best impression we have five people call in duel Christopher Walken they're all so bad usually that's the problem okay so it's good we can do that you can do that let's see a woman doing Christopher Walken challenge is a challenge that a cherry game up that would be seven two zero three one zero eight two three seven if you want to challenge Colin Gordon to age will also do if you have with this but how we're doing impression off you pick it an accent or an impression and whoever does it better if you beat me then you get it you call it with any impression that you already do and any accident you already do and now if I don't do it better than you you get the ticket how about that that's me on the spot now I'm scared oh now it's gonna get weird all right well that's that's that's a challenge to all challenge challenge wrench shadows Shillong all right that's for a plus one yeah it's it's for a entry to the to the event plus one weeds you all smokes well that everyone gets that that's basically reiterate exam you get to get a buffet and that means you could eat anything you want yeah kids are you Richard alright well any any challenges on oh yeah the kid the kid where's the kid he's not listen to the show the kid could beat you up kid could crush me no kid some whatever does it go to impression what's it what's your goat someone I don't have one oh really helpful your Adam yeah I just do me so keep it here but yeah thank you looking over the years I can do certain things at certain times but I never liked thought of it I gotta keep doing I can do I'm saying impression and almost any accident I've never tried to practice I just I literally hear something and it automatically like mistakenly mimic to the world I'll get in trouble right cuz you're going to ladies major guy to me I'm like yay you're not on purpose I mean I would be behind your back if I thought of it but like I actually now that we're also PC and everything is I get when you go to Chinese food I was like I think every time I ever came out also you get a pack of seeds if you have tried yeah okay pack of seeds is now if up the any anybody yes I'm saying you do your part whatever your real house impression is I don't care who it is right yeah I'm dope [ __ ] now you got a two you've done to all these are quotes complain saying impressions in quotes that's different yeah besides it wasn't referring to a person no that's a problem he actually you know he actually really did change that word a little bit we're actually consciously for the first time I'll I found myself using it other than singing alone in my car when the only like the NW day but then they keep any Akron will do but like other than that like I was never comfortable in yeah I think it was Chapelle is because the humor somehow like put in that con have so much quoting of it but then I had to catch myself might and he actually said something is like you think I'm all offended by it like I was like I don't I didn't get permission it for everyone use the word I was like dick it was weird he's like especially around my kids people like he'll say something like I'm Rick James [ __ ] on my children like it's like this time turn it off anyway no no challenge really the challenge would he have not affected nobody not the key I'm surprised a kid to kill the kid again Amano yeah take him out who's the kid the kid he used to be on the show Ryan which Ryan kid I have like 75 Ryan's in my phone you know I know it's creepy right and a lot of helps to like like yeah we're the only one she says that there you go way up but most of them are yeah I'm yep yeah Ryan's is crazy I actually had a the other day we walked into this place we're working in kids named Ryan and I'm telling him the story about everybody's name right and then all of a sudden as I get around the corner the next kid I'm like way but your name is like Ryan oh my oh my god this is like come on now it's like yeah it's kind of funny we're partners we're both named Ryan and I'm like this is that that's great I looked at my phone and I showed them all the Ryan's ahead I realize it was a Facebook thing at somehow I was like looking at the list we could see it from like a distance and like you'd see like all the you know different names like forty Stephanie's like 32 you're like dude I was like it's a lot of Ryan's I goes the water you notice the bike dude you know like 85 Ryan's and 37 Ryan's with beards that's my wheelhouse you know it's a gay bar obviously so we're back to the game they shave 37 Ryan's beers at the game boy I'm not I'm fully compromised and all that I'm totally comfortable it's I did did I not offer you out of context totally to wear all pink including a to you the other day okay just add a context you did you did volunteered that I'm just fully fully for no reason yeah really for no reason was no reason but I didn't tell you that I'm telling you feminizing and I support feminized seeds and I'll wear pink know where to to to choose to show gay bars and go to gay bars it's pretty much your here's thing I'm 44 and this is where the big difference is 24 year old Colin my psyche wasn't as strong it's not things I've like no no man I don't know about that maybe maybe this but moving out that now it's just like yeah that's funny you know it's just matter if I literally want to do it or not I get out of the house that night but like as far as like going over the topic there's nothing that I don't really get embarrassed like it's just a good foot soak it as you get older thing cuz like I see things that are cool now and I don't even know they're cool literally like oh my god I'm like what the hell is that it's hilarious like that's cool like really like Lily no that was cool okay I don't want to be that so get over think it's getting older just not challenging people no one's coming back at you I can't believe this challenges I thought it was a fun one and I thought I was pretty creative and I basically get a double win I'm gonna get the past I'll keep it you know and I'm taken not him see what we did the animal noises they went to that there they could do that but it was like you know on the spot everyone's got a DeNiro or a walk and all right so anyone in the room who's got something nobody about this talentless rumor how about to be importantly we could do impressions of people in the industry and I can do the entire thing ash him and I'll answer questions about photons anything you want do you want to talk about lighting judge need to talk about photons the electric see the you mole among all humans lumens are for humans okay did you mole is different it's what the between four hundred seven hundred and the aluminium is what gives the better reflection I did a whole joy at Che Guevara I did I did a radio show with him next to me and I did him and he just didn't say anything he's just laugh at the whole [ __ ] time right it likes me and him yeah and their viewing me as him and he's just in there laughing there's a lot of fun his wife is there too so she'd even come in like a little bit one smile so it's wholly validated that I was him yeah and she's like it's pretty good it's like a little higher octave what is pretty good and leash it's just wife we should talk about photons all the time and I was a mini-me I love that word so much I didn't realize how much we butcher her language until I heard a low minimum like what's that like aluminum that's like sexy little bit of that I'll buy that we gotta lights you running so I'm I'm genuinely lucky man I'm sponsored by a lot of companies but I run Kavita at Souls tech black dog and revolution and oh [ __ ] I have a whole Grove built up by Sun system as well and [ __ ] another one either way however and everything it's free and good free and good we have a like I we have a like a nice 2 2 2 1 ceramic metal halide to HPS and our rooms and then we got plot I have plasmas I have felt like these various different things I have white LEDs for clones I use colored LEDs for seedlings keeping compact these various different things for different jobs I use a lot of souls tech bulbs for my DS and I like their bulbs a lot I don't use metal halides and give eat as though because that takes the warranty away you have to use the proper bulbs but yeah honestly man he's a lot of red lights D's Sarah mental highlights it's just about to for job what your end game is and you do it properly you're fine yeah I mean you're not gonna go wrong if you get any sort of name brand any one of those good lights just don't get something kitschy and new like it was the newest [ __ ] cool thing don't get that get the best thing from last year just get whatever is just the best thing not because but honestly I think like this part six or seven really good to ease like upwards of ten different ceramic you know bulbs out there that are solid different fixtures what are you used for your see reduction mostly so it depends on what my goal is if I'm trying to get them bigger and taller quicker either like t5 surly and then like just metal halides experimental heights and then but if I want to keep them compact for a while like sometimes I'll do like five weeks in a small container just to get a ton of nodes and then I'll put in a big container and I'm flower quick I'll put it under LEDs like mix spectrum and I keep some super compact and like it just allows me to use very little space and get a lot of growth in a very small area Canadian Indians is the request so we're talking in native from the currently living in the country of Canada to clarify I mean a Canadian Indian could be this kind of Union and in order mean a so like the be more specific okay has go in there is this alright mister [ __ ] here just uh enjoying you know the show nice you're here to challenge Gordon yeah what do you got for us oh well I got for you you got for him I bring two questions or bring depending oh yeah asked about you know what variety ethos is the most alpha thing you know you talk about alpha the most consistent stable homogenized things like that the one that you were considering your your favorite alpha thing well okay here's the thing so I have a lot of so it's about flavors a little bit you know I mean so I have a few and I have some that are like I'm you know I'm just gonna go member berri yeah alright it's just it's it's three and a half pounds light everything's 30% and everything is turkeys [ __ ] oh yeah yeah yeah I'm like every single Moke it is the most flavorful it attests crazy-crazy high-end live extraction you have everything from sweet to true skunk to grapefruits in there it's absolutely amazing extremely high yield easy to grow and you break it's just it's a crusher yeah yeah and I've to this day I have not seen a single Nana and I let some of them go actually revenge one so it probably went like a hundred days and I didn't see one Oh apples it does it's got really really good skunk old school skunk in there and like old school Afghan that was a state like stabilized a long time ago before I used it so it's a that that helped you know yeah so yeah I'm gonna member berri it sounds pretty good remember that from like South Park so that's pretty funny on the photo the rich yeah definitely looks real nice for sure dude they're very colorful towards the end Villa very vibrant Purple's magentas just Pink's just just just just it's just really really beautiful beautiful we you know if you're not an OG head you know one of those people it's like oh geez chemist hours only which by the way I'm kind of that yeah yeah and this is about as good as can get like I would never put it against a legit chem dog or legit oh gee coach because I wouldn't put anything against that but like people who don't even know what that is would think this is the best we've ever spoken yeah I think so you know I'm putting it in the cup of Santa Rosa in June so I think it's good enough to enter and I had a lot of weed dinner oh yeah well luck with that particular appreciate yeah yeah the only acne i got going on with but Leo likes out there in a mumble you know yeah you both down yeah you actually try shed that a little bit i Westar channel Toby years ago but you move that bucket exactly a couple years ago wafer ah oh here you know what's go tour again you know that you're from the west coast of Oregon oh yeah nice nice I uh I love it actually really do yeah I'd be out there I think wasn't for a few other things that rank with me down here it's nice I would love to grow outside in Oregon that would bits yeah that's what I'm a dream yes it's one of my dreams and find Bigfoot well I'm out there yeah that's likely but for some reason that's part of the fantasy all right can't you can't detach it yeah definitely it's always uh you know it's always hard to find you know varieties that finish before the October rains around here that preserve I suggest our pillow factory it's got really good botrytis resistant and it's alright and it finishes two weeks early it is it's highly promising I asked to give it a stupid name on purpose just to reverse market it and it worked great for a year nobody bought it but then I realize it didn't people like dude that throws not huge yields in eight weeks we were like huh and I was just it just to be funny took a full year before people started buying it I heard it was called pillow biter but oh I tried but then someone got all mad you know and I was like hey I'm gonna do it regardless to what you say goes on obviously was I with your theme and obviously one large it is more flowy speaking of themes but any other questions join the show make sure it I call you know never call before and you know people are you know people can call I'm like okay he's with being way too funny right now break it up a little bit you know yeah you know I got a way to flow I gotta break it up bring some salt to the situation yeah let's take a break some real la cordis right back to yeah that'd be an amazing goal like eighty coffin style I'm like how much revering five seconds it just awkward silence to that [ __ ] conversation okay okay good job like well thanks for calling in for sure yeah yeah love and peace boom work on an impression yeah oh well one day take Joe I don't think he's gonna do it [Laughter] words hard head strong brain bad I get it so so tired yeah doesn't all flow man I wish I could but well nice going i knows we have fun appreciate it yeah yeah no bro yeah [ __ ] you later okay peace take it easy that's fine boo no the noises actually alive out of context out of context be a great line it's like oh I thought I'd call it I say you guys having a bunch of fun I could allow that I'd say he added to it so good times no yeah it was fine absolutely in fact you to bring your member berries up remember yeah I remember he actually he said weighted perfectly well yeah I want to talk about my berries you gotta talk about you had to like not totally just ramble about all your strains but at the same time bring them in slowly with us oh speaking of which what's the what's the thing everybody should be looking for right now watch your favorite like just besides number barrier that was a lie was your other favorite what's your other favorite not tell him I really like it to campus they really is a banger I've got a few of them like that Manor cookies we're almost sold out of which is been huge like as if you asked me three months ago if you're gonna sell I'd be like never and like we're almost sold out of that and then that one man during the cookies to turn my guitarra it's a big fat huge mannered flavored cookie welcome to the after let's [ __ ] yogi yeah then are you doing boo boo boo hey yogi CFO 20 of course he's gonna win the tickets we were soliciting that very so we appreciate you participating yeah want tickets and now you get a free pack coming to you too so that's even better yeah so you guys so we were doing an impression contest sudden I got free tickets to his Yogi Bear and he called in it is free to the tasting that's on the foot that means you have to come early now you gotta get here like six days earlier than you thought so gonna cost you I shitload more money I will be there on the 18th that's the best I'll do it yeah we'll save a little goodie bag for you how's that sure I'll make sure actually a goodie bag I'll call you Jackie you can [ __ ] in to that exit y'all be cool I gotta get out I pee that's [ __ ] fine actually cool things comforts so we're doing all the cups now as far as we got boots and we have ones la 420 San Brandi now actually I don't like oh they like up because if you just said say Bernie of like I'm doing we're doing like a secret drop it's not secret because they just said it but we haven't told anyone what it is and I haven't advertised it but it's very limited and it's like goddamn got x no [ __ ] and then the other one is are you [ __ ] kidding x get the [ __ ] out of here both very limited ones male female one spam hand numbered by me you have to see me in LA that I get them because we're not gonna sell [ __ ] out of here times goddamn no they look here's the thing I'm not because I'm not saying they are double chicken I was I'm white labeling very nice cuts of extremely popular name trains I got you your light so it's just like those cuts you're trying to get times that other [ __ ] cut you're trying to [ __ ] get okay you know so it's a Mack something cross obviously [Laughter] don't [ __ ] blow but [ __ ] bro I gotta say I wanna say thanks to I like that our customers like we did our last drop in say in the membrane and I put on it none yet times business and I put nothing about it except those halls [ __ ] sativa yeah and it has a high variation rate and we sold 2,000 packs in two and half weeks yeah I was like dude I haven't sold 2,000 packs of any particular strain ever up to that point and just on based on we're down we're in I like it nunya times business and like oh I put turps laughs [ __ ] and TC [ __ ] tons everything it was like I'm in I'm like really and first of all it's amazing [ __ ] weed but I also decided like I said put it succeeds in and Louie was just last second I was making him I just filled every vile like full except for like 20 [ __ ] seats like them everyone just because like it's like return but like I couldn't believe like we literally it was I was at every day I was like how many like I don't get it I'm like I didn't say what it was hmm and like I was like where it's outselling everything you've ever done everything I've ever crafted everything I've ever worked on my entire life I did a little [ __ ] it social media like back it's like boom I'm like oh man at least they're getting good weed but it was an interesting thing for me and marketing to see like how far marketing can get you also will trust in the company I'm sure some of the return customers but I was [ __ ] amazed at people that many people buy something that was unknown relative to like you know like I'm releasing it like a Kemp movies like m4 x TK like in like three months or so which anyway like an amazing cut of camphor and anyone knows of those strains you get a nice chunky big fat og like it's amazing that one never sells faster than I New Times business ever and we all know like it's probably gonna be better because to the best cuts ever mmm I mean and I just did it just to see it's kind of funny so though this drop I'm not - at all I'm not telling anyone it is and they only find out the [ __ ] day comes out mmm see how that works I have no idea if that's gonna do anything like I have no idea these anything things gonna work great I just like to see what happens when's that drop them about 420 of course some see me in San Bernardino at the High Times cup a brand new plant you know that the fair that's what we're talking about I retain a new booth his tenth I do believe it's not I did not micromanage this job you have a design company but it's [ __ ] bad-ass I'm like really excited like he's worried like all adulting and [ __ ] you know I mean there's nice yeah so you have a whole crew there waiting for you do we bring in seven people I have a road crew now like we're buying the Mercedes [ __ ] sprint so we can like actually take all the gear and [ __ ] like we're like for loading up dude like like we are going a little carnival I got us a wheel like every half hour I've been doing giving away packs giving away [ __ ] free weed everything and like just and then that's a raffle but like there's a wheel everyone can spend it some right there a fool we know I got a raffle but no I got a wheel ever become spin and like look who doesn't like spinning wheel spin the [ __ ] I like spending [ __ ] wheels I know and it's like the ding ding ding ding ding ding dude right so then I just put a much [ __ ] on there when you went stuff everybody could spin it mostly you gonna join if you get lucky get some money we're like the cheesy pursuit it's been the wheel and gold bow ties and shade over I haven't gone that far but every of us wheel you have to wear a bow tie that's like parted I didn't know if sweet [ __ ] store in San Francisco like right my Haight Ashbury only has like things that like Imaginarium par narium person like what is that like is that an all crushed red velvet suit with a purple lapel you like it it's like oh and there's a different feel like it is I would I know where yeah definitely yeah having said that I would say you should do that for sure just a ding ding ding ding ding ding think we won best - yeah very low we won best booth took that first booth never did it was the cup three years ago we won best booth at one here in Denver and the only reason we won is because I bought that [ __ ] wheel and I made you you know only qualification but he had to vote for best booth before you spin the wheel crushed it yeah yeah my boot sucked that's all I did that was like I just wanna win best booth see what happened then I was like you totally [ __ ] if it works we got second and third actually you're that guy to go because they [ __ ] up the thing that no but seriously I just those [ __ ] funny everyone's sitting there like where they're helping have download their app and then like vote so who do we vote for we're like anyone you want it's America it's been the [ __ ] yeah you know I don't think we did actually would tell people because cuz whatever but yeah we rack those votes I just found out like I got like four cups in a row and I didn't know was something you voted for and I didn't know there was not an app on your phone I was like I don't think anyone else knows either so I'll just sit there with this wheel yeah and a line and for three days people decide about two days because it was a [ __ ] vote and [ __ ] I spend that [ __ ] wheel we were also giving away for free the stuff that was on the wheel yeah like you could just take the stuff yeah but they would rather spin the wheel and win the thing that was also on the counter just that they could take like yeah yeah what a joint you like you're gonna have a joint okay I want to join it like dude you get you have three yeah hey you know what I spun that thing like six times I got excited every time a little bit sorry what a play a little play I gave that a hundred and twenty eighth and the i-25 hey deaf Thornton I made a wheel party store I made a wheel out of the front of a bike for my the old school Amsterdam I made my [ __ ] all Amsterdam style so it's kind of like steam punk a little bit and I kind of stopped it was ridiculous yeah I have beard I was very impressed whatever that is that you have front of a bike it's in front of a bike I I didn't have a wheel I didn't have a wheel I had a bicycle wheel I put that other thing it was it was perfect great - yeah it was super dutch yeah altered excellent so all right so you got real spinning going on yeah if you read downtown New York and you're looking for the baddest place and the guy okay so yeah we got our own new headband coming out on 4/20 we've got a strainer made in basically it's early glue it back crossed grill glue with a Afghan Kush and then back to a real real gun it took like three weeks off the outdoor flowering time indoor it's similar a little faster a little more stacked but outdoors like real reasons because the triggers right early I think people at a mark that I got member OG which is our member berri times temple cush remember that's uh that's actually a male female yeah we're really [ __ ] good we actually literally try to give them away I'm not kidding and then you saw pictures of them in real life I use that ours like yeah like those the things we gave you yeah no selling them know that's how freebies turn in the [ __ ] are you kidding and I ransom and they were like unbelievable I'm like I guess there's something to this male/female [ __ ] [ __ ] just monster [ __ ] just delicious [ __ ] fruity cush buds purple is [ __ ] but you know honestly like working a lot of stuff are the I'm most excited for something it's not coming out for a while it's it's just it's an orgy of different old-school skunks we've been collecting and original chem dogs now we're doing various different chems Cameras Cameras Cameras with skunks and those are just to speak high-yielding just beautiful beautiful plants you know I missed that Dutch big huge bud just spongy massive it like working with these skunks and Kem's again I'm like hey I'm a good grower again you know cuz it's like you can't figure just rug GH can I get me some good paint like this so it's fun growing those things you know it's it's just weird because like you know get these skunks as you know they're testing 15 16 percent mmm but there's so much flavor and cool interesting characteristics that a lot of people nowadays haven't seen more like the earthy hmm stuff but they're stable of [ __ ] like they breed exactly what they are like it's something that doesn't exist much so like when you breed with these like old skunks like everything Valley shares to Phoenix yeah and not much variation in verses I do some chem cookie thing like everyone looks different right yeah of course there's so much yeah recessive stuff there you're like you might get some good combos but so these skunk can I do it I know that this time you're doing it like old-school with let everybody smoke the weed and stuff but all this stuff's already going to follow us in a solvent testing yeah well FiOS is the genetic testing oh yeah well I mean as far as uh are you gonna categorize all those whatever you do several yeah I'd say at this run I think we're gonna have eight kits but we have 14 I think already in the system everything it's unique anything it's special or sometimes I get like an outlier mm-hmm just what just want to see you just yeah yes you know just to see and you see genetically it's still quite similar it's just the expression is that much different but you know with FiOS and on stuff it's just playing around having fun with it playing with the tools but it is nice especially when when homogenizing and stabilizing strains to see that you you can watch that reducing amount of very cool yeah and by the way my f twos and my F ones eat were the same amount of variants as my r1 and r2 I got lucky hmm my f2 was like super feisty I always I was like goddamn it I guys had a Blackfyre that like tested high mmm and they didn't f2 and came back is low and like I did my best you know to get make him stable right but I was proving that there's no way it's gonna be a stable as the females but it actually did they can do anomaly yeah I'm still saying it but the evidence currently is 50/50 they both came back way more stable so yeah that is literally the goal of cannabis you know breeding and some stability and modernization and I think not to take away anything from them too because it was a bomb an sf2 yeah it's not like male soccer like I think that's like provocateur you know kind of stuff I want to get people thinking I generally do though and discuss we would expect nothing less obviously so that's that's least you're consistent right you know here's the thing I'm open just got to discussion always period including anything that I've come up with and in that and I'm ready to pivot if you show me something that's new cool you know I want to know it I'm not like I'm not set in my ways but that's allowed me to kind of look outside the box and after 25 years of using males I had a lot of mushrooms we'll see the mushrooms I decided that uh no I looked it up but couldn't find anything that it said that DNA was different right once I talked to a physiologist a guy who published a PhD published you know he's like there's no difference I'm like huh I was like is there anything to say that male female breeding is better he's like no why would the wheat I'm like I don't know I'm asking you I don't I dropped out yeah well I mean again like a little bit like you're saying before because the cannabis breeders are always like so stuck on the sort of romantic side of it I enjoy the art of finding a good dude yeah yeah or just I know that we all try no though but I get really do here's the thing I actually do enjoy the male feeding male female part of breeding cannabis I generally do it's just labor some it takes a long time for the show and for to actually homogenized or to stabilize a strain or a variety it takes a long time oh and I'm not saying you can't do it equally well or even potentially better I'm saying I can do ten in the time that I could also do one or maybe two at most and gets equal results so not saying that male female would be better or worse I'm saying I could do way more female homogenized strains at a much higher level at a much higher output so my contention is not it's better for breeding period it's better for breed homogenized commercial strains which is their specific is what you're doing right and that's a specific endgame yeah if you want to if you want to avoid bottle necking you should take all your mails like a room at ten twelve fifteen males and a bunch of great females and you know and and and cross them and to store some seats and to avoid genetic drift and things like that but those are different goals of breeding mmm-hmm yeah I mean so it's like I'm not saying don't do that I'm not saying don't cross a bunch of males with some females to put away seed stock to keep diversity and that this thing's different looks I got a friend of mine just different in game a friend of mine called today it's he had some really you know he had some seeds that about 25 years old I think more thirty years old and they were like he knows exactly which weed it was some Santa Marta cult and he know exactly that it really was that he wanted to do something with it and so his question to me was that you know you know what should you do see like you know F to them like figured I can breed them and you know to go go which is what I would suggest just let it out like yeah I just say have to everything everything everyone I never know everyone yeah and then start from there yeah well especially on those things because the minute you breed it with some cookies cross or something yeah you're fired you've worked f2 crossed everything with everything put that away right and then work those a little bit and then you start crossing with some stuff yeah and once again that's a different endgame yeah and I would do that too and but for what I'm trying to do and I won't see in it but that's part of my contention is it's not I'm not saying it's just for all tools it's for this particular ed game for what I'm doing and once again I don't know if long-term if by the time I get to an r4 it's gonna be as strong as an f4 it may loose vigor it's possible I I don't know I do know at to the r2 process it's way better than the FT process that's as far as I know so you know that's where I am on that and that's from my personal experience in from what I've seen mmm and also from other growers obviously they I give a lot of free seeds away to like growers that I if you're a good grower and you not take pictures near a friend of mine I'm giving you free seats yeah I need to pack in put clothes back whatever so a lot of that is also you know feedback that I get from growers that I respect they also like different rooms different styles of course I guess always the feedback sometimes sure and that's the nice part I mean and have you had like because a lot of times I think one of the big fears is that seeds over the years has always been like you know the the fact that everybody who is you know getting seeds that are made from stress plans etc whatever the stresses a real thing yeah that is epigenesis it is proven but have you had any kind of like just [ __ ] up [ __ ] along the way where certain things have gone wrong like oh yeah better out there that yeah nothing need to address or any recall the strain three months ago oh yeah two weeks after its release yeah I had only run four seeds of it they all came out great yeah somebody else really beautiful couple people also yes and then native running a little bit after me and they all told me any day at least I've got one intersex trait it's like three of them at multiple like three out of ten or four out of ten like way to that like one you know like that's a problem and like I know it's not their room they know it they know what they're doing yeah sure so I put a massive post up all over social media saying recalled refund and it was the hardest things ever to do and I had an amazing the most positive probably social media response ever had yeah cuz dread yeah we substrate because I hang my head I'm like I got this here and what happened was and it's not like I actually no one knows and I don't make it makes you see something I didn't want to make an excuse but it wasn't it was kosher cush but it wasn't my cut and my friend didn't know enough that this is actually a slightly better cut he thought he's do me a favor and he just forgot to tell me and breeding you know how when once you pollinate something he when it doesn't finish it finishes different yeah so I couldn't tell that was a slightly different cut and then later he was like yeah no it was this better cuz all I'm like oh she I don't know how it breeds yeah I was like did I broke that up alone ten times I know how that one reads you know sure and so we had to recall it and so once again the genetic you know it's an unknown genetic using unknown genetics untested genetics is the problem yeah and I know that no matter how good my feminizing technique is I'm not gonna make a string better I can't Gemini's dog waltz and take that Manor situation out of it I mean if I use something that like a trait camp looks like a cherry pie or something bad exactly why are we gonna use it if you know it's good but that's why I literally won't use it you see stuff that already has tendencies or prone to that I won't use it all yeah the only one is Kennedy because it's worth it it's not that bad yeah it's day 18 there's a couple Lou bulls and like you said that one freaking branch or that one plank like out dude yeah you're real bad but mostly it's like I'd say 75% of them are really good come either which I'm totally happy with one do I can't find ya but yeah I did we've had we've had a lot of problems and the number one thing is always untested stuff yeah and just like anything else whether it's male/female breeding or female breeding it doesn't matter female you're using regardless of its intent you should test of course and usually that's one that's most tested it's the mail carrier it's most run yeah like that's the hardest one to like you know yeah it takes a while and then there's like plant counts and room and you know all this stuff and like you know so just variables and like I said it's no I'm not it's about any game and tool for a job but you know a lot of my customers do large crops and they like to go from seed and they like feminized seeds that they know we're gonna you know be same height or the same no sure so why can't I go to the f5 process except my way sowhat's okay so know that we're wrapping the show up right right now grab it up what's the best way to get in touch with eat those besides its ethos genetics calm

tool the new mean green herb ease from cyclones are in all natural tobacco free pre-rolled cones that we've really been enjoying here at Rafal studios the cones also happen to fit perfectly on the new raw cone loader tool that we debuted here a couple of months back the cones simply slide on the narrow tip of the cone load or tool where it will stay put while you scoop and funnel your ground herbs down into the cone the cones do come with a small plastic straw to pack the herbs in but we find it a lot more effective to use the tamping tool provided with the raw loader kit that wooden tool has a tapered shape with a narrow tip for firming up the skinny end of the cone near the filter and the wide end for tamping in the remainder and the wider end of the cone of course you could also load the cones very easily by hand but the loader does make it easier and less messy and if you're rolling multiple cones the loader is a real help [Music] now we have our cannabis loaded we're also want to juice it up with some very nice honey oil this is a solvent --less extract oil of green crack sativa and I'm using a syringe to drop a few drops into the end of the cone also leaving a little bit more room for some more goodies at the very tip now we're going to add in some Keef to fill out the last few centimeters now we have not tested these cones loaded fully with Keef but the impression is that it would be perfect for smoking Keef cones with an excellent taste of sage and keep complimenting nicely now our cone is fully packed and ready to light but before we do let's check out this cool

complement the smoothness of the burn and also stays nice and cool as you smoke the cone all the way down to the tip now we didn't have a little trouble with his comb burning unevenly mainly due to the oil we're dripped into it but even then it held together perfectly without dropping the cherry and even out and burned all the way to the tip despite the variety of contents inside I hope you

showing you how to determine the joint size of your bong or accessory using a dime 10 cents get this question all the time people don't know the size of their bong or their accessory if they're trying to get a replacement or an add-on so yeah we'll start so we're going to go from small to large here we have nine millimeter uh joint so typically soft glass bongs are nine millimeter it's going to have a joint that looks like this rather than a joint that looks like the male female joint there so the nine millimeter slides typically look like this so it has the long insert at the end because it goes down into a slide typically people don't dab with soft glass it's it's more sensitive with heat but that's another video so we'll go to 10 millimeter next uh 10 millimeter we got these two guys uh so real quick male versus female you hear that term uh what that means is joint size so male right here for obvious reasons this is called a male joint and this is called a female joint so the male joint has an accessory slide on it while the female joint has an accessory slide into it so female male uh with 10 millimeter so like i said back to the dime we take this you try and put it in the female joint as you can see it's clearly not gonna fit uh you take the accessory this is a 10 millimeter male quartz banger you see it basically just takes up the middle of the dime so that's how you can determine it's 10 millimeter these are less common but they're still out there so that's 10 millimeter next we go to 14 millimeter male 14 millimeter female and two different joint sizes or styles i should say so this is called 90 degrees the reason being is it's at 90 degrees this one is at 45 degrees so beaker bongs are at 45 degrees so what that would mean is if you were trying to add a quartz banger to a beaker bong or 45 degree style you're gonna want a 45 degree banger so this is a 45 degree 14 millimeter male quartz banger goes right into the bong and as you can see it sits flush so that's why it's called 45 degrees and that's why you want a different size the 90 degrees isn't going to sit as flush it's going to be at an angle like that i mean it still works but technically the 45 degree is flat so it's gonna work better all right so with the dime we'll take this 14 millimeter male going on to the dime you can see it takes up about 75 percent of the dime it takes up a big chunk of it and putting it in to the female joint it just just fits in so you can tell okay that's 14 millimeter female same thing this is 14 male takes up about 75 percent and then next we will go to 18 millimeter or 19 millimeter uh you're gonna see that the penny or the penny the dime goes right into the joint like that it can still come out but uh yeah so with the female 18 millimeter 19 millimeter it's going to go right in that way you know that it is indeed 18 millimeter or 19 millimeter if we take this and sit on a 18 millimeter male joint as you can see it takes up about 95 percent of the dime so that's how you can determine the joint size of your bong accessory joints whatever using a dime if you guys have any questions feel free to reach out hopefully you found this

here and today I want to bring you a review for blue cheese from Whistler cannabis company so according to leafy blue cheeses a combination of UK cheese and blueberry and Whistler cannabis company it's an all organic cannabis company it's sixty to ninety nine for an eight so it's much more expensive but it's a hand trimmed premium product so this 8 year was actually packaged on April 17th so this is by far the freshest stuff I've ever gotten here and the stats on this is eighteen point six percent THC and then less than 0.5% CBD so as you can see this one comes in this big cardboard package as compared to those plastic jars I do prefer this because I take it straight out of here and put it into one of my glass jars containers rather than just keeping it in the plastic so let's go ahead and open it up it's got just like open up their pre roll joints got these two things on the side to press those in pull this out I like this company because they do their packaging right I mean it looks like the buds are just pristine in here but it's also just perfectly sealed so they do a higher-end packaging as well compared to some of the other ones go ahead and open this up first smell mmm very very nice before we take a closer look at this I want to weigh it and since this does have a Boveda pack in there it should be pretty close to 3.5 so when I weigh this all out here it actually brings us to three point five four so that's nice to see it's usually you know three point four six if anything so it's nice to see a true proper eight let's go ahead and have a look at the buds here there are a really nice light green color and one thing I like about this company is that they hand trim everything it's not machine trim and you can tell cuz it just has a real connoisseurs trim on here you're not getting any big leaf or anything like that and the buds are just covered in orange hairs and just sticky with trichomes completely dense as well like that is a firm bud right there let's go ahead and smell it now that we've let it air out a little bit getting a little bit of kind of fruity or citrusy scents but nothing crazy not like a lemon tie or anything like that let's go ahead and bust it up and see how that changes it this is in my brilliant cut grinder absolutely love this guy try not to bust it too much this isn't the medium setting here okay now expose some of those terpenes let's go ahead and give that a fresh smell ooh much more aroma there that really really activated it getting a little bit of those blueberry a lot more of those fruit tones in there there's something just behind the fruit that I really smell and it's not an earthy tone very very nice though and be testing out today at the Arizer air 2 and this is a long boy stem so as you go to this longer stem here there's a custom-made one that we have I get this custom-made like this because with a longer stem it does cool down the vapor so it's not as harsh as you're gonna have an extended session I chose the air tube because of these all glass stems you get really really good flavor I'm going to turn this up to 380 degrees Fahrenheit KB just arrived at 380 Fahrenheit give it a second to reach temperature and let's go ahead and baby mmm pure terpenes there wow you can really taste that fruitiness coming through with that again you just feel like you're inhaling like pure Terps you know you're seeing the vapor but it's more of a blueish vapor I think it's when it's Terp heavy definitely getting some more of those fruit flavors the earthiness it's got some complexity to it [Music] you feel like you're kind of moving through the strange flavors you hit it you know I like the stranger it has complexity it's not just like citrus it just kind of changes through the bowl as you hit it very nice fourth hit I think that was a fourth of the fifth hit flavor is starting to diminish definitely still there I'm gonna go ahead and power vape the rest of this and then give it some time let the effects kick in so very nice Bowl nice and smooth good flavor you know what about the fifth hit sixth hit for sure starting to lose a lot of that flavor but very very nice and it changed you know over the course of those hits more fruit at first and then it moved through the other tones as well so I'm gonna give this 15 minutes let this kick in and I'll report back okay so it's been 15 minutes and that was a very very nice strain set it's about an 80% indica 20% sativa and I believe that because it's nice and relaxing but it wasn't like couch lock I wasn't feeling tired but very very at ease just chilling on the internet you know didn't really want to get up and do anything or anything like that but very relaxing I could see enjoying this one at night for sure but in the daytime I don't think it'd be too bad because it's not like a terribly tiring indica dominant strain so overall this is a really good one I mean it's expensive you're paying 60 299 for an eighth but at least you're getting really good quality stuff not only is it organic hand trimmed all that kind of stuff but it's really really tasty and the effects are great as well so overall if you don't mind spending the money and getting the higher end stuff this is a really really nice strain and I haven't tried one from these guys that I didn't like so there you go guys I hope you enjoyed this review of blue cheese from Whistler cannabis company I appreciate you watching these stray interviews and let me know which one you want to see next keep a green keep it sneaky and we'll see you next time", "Q98Ql2l9ls8": "Weaver do we'd review today today we have a little bit of a different one I've been smoking medical cannabis all day it's time to get recreational we're looking at tens Oh dose epi and sistas - sunset sherbert this is gonna be a week off right now I'm looking for a bit of a smoke to kind of wind down it's like 7 o'clock or some [ __ ] I need to take it down a notch I need to cool my Jets a bit so the dose epi dot one is a little heavier perfect for that type of time of day of the thing setting thing for me cool and then sunset sherbert that is more of a 50/50 hybrid it can be on the sativa dominant side we're not quite sure what this one offers we've never been in it yet I've done Tendo watermelon skittles it was a pass and I've done citizens - Macke one which was a pass this was some fire actually so if you see that around maybe check it out and then creamsicle bit of a duster look great didn't smoke that well creamsicle is quite the name it attracts people immediately to it but not the best of smokes so let's see what's going on in the sunset sherbert and the dope seep I read off alright so we're just gonna get right into it there because there's no time for delays it's hot as [ __ ] in here and we will start with don't see pie by tens oh we have dough see pie at 22.35 percent THC the package date the package date is on February 17th so that's a bit older of a week citizens - we are coming in at 23.6% THC and a package date of February 4th so it is in June your package in February 10 days apart very close together and this is actually a good weed off for some jet this is basically older product in my books being packaged you know about five months ago that's an older product okay now that's cracked a bit Oh pinch pinch pinch on the sides here for the tens oh if you can't figure it out maybe I can't holy [ __ ] okay tens we'll get points for being childproof okay so not a lot of nose in there just because it's old but see what the handy-dandy scale says before we really talk about it ready okay okay okay wait wait okay so tens Oh reads in at three point three seven three point three seven under wait it lost that weight in its five months of sitting in the jar so what are you gonna do audible veto pack I could still dry out in five months let's try what sunset River by citizens - has going on okay no seal on this either yeah three point four four three point four five little under but that is just because of the length of time in the jar so not as many complaints on the weight there but you know that's how it is so let's take a dive into them let's dive in alright so first off we crack the Denso dou C PI this is what it is now the appearance is it looks very good come on down check it out caked little nuggets now it is dry though okay it is dry but it is stacked with trichomes you can tell that it was well growing well taken care of and a very good trim now we're seeing some browning on there that is from oxidation that is just from air hitting plant matter and trichomes it doesn't matter what kind of product you're looking at it will brown over time that's just the way it goes and it also decreases increases in quality but when we're looking at these two side by side here is the citizens - so the citizens - is also good-looking but it's an area but there's more it's bringing parties here so let's check this out the color is very nice - it's a nice purple dark color those colors when it's darker like that that tends to make me think from my experience that this is gonna be a heavier bud so back appeal appearance-wise Tendo does take the cake on bag appeal it is frosty er it's tighter I want that when I see it the sunset sherbert is a little airier it's not quite stacked his truck with strike homes but it does say I'm heavier so I'm looking forward to both of these smokes right now I'm just worried about how they're going to smoke they're both on the dry side so we know that's gonna offer a little bit rougher of a smoke but let's roll these [ __ ] up real quick and here we're crushing up the tens oh don't see hi this is where we're gonna catch the nose if there is in the bust this is one of the most exciting parts to marijuana hmm definitely don't see pie definitely add OC in there I can smell that immediately but it's just not strong it's just it's just like [Music] just I'm looking for more of something that says hey man get in here party with us and I'm getting more like Kai we're reading books maybe the smoke says hey let's party a joint now next up I'm gonna pick the biggest chunk ia's buds on this guy I seem to have one really good-looking top nug the trim could be a bit better I got there's a lot of black and leaf on there but we're talking about more of a mid Z product so that's where you're gonna see that trim not be perfect like you do on some of the craft products okay again not blasted me in the face not saying hey man let's party but I get it straight earthiness probably a higher Mir seen content in this one yet is saying take a seat that's that's what I know from this smell that this type of butt is going to be heavier more sedate O's okay we got a joint first for lighting with Josie Pye Tendo dose epi let's give it a second Jesus I just got in there a couple roots in few hoots in here I'm getting a pretty clear smoke now it's lacking terpenes and it's a little rougher from a straight-up that's just how it is that's how it is come on here's what I can tell you immediately after the few hoots that I've had I'm feeling good all right I'm gonna keep this going but I'm going to light up sis's - sunset sherbert it's time to see what's going on in the burn also it's a great test to see how long a joint just sits there burns the Tendo is gonna keep going here I can tell a good cure a good flower that busts up well with egg cuz it is a nice grind will continue to just sit there and burn just smoke away a bad joint will stop burning and you have to relight it oh so same thing with both of these they're both on the drier side so there is that bit of scratch that runs through the back your mouth into your lungs and it's just like hey I'm a little dry there's not enough moisture coming in through the back end of the [ __ ] joint to get through the smoke to really course the inside of your body with moisture to enjoy the smoke it's just hard from dry well let's get past out for a second because I think this is dankaran this is a big day girl this is taking me down a notch this is a heavy hitter it's that those terpenes in there that mix with the THC it doesn't have to be strong th either so I'm starting to get pretty stoned I'm smoking two joints back-to-back at the same time it's not back-to-back it's actually at the same time so the dozy behind you it's gonna go through the instrument the dough see PI keeps me coming back to it there's an initial sweetness to it that I really like that that's hitting the one still pulling and then uh it's going to the system stashed here now we're switching over I'm gonna take a few hoots of this and describe what's going on this its danker this one is Decker for sure it was exactly kind of what I was expecting after I looked at it I know we'd like that that heavy darker green color has a heavy hitting spoke about it it had earthy tones and I know that is gonna do good things to my body I can't even talk right now holy [ __ ] but this is good this is good in its own way not sweet like the tens oh not at all this one is more like like I fell from a tree hit every branch on the way down and then face planted in the [ __ ] dirt on the bottom that's what this is it's just that's how you get your buzz on for a show okay now we're talking about we're talking about marijuana now let's go through these let's see if I can go through these in one bit all right don't see pie you did quite make weight that's because I know you've been in a jar for so long gay bag bill 10 Joe had a better looking bud citizen stash had a little area more of a bud the trim was not as good the trichomes were not a stack it did does not look as good the nose I've always had a very little limited No upon opening and then upon crushing not that glass in your face not that healeth party [ __ ] terpene smash fear face they both were on the earthy side one more earthy want a little sweeter but nothing to write home about on the nose as I'm just looking both right now they actually smoke very equally okay they're they're all slightly different but they're both old so they're lacking the very crisp terpene taste that we love from cannabis when you're talking about recreational cannabis that's really what you want to do you want to enjoy the [ __ ] [ __ ] out of it when we're talking about medicine you just need to get that [ __ ] in you and then keep going right so on the recreational side this is not what I want to see in terms of freshness we got to get better on that but in terms of quality god damn it I don't know where I am I don't know where I am I just don't know where I'm at let's give them a score I'm gonna sum this up I'm not even sure at this point what I've said I'll give you this I won't give you anything I'll take it back I'm gonna say this what am I gonna say him I wanted to wind down for the day I was looking for more of an indica more of something to cool me down for the day now I got that I'm just ready to call her a day I'm really just ready to call it a day so in terms of score they're both getting graded on the old factor so take a step down on that appearance Tendo has it on bag parents tens Oh has it on taste of joy - this was a little sweeter it kept me coming back the citizens - more of Amenti more of something common out there okay don't see pies a little less common don't see that as much but turn in terms of effect I got exactly what I wanted so when I'm scoring these tens oh you're gonna get a 645 you will be recommended to buy again okay I am saying check it out if you like find a fresh batch that's the biggest thing finding fresh batch intends oh you're getting a 6.5 I know this can be better this can be the sevens for sure it needs to be fresh and I need to smell and taste that [ __ ] freshness citizens - you get one point under at a six point for your bag appeal was not there I know that's not everything but I know the density of the buds and the trichome density in there what is just not comparable you're going and getting a six point for you I like the smoke they were both exactly the same smoothness they were both the same dryness they're both the same smoothness they both smoked the same and I actually enjoyed both of them I finished both two joints I will finish the tens oh I may not finish the citizens - that's just the reality of it that's it that's that's the review holy [ __ ] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music]", "cXTIc9cTUG4": "[Music] welcome to another strain alert it's been a minute obviously don't say it doctor the busy trend globe with cyber sales and profits afraid it's sometimes this particular strain that we are [ __ ] with today a lot of you have heard of it some of you know about it and have smoked it but I'm here to tell you about it either way if you have or having this right here is some legendary [ __ ] in the making this is called the biscotti from the cookie family this is cookies biscotti and this is one of the sought out strains right here this is a frame a favorite of mine personally I [ __ ] with some biscotti on personal tip no I'm saying I keeps me a bit at home this is a favorite of Scott Storch legendary producer no I'm saying because he'd be staying lit with ample amounts of the biscotti now if you don't know what the biscotti is it is an indica strain crust with gelato 25 and South Florida oh gee this [ __ ] right here is fire you open up this jar and it's like the fragrance is just like overwhelming you know instead of getting punched in the nose you're getting tickled in the nose by the full bouquet of this particular strain right here the trichomes are off the hook the the cure is insane you know it I got to tell you this [ __ ] is on blast man the bag appeal jar appeal I mean the Nuggets don't come big and blown out you know they don't be using the phospholipid this particular [ __ ] so the Nuggets are you know small and tight they're not huge sometimes those big nuggets are you know overblown and and it's not what they seem to be but this [ __ ] right here you know the power is in these little mid-sized nuggets that you got here you know any connoisseur knows that those little middle midsize nuggets you know not the big full-blown Cola style but the little ones that's the where they pack the flavor and the punch is very dense gonna need it grinder don't [ __ ] with scissors because you're just gonna ruin it use a proper grinder you know what I'm sayin this [ __ ] right here you can find in Maywood at the cookie store in Maywood cookies SF and any cookie dispensary or cookies dispensary that would be in your city so if you're in Seattle please believe they got the biscotti if you're in California here South Southern California or Northern California you got this [ __ ] if there's a cookie store there and there's new cookie stores coming about so if you want to find this train it's on blast now I didn't do the light up because this is a strain alert it's not a review no I'm saying we're just telling you about the fire that's out there you know what I mean and the biscotti is one of the most gaseous [ __ ] strains out there right now so go find it and light it the [ __ ] up share it with friends or Bogart it whatever the [ __ ] you're gonna do with it but I tell you this [ __ ] is like the [ __ ] fuel right here this [ __ ] is the bomb you get this [ __ ] and yeah I wouldn't share it with nobody they're gonna be opening up some cookie stores in different places as I said earlier and we are also gonna be open up our dr. greenthumb store in August in Sylmar California you could check out all of dr. greenthumb flavors all are insane line everything so it's just giving you that little bit of knowledge right now August 15 so mark California go on the B Realty Vig look it up and be a part of our grand opening you know it's rec medical all the above all right come check it out there's been another strain alert keep it blazing yeah [Music]", "r5r7x52F9so": "hey what's up you guys shadows here again with another episode of shadows we review today on our show we got our special guest today see you next tuesday what's up you guys and we are gonna be going over this is the docido by claiborne now this one everybody spells it a little different they're spelling it like that but it's all sato yeah it's documented it's supposed to be docido because it's girl scout cookies crossed with true og but this one is weighing in at twenty four point five one percent thc point zero seven percent cbd twenty nine point six seven percent total cannabinoids and it's labeled as a hybrid and it was forty seven dollars at la cush now you guys if you if you know anything about real faceoff og that's a pretty good og now this one we'll see okay docido is a really good strain if they actually got the right strain but you know that half the time they label them all this crazy stuff and you get it home they're like what is this they're not the same this isn't the same smell yeah growers and clubs aren't known for getting it right as far as the name and the strain yeah sometimes yeah and that's what we're here to tell you because you know when we've smoked let's say when when i owned the dispensary a hun literally over a hundred just like um vendors would come to me and bring me a train wreck okay and when 90 90 of them out of the 100 brought me the same smell and the same terpene and like you know the same bud the same overall that's train wreck okay the other 10 would be all these other things that they call train wreck and see i know this smells i've done this so many times she's been with me we've we've done this for a long time and we know 25 years yeah we know the smell so we look good right yeah so when these people give us these crazy descriptions just with this straighter sister and we're just laughing like dude who made up those names we we were the ones making up the names to try and differentiate when we would get like four different types of train wrecks but all from different growers through different growing processes they grow substantially different some would have purple because they use purple enhancing nutrients and then other ones would be you know bright green so we would sell all of them and give them slightly different name like train wreck rain wreck you know uh night train you know what i mean we gave them all these different names and then people ran with it like this is my train now and it's like no dude it's train wreck we just gave it a funny name like barry train because you know that that particular grower had you know a bunch of purples in their grow house and it kind of smelled like berries a little bit too or you know what i mean or they gave it great nutrients because so they have like great flavoring they even have they just tried to fluff the names to sell it to you more let's be honest well and but but there are real strains and there are real strain names and if you keep it in that family you know what you're getting yeah but all these wicked wild names it just yeah it's something yeah we were honest with it we would give we'd tell you like oh it's night train it's and then we'd say on the box like train right across with this or whatever but these people nowadays are anyway running back to the cleveland okay so anyways back to the claiborne we are doing the docido we have already opened this one and tried it for you guys to give it our our purpose to give it the perfect review but we want to open it up for you guys so you guys can see it yourself so we'll open it up right out of the box you guys the smell smells smells very strong you smell it you can smell it from a foot away yes it smells mean smells good and now the reason why it smells meaty is because this isn't the regular dosa dough this one actually is crossed with master kush crossed with um uh girl scout cookies and that's why this one is slightly different than the regular dosa dough maybe that's why they wanted to call it dosado or whatever you know what i mean but you see dosato on the clayborn menu that's this is what we're talking about yeah this is the one so dumping it out right here this is the best nug in the bag so we smoked all the other ones and we kept the best one to show you guys okay so right out of the gate you know my nails are cleaner yeah so the calyx to leaf ratio is awesome on those the trim job is good the trichomes are awesome they did a very good job now let's look at it under the microscope all right that's a big nugget now this stuff is really purple you guys and purple can be attained by either being a purple strain or through a lot of nutrients or freezing your bud or down making it cold in the room or feeding cold water there's lots of ways of making it purple honestly the best is when you get a strain that's naturally green because they're usually pretty strong and you just throw a little nutrients in there to make it purple because purple strains are usually the highs on them are usually relatively not ahead banging high it's usually a mellow high so if you like a mellow high the purples are great for you we're all naturally occurring purple but you can make an og purple through the right nutrient combinations and it can be an amazing amazing og so you look on here you look at that black background that's the dark purple in the background of this it looks so good on camera right now yeah all that in there that's that purpley purple now do you see a lot of heads left on here it's all grass yeah it's all grass most of the heads have been probably shaken off and given to you in the power packs maybe i don't know check and see if you see docido in the power packs and the little key from bunch but it looks like it it's a lot of the trichome has been shaken off yeah tumbled off so um it hasn't been handled very good but the smell right out of the bag smells really good and you want to break that up and smell that when you break this this smells small yeah this is really good you guys no when i say that it's not face off og crossed with with uh girl scout cookies that's not saying anything bad this is master cush crosses girl scout cookies this is a very good strain it's this will probably lay you out a little harder though yeah let's see yeah this one's really good so you want to pull out the better so knife got her piece and uh you guys grab your pieces at home grab a bomb grab a piece of bud pack that bowl let's do it together you guys all right you're gonna use that bomb oh this is not really dense though sticky but very dense yeah very dense it passes a snap test as you can hear perfectly cured real sticky nice but it is real dense breaking this up is a little difficult even with my nails you guys gotta smell this i wish you were here i wish there was smell-o-vision come on amazon get on it musk we don't need to go to the moon we can get to the moon right here smell vision like taste this smell this oh god we could all get to the moon together cheaper figure it out musk come on hmm we'll even name it weed after you i'll make a weed after you we'll have musk og fly to the moon together all right you guys got got a lighter make sure your lighter's working good don't have any lighter failures that's sorry i feel like i'm packing that's awful because i've broken it into so many tiny crumbs but it's better to break it up into tiny crumbles when it's a dense weed like this clogged oh have you ever been like like oh [ __ ] your lighter nothing's coming yeah and then you don't get high from the hit so you gotta like then you need to redo it redoing it you're sitting there burning all this burnt stuff and you were just looking forward to a nice good green hit and then you're looking in your bag like god that was the best snug in the bag and i ruined it like oh please don't do that you guys make sure that it's good lighter check all right you guys ready let's do this clear the chamber oh made it too thick now that's definitely one of the stronger purples so if you're going to if you want to show your friends something that looks really impressive because purples always look more impressive you see more trichome um with a butt with a darker background so it looks way more frosty really impressive to show your friends the smell is awesome the taste is good and you'll get super faded and we have smoked this one day after day for for a while because yeah we bought a couple eighths of this and what do you think i mean the high is good you like it don't fade it i don't even want to talk anymore yeah we're out okay so i'll see you later but yeah you guys give it a try this is the docido by clayborn you know what i mean it was 47 so it's up there with the ogs but it's up there with good reason you know what i mean it is a good alternative to the og's it's worthy it's some good that's a decent cushion you know well purple i've smoked oh geez every day for years we both have and every once in a while it's good to change it up and i don't mean you know i don't i hate to get away from red boxes and blue boxes maybe oh geez and stuff like that but every once in a while they don't have a good one in stock or something like that and you save a couple bucks and this one's a good flavor and it'll switch it up sometimes it just kicks in sometimes you're wondering you have the better weed than a buddy but you've been smoking it for so long that you're almost immune to it he'll come over with some rags and you hit it and you're like god of my eyes what the hell is cheap ass week i mean hi sometimes changing it up is good so this isn't a bad alternative you guys so give it a try guys that's a dosey doe by claiborne give it a thumbs up yeah this is thc see you next tuesday giving it a thumbs up i give it a thumbs up for 47 you guys it's it's not a bad alternative you guys so uh i'll see you on the next one all right later", "sC8KG3dcyGU": "and we're back again for another spin of the bangle buds because i ran out of all my stuff again i went through that apple fritter so fast because it's you know pretty pretty light it's not very powerful stuff and that shred stuff i just vacuumed up like a vacuum cleaner so we got um delta nine head banger palmetto headband and shred tropic thunder so um yeah shuffle it let's give it a spin shall we i guess i'll go for one of the head ones give me one of the head ones [Laughter] headbanger okay sure try that so this is delta nine um headbanger and it's at one or seventeen point nine seven percent so pretty much eighteen percent it's a sativa hybrid and it is hey look they got a sticker on here wonder what's under that sticker oh my i kind of want to find out the package date is august the 31st now i'm curious what's under this sticker i better take this off and find out all right i tore the sticker off and let's see it looks exactly the same doesn't it oh the only thing i can see here is it had two dashes here they missed two dashes they had to reprint stickers and put them on oh my god that's hilarious anyways we've solved that mystery time to um check the scale here make sure it's all properly calibrated that uh we're checking with a 50.00 gram weight and here we go looks looking good we're good to go here we're good all right there we go we're going to zero it out boom here we go it's time for delta 9 headbanger so i don't know what strain this is actually called is it actually head banger or is that a mix of other ones i don't know i have to do some research and figure it out here we go [Music] hmm nice smell kind of uh [Music] kind of very flowery and soily soily it smells like dirt flowers very good though look at it looks kind of nice in there let's see what the weight is come on delta nine oh my god underweight delta nine that's not good you were underweight with this one too the apple fritter your bastards now you're even more underweight that's two failures in a row delta nine not good i was hyped for you guys too fuck so here we go these are all the buds there's um how many is there one two three four five six seven there's like 22 buds here at least for 3.5 grams they're all very tiny so this reminds me of uh kanaka it's like i just opened some kanaka here anyways i guess we'll check them out with the microscope okay we're looking at the outside of the um the headbanger from delta nine it's trichome chunk city here look at all these chunks there's chunks and they're everywhere yeah look look at these chunks look at that that looks fucking awesome there's a lot of trichomes here look at that i'll get back to that mega chunk section let's zoom in on this let's zoom in oh fuck i can't tell though this stuff looks old again just like that other stuff the apple fritter kind of had an old look to it this definitely does kind of look old though hopefully that's not a bad thing because the package date is when they put in the package we don't get access to some information that we need though like harvest date uh how long it takes to dry how long the curing is we don't have access to any of that info so we just get the package date but this can be sort of sitting around for however long before it gets packaged right so that's some of that missing intel hopefully we'll get when the regulations come under review and all that i think they should uh definitely be telling us that anyways though it actually looks really nice this stuff here looks like it's loaded with trichome chunks which i happen to love they're um i don't see any clear ones they're all cloudy they got a little touch of the greenish yellow to them let's bust open one of these buds and look inside how about this guy let's bust it open here's a look at the inside it's very kind of cappuccino colored in here everything has like a very light color yeah see it's all got this kind of look to it here all kind of yeah there's some amber stuff in there too it's mostly like this here though mostly like this this type of stuff right there what is this look i found like a weird little black section almost what the fuck is that let's take a look let's see what it is oh wow that's like one of the darkest leaf sections i've seen ever look at that oh look at this section oh my goodness so many chunky trichomes here wow that looks really nice right there that looks freaking awesome um anyways you know what i think it's time that i go try this out and i'll be back so i just got in from this delta nine head banger at seven well basically at eighteen percent and this stuff has a nice flavor to it it's kind of like a flowery kind of flavor with i can't tell if it's like a dirt or if it's like a spice like a peppery spice or something or dirt mixed with a flower and then and then every now and then you get kind of like a hint of some sort of like gas or something so it's an interesting flavor it's got flavor so that's cool the high on here though is a little disappointing it's kind of unfulfilling and unsatisfying it feels like a sort of like a light medium so very very lightweight stuff nothing like what i'm usually going for so i you know just like this this i went through this entire thing in a day this 3.5 it was so light just like this this i'm sure that i'm going to go through this entire thing by tomorrow which sucks because the uh that other stuff lasts way longer that shred stuff i went through that pretty quick too but man that's ah that's disappointing and the weight was a little a little shy on this too so it's underweight the the high isn't good enough it's underweight tiny little buds it's nice and dry the dryness is real good the the flavor is good but i don't know i just would i buy this again this oh this one here was more expensive than the other one this one went for i think it was like it's like 30 bucks for this and i can get way better stuff for less from ocs so it's getting to that point now where certain things are just not good enough to compete so you know i don't think i would be buying this i would get one again it's just not good enough for the price it's unfortunate nice taste though these delta nines got a nice taste but that's uh not the reason i buy cannabis for taste right so yeah anyways it's all right i'm you know i'm not gonna buy it again but you know i don't hate it it's just not powerful enough so you know that kind of sucks anyways though um but we got two more things on the bangle of buds and uh i guess i'll be opening those up pretty soon because this is gonna go fast so yeah come check those out hit the subscribe button if you want and the uh notification bell and it'll tell you when the next video is online and that's it for now so we'll see you later have a good one", "hchSvCgrYrM": "hey guys it's Florida MJ 4:20 here and today I have a comparison video between 9 pound hammer minis from true leave with 9 pound hammer regular buds from true leave so let's see what the THC is on the Mining's we got seventeen point six percent THC 0.5 percent CVG for a total 18.1% t8 cannabinoids and for the full size we have eighteen point three percent THC 0.5 percent CVG for a total 18.8% cannabinoids alright so let's get these minis opened up and it's the it's the jars of doom you know they gotta have jars that are really hard for people to open for some reason your medicine has to be that way guys see the seals pretty good on this looks like yeah it's not much of a bounce to it though see what's inside alright these look like some really nice little nugs in there 9 pound hammer this is the minis take a closer look at well let's get a smell first alright so the smell from these is very purple that's what I that's what I'd say it's got a sourness to it maybe a little penis but overall I smell that purple smell I want to figure out what that is it smells really good alright let's take a look at these things all right it'd look really nice as you can see these buds are just totally covered in tri cones they're really well developed little nugs these are not Airy wispy buds these are fully mature nugs that are just small and that's what I've come to expect out of truly minis between what I've gotten and what I've seen on the forums that's what I expect now because that's what they've been dishing out all right now let's open up the regular nine pound hammer eight here we've got the minis see if I can get that to stand up right there on this side we'll have the full-size let's check the seal on the full-size jar looks like the seal is intact go ahead and break the seal all right oh we got some nice nugs in here see let me compare these smells here hmm I would say these minis are a lot sweeter and smell and these have a lot more of the sourness to it and it's like a I'm thinking a candy sourness smell almost artificial smellin like like a lime candy or something it's really interesting just dump these mugs out oh wow look at this guy's it looks like we only got about seven eight nodes here that's good look at this man all right I'm liking what I see these look like they're maybe a little bit more mature than the smaller ones the smell is more pungent and well-developed it's more of a well-rounded smell to it deeper bolder smell all right let's go in for some close-ups of this stuff at the nine pound hammer Minnie's up close as you can see they're really nice well-developed little buds we've got a nice coating a trichomes on them there's a bit of leaf enos tiny bit of leaving as you can see to them not a huge amount take a look at that some beautiful stuff that's for sure it's really good try cone coating is nice-looking the color of these tri cones is very close to that of the trichomes on the full eighth you know I don't know if you saw my video yesterday where I compared the lemon og cush Mini with the lemon og cush full size and you can see a definite difference in the trichomes as far as their maturity their color that kind of thing all right let's take a look at the nine pound hammer full-size buds and these things are just beautiful man these are even better like more thoroughly coated with trichomes the smell is better on them they're just overall more well-developed buds I probably give you a higher quality experience overall and just look how sandy these things are man looks so good alright let's go in for a little bit of a closer view alright now we've got a real close-up let's take a look at the minis first trichomes right there they look so good nice furry coating all over the buds pretty little orange hairs everywhere there you go yo fir that thing is it's a little bit of leaf eNOS on some of them tiny bit of leaf eNOS I should say it's not not anything like some other batches you might get from other places and worth mentioning though let's take a look at the full-size wow I mean the difference really is impressive between the two while on the minis you did see a really nice coating of tri cones these are just really nice you can look through here you start to see those big heads forming on these things the smell coming off of this plate is amazing it's a really pungent smell and like I said I'm not sure exactly how to describe it but it smells like some purple strains I've smelled before like maybe granddaddy purp or something like that we'll look at that one oh man is it snowing or something are they evolving they evolving a winter coat oh yeah look at that you can see some really fat heads in this nice it's really good check out check out that Rando big fat head in there you see a couple more over towards this into the boat you so I'd say these are the trichomes aren't as big and fat and plump as the lemon OG Kush was still looking very nice though all right let's get this stuff weighed up and toked up all right now let's get these suckers wait up there the scale of course first I think we'll weigh the regular size since they're easier to get off the plate you got 3.6 nice so point one over on those tear that scale again just in case whoa holy cow four point one oh man I did it again guys it's like hitting the lottery on Thanksgiving what you're gonna do you're gonna talk it up it's what you're gonna do that's some really cool stuff right there I like having 4.1 man so this is half a gram half a gram over what should actually it's plenty six grams but it's it's half a gram over the regular jar and point six over what it should be so excellent deal for 27 bucks or 21 60 or 20% off heck yeah all right let's see so nine pound hammer is it's been around for a while in the system it's one of the go-to strains of true leave a lot of people love it a lot of people hate it a lot of people love it for night time a lot of people say it doesn't do much for them nine pound hammer is an indica dominant hybrid it's a cross between GU berryhill's OG and Jack the Ripper pretty good strain I've enjoyed it the times that I've had it I haven't had any problems with it so pretty good stuff now let's get some of this toked up thank for the review I'm gonna review the minis because that's really what everyone is interested in getting nowadays it's the mini so pick out some nice buds they're all really nice-looking but I want to get some dents one here we go this is look at this man this thing is the densest little nub of kryptonite kind of looking stuff and here's another really just covered node I'll use these to pack my bowl might not even need to honestly this one is really nice and dense this strain seems to have some really dense nugs I really like that I'm kind of disappointed in the lemon og cush minis I opened yesterday though that jar strikes me more as a joint roll in the scroll on a joint rolling jar you know so I don't know if you guys have that kind of thing like you know I grade in my batches that I get and like you know if this it's not that great if it's got a bunch of seeds in it I just consider it a joint rolling batch in that way I can roll big old joints out of it not worry too much about wasting something that's beautiful so I'd consider the lemon og cush from yesterday a joint rolling batch this batch right here I'll hustle man it's a vaping batch I want to savor the flavor I want to get the full effects out of it dang where'd that little one go that I was gonna use huh oh well I'll use this one maybe I already cut it up hey man this stuff is nice and sticky it's just covered when I did get there was one little stem in here I saw I don't want to be you know full disclosure here I did get a stem but 4.1 I mean come on 4.1 that all bundled up there so I can cut it up nice and fine all right Thank You Dade and use my splinters II see what this cuz I think this is gonna pack a big hole punch so I'm gonna let it do its best to me the splinters he really also packs a punch see I got it packed there I don't want to pack it down too tight go ahead and let this thing heat up for 10 seconds before I start hitting it I'm ease into a hit not much but I could definitely feel it oh man okay this strain tastes beautiful he's got kind of a pine eNOS to it but also that purple flavor really got to look that flavor of it maybe maybe it's a kind of a flowery flavor that purple flavor I'm not really sure like maybe some dried flower buds I've smelled before or something like that but it's really nice maybe dried hibiscus almost but a little bit more funky it's really nice really love the flavor on this thing but one thing I feel like one thing I feel like I need to do is is learn a lot more about flavor terminology and you know stuff like that aromas well I can more accurately tell you what this stuff tastes like see you start to get some vapor in there oh wow some good hits this thing always hits me so fast sorry to get sniffily feel it in my face no that's one really heat up see if I get a good old cloud maker going here oh my goodness man blow my nose again oh man so I'm that bigger hit I'm starting to get a little crazy fruit coming through maybe just a look at oh man it's like barely even cooked dang we're gonna be here for wild boys well that'll be here for a while boys and you really got to work this thing it's like it's a it's analog for sure you know it's not your digital normal digital bait this isn't the kind that you just turn it on and you do whatever you want to you got to play it like an instrument and man if you play it right it rewards you it really does so you gotta learn to play this thing oh hey kitty kitty hey baby kitty cat yeah this isn't for you baby you're gonna have to go away for a little bit be right back all right I'm back had to give that little kitty something that Thanksgiving on a little sour cream did the trick all right oh yeah it started crank out that vapor that was a really smooth hip for how much paper I got surprised usually it's usually be really killing me just a couple light coughs I'm deal with that yeah this thing is all about changing up the speed of the draw and the duration oh wow it's now it's getting a lot more of a greener flavor to it like all of a sudden maybe even a sweet peas flavor like a sugar snap peas that kind of thing interesting you'll see what we got in here now starting to get to it mmm I'm starting to get through this here almost done with it man I'm feeling pretty good um I'm a little surprised you know this is a lot more clear-headed than I would expect from nine pound hammer I feel great but in a very clear-headed way which is interesting like I don't feel groggy so you know take from that what you will I guess it can vary person to person but yeah I don't feel tired and groggy from this I feel just fine and it feels good really good I've definitely felt a lot more indica indica like effects from like Starkiller's a good one for that another one off the top of my head well let me know gee cush there you go I took a really good one for that I'm not getting very much vapor off of this and it's tasting pretty toasty so I think I pretty much cook this goose even though it doesn't really look totally toasted here let me try during this up a little bit no give it one more hit and if that don't work then I guess we're doing oh yeah that did it just give it a good stir Oh firmly into toasty territory now definitely at the end of the bolt it's a nice vapor there oh very toasty oh yeah it's starting to reduce in volume - I'll buy a lot probably buy a third at this point which is great I mean think about that that means all those trichomes were taking up a lot of physical space all right well it looks like I've cooked this one looks like I've cooked this one all the way through I'm not getting very much off of it and it's brown all right so there we have it get these two things on the plate again nine pound hammer minis versus full-size minis effects are great they don't feel really heavy to me I feel awesome right now I don't feel tired or you know couch locked or anything like that so this is nine pound hammer minis these are $27 they're about 24 bucks with 10% off and about 2160 with 20% off this is an excellent deal especially if you get 4.1 grams out of it like I did these are the nine pound hammer on the side full-size these costs fifty three dollars and eight very expensive for what it is beautiful buds it smells really nice nice effects I wouldn't say they're on the sedative side or anything like that I'd just say that it's a really nice high and so yeah if you get these on sale and you could get it down to what let's see 43 bucks so 20% off they're around 43 bucks or something like 42 for the jar it makes it reasonable ish but it's still way too high so wait for the minis I mean you know it's such a good deal all right guys thank you very much for watching y'all have a happy Thanksgiving you guys I just wanted to show you this bud it's out of the Florida Medical system it's a legal bud what do you guys think about it what's that but make you think does it remind you of anything any strains any dispensaries any effects how does this bud make you feel when you look at it what would you say about this bud if you had to say something about it does this bud look good to you you look like a high quality bud all right I'm going a little bit closer all right let's get a really good close-up of that bud what do you think about it you think of any names or places when you see this bud any feelings or experiences what's this bud remind you of you think it looks like a good bud how's this but make you feel what do you think about this bud alright thank you for watching you have a good one", "w0dbfTnA1v8": "[Music] what's crackin y'all this is be real AKA dr. greenthumb for another strain alert it's been a minute you know I've been filming a lot of smoke boxes at the plate as you guys must know but big coming across a lot of fire a lot of gas lately one of which I have right here before me this is called the clue lotto buy the gas pump this [ __ ] is [ __ ] fire it tastes so goddamn good as crazy it's it's across with some Girl Scout cookies and face on fire cross back into cookies cross with gelato 33 and this is a strain that is produced for my man yep mouth I got more than five on it I got to tell you because this is the business right here and I've got to say if you're a connoisseur this is this is you're gonna want this if you're into the exotic flavors men I'm you know they've done their thing in the gas economy because if if you check these nuggets right and you look at just the bag appeal or the jar appeal if you they are [ __ ] you know sigh and if you go closer and you put a little you know you get one of the micro lenses you'll see this [ __ ] is frosting she is [ __ ] frosty you could make a snowman on this [ __ ] she's so frosty trying to tell you by when you open up the bag it's got that crazy exotic soap type of fragrance that just everybody as I came that you know roll that [ __ ] up fast on one taste that and then once you taste it it's it's very full you know the flavors is it's you taste a little bit of that gelato you taste a little bit that face on fire and you actually taste a little bit of those Girl Scout cookies it's a very nice mix and I gotta say the Cure and the groom all that stuff top-notch man if I were giving it five green thumbs on a review y'all could not be mad at those five green thumbs because these [ __ ] have done their thing this is a strain alert not a review let me tell you this is just us telling you about the fire and I tell you right now this cool Otto right here is [ __ ] fire you know [Music] fortunately I could smoke this with to my head because this is a non sharing segment not a meaning all the homies that are in the other part of the studio they can't smell it but if they did they'd want this segment to be over so that I could share this with them and that will adopt it so for all y'all they want to know you can go to Instagram a check for the Instagram Gas Co LA Gas Co underscore calais and you will find the stores and the shops and delivery services that might carry the lines if they up they have a lot of dope lines but this is the one we're learning to do Tuesday cool lot off my all right so go get it and keep it blazing [Music]", "UNWHow4VH3k": "well we are back we are back and we are pressing a quarter of moxie viper cookies okay uh this is i haven't i haven't pressed a lot of moxie uh in a while so this will be fun this stuff is ringing in at uh 26.9 percent combined thc thca we've got a 121 micron bag here and the crd 30 ton triptech rosin press is set to 180 degrees fahrenheit i don't use timers i don't use the gauge that's on this pump so please don't ask me how long i leave it on just watch the video and you'll see how long i leave it on for okay so this has been rehydrated with hydra stones and we're going to load this bag up hope everybody is staying safe staying medicated and being good to each other out there just a reminder if you are a medical marijuana patient in the pittsburgh area and you have dispensary flour and you would like to have it turned into gold please come and see me in penn hills here at the studio i do that for patients i press form for free that is a patient's helping patients initiative that i've been doing since 2018 never charge a patient to press their medicine for it it is important that patients get good quality medicine at a price that they can afford and i am trying to help in that respect so here is our quarter get this thing all put into a nice little package and move these lights up here and get this placed right where i want it to be there we go that paper of course anytime you're doing live stuff okay all right so let's get that out of the way and get this centered up where i want it to be get the light in there on it real good so you can see it get real close and put it right there all right here we go let's get this valve closed on the pump let's make some medicine there's nothing i enjoy more right now than just getting the best that this flower can offer and as long as you treat this plant with respect she will give herself to give you the best medicine that you can have much better quality than anything you will get in the dispensary as a concentrate solidness is definitely the way to go and rosin whether it be hash rosin or flower rosin is a step way bigger than any of the commercially available chemically extracted concentrates so let's just remember where the quality is and the flavor because this is a full spectrum extract and take terpenes and winterize it do all kinds of crazy stuff they just you just get the buds and the essence of them their soul that's the way i like to approach it so as you can see it's going to get harder and harder to see so i'm going to let this go now and start concentrating on this press i'm going to let that heat soak in for about 30 seconds before i finish get the full pressure i don't know if there's any big drops tomorrow for the weekend but i would be watching the healing center my tree rise all of those guys because you know how that goes friday if you get a big drop and if you're not ready to grab it online you can lose out real easy all right almost at pressure there we go that's where i want to be with it let it sit there for a minute i'm going to pull this shot back out oh yeah this should be fun so again moxie doesn't come out with a lot of flour they've been coming out with more lately and i don't get a chance to press much of it because it's usually at the high end of the price spectrum not a lot of patients bring it to me so i figured i'd grab some and we'll see what see what it does you know and there isn't a whole lot else you can do except uh try it and it goes into my database you find out how it stacks up against the other grower processors and the other strains that they're putting out so i'm just getting the scale ready i already have a jar make sure i get the tear on that first seventeen yep that's great okay are you ready you ready to see it here we go okay viper cookies what'd you give us oh oh yes oh yeah i'll tell you what take a look at that that looks mighty mighty fine to me so let us get that paper off of here turn off the i am done pressing unless unless there's a patient that comes over with something for me let me get the shot out and redirected all right a small blowout no big deal take my tools here clean a little bit of clean rosin off the end of that but like i said blowouts happen no matter whose bag you're using luckily they don't happen all the time so let's get this fired up tara and philip she looks like a happy plant this thing was coming off looking like it was made from washed flour uh and that it didn't just come from straight flour some of this consistency is very reminiscent of a lot of hash rosin i see being shown on ig gas rosin's fantastic it's just not practical for medical patients in pennsylvania because of our prices you know so pennsylvania and the medical marijuana program flower rosin is king of solidness because you can't get the good stuff good ash rosin at the dispensers they don't sell it they don't make it people who do make it aren't making it for the legal market so best you're gonna get medicine wise from somebody who can craft it immediately for you somebody like me who's doing flower rosin just like this gotta love this plant with all your heart to be good at doing this consistently you got to be having access to flour that is of amazing quality to get this kind of result oh this stuff came out so beautiful oh yeah oh moxie my good friend dave perlow gabe pirlo who is the ceo of moxie he and i have had a very nice relationship as far as his business ideas about doing solventless believe me when the feds lift the the lid off this whole thing and deschedule this plant you're gonna start seeing a lot more solventless on the market because it will be on the recreational side probably but you will see it moxie has always been a concentrate centric company it started off they didn't have the canopy enough to to sell flowers so all they sold were their really nice concentrates and their cartridges i love their cartridges liquid moxies melon wreck is awesome ellerange is fantastic a big fan of their distillate cartridges but their flowers always been kind of rare you know now they're stepping up their their production ability and now they're coming out with more flour which is really cool so let's see what we got for a yield and wow 0.61 well when you take away the 17 grams for the jar that is well that is not what i would consider an acceptable yield okay again my bare minimum acceptable yield is half half a gram per eight this comes out to be point three per eighth which i mean here's the thing though the quality is amazing okay and in terms of the look of it it smells incredible you know but there it is maybe i can get it you can see the better light i mean look at the quality of that there's no disputing the fact that moxie makes really good flour the problem is the flour that they make or that they grow doesn't have the wax and lipid profiles to make them a good candidate for solventless extraction via rosin press so always bear in mind that when you're going to buy flour you need to pick strains that work for you and you have to be willing to accept that you may get a strain like this like this viper cookies which looks to be amazing probably going to taste incredible uh but the yield is not sufficient for for me from for me personally it may be for you as a patient you may be a baller and can afford to buy enough eights to get enough of this pressed to make it worth medicating with it i tend to look for the higher producing strains i think this is an excellent strain i bet it's a great strain for the other uses dry vaping quote unquote um but for rosin it's one i would probably take a pass on personally but if you're seeing this and you're liking what you see grab yourself some dispensary flower and get on over here to penn hills and come and see me and i will do this for you too stay safe stay medicated be good to each other everybody have a good day", "kknjCzCJUbY": "[Music] what's poppin yield this is dr. greenthumb from be real TV we got another strain alert up in the [ __ ] temple right now we got this nice strain provided by the gas company the gas co this is called tropical lotto no I'm saying it's tangi crop with poo lotto no if you don't know what a lotto is we just did a strain alert on that not too long ago it's with some sort of fire Girl Scout cookies and such as Auto thirty-three back into each other you know that we explained it in the last one but um it's that strange cool lotto mixed with tan G now the nubs are crazy I mean they are frostbitten I mean that means there are tremendous trichomes on these Nuggets now I mean you want to put them in a jar you don't want to have them in a bag because then bag is just gonna smash away all that tasty goodness

on this the I mean everything about it you open up this jar it's a burst of crazy crazy [ __ ] flavor out of that jar you know and I think it's partially because of the tangi mixed in with with the colada lid when you taste it it's got that soapy taste but it's got that little bit of you know mandarin twist if you will you know it's it's it's one of those joints where it tasted very good towards the middle it starts off with a lot of flavor but in the middle it starts really kicking you know a lot of joints are doing that and you know you get the full effect if you got them all one of these funky fill tips you know we don't roll our [ __ ] with doubt um don't get don't get the imposter brands get the top of the roster rim you know what I'm saying not the felonious you know you get with

smoke this [ __ ] you are going to get everybody's attention man the bag appeal the jar appeal is 100,000% and I got to tell you this tropical lotto is one of the doper exotics I've come across in the

you know what I'm saying I'm dr. greenthumb this has been your strain alert [Music]", "j-FFcCKEEi8": "what's going on guys it's your boy sam from sammy cbd tv welcome back welcome back to everybody uh you know let's get you popping right like old times right all right guys today i got a review coming at you with the white cbg from a company known as nothing other than the main company called the diet dank cbg white white cbg diet dank guys this company i was introduced to uh by green point c company it's an absolute it is like an astonishing company um green point seed company i highly recommend them for any of you cultivators out there all right so why don't i just give you i'm gonna give you a little bit of a bust down i'm gonna i always like to i like to see what the company says in their description just so you guys know what they're bringing to the table okay so let's check it out white cbg hemp flower is an incredible popular among the hemp consumers the dense buds boasts an attractive ray of colors beneath the white trichome blanket a lot of you guys know cbg has got that white look to it um and it's always a little drier i've noticed out of all the strains in the past that i've ever smoked or vaped um this is an indica dominant strain guys so let me get right back into it all right so notably white cbg contains extremely low thc levels while maintaining a potent cannabinoid profile in fact white cbg contains up to 20 cbg and has thc percentages well below 0.3 hemp threshold as such consuming this indica dominant health cultivator will not cause anyone to feel high though it may make them feel a whole lot better anyway so cbg is one of over 100 cannabinoids guys um you guys know one of my favorite cannabinoids is cbn okay cbg is an especially exciting cannabinoid because it's the precursor to all the other cannabis based cannabinoids um it is the first cannabinoid to develop in the residence trichomes of the hemp flower okay so it usually transforms into other cannabinoids like thc then cbd throughout a process called cannabidrolic acid synthesis okay so you'll find perfect balance of cbg in white cbg they're claiming strains such as these have exceptionally high cbd levels because growers can allow them to develop cannabinoids while into the season without risking much thc development so they're saying it's skunky creamy pine aromas okay so it's an indica dominant hemp variety that features dense colorful buds coated in milky white trichomes mild odors producing a faint hint of fresh earth pine lemon and cilantro its most dominant terpenes include migraine pinene carotene and visible oh notably this unique profile combines nicely to create a relaxed while clear-headed experience just what i like to see and just what i like to hear right guys um indoor ground so it's exceptionally smooth causing a slight heat in the back of the throat a strong citrus flavor [Music] consume an after dessert or pleasant compliment to an early cup of joe despite its missing psychiatric properties consumers often find themselves feeling relaxed and better focused clutter-free mine that's what's up i have to uh no all jokes aside but guys we're gonna see what this is all about i'm actually kind of interested now that they're uh you know saying all these things about it all right guys so let's check it out let me bring this little closer to you one second one second boom check that out you like how that's that focus game i don't see anybody else's cameras on youtube looking like that boy all right i'm happy to be back you know i miss you guys much love much love we got some great reviews coming up front guys i've had this um five leaf wellness uh barry cross sitting in my like bedroom for like almost a week now i will get to it i'm sorry that'll be next i promised this one like a long time ago so i'm just trying to go in order again right so i'm getting that cilantro hempy it actually smells pretty pretty good all right not bad let's check it out guys that's the um that's not bad wow there's definitely a lot of trichomes on there wow yeah that's that's definitely got some trichomes on there you can't really tell first until you get it close and light let me uh let me just i'm gonna break it open a little bit oh wow i find it smelling like cilantro and grass but it's got this really nice hint of something in there guys it's like deep in there i'm getting that i think it's the citrus hold on man it does have citrus guys you gotta like really break it open though to really get it like i'm not gonna front like it's not strong but when you get it it's there oh man this [ __ ] smells so good all right so naturally it breaks down like with no effort i mean it's it's on the drier side i've had this for a while though too so you know look at that look at that look at that piece hanging on my nose but you know for real this [ __ ] was like you know it's a little dry but uh like i said i've had it for a little while now so guys i'm gonna be vaping this bad boy today because i want to know what it's all about as far as clean hit all right guys i'm going to be using the uh get high as an hi this is my get high vaporizer it's got the uh joint right there so one two 3 4 5. all right so as you can see the uh the green see it it's actually heating up currently right now yo when you guys get a moment because i had to listen to uncopyrighted music for my uh video because all like it's crazy because people are just heated up so i can't talk anymore all right guys let's see what it's all about cbg man cbg [Music] make it it's got like a really smooth wow i'm starting to feel now it's like it's right here it has that citrus taste guys it's got that real green like i'm talking like green green that's not bad i'm just gonna do that one that's that one ball pack this for this round because this [ __ ] is it's pretty official i could feel it already it's just creeping in there like real calming now not like super crazy or nothing as far as like making me anxious and [ __ ] yo some strains though y'all [ __ ] that i'm just gonna be honest crazy you know what i mean like i wouldn't even mess with them i wouldn't even mess with them man that is that's not bad though that's really not bad guys i might just kind of i kind of think this is pretty good white cbg dieting keep out of the reach of children consult your health care oh wow am i pregnant or nursing nope that's not bad guys so like i said this is a indica dominant [Music] strain huh we have other cbg strains too wow let me check that out i actually didn't even know that oh excuse me guys thank you alright huh wow guys i just i well now okay honestly i feel super calm right now like actually it's kind of it's quite a little it's quite pleasant i thought it would make me anxious truthfully but i'm gonna check this let me just dial in here see what we got we'll see it says within average resting range so you know i'm not getting the heart racing guys it's not making me very anxious maybe a tad anxious but most of it's in my head because a lot of you guys know i took a break from doing reviews so this is pretty cool listen to this guy so inactive in its acidic form cannabinoids like cbga become decarboxylated when heated altering their chemical structure most of you guys know that when you're making edibles you need to decarboxylate the flower first before you do it that way it's activated okay so cbda turns into cbd thca turns into thc okay so non-acidic cbg really binds to both cb1 and cb2 receptors throughout the body and may help regulate endocannabinoid signaling though cbg is not psychoactive it may help regulate the levels and reduce thc high that accompanies marijuana consumption uh it's a quick solution to marijuana over indulgence so apparently they're claiming that if you have too much thc you can use the cb g oh i really didn't know i didn't actually some of the stuff i didn't know about cbg like i said you guys know i'm ultra familiar with cbd thc et cetera cbn as well but cbg i wasn't 100 sure i did a review in the past about it but excuse me wow that is what the strains doing to me i feel like licking my eyes i feel like this super like calm dude i'm not gonna lie guys i was very very nervous okay i'm just gonna turn that music off because i want to be 100 real with you guys i was so freaking nervous to do review because my last experience with that cbd hemp flower i got the skywalker strain from plain jane and it just sent me into a full-blown panic attack um the one before that that set the tipping point like basically once i had this one strain from there on out panic attacks all the time a lot of you guys and i know a lot of you guys can uh you know that what's the word for that relate you can relate to what i'm saying because you know you know um so basically secret nature's secret dream strain sent me into a full-blown massive panic attack it is a sativa strain i freaked i mean i literally walked inside ripped my shirt off i went up to my girl said yo i think i'm gonna have a heart attack i think i'm dying um i was so so scared guys and you know what it makes me want to tear up because i'm being for real like you can't make that [ __ ] up and a lot of you guys are like [ __ ] or uh cbd's diet weed it's like first of all i'm gonna tell you right now that secret dream strain that i got through either it was the terpene profile or they definitely pushed through some stuff that was above the legal limit whatever okay i used to be a full-blown marijuana advocate i used to love thc and all that guys i can't use the anymore um only for the simple fact that it caused me to have psychosis um i got some synthetic k2 stuff guys if you don't know um it sent me to a full-blown psychosis state from there on out i couldn't smoke cigarettes i couldn't walk fast i couldn't do anything to elevate my heart rate it made me always think i was having a heart attack um when i used that k2 spice guys my heart rate went up to 196. okay that is terrifying okay terrifying so you know from there on out i couldn't do that and uh you know that secret dream strain really woke something up my mind from like that moment from years ago because i was i was panicking all the time guys like all the time you know so whatever it was i'm not gonna lie it made me freaking nervous um but anyway so basically i got the skywalker strain then from plain jane and it did the same thing um why did it do that i don't know so i just wanted you guys to know that if you guys are thc sensitive individuals okay like i had become later on in life um really check the thc a um in most strings okay a lot of people like the cbc along with the cbg and i got the delta eight vape cards and the delta eight this and that if you have a sensitivity to th e do not use delta eight at all okay common sense don't do it you're gonna freak the [ __ ] out you don't want to do that to yourself okay if you're sensitive to i can't say cbd because no one's really sensitive to cbd however well they're sorry man this this strain makes me tired so all those strains literally have thc in them okay the legal limit hence the legal limit so even though it's cbd hemp flour there's still some thc in it so if you are really that sensitive to thc like you like i am you really guys need to be careful for real i do not want to see anybody freak the [ __ ] out kill themselves jump in front of a bus because you're going through that crazy panic phase where you literally think you're really dying okay um i'm here for you guys if you ever need a friend to talk to comment down below all you guys know me i give away as much as i can in fact i'm having a two ounce giveaway coming up i'm gonna give two ounces to one individual okay two freaking ounces okay i might even do that not tomorrow but the next day okay i'm gonna give away two ounces to someone that really is in need okay um but anyway because i'm mumbling now to go back to what i was saying is you really got to be careful about the the tolerance problem okay guys um i don't want to see anybody freak out like for real so if that's the case i'd recommend the cbg because i didn't know that cg actually can bring down the thc high it's kind of interesting actually in fact i'm going to look more into cooler uh more other indica cbg strings because i really like this they use one freaking ball pack dude and it's got me going like a mug like i'm gonna show you another i'm gonna give you another picture of this little tiny this nug and how it looks okay so check that out you see that look at that you can see the frost look at this like frost balls protruding from it it's kind of insane wow this is dry see that you see it turned to dust that's interesting anyways guys it's your boy sam thanks for tuning in for another review i really appreciate it means a lot to me i enjoy

product review video so check it out for this video I'm going to be trying another joint by fat Panda it's gonna be great I hope but nonetheless this is OG cam coming in at 23 percent THC with thawing 0.18 percent of CBD and then it's got two point fifty three percent on the terpenes alright I don't think it's got really anything else in it not really alright so I picked this up at green to go in Finley Washington this is a legal Washington product again this is by fat Panda this is the second joint that I've reviewed by fat Panda the first one didn't get so good of reviews now I know what some people might be post in the comment section well your last review you gave them bad reviews and I like fat Panda joints they're pretty damn joints and dadada I've had good fat Panda joints okay I'm not gonna say that all of them are [ __ ] that's not what these review videos are about okay they're not saying hey this company [ __ ] don't buy this company okay my review videos are for the individual products not the companies the products okay so if one joint didn't score to higher didn't score to well doesn't mean that this one won't okay it just all depends on the product to be honest it just did that's all it depends on so we're gonna go ahead and pop that top take the seal off show you guys it's not been opened or tampered with there we go and we're all right and there is our joint they're using the raw papers with the rock crutch they got their logo right there I'm gonna try to make this review video on this joint a little faster than the other one I know the other one was like 10 minutes I'm gonna try to speed it up on this one so what we're gonna be basing this review on is how well does it smoke does it run does it you know suck at hitting and we're also going to be reviewing the flower of course inside it does it taste good as a bottom-of-the-barrel shake you know what I mean a lot of joints are bottom of the barrel shake to be to be very you know Frank like even if a company says it snugs and buds and premium cannabis it's [ __ ] okay a lot of the times 90% of the time that's not that it's usually bottom of the jar shake whatever sweet leaf that's falling off stuff like that okay nonetheless I'm gonna give this one a try this is the og Kim I have had the flower version of this it not in the joint and I loved it I absolutely loved it it tastes amazing the Turks were great now this you can smell it it actually smells pretty good you can smell that og cabinet ya know you can smell it it smells really good it's definitely got that og

say I do recommend this OGG episode you kids pretty good I really like it I really dig it I do it's got so far it's burning really nice it's got a nice even burn to it and I like it when joints have that that's one of the main reasons the joints are a turn-off for me that and how fast they smoke you know what a blunt does last longer I'm more of a blunt person myself but I do like joints there are also a lot healthier for you than blunts are so let's give it a good rip no bear I would definitely recommend this so if you're looking for like a pre-roll product and you don't mind paying $7

cream the kalama kush the j1 and the nigerian silver i feel like i might have had the kalama kush before maybe not maybe not maybe not okay all right all right y'all let's let's get into the chirp review let's get into the turk review okay we're gonna set the box down we're gonna move the pre-rolls to the side we're gonna move the edibles for later we'll try these later um we're going to we're going to keep the tincture on the table because we might have more of that cray thank you for following the twitter hell yeah man big hell yeah okay let's try these out kamala yep yep it's hers okay so we have two of the caramel cream so we'll put one aside we have four strains to try here we have um here we go check them out okay hold on let me turn the music off here yo what's good everyone today well actually okay hold on let me let me do this again what's good everyone um wait hold on let me think here okay yeah yeah yo what's good everyone it's cosmos and today i'm bringing y'all a terp review from my twitch so this is live on the twitch and i'm gonna be uploading it to the youtube we got some new strains here oh boy they're actually on the table but we got some new strains um by karova right here we got a little goodie bag in from corova and so we're gonna strain review all four of the strains the j1 caramel cream kamalakush and the nigerian silver um we also got some other pretty [ __ ] epic stuff in bicoroba so much love corroba huge shout out for the care package and love we're gonna be trying these products i'll give y'all product reviews on everything that we try from them um i actually just downed a little bit of this thousand milligram tincture right here to start the strain review and we're gonna see uh where it all goes from here so yeah let's uh get into it here and start with uh why don't we just start with the kamala kush right here so we're going to start with the outside of the package you know the corrobor packaging very simple just a box here is just solid packaging we're going to look now i'm careful here and we're going to look at the processor name on the side of the package because if i'm not mistaken corova does outsource most of their extraction this is beehive extract here i don't think i've had anything by beehive extracts before so i'm excited to try this this is og kush phenotype of the kamala kush let's open it and see how it looks okay so from the outside of the the gram it has a solid look taco toker thank you for the follow let's go ahead and slice this open i do like their grams a lot of the containers in oregon they have the screw lids that get stuck whenever they get oil in them these guys have the snap and pop lid so like you just go like oh excuse me there we go yeah so it snaps like to the side and then it pops open okay so this is like um a 50 50 dry wet batter it's not super wet but it's not super dry let me smell it hold on oh [ __ ] yes [ __ ] yes yes oh i just touched my nose to it this is exactly the [ __ ] consistency that you want on just like a solid just like very solid you know not like crazy crazy high end where it's like crazy 50 dollars you know but like around the twenty dollar [ __ ] thirty dollar range you know um yeah it has the terps it's not like a super like cushy smell to it but it's almost like cheesy oh it's mellow too i'm gonna use a dabber to break it up a little bit that way we can get more of the terp smell um i noticed that you know whenever you get a fresh gram it's been sitting there for a minute you know sometimes you don't get that fresh turp smell but if you really mix it up you can get that real the real terp smell wow this this honestly reminds me of something that i smoked like six years ago that i really really liked that being said like it just has like that almost like really rich like old crumble smell to it like i mean old crumble not like it's old but like that you know how crumble used to smell way back in the day whenever it would smell like really [ __ ] good um this kind of has that nose to it it's an interesting nose i can't i can't uh can't see exactly what it is but i'm excited let's take a dab sorry i've just been sitting here with my nose in it this whole time um let's take a dab see where it goes i'll try to i'll try to chain somewhat chain these dabs so the review doesn't end up being like 40 minutes or something but it's probably gonna end up being like 40 minutes or whatever so yeah big cheers trey hell yeah yo mini gun thank you for the follow appreciate you hope your day's been nicely lit over there yeah so i'm i'm excited to try this right here this is the kamala kush okay okay big flower boy i'm gonna have to be smoking a little bit of flour here now now that i got that flour try it out see how it is you know i'm excited to try this i'm excited for sure let me heat it up crazy we got this right here all right check it yo check it check it when i gave it a little mix around there we got a nice look to it um i don't think that i have a feeling that beehive isn't running crc this looks a little bit too yellow to be crc to me i think crc would be a little bit wider and it doesn't have like a crazy citrus terp to the background to it it's possible that it's a pho blend based on the little bit of nose that i get from it but it might be pure butane it's hard to tell let's uh let's take a dab here and see how it goes we've got a nice little little chunker just a tiny bit more here we're going to be taking four dabs here so i'm not trying to kill the whole gram and once because i'm going to save some so that we can record some more videos with them but i also want to get enough so that i can get a very good palatable test to it you know and really just test out that flavor i'm gonna play some songs here um by uh billy marcia fava for this dab billy's the homie i'll link his spotify down in the youtube description for when i put this on youtube and big cheers everyone the kamala kush for the first time you don't even need to go to class just that one's really mellow smooth a little bit of nose burn from the terps i like the terps slightly like earthy like a little bit gassy yeah it definitely does come through with that nose burn on the terps there but it's not like harsh at all but it does burn your nose a little bit okay so honestly um it was really smooth nicely tasty i'm already feeling pretty uh pretty toasted from that dab it's been a minute since i've taken a dab too so like an hour it doesn't taste quite as cheesy as it smells but overall it's good it's good um i wouldn't say it's like the best that i've had you know it's pretty solid but it's not like super super super fire you know i had there's nothing wrong with it but it was it was solid it was very solid you know it wasn't like it wasn't the most fire i'm just being straight up with y'all i'm an honest person you know um it was good um you said i'm not a fan of the [ __ ] yeah i didn't get any film on the mouth no feel my mouth this was kamala kush right here high q plays by corova and that one was it was pretty solid um really smooth you know i have no complaints with it on a scale of one to ten um you know for like budget product under the 30 range i'd give it like photoshop i'm my own director i mean probably like a six or seven you know i mean i've had some pretty damn fire stuff for the same price range it really wasn't bad at all you know and like if it was like well um this was like one of the options at the dyspo you know and it was like you only have a few options i wouldn't not recommend it it's not like it was bad at all but didn't have a chirp that like really stood out to me so yeah i can definitely show it again yeah it's a solid it's solid it's not bad at all yo my when i say something is a six or a seven that's an objective scale like it's actually a solid product okay and five is average so it's solid come on man this jar these jars aren't normally this [ __ ] but this one specifically is a little bit [ __ ] in the house who extracted this so this is um sold under the karova brand but it's extracted by beehive extracts in oregon and if i'm not mistaken these not all of them are processed by different companies but i'm pretty sure that some of these are processed by different extraction companies so i'm extremely excited to put them side by side and then be able to come back to corova and give them some good feedback about which extractor i think would be best for them to continue working with because i have actually told them in the past that there was a couple extractors they were working with that i really didn't like the product and that were making some shitty product out of their stuff so yeah um okay on to the next one we have some caramel cream the caramel cream is extracted by bobsled extracts i just gotta say bobsled is fire as far as i have ever had any bobsled i've had a couple strains from them that were kind of crappy like it was just it felt like the turks were crappy i've had a lot of trains by bobsled that were super far um this one was tested 11 12 20 20. uh so a few months ago and uh let's break open the packaging and test it out have i ever had any dirty arm farms i have tried um some other stuff never impressed it's always their whole company is honestly um just feels kind of a little bit shady with their [ __ ] like selling like crc [ __ ] and like trying to sell to soccer moms is like some boujee [ __ ] and stuff just it all doesn't feel quite right to me and so yeah let's see how this caramel this is caramel cream caramel cream by bobsled is looking good crc is color remediation column is what it stands for okay caramel cream um has a very solid like orange smell to it bro this smells like crc to me it has a really good like floral orange like lime smell to it but it's like that very it's that very slightly stereotypical crc smell with slight floral aftertone to it so this might have actually been some good starting product yeah and i mean i have a lot of crc a lot of what i dab is crc and i have nothing against crc whatsoever zero percent but i think that it can be done in in good ways and in bad ways um like you can over crc something by putting too much media in the columns and whatnot um 110 very very easy to do that so yeah let's go ahead and heat up and test this one out let's try it out so this does have a slight bit of the crc smell but i mean it's wet in the point that it looks like it has a good amount of terps in it and i mean it does have like a floral smell as well to the to the orange like lemon um crc tarp it like the smell of it almost right now reminds me of like [ __ ] like hold on hold up you know what this smells like this smells like powdered lemonade no the yellow gatorade powder dabs of the move for sure yes yeah this smells like yellow gatorade powder not in a bad way that's just what it smells like yes scuba hell yeah hell yeah yeah dabs are just very concentrated forms of cannabis you know so it's gonna be like two or three times um as much whenever you take a dab like for it like hitting you i'd say it's probably all right we're on cool down for this one we got four strains in total to try this is number two out of four we're about to try is the caramel kush extracted by bobsled for corova um coroba unrivaled they hooked me up with a care package with some strains and stuff and we're doing a little strain review trying to give y'all an objective strain review letting you guys know exactly which ones are my favorite terps why i think so which ones are my least favorite terps why i think so um should be straight up with y'all we got we tried the kamala kush last by beehive extracts it seemed like some solid non-crc stuff i gave it a six to seven out of ten not bad whatsoever not crazy impressive of a product either so far this caramel cream has a good smell to it really good wet look um extracted by bobsled which they're pretty solid but the smell to it is like a lemon gatorade powder is what i said the the yellow gatorade powder and so i have a feeling it may taste a little bit like crc but we're gonna see okay straight up whatever happened little dab [Music] [Applause] new speakers forget it in a week where's that brand new single i got chains like mr t but you don't want to try mine turn your whole neck limousine cup of coffee in a magazine i flex real hard awesome it's not harsh on the throat but that one definitely got me as well um a little bit in the nose maybe it's because i exhaled the start of it out of my nose but yeah that was a good dab right there honestly um really smooth really really smooth had the turret burn as well um the flavor i think i need to blow my nose um because i'm just not getting the flavor quite as much as i would like to i think that that one okay let me just blow it i think that i'm getting it um yeah okay i stand by what i think um more what i thought at the beginning the flavor on that one is very mellow um he said i have to blow my nose after every dab i don't blame you i don't blame you the chirps that get you sometimes yeah that one's nice um it's smooth i really like the high from it i'm not gonna lie i think that i like the high from that caramel cream a little bit more than the first one and i have a feeling if i dabbed a lot of that i would just be [ __ ] lit as [ __ ] yo rod thank you for the follow much love much love so that one's pretty solid that uh that caramel cream i'm gonna have to take more dabs of that a little bit later and we'll delve into it more and see if we can get more of the flavor out of it maybe with a little fatter dab or something maybe a little low temp dab and come back to it it was solid um but just not quite as much flavor as i wanted but definitely solid i like the high from it too so overall on that one i give it like a uh a 6.5 to 7.5 it's slightly better than the um corova or the uh the like the kamala kush but um not quite as flavorful slightly better overall just because i think i might like the effects a little bit better like the initial effects but um yeah the flavor isn't quite as prominent all right on to the next one we have some um nigerian silver here and this one is processed by beehive extracts as well um tested 2 9 20 21 so this is some freshy fresh and let's see how it's looking the nigerian silver okay i mean i i even though i got these for free i gotta i gotta show you guys because i know i'm objective i gotta just literally i gotta show everyone because i'm an honest person there is a piece of particulate in here um it's not a very big piece of particulate if this were to happen um normally i would um show it to the stream and then i would take the piece of particulate out and i'd say it's not that big of a deal i don't really care um so that's exactly what i'm gonna do right here okay i got the piece of particulate right here what is this let me look at it hold up it breaks apart so i think it's organic i think it's just a piece of cannabis particulate that wound up in the gram no big deal no big deal [ __ ] happens all the time i've seen way way way way way exponentially worse um [ __ ] uh particular so i'm not worried about that whatsoever let's give y'all a better look here of this gram and then we'll break it up and get the smell going here this one once again is the nigerian silver oh yeah oh [ __ ] yeah oh yeah okay hold on i mean for how dry this one is the smell is amazing um wow nice it's like a slightly wet butter like just like a putty consistency almost like a wet putty oh yeah oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah well i'm excited to try this i'm very very very very very excited to try this one this has an extremely floral smell what's good miss girl how you doing oh very nice sweet funky it has a sweet funk to it nigerian x unknown yeah this [ __ ] smells great i'm really excited to try this honestly let's [ __ ] go yo this is hype this is height let's heat it up dab number three oh i haven't been keeping the dab counter updated hold on we're just gonna hit the three dab updater here in the seven dabs i'm excited i'm excited wow i've been dabbing down pretty fat pretty quick as well because i checked my timer and it's still got like 40 more minutes until that uh temperature should be kicking in or so maybe even a little bit longer i'm curious if any of y'all in the chat or people that in the future see the youtube video have tried corova in oregon what y'all think about it um or elsewhere and what y'all's favorite strain was or whatever favorite product and uh yeah which you maybe liked didn't like about it you know very curious to hear so yeah sounds good panda see you in a bit baby hey what's good toes how you doing man what's good what's good we're just doing a little strain review over here for some new corova strains that they hooked it up with giving a little objective feedback on them letting y'all know what i think about them and they're testing out some of their products pretty stoked on it pretty stoked on you're on your lunch break nice toes the day's definitely lit over here so far how about yourself how's the day been over there work that lunch break action let's go all right we're about to dive in on this nigerian silver right here oh i really do like the nose on this one i like the consistency too do a nice chunk here so we can get a good flavor test make sure we get a good low temp one on this one i want to get the flavor here cheers but it's still this one's my favorite one so far it's not terps that like smack you in the face like some of the dabs that i have um but it's a really nice um smooth still does burn your nose all these have that nose burning quality to them and they just kind of get you in the nostrils i don't know what it is okay all right really nice smooth taste on that one as well like smooth through the throat um [ __ ] little floral action way sweeter than the other two although the other one was kind of like i had just that crc taste to it in the second one it was like almost flavorless very mellow where this one does come through a little bit more with the flavor you get that sweetness to it i do enjoy that one um you said i haven't had coroba in years love their edibles the 1000 milligrams put me on my ass every time every time how much would you take of it toes because i took like a dropper or so i think about what strains have i reviewed okay so this one we just did was the nigerian silver and then right before that i took a dab of the caramel cream and then right before that i took a dab of the kamala kush and then i'm also gonna try this j1 right here next and then they give me some flour too some triple o g flour right here which i'll have to smoke um sometime might as well give it a testaroni bologna you know looks pretty solid i gave it a smell it has a nice like cheesy og smell to it um very funky very funky to it like almost a gassy cheese oh gee to it which i'm about and then i got a [ __ ] 50 milligram uh peanut butter dip cookie here mini cookie and then we've got three uh pre-rolls as well one of them was a pre-roll blunt which is super dope i'm actually really excited to smoke that um but it's not just any blunt it's a hemperil blunt because i don't even smoke blunts so i was hyped to see that they had a hemperil blunt i was like yeah that's nice so very very excited oh wait actually one all flowered blunt very excited oh yeah hell yeah very very excited toast yeah by the looks of it i'm pretty damn sure that's a hemp wrap i'm like 99 sure never seen a blunt wrap look like that so i'm excited about that hemp blondes are where it's at i wouldn't even smoke a regular blunt i don't like tobacco a little bit more q-tip action and then we can try the last dab very excited for this last one as well here i'm pretty sure this one was a different processor if i peeked correctly i just took a quick quick little gander at it okay this one is processed by sakida northwest i have never heard of this company and this is some j1 right here i've never heard of this company okay just by the looks of it i can tell you this is crc um let's see our c how the terps are we have 65 milligrams of thc which is a little bit on the low side the other ones are 653 milligrams of thc the other ones are around 750 so maybe this one has higher terpene ratio but we'll see okay it's like a wet a slightly wet sugar consistency let's see how the smell is like yep i expected so it's a mellow crc smell it doesn't have a j-1 terp to it very much oh actually no it totally does hold on sorry sorry hold on hold on there it is i'm wrong sorry sometimes crc jack herrera is a very tough one sometimes to discern between the terps of jack and the crc this one does have a crc backbone to it but you can smell the jack there you can totally smell it oh yes i love love love love um jack herrera i'm super super excited for this one i think i'm gonna like this one a lot am i gonna play some more tarakov um later yeah i'll play some more tarkovs later definitely definitely okay oh wow yeah i'm most excited about this one out of all of them so far i can say that for sure i mean i just tried the other ones too yeah there we go a little mix-a-roni bologna too look at that yeah you can tell it's crc right off the bat um and the the smell to it at the start i did get the nose of crc but then as i smelled it more and more you it totally has a very strong jack backbone and uh j1 is very says that jack smell oh yeah i'm about that oh i'm so about that i'm gonna grab some water right now i know i'm about to be sweating after this dab you know yes oh [ __ ] these don't have okay okay corova okay i do have one thing that i just noticed that i may have noticed before but i'm just noticing again this packaging the square box is re this is removable from the gram most people just keep the gram and throw out the box unfortunately on these grams there's no identification as to which strain this is they're on this box so if i have four different strains and i throw out all the boxes and i keep just the grams i'm now left with four grams that i have to every single time i have to peep the bottoms of them to see which one is which and i have to try and remember which one is which and if i have 20 different strains that becomes very hard so now i need to keep their boxes so that's a note that's a note i'm going to note that for them i'm going to note that oh [ __ ] i should have been writing stuff down about each one but it's okay i'll post that i'll post this video i can send them the video of the terp review and um um am i oh i'm i'm toasted i'm toasted uh i've taken now three dabs um of their stuff and i kind of took a slight um tolerance break yesterday where i didn't smoke as much as i normally do and so it's been really nice today i've been just getting [ __ ] high as [ __ ] seriously hi which is really nice so yeah um ooh yeah okay i gotta say i do think that i might be feeling i mean uh since i've taken three dabs in a row it's really hard to say which one necessarily i'm feeling the most but it feels like that last one that nigerian silver really does slap and i do like the smell on that one the best so far except for this j1 i have high hopes for this j1 and smelling it oh yeah um green i am reviewing the j1 here which is processed by was it sakita north west um and sold through corova and then the nigerian silver processed by beehive extracts the caramel cream processed by bobsled in the kamala kush processed by beehive i've tried the kamala the nigerian silver and the caramel cream so far um i thought the kamala was pretty solid for some non-crc it had a um was almost like a cheesy smell to it it had a good all of them so far have had like a nose burn where i really i felt the terps in my nose but none of them were harsh through the throat whatsoever all very smooth um i think that this one yeah yeah yeah it has more of like a cheesy cushy smell to it um where the other one processed by beehive the nigerian silver has a more sweet smell to it and oh yeah this one nigerian silver i think this one was my favorite out of the three i've tried so far super super tasty really smooth not like crazy crazy terpy like not like the chips just like smack you in the face and you're like oh yeah i'm sweating from those terps god damn i can taste them so much but still just like really nice overall um i really enjoyed that and then this one the caramel cream for um bobsled i'm not gonna lie bobsled um recently um some other stuff is pretty solid some of their stuff is so-so i think that they might be overly cr seeing a tiny bit of their stuff and um this stuff was solid but i'm gonna have to take another dab of it because it did kind of taste like it was just a little bit overly crc'd and i think that some people just don't need to crc product so much and i think that takes a little bit too much of the flavor away from it and makes it so you're kind of like grass you're reaching to try and find the notes of flavor that are left in the product you know what i'm saying so this one's solid all the highs from all of them are great they're all smooth so um pretty solid this last one though the j1 yeah processed by sakita northwest right off the bat i was like i can tell this is crc based on the look of it and then whenever i opened it i could tell the crc knows right off the bat but then as i smelled it more and more you really do get the jack herrer so this one the other one crc is color remediation column um so basically what companies do is they run a type of bleaching clay generally like a t3 t4 bleaching clay through a really big column and they'll run their product through that as well as an extra form of filtration and it i personally believe that most stuff that crc does overly crc then it takes out too much of the terps and flavor but if you use a disc to crc instead of a column then you can pull product that doesn't taste quite as overly crc and so yeah it all depends on the product certain strains go through crc columns very well and can be crc'd heavily and still taste really well afterwards certain um you know like this j1 is definitely a strain that does better through heavy crc as i can definitely tell here because i feel like the caramel cream isn't supposed to be like a a light like [ __ ] lemony smell to it you know what i'm saying that's the crc coming through where j1 does have almost a lemony terp so it kind of meshes well with the crc but you really do get the jack terp on this one as well as you smell it more you will get that full profile of the jack the j1 behind there i'm excited to try this one let's take a dab let's get it the last one of the terp review let's do it [Music] yeah a hundred percent green yeah a lot of companies are using a lot of filtration in the dabs that they're making i am excited to try this one is this one that has less thc a little bit less thc but i'm still very excited for this one i got rich really fast thc doesn't matter you know it's over all turks yeah trey let's get it [Music] we'll take a nice chunky dab here this is probably the last dab for me for a minute and we'll get a very good flavor tester big cheers everyone i'm really proud i hit it a little bit too high i'm just gonna drop a whole nother dab in there it just makes it not taste as good you don't get as much of a flavor i'd say that the crc does slightly mask the flavor of the j1 but you still get the jack chirps through there this is the only one out of the four that doesn't give me turn burn in my nose all the other ones burned my nose a little bit as i was exhaling this one is completely smooth entirely through do i have a stream schedule um yeah on monday wednesday and friday i go live at 10 30 a.m pacific standard time and i kind of just stream like till whenever and then normally i take a little break and then come back for a late night stream around like 10 or 11 or you know maybe nine um it's all pacific standard time by the way and then tuesday thursday sometimes i go live at 10 30 and sometimes i go live later in the day like anywhere between two and six p.m depending on if zenna has work and so is my fiance and depending on if she has work on tuesday and thursday i go live kind of differently but i let everybody know in the discord which i'll link right now in the chat um and then on the weekends um it always varies but i do most of the time stream every day i think i've streamed every day for the past like 400 plus days or so and so i try to keep on it keep up on it we had 420 subs last month so we're trying to get back up there and shoot for a thousand subs by 4 20 this month this year is the goal would be a dream for sure so yeah see if we can make it there but yeah i think that over the past like three or four actually realistically over the past couple years i've been putting in nearly 300 hours a month a lot of the time streaming and it's really starting to pay off these past few months especially hey much love kika how's it going over there hope your day's been nicely lit we've been chilling over here just finished up a little turk review and we've got up to nine dives actually i gotta change this dab counter actually speaking of the terp review that we just finished up let me formally wrap this up here for the youtube video thank you everyone on the youtube for watching this and thank you everyone that's been here live um i'm not leaving my live feed right now but i'm just going to wrap this up so i can cut it for my youtube this has been a little objective kurova review on four strains of corova that i haven't tried before three different processors which was really cool to get to try some different processors i'm going to give you all quick ranking this j1 was my favorite right here by sakita northwest i still think that they are we're overly crc in the product slightly i think that the flavor of the j1 was slightly masked by the crc flavor but this one was just so smooth like i got my forehead kind of sweating too like i see him kind of sweating a little bit from that double dab it was a really really nice dab overall and it has the smell of j1 it's really smooth definitely i really like this one very solid the nigerian silver is definitely my number two this one's by beehive extracts not cr seed which actually i really did like it's very very solid very like kind of a more floral flavor to it and i really like the high from this one it [ __ ] smacked me really really like this one my number three is gonna have to be the kamala kush another one processed by beehive not cr seed it has a really really nice almost like a cheesy cushy taste to it which i was about these ones both burned through my nostrils but my throat was great which indicates to me it was probably a clean product but just getting a little bit of that burning my nose you know sometimes this caramel cream also burned and this one's by bobsled i still like this one um i think that i need to take some more dabs of this caramel cream to really get a good overall flavor to it because it just didn't feel like i got enough of the flavor of the caramel cream coming through from the first one it did taste a little bit overly crc'd so we're gonna have to try some more dabs of that in the future and really get the flavor on that one coming through i really do like all of these i think they're all solid for the price um you know as far as like i wouldn't be like no none of these are i wouldn't say that any of them were bad necessarily or anything like that but i gave you all my rankings and that j1 solid and i actually really do like that [ __ ] uh this one as well the um the nigerian silver just has such a unique taste to it i like that it's a kind of almost floral uh two is floral fruity i love those uh i love those terps but it's not like citrusy at all you know it's nice i'm high i might as [ __ ] you just took five dabs um which is good that's good you gotta do it you gotta do it's good little turp review thank you everyone much love and uh we'll see you next time youtube if y'all uh

um so good evening everyone i am here with glenn we are going to do a strain review this evening um and have a little bit of a cannabis based discussion so glenn what are we actually reviewing tonight tonight we're going to review wapa from hannah farms uh wap is in indica it's roughly what do we got 19.5 so just below 20 percent uh it's a great indicator 60 indica dominant strain really good for night uh we kind of i uh jessica and i were thinking about what we were gonna have today and uh i think it was you that recommended it so me been having kind of a dull depressing day to be quite honest a lot of anxiety wapa is a good strain to kind of turn that around i'm very impressed with this and the buds are actually getting a lot nicer yeah actually um glenn and i were speaking just before we hopped on this call to record our conversation with you but um this is not the same lap i would have seen a while ago from canada farms uh so that's who's the licensed producer of this bud we're trying today uh canna pharmacist is in hope bc but this may be the best whapa i've ever seen yeah come out of that facility so it seems like maybe they're working on some improvements internally but i'm very happy one or two like the buds are nice thick and dense so they did a good job all right what are you using for consumption method so i am vaping in my utilian 721 um i'll be vaping at a temperature of about 375. okay i'm i'm only go a little bit lower i'm vaping my mighty from uh stores and bickel so i haven't packed oh yours all heated up already eh almost almost it's good uh 200 degrees celsius heats up pretty quick and we'll see how uh see how it tastes this batch is actually very fresh i'm impressed by the how dense it is and how how nice it's packaged so good job canada farms on the presentation let's see so um as for flavor uh so how i was feeling before i dosed i have a very sore body not gonna lie it's the day after saint patty's right now um a little bit late i i'm tired today i feel beat up physically and just inside so beeping it i am getting like a very earthy taste to it a little bit of a peppery test taste you can even see my smoke coming through yeah i would say peppery citrusy with a little bit of earth underneath it nothing too crazy um my stream that i have is a 19.5 like you said but mine is actually packaged from a while ago well over a year ago uh i don't know about anybody else i know a lot of people don't like utilizing old thc they're going to open their packages and concerned like the thc is going down and yes i will say that your thc percentages do go down your shelf life is like your 6 to 12 months but the thc converts into cbm glenn i don't know if you utilize like uh aged cannabis but i find i sleep better it's a good that's a good discussion to bring up especially because i am the person that loves opening jars like a little kid and i leave these jars uh opened and sometimes i don't want to smoke them because they aged but as you were explaining that could be a benefit for somebody like me who wants more sedation i want to get knocked out when i sleep what's up what's um what's interesting about it is your thc does deplete but you actually create a new molecule on the cannabis plant called cbn and cbn you can absolutely go google it as soon as we're done this conversation and have a look for it for yourself but there's been people who have compared it to you know having 10 times the strength of diazepam for sedation and relaxation um usually i can watch an entire hockey game but i will with this age cannabis even at the 19 um i'll be knocked out alone stronger than i ever have in the other strain so that's i'm so glad you told me that because maybe tomorrow um or on the weekend what we'll do is we'll take another strain from either can of farms or alba medics and something that's aged that's a good indica and we'll see um if it knocks me out i'm curious the difference um i'm tasting earthy definitely taste pepper i really like that flavor my mouth's dry i'm starting to really feel my effect definitely dried my mouth out i'll need to go get water um there's definitely cereal high but i'm really relaxed i'm mentally i'm alert i'm awake but i i'm actually feeling very very relaxed right now yeah all me down was uh i don't know i i think when i'm having days like this i should immediately resort to uh one of the strains i know it just kind of led that you know it is now but you know no better time in the present so i found that this strain in the past has been a really 180 um after i consumed it it's just it's really been positive on my mood and anxiety so i'm feeling starting to feel a lot more calm like a weights been kind of my uh taking off my shoulders so i highly recommend it's one of my favorite strains as you know from uh can of farms so i'm gonna give it uh just because i like it and i know it i'm gonna give it a 9 out of 10. um expect that beautiful buds packaging was great taste was great and the effects i feel are exactly what i wanted and i needed tonight so i would definitely score it high on a psychological level um i will definitely give it like an eight out of ten for physical for if you're looking for pain i didn't get really pain relief but even just relaxing yourself um helps that body tension so i would def i love this strain his personal favorite and honestly i'm really impressed this is not the same like i said lapa i would have seen from canada farms a year ago it's a four-year-old um tune in guys jessica is very very informed when it comes to medical cannabis i try to keep up and tie up the loose ends but uh she has a lot of knowledge and we will be going over different strains so next episode we will have another strain for you guys to uh to test out have a good night", "mG53M9UfNdc": "can i kill this in one hit guys this is a moon rock this is a moon rock [ __ ] 0.3 moon rock joint they say this lasts a while

we'll be reviewing the hardcore og it is very hardcore you know we don't have too much statistics about this weed they haven't put any of them out but we do know that it's a hybrid dominated by indica

ground because you can't hang that's okay you could work your way up as the doctor has but I could say that from the from hitting this the first couple hits definitely got a great flavor it's it's a it's kind of like an OG flavor but it has a hint of something different so it's it's not exactly a an OG Kush flavor but it's definitely pungent as they say it's very dense it's not fluffy it's nice and tight the buds it's very crystal e very fuzzy you could check it out with you know if you've got a magnifying glass or some [ __ ] like that and you'll see all the flavor all in that plant and

180 and we're here for another review but it wouldn't be your typical review it's going to be a shake review today but the stream is going to be worth it though so i went to my my favorite place to go to ascend that's why i guess where i love to get my recreational products until i get my medical card out here got my new york on deck still but today was definitely a good day so today we got a strain called jet fuel gelato jet fuel gelato is a jet fuel cross breeding with gelato number 45. it's turpin flavors are based off of herbal peppery and piney this stream really brings back the classic og smell that most people would love to smoke but it had its own distinctive like smell like you could really tell there's some jet fuel in here like damn oh this is some fire right here has 19 tac has zero three percent th cbd excuse me and this is an indica dominant hybrid it's a good it's a really good one and believe it or not it's shake you can see it right here so we're not doing the buds today we're actually going to be working on the shake so as you see here you know the high supply this is the limit that you know you can buy for a day and today we're going to use papers because it's shake we're going to roll it in papers got my raw papers on deck got my raw filters on deck you know we got to be prepared all the time all the time bro so in this case i'm going to just throw some here because this is going to be a quick roll this is going to be a quick one two guys gotta smell it ah gas right there i'll probably do a video smoking it with the gelato i'll get it in the back wood when i don't do some other ones it varies it varies when i first tasted this this this hit me like whoa because it's something with gelato cross breeds oh man they just they stand out they really stand out to what the policy is the flavor the taste everything i i'm a fan of gelato crossbreeds i was never really a fan of gelato by itself that's just me because of my i i've had bad experiences with july that's what it is you know what i wouldn't even call them bad experiences i had low quality experiences because it did its job medically the taste was just horrendous i just couldn't bear with that taste i see the good thing with the shake all you have to do you could you could throw it in your vaporizer you don't have to grind it or nothing this is for the lazy people you know the lazy people that just want to just throw it in there and roll this would be a perfect recommendation for you because when you buy a shake from a cannabis dispensary you're getting the same quality as well it's the bottom of the barrel but just taste wise you're getting the same quality it's good the taste is there you're just losing maybe 10 to 15 percent thc depending on the strain and how much shape they give you but personally i would recommend shake to beginners i'll just throw this straight to the beginners thc content isn't high they wouldn't have to worry about freaking out anything it would work out for them so they'll be able to enjoy medical cannabis the way it's supposed to be because he has enrolled me a basic average joint you know something like something quick for this review because we're not we're not necessarily here to get fully loaded we're just here to you know dose enough to medicate that's just what we're here for but don't get me wrong i smoke up all day but as a medical you as a one for medical use it's not it's not really you know we need to go ham that first hit all out this is a pure essence right here wow it's very clean it's a very clean taste you could definitely the terpenes definitely did the herbal the peppery that's why i had to take some water because i felt that that that's that little spice it's not as smooth as the other strains but it hits it definitely is so if you were to get the actual nugs of this it would most likely be 29 30 thc this is pretty potent for 19 and that's rare and i think that the harshness behind it also plays a role in that i was going to use a high hem but i haven't used april's for a while so i figured hey let's do a review and papers but the high hips are always going to be there but one one one brand i will not i will not recommend is real size this is speaking out of personal opinion i'm not a fan of these one they smell funny doesn't smell like hemp it smells like some whole other nonsense this would be like an equivalence to an actual blunt wrap you don't taste it you don't taste the herbs i would rather have um those palm cigars those king ponds i'd rather smoke that than use that because at least with the king palms i'll get a really slow smoke out of it i'm not even a fan of king palms but i will do a review or two with them because i have friends that like king palms so i'm pretty sure they would like to see someone do a string review with king bombs so i won't discriminate trust you i don't because got the backwoods on deck wear them bad boys at got plenty of the high hemps all of that so now this is going out i relit this i don't taste any burnt any burnt tree it's still clean and harsh if that makes any sense um it's really is really like a down to earth classic og kush in a sense but uh a higher end fragrant lg kush but these are just the og other toads don't listen don't don't don't bother me on that one the taste reminds me of an og kush so much jet fuel is a great strain it's definitely very strange i've only had it once it was just one of those quick live moments girl you have to smoke a whole eighth out of it so i didn't really get to fully enjoy it plus i had a couple drinks so it's just one of those couple drinks some smoke boom good i'm still waiting for the g purpose to get back to stock i'm definitely going to do a review on that that oh man that's a good one jeff it was that g perps is purple punch and jackfield if i recall correctly yeah it's one of those two um yeah that's that's actually the crossbreed for it halfway through this birthday nights this burning slow you don't have to always stuff your joints rip some of your paper off if you're trying to roll a smooth tray roll accordingly you just level it out i put just enough to roll me a nice little drink but overall stripe wise on the review on the stream i'm gonna give it a nine nine nine and a half the taste gets a nine and a half i mean because it definitely it details it brings back memories it brings back memories off rip and so that being said you can really taste the essence of what it's like between uh jet fuel and gelato it's fruity it's definitely a fruity it's not a dank this is not a dank stream this is fruity so that's why i scored high on the taste run overall quality i feel it i feel the effects i'm halfway in here so i know it's going to do its job even for a 60 40 on indica dominant hybrid i'm still good i just love me some indicas in the condominium hybrids i need some granddaddy purple in my life the taste and culture tongue nice make sure you want some sweets if you're if you want to think about it that and i have to go for something to eat too got me just got me yeah it's burning nice i haven't had to really re-light it because i know mostly out there i'd be smoking joints yeah i'll be relaxed every five to ten seconds this whole video i probably had to re-light it maybe twice oh this is pretty nice about to have me waste smoke missing all of that but overall yeah i could definitely say the strain is a nine and a half i don't necessarily have any fond memories or any flashbacks with jet fuel or gelato because i've had nothing but bad taste experiences smoking gelato and jet fuel only had once what are we talking about the crossbreeds on the other hand that biscotti yeah gelato 25 in south florida oh gee that's a good one there's a few there's a few other um cookie crossovers that um that cry involves gelato i i tend to forget um the names of them so i really like i said i don't really come across gelato strings like that i do have a video on gelato shape regular gelato shape if not uploaded or i'm gonna drop it soon either way i already have it on deck so this will be the jet fuel gelato version the upgrade is literally an upgrade from regular gelato and the regular gelato from mr from what essentials that's just gelato there's no numbers to it or nothing it's just a lot of them and what gelato is isn't gelato with zito's crossbreed my show is i'm not sure what exactly frustrated with but i know it's cross rated with singles that's for sure this is this is definitely good i can i would recommend jeff which allows anybody who's into hybrid let alone this so i'm going to go finish this up though and as always guys until next time stay [Music] high", "RhOqzKeiEoI": "welcome to another doctored green thumb strain review I am dr. greenthumb know it's been a while since we've done a strain review but the doctors been busy no I'm saying go in here go there but none of that really matters today we have what is known or what is called the Hammerhead og this hammerhead og is an indica its THC percentage is 24% so it should be pretty good its CBD is 1.1 percent people that have smoked it says it makes you sleepy gives you the munchies makes you confused yeah this is real life they sound like some [ __ ] cherry lightweights but you know nonetheless I'm gonna smoke it because I don't get none of that I'm immune to all those crazy little stereotypical stoner things that people talk about you know like confusion hunger and giggly and pression and [ __ ] like that the doctor doesn't get none of that man we've been smoking too long down here at the temple alright so um the Hammerhead og looked pretty good the Nugget you know was pretty tight it's very dense a lot of orange hairs if you will so we're just gonna light this [ __ ] up and the doctor will tell you what he thinks of it incidentally the funky field tip on this is not actually a funky field tip this is a dr. greenthumb tip by nish coming soon my good friend niche glass mm-hmm dr. green dumped tips but I gotta tell you this we put that [ __ ] phone on shut it up [ __ ] well I'm sorry to say that not even this cool ass tip could save the taste of this so-called to hammerhead weed this ain't even hammer and a tic-tac it's actually quite brutal I don't know why I'm still smoking it but I can't stop there must be a magnet on this foot by this [ __ ] niche tip right here because this is [ __ ] torture this is like listening to an hour of Shiki raucous battle raps and [ __ ] oh I'm sorry that was it for you but I got to give this this stuff a - two thumbs I mean at least it gets that because it still has me smoking it somehow even though it's not really up to up to the doctor standards you know if you could see through my glasses there'd probably be a tear coming through my eye like that Indian who [ __ ] it didn't like people you know littering everywhere man people who start pollution people can stop it it's [ __ ] weed is I mean it looked awesome man what what did you guys do the Hammerhead the [ __ ] out of here and go [ __ ] yourself [Music]", "pjdifoOXhyk": "hey welcome to that connection and here I got cloudiest nine tecktonik nine grinders so this is a really unique grinder um here's everything comes with it it's come with so much it just comes with uh there's a box it comes with the manual comes with the USB the Android charger the grinder itself and its really neat pouch but this is a really unique grinder it's a really self-explanatory actually so it comes in three different compartments right it comes with to grind your flour and and then you know to hold it and what makes this really unique is that it automatically dispenses your your body of flour you know so that's what's really unique and it doesn't have a Keith catcher pitch holder so some people like that some people don't you know personally I mean I used to love it because I select glove packing McKeithen molds or whenever I it's full or anything but honestly I don't even care anymore because I like to keep at the moment no tuvo so what's really cool about this is um well it comes with a see-through uh you can see your bud here and if you slide it this is tough bak it close it and then is to open it you see down here it comes with this little thing and this helps automatically just this is the power on and off in charge and this is where you it automatically dispenses your cannabis to Bowl grinder or a bowl join pre-roll whatever you like and don't the only thing I don't like about it so much is the inside so um here's now how the inside looks and it's pretty cool II its are getting see-through you can see all the underneath and the battery and [ __ ] but there's a lot of plastic to be honest I don't I'm not a huge fan of plastic least of all with grinders but I mean it's still really convenient and um I'm sure glad to top part with grant work grinds your flowers made out of plastic is made out of ink alloy or I think it's alloys something like that yeah but it still made a really good material and I'm here let me actually grind it up right now see this is let you guys see power alright so I got some computer over here yeah [Music] you can see it grinds up all your blood it's actually really good it's pretty fast compared to Logan's really nice yeah and then this is what I'm talking about you could um you could have your joint rolled out and just you know pop this thing on a purse you got to slide it yep slightest make sure it's open pop this thing on turn this thing on and just dispense if you're willing to join or you could even use it for pre-roll that's what I like about a lot see like it fits perfectly on this thing no dispensing from there you just you know pack it down and just keep doing it but okay here let me show you how it looks like when its dispensing just like that just sometimes I get so low or just like spit it out and sometimes like right now it's not even dispensing damage but just because maybe because this flower that I have is kind of sticky so that might happen sometimes but otherwise it's still it's really good for pre-roll man yeah obviously most of actually that's actually all there is to this grinder it's just pretty much what's really neat about is that America dispenses your flower to wherever you wanted to land be it up join a blonde ping-pong pretty roll the dryer vaporizer just open it up pop it open and just put it on like that that was a first time I didn't understand but it was a really easy really nice and quick but like I was saying yeah this thing makes it sometimes it will spit out so I'd watch out for that but I mean otherwise when you're done just take this down slide it in that's it it's pretty neat it's really nice and convenient really good if you smoke a lot of pre world's so honestly this is more fur I see there's more of people who smoke a lot or pre-rolls in like joints and like will just love rolling and the process of rolling and all that stuff but for the price of this um they're selling it on their I'm selling it for like 60 bucks 66 I don't know I'm not sure if it's before a text but somewhere around that price range and I mean honestly it is kind of worth it because uh there's a lot of process to it in the making of you know making this thing and it looks really unique it looks like it's built very uh you know genuine and unique you know right but I mean there's a lot of really dope grinders with really nice designs for like twenty thirty bucks well like I said this thing right here where it dispenses your can of it your flower it's what makes it really unique so I mean if you're a cannabis enthusiast and you really like the idea of this grinder like automatically dispensing your flower too straight to where you want it to land I'd recommend this it's uh what I love about sly it really does grind up your flower really easily come that's a big problem with a lot of grinded before I buy them sometimes they're like trash and just don't take forever to grind up your flower or you're nug and other times it'll just take like seconds like this thing took like two to five seconds like three five seconds and grinds up everything so yeah that is the tectonic nine Claudius nine the cotton I checked on nine

like this one here they're all gonna start falling over they're staying up pretty sturdy but they're starting to get heavy they're gonna be it's just now about to be and it's not even week six yet so yeah they're gonna thicken up I might have to go grab another nad I guess I hate putting those things on it's pain in my ass but I got to do it I guess I got to do it just added bloom booster so I just been using my base newts this time I had researched about week four just a real good heavy dose usually I added about once a week until week four but I've been in and out of town and all that [ __ ] huh and the drip system did just fine and I was gone for eight days I came back and there was still quite a bit of nutrients in the tank my 55 gallon tank was using I was feeding them twice a day for one minute and it was using about five gallons a day on all these plants end up working out real nice so this is dr j 303 leave a comment subscribe thanks", "Gn4OkJM3p-0": "[Music] what's up YouTube it's your boy Serge back again on another episode of The Daily session a YouTube channel for cannabis patients and adults man guys I'm so [ __ ] excited to show you guys this train this [ __ ] is straight fire if you watched my first video I actually dabbed on some of this and this is actually the nug that made that damn that I dabbed out in my first video but yeah VIPRE cookies for you though for those of you don't know what fiber cookies is it is a strain crossed between Viper City og and Girl Scout cookies made by moxie genetics this but specifically was grown by down river meds for patient station exclusively so if you want to get you some of this fire you're gonna have to go down to the patient station shout out to them real quick Viper cookies definitely a powerhouse strain THC levels are up to 28 percent so but alright guys enough of that let's get into a smell test for you real quick [Music] [Music] I smell very pungent very pungent very earthy as that Girl Scout cookies smell that I love very pungent like I said like you open in just everywhere you know you can't hide this smell it cannot know I've got to say so far that this is probably one of my favorite cookie hybrids this stuff is straight fire I loved the wax filing my favorite waxes around and if you ever see it guys I recommend picking it up but real quick guys I'm gonna pack my bowl up with some of this and I've got some close-ups that I hope you enjoy [Music] all right guys nice Bowl tag there [Music] so you can see from those nugs nice very frosty nugs they're very sticky loves the sticky icky yeah guys let's get a good taste test we've got wax her butt and hail it up Cheers [Music] Wow [Music] no you guys [Music] [Music] [Music] damn sit [Music] it'll lemonade Wow it tastes guys definitely has that nice OG taste very earthy sorry as I'm Dino [ __ ] some good stuff [Music] who already I feel that nice body relief I can tell you that this strain would definitely be a couch lock strain so if you're looking to be active stay away from this strain testing out 28% you know so it's very potent this would probably be another one of those that's good for insomnia so it's probably gonna be one of those where I take a nice bowl before I go to sleep and it puts me to sleep it's gonna either take guys it's very good [ __ ] [Music] [Music] also guys let me know what you're smoking on and I like to know so uh throw that down in the comments I was also gonna pick up some dab and I thought you over killed I have the butt and the dab but I'm gonna have it again soon because I love that wax but you know guys like in every other video we're gonna end this video with a DAB today we're dabbing on some nug rut BHO crumble by nlg this some strawberries banana [Music] see some good color [Music] I'm not much of a crumble fan but I had to try this stuff so yeah guys that actually my first turn is party I see a nice tab there [Music] guys I'm really feeling good on that fight for cookies delicious is definitely up there favorite strains [Applause] it's again a real quick shout out to down river meds and shout out to the patient station [Applause] cheers night [Music] Wow

crumble looks like okay this is my crumble i do this extract [ __ ] too i'm not playing look at bro i didn't want to talk prices you already know what time it is she looking like canary diamonds bro my crumble game is crazy", "6jmsiS7hcSA": "all right hello everybody we witch here again and Jesus Christ today I'm gonna be doing something that is totally gonna [ __ ] something for me so I tried to make it as clear as I could from the caption but yeah you guys know what you're here for pretty much today what I'm gonna be doing is attempting I say that very harshly attempting to take one full gram of Keef through one bong ripp and I know that doesn't sound like a crazy amount but if you've ever smoked Keith before just straight Keith's point one point two point three of a gram will totally knock you on your ass so that's what we're gonna be doing today um this is my little Keith collection here this is the most Keef I've ever had on hand at once I went scaled it up it's about 5 grams let's scale it up for you guys you can check it out yeah it's about 5 grams a little over five point one or so been saving up for a while I'll take a fat key for it before bed but that's about it it used to be you know smoke a bong take a key Fripp smoke a ball and take a key friend just been saving it like crazy for this moment so guys oh let the scaling begin and then let the smoking start alright so now we got the cheapest skill in existence bust it out all I'm showing you guys this container here it is the exact same container as this to zero it out and knock that bad boy off and see what we got here we got like I said 5.1 what we're gonna do is take the cap to the kief container and just straight up we're zero it out and throw a gram on there and like I said with the 1 gram 5 grams may not seem like that much but when you are personally grinding up your own weed everyday' to get that amount that's I'm proud of myself god damn it took me long enough alright so here we have it guys are one gram of Keef scaled up and ready to pack um all I can say at this point is wish me luck just trying to get a better angle so you guys can really see this Keef my camera's not really catching the lightness of it looks a little darker in the camera but whoa this is a lot of Keith guy so if you've seen any of my past videos you for keyfitz I pull out the specific Keith bones but not today I do not think that little boy could ever possibly handle a full gram of Keith so we're bustin out big boy today big boys for Dickie Fritz cleaned her up nice and good let's get to pack in and straight to the head alright guys so here we have it I got it to fit quite nicely this is in fact one full gram of Keith pack to the bowl nice and tightly fit just perfectly whoo let's hit it all right just gonna show you guys one more time before I hit it so you know I'm not playing no games I am absolutely not ready for this let's go I just got punched in the [ __ ] chest this is worse than a DAB bro all right Oh besides the fact that it feels like I just ride him just got kicked in the [ __ ] chest I feel like I handled it pretty good it wasn't too bad um so [ __ ] close to one hit it was about one and a quarter one in a fifth maybe but yeah you know what that means I'm gonna have to try this again in the future Jesus Christ not today but yeah holy [ __ ] I am feeling it I am buzzing that was a lot of [ __ ] Keith to smoke by far the most Keef whoo I have ever smoked in my life um I am freakin stone once again thank you guys for watching usually I would say try this at home but not today not this one I am ripped and I took them hey so do it at your own risk but I have a great day guys once again thank you for watching peace", "jxKF5Puh04E": "how's it going YouTube and welcome to another episode of the high life we're gonna do another rolling video today because you guys seem to like them let's see we're gonna roll a blunt a gram gram of flour and I'm not in a way it but I got some THC a we're gonna sprinkle in this [ __ ] so this should be pretty [ __ ] dank right alright its way and look at this [ __ ] [Music] all right a half [Music] 99 that's [ __ ] close enough throw half of this in the grinder [ __ ] in there [Music] you also need to [ __ ] see yeah that's way too [ __ ] difficult I don't [ __ ] care [Music] let's break up the other half by hand I'm sure somebody's gonna want to know what it is ground blue number four luckily I [ __ ] ahead the container from what I bought it [Music] [Music] don't really smoke a lot of blunts these days kind of looking forward to this back when I was in a high school I used to smoke blunts all the [ __ ] time which is weird because I definitely didn't have money to be smoking blunts all the time there was definitely ways I could have been saving [ __ ] money but you know [Applause] [Music] [Music] all right just realized I haven't showed you guys this THC a let's set this down for a second oh sure would have done this video earlier in the week back when there was larger pieces looked like I was smoking aquarium pebbles now that light is so bright it's [ __ ] waiting it out either way [Music] maybe just a little bit more up here right there alright that looks [ __ ] good [Music] [Music] some kind reminds me of like clumpy DMD [Music] [Music] alright let's seal this [ __ ] out I always like to start from the left side and work my way over although I suppose it really doesn't [ __ ] matter [Music] [Music] oh my bad guys didn't mean to bump the camera there all right there she is definitely not the prettiest blonde ever like I told you guys earlier don't really roll blunts and smoke blunts a lot lately kind of out of practice it's straight enough all right thanks for stopping by everybody I'll probably post a video this I'll probably post a video of me smoking this but I don't know maybe as sort of God the videos of me smoking get half as many views but whatever seals"}
