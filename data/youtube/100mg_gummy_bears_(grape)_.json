{"MxPBmxnLivM": "[Music] two wheats the marijuana animal review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and today we are talking about krispity krunch II no I'm just joshing with you we're not talking about Peter Barnes but I'm on camera one because they're good too because they're high in fat and three because we're actually reviewing a hundred million gummy bears what's correct we are reviewing the ED of your 100 milligram Getti gummy bears today looking at in another this is another in this series if that appeared that we're going to be reviewing smaller dose to the last time we took these if history is going to repeat them itself these will taste awful and won't get me that high I'm hoping against hope that both of those things aren't true but there are no guarantees so the peanut butter minims just that just bad to help me get some of this as the best part of this th e so that's why I'm eating news those are gonna taste so much better than these I have a feeling alright let's open it up here oh man I thought last time this packaging was easy to open but now it's not looking so good balls all right I'm gonna have to grow grab some scissors technical difficulties back that's a negative anytime you have to go for the scissors she'd never have to do that finally finally let's give it a sniff oh man Oh smells like gummy bears with weed here we go that is awful oh and it gets worse it's got that harsh aftertaste oh oh they're so bad oh why would you do this to yourself and get gummies guys why why candies and goes-- why I don't understand it I really don't but I'm willing to keep doing it for you guys just because you seem to like them I I I'm not sure I get it so the head of pure 100 milligram gummies guys I'm going to finish these bad boys off not looking forward to it and I will see you in two hours to let you know how they are feeling and let's hope against hope one last time that they are the exception to the rule and I am coming to you blazed in two hours but not too optimistic see you two hours peace it has been two hours since I had the head of your gummy bears 100 milligrams and nothing really I can't say nothing I little high it's sort of as equivalent if I had maybe smoked a small bowl recently so on about in line with what I thought not a good value proposition at ten dollars not at all they tasted awful tasted really really bad and I'm not very high there isn't really a lot to say about the etta pure gummy bears and then they taste terrible and they really don't get you that high I have a few more and appears to review and I hope things turn around for them and again I want to I do want to say that I think these are more potent than like the infused creations that I've had so take that as you will but you know just gummies and candies just don't do it for me they may do it for you edibles you know can everybody experiences them a little bit differently maybe they just don't seem to work but I'm willing to give ed up here a fair shake in the future reviews guys and I hope you will too should you stick around for future reviews and thank you so much for watching this episode we'll

"vAd2MnnDEn4": "hey guys welcome back to our channel if you're new here I am Judith and today's video I am going to be eating a hundred milligram edible for you guys I did get this on 4/20 and I am barely going to eat it with you guys just because I don't know it's been in the fridge it's been getting cold and I thought why not do it today today is my day off so your grocery and yeah so I'm gonna consume this a hundred milligram edible for you guys and see what it does to me I am a huge smoker so I don't know if it would hit me as much but honestly it probably will because edibles hit different than smoking like honestly honestly if you eat edibles they will hit like major but yeah so I'm gonna eat this for you guys hopefully I don't feel like I'm dying and then from there who knows this video will probably be a short vlog and yeah I'm just gonna go about my day on an edible and see the effects of what happens so let me set the camera for you guys and then open this oh so I am in my little sister's room I am at my mom's house and yeah there's nowhere else I'd rather take a hundred milligram edible than my mom's because if I freaked out which I probably won't but if I freaked out my sisters are here and my mom is here and everybody is here so if your girl feels like she's dying everybody is here hominy yeah yeah so let me set this camera up for you guys and then let's do it okay you guys I'm so mad at myself because I literally broke the freaking edible and I didn't want to do that I wanted to show you guys exactly what it looked like and your girl is just not paying attention if you guys have ever tried these let me know in the comments down below and what you guys thought about them so I've tried these before they were good and let's do this again so here we go I'm gonna break this seal for you guys know it's childproof it's childproof you guys it doesn't even have a little cut for you to follow do you have scissors money so you legit might need a knife or some scissors to open the packaging which is always good that's like an a-plus because if you have kids or you have little adults around you don't want them to easily access these things because yeah Oh Jax is sad he's crying outside right now but I don't want him inside because he's just gonna he's just gonna bark and do odd things possible but he's sad because jenna so just dipped or she went somewhere I'm not sure but okay so I went ahead and cut it open I'm sorry my nails are a little rough right now one is really bitten your girl has been super anxious and nervous and if you know me you just have a lot of anxiety sometimes and believe it or not I get and I get anxiety attacks and it's just a struggle you guys so if you guys know what they feel like or you guys are also going through the same thing I hope that you guys are doing everything possible to just stay calm and everything is gonna be fine you guys I always try to remind myself that but anyways it smells so good these are dark mint chocolate bars and they legit smell like dark mint chocolate they really do you guys let me push them it to the front they literally broke it in there I am so upset with myself but they still looks so good okay let's do it I'm gonna eat the whole bar you guys so let's do this they are look look at how they're packaging for their chocolate is like go ahead and hold that for you guys look at that it literally tells you the milligram of each little bar that is crazy I don't even remember eating the other one and I don't remember being this excited about having the milligrams on the bar I don't know I guess yes yes if you guys how do you say it um if you guys are dosing or how would you say I money you just oh yeah mone is smart she okay so if you are micro dosing and you are a big believer or a big person who does micro seeing these are exactly what you need but let's do this image it tastes like dark chocolate man mm sorry 20 milligrams yeah 820 milligrams right there let's go ahead and eat oh my god I'm such an idiot you guys and you guys are not telling me so apparently it doesn't give you the milligrams on here I just assumed that they did but no it doesn't it actually says THC on the bar d\u00f6 oh my god I'm either dumb or I'm blind you guys I'm so dumb but it does say THC on them on the packaging and lets you know that each bar is 10 milligrams so I just assumed that that's what it was on that's what was written on the bar but you know what it's still cool it still lets you know how many milligrams each little bar is and honestly dude the reason why I like these is because ok 30 more milligrams and then it's 50 milligrams total and you can't argue with that [Applause] and I got this one this one didn't break yeah so this one didn't break you guys and 15 milligrams for this little bit is yes yes I love edibles that are tiny but they pack so much like a little brownie that's 100 milligrams like thighs the best because you don't have to eat as much like it legit gets to the point it's not like you have to eat 50 cupcakes to get 100 milligrams like no I love that they high dose these things so that you can eat less of it but get more of a punch like those are my favorite edibles look 20 more milligrams what is that now 70 milligrams oh my god I'm freaking myself out honey you're gonna be here with me okay my sister said if I feel like I'm dying she's gonna be here with me you're gonna remind me that I'm not dying she was gonna remind me I'm not dying guys honestly I can always have I can always be having a bad day but once I get on camera for you guys and I talk to you guys I just make a difference I do feel better I do feel the best I could be sometimes but yeah like I really like being here with you guys you guys motivate me of course I do want to do big things when I'm older I hope you guys stay to see what the [ __ ] that J and J twins are gonna do in the future my sister has a boyfriend and they're hella cute you guys so shout out to all the couples out there especially my sister's relationship because he is so nice you guys like so next so nice oh hi there any more milligrams and that's gonna be a total of 100 milligrams you guys so recently hmm yeah I would buy these again mm-hmm yes mm-hmm so recently I took half a tab with Hubert he took the pool tab you guys I don't know I don't know people could do the most and still survive but me knowing I'm gonna take a full time I know that it's gonna be full-blown everything like everything I'm gonna see God I'm gonna see [ __ ] mythological things everything so I took half a tab right you guys I swear I couldn't stop laughing like I was trying I was trying so hard to keep it together because like I wouldn't look at Hubert and I was just like in my mind it was so funny like to even look at him was so funny like I didn't know I didn't know why looking at him was so funny and while I was doing that I was applying to new things so that I can get my life together and go find better things so I was on my laptop like the laptop looked cool whatever but then I started to realize oh my god oh my god it's hitting like my half tab is hitting and that's why I only take half a tab Jax our guard dog our long-haired dachshund or jealous long-haired dachshund even after the tab was over and we woke up the next morning I even asked him I was I asked him how his tab fell and if he felt it and he said smack - smack but yeah I am my my half tops max I didn't think it was going through because I've never had great oh my god looks so young with short hair so I never like I never really have good experiences with papertabs usually jalisa gets us gel tabs and those are the ones that really really like always boom like and these paper tabs one time we took them and they just it didn't work out so yeah lesson learned gels are my favorite my point is don't be afraid to microdose don't ever feel like you have to eat the whole edible or take the whole tab like no I even take quarter tabs and I feel good I feel like I could take a quarter tab and go throughout my day or take a quarter tab and drink and have a good time so everything is possible you guys don't hurt yourselves but I will come back check up with you guys and see when this hits so I'll make sure to time this for you guys let me check and you're gonna wash my hands because I do not want to lick my fingers so it is currently 138 I will come back whenever these shit's hit which will be in like 30 minutes hopefully or maybe an hour who knows no one ever knows um yeah and I'll check up with you guys and see you later my dude shoutout to jealous because she is hooking it up with some boiling crab but yes but yes okay so it's been like 45 minutes okay you guys so it's 229 now and oh my gosh that's so weird why is it doing that anyways so it's 2:30 you guys and I am pretty faded I don't know what that means that's so weird oh it's doing it's like something the camera can see but not us okay guys so the edibles definitely hit you guys I was watching a really good movie right now called private life it's called private life and I was crying you guys I can't stop oh my gosh this edible is definitely hitting I was watching this movie called private life and if you haven't watched it you guys need to watch this movie like the movie is so it's real and I like that so yeah the edibles this is like 45 minutes after or 15 minutes after so like about an hour it took me to really get the feeling like I am super faded right now you guys like I'm just like deeply in movies right now if you guys want something that's gonna hit you guys should definitely get some wounds and if you like the mint flavor with chocolate this is definitely that so yeah thanks for watching and I will see you guys in the next video", "Qqm0eS5nKmw": "okay so in my current attempt to worry less and experiment more I'm coming out of a sixteen and a half hour fast into this is a candy bar with a hundred milligrams of THC see how it is okay so when you finally wrestle with the childproof packaging which is also micro proof you get this it's a pretty little gold bar it's pretty

"H-KD67mwVC0": "so what does 500 milligrams of THC feel like well I can tell you that it doesn't feel good it kind of feels like this okay so it's a little over two weeks ago that I was given ten drops of cannabis oil and the dosage was played down to me and I wasn't sure exactly how many milligrams I was taking it was said that it was diluted and very weak and I was given ten drops and I have never ever taken anything cannabis related in my life so obviously it's gonna hit me harder I wasn't planning to take it I thought the worst that can happen is I'm gonna be extremely relaxed and calm and I haven't really done a lot of research into THC and cannabis oil and the effects on what it does to you so I took the ten drops under my tongue kept it there had a bit of a bitter taste didn't taste much else and then afterwards found out that there was 500 milligrams of THC in those 10 drops so I didn't know if 500 milligrams was a lot or not because I've never really put much research into the actual effects and what the dose is is law when I read online that 500 is extremely high and I was seeing a lot of people there are regular cannabis oil users or THC users I saw how it affected them I thought to myself well I'm either gonna feel weird and go through like a sleepy zombie State or I'm just gonna feel okay so an hour went by I felt okay and I decided to leave the house because I actually forgot that I taken it I carried on swimming and we were doing a whole bunch of things as I was leaving my skin was so hot like it suddenly felt like in that split second I was fine doesn't feel anything in the next second it just hit me and my skin felt so hot like there was a con air blowing on me and it honestly felt like heat a so I went up to it and I faltered and when I put my hand closed it felt like cold air but as I stood back that that air blowing on my skin for that I was on fire I literally felt like I couldn't handle the heat the next thing that happened is just almost like the wall closing in and like tunnel vision and it was just black everywhere except right in front of my eyes and it felt like like like falling or furutaka like you at the top and as you drop it's like that whoop kind of feeling like everything closing in your stomach jumping and I was horrible I felt like whoa something's not right and then I remembered I took ten drops of cannabis oil and I thought to myself okay maybe it's bringing on some anxiety because I've suffered with anxiety attacks and I managed to calm myself down over the years and control it it just got worse and worse and worse my heart rate shot up so high that it I could feel it jumping on my chest now thought okay it's definitely anxiety but my heart the way my heart was going and felt completely different to anxiety so on my very very bad anxiety attacks where I've got rushed to the ER I had a heart rate of 140 beats a minute now if you think about it to put it in perspective your resting heart rate is about 60 beats a minute it can range between 60 to 100 but usually your resting heart rate is about 67 so 140 is for me if I'm boxing or if I am on a treadmill and I'm running or on the elliptical machine or skipping doing those intense things your heart rate is about at 140 so now I imagine being at a resting heart rate and suddenly shoot up to 140 where it feels like you're running on a treadmill and you're out of breath like you you're running that fast but you're not so your breathing doesn't match your heart rate your brain doesn't match your body's activity and everything's just out of synch so that's classic anxiety symptoms I thought to myself I just gotta calm down so much my heart rate shot up to a hundred and seventy two beats a minute now that's the highest I've ever seen it even when I've exercised and when I used to do MMA training my heart rate ever used to go to 172 I think 165 was the max I've ever seen my heart rate I felt like my heart couldn't take it I had this burning sensation through my chest like almost like when the letter s it is building up in your body and you're training hard and you feel like your muscle cannot take the weight if you lifting a little bit too heavy feels like I'm also gonna take I had that same kind of burning feeling in my chest and my heart was racing so fast on top of that I had this funny feeling like it was it was just like my heart couldn't cope with a the beats per minute and I lay on the bed I got managed to get to the bed and I was struggling to speak because my heart was going so crazy that I couldn't get the words out like I was freaking out inside and I was told with it that's the weird thing I didn't feel the effects of the THC besides those physical responses like I was I was going through all of this but in my mind I'm like just relax it's anxiety and even though my heart was that fast I'm like you're just gonna freak yourself out more and I was talking to myself to calm myself down using my diaphragm to breathe and slow my heart rate slow my breathing control everything but it just got worse and worse and worse when I checked my heart rates again and weights up to 180 and it wasn't like a panic attack where it stays high for long and then oops it just stayed constantly a tip from 180 dip down to 172 to 165 and it didn't go below 165 it was between 165 and 172 for about seven hours so even though the HC is considered safe there are extreme cases where there are complications so if your heart rate stays too high for too long you can have a heart attack my blood pressure was extremely high eventually we call the paramedics because I didn't feel like I was gonna make it now I've seen lots of stories of people taking too much and especially if it's their first time they think that they're gonna die and they have anxiety and freaked out I've been through so much anxiety over the years and has so many anxiety attacks where I was rushed to hospital and this fall so different my mind was still there like I was still thinking everything and I honestly felt like I was I was blacking out and my heart was going way too fast and my heart couldn't take it they called the paramedics the paramedics came my heart rate was still extremely high my oxygen saturation was so low because I wasn't breathing properly I was trying to control my breathing so much that I eventually slowed my breathing down so much that I stopped breathing basically they had to stand over me and told me to take deep breaths because I basically lost respiration and I wasn't getting enough oxygen in my body so I made a conscious effort to suck in air but I struggled so much to breathe it's almost like a disconnected feeling and I have read that so that you could become disconnected but you don't know where you are I knew exactly what was happening around me I could feel every single thing I could feel muscles in my face I could feel the inside of my ears I could feel all my muscles I could feel everything it's scary because then you start feeling so lame almost like I couldn't really move much then I would try shake myself like just like the little jerks and jumps to like wake myself up because I could feel like I was slipping away - I don't know passing out or blacking out and the funny thing is in that clip where you see me laying on the bed there my blood pressure was so high it was 190 over a hundred ten I think somewhere there and I thought I had glasses on I'd fought like you know when you put glasses on they're a little bit too tight and you can feel the bands on behind your ears I could feel that and because my blood pressure was so high my veins were so tight there I didn't have two losses on it was just those veins and the whole time I thought I had glasses on because of that feeling my blood pressure was extremely high my heart rate was way too fast and that's lost him for seven hours it's the last longer but off those first seven hours those were the worst so having a heart rate go that fast for that long it can be dangerous and having a blood pressure that high and if it rose higher along with that heart rate is extremely dangerous you could have a stroke you can have a heart attack it's very easy so even though it is a natural compound and there are no reported deaths from cannabis the complications or ever stating and I've never felt that scary in my life through all the anxiety attacks that I had and everything that I've been through with thoracic outlet syndrome that feeling right there was the scariest feeling I've ever had when I had anxiety I used to think that I was gonna die and eventually you know you're not gonna die even though you feel like it with us I just I couldn't control it obviously I take it such a high dose that my mind was only focusing on negative things as much as I was trying to stay positive and talk myself through it and the paramedics actually brought the stretcher they wanted to take me to hospital if my blood patient didn't go down and they stayed with me for a quite a while because I saw such tunnel vision and my blood pressure was so high I think I just like to zoned in I honestly thought that they took so many hours to get there and it felt like it was nighttime reading where in the clip you can see I'm laying there as it's fall early evening I think there was 10 past 6 or so so I was really like out of it I doesn't feel good at all my whole family around me none of them had ever seen me look that bad I didn't see myself making it out of it my heart was feeling so strained it was about three days after that that I still felt like I couldn't do anything because just getting off the bed walking around the house I felt like my heart was pumping so hard like it like it was overused then drained from the day before so it was just like the next week I had no energy I had left so much energy I wasn't myself at all I doesn't feel good I had the worst headache and obviously such a high dosage was way too high for my body to handle and I had no tolerance to it and it wasn't something that I've ever wanted to try or thought to try so it was a stupid decision to even want to try it and that's why I just got to be careful with what you take sometimes doctors will prescribe you medicines and things and they just don't work with your body they react differently and your experiences can be totally different to somebody else so you everyone can be laughing and having a great time and then you are freaking out and having the worst time and just now you get a complication and like I honestly thought that I wasn't gonna make it and it was an exaggeration because when I look back at the footage that I have the way I look in the video freaked out and not looking good at all my heart rate I got felt that and I can still feel that I can think about it and feel that scared feeling that I felt and it wasn't just because I was having some weird experience from the THC it was just it was pure anxiety and pure fear and yeah it's not something that I enjoyed at all I know I should have researched first it was one of us things that happen so fast that you make a stupid decision and it can affect you it was one of those kind of things because I love to research everything down to a tee before I take it when I had my thoracic outlet syndrome when I was on tremor doll I took like three tremor dolls and I threw the Box away because of all the first of all the way it made me feel I fall I couldn't feel like myself didn't take my pain away and all the side effects so I threw it away and cured myself naturally and this was just one of those things where it wasn't planned at all and just happened like in that split second I was like okay let me just take ten drops I mean what 10 drops gonna be and ya had the scariest 7 hours of my life fortunately I came right I eventually managed to stand after seven hours I managed to get up stand I felt horrible and weird and zoned out but I felt a little bit more relieved that I felt like myself I felt like it just slowed down enough to a point where I felt I felt okay and I could I could go home so yeah that's my experience it's a horrible experience now I know there's I've really got so many messages from people all over saying it took too much and if you want the right those who just message me or if you want proper CBD oil with no THC I'm not interested in any of those things I'm not interested in any of those kind of questions telling me that I took way too much because I know it took way too much for myself but this was just something I thought I'd share because there are so many websites that you read and and obviously it's promoted as a safe thing to take and obviously if it's measured properly and in the right dosages then it can be safe and it can be useful for many things but if you're just taking it and you don't have any knowledge about it and you're taking too much like I did it can be scary and it can be dangerous and just now you're taking a higher dose and your body can't handle it and you end up having a heart attack or stroke or something that could have been avoided because you don't know enough so I hope my experience can just hope somebody make the right decision and not just take some research first I have been struggling to train I've been back to training maybe once or twice but because I've been so busy at work I haven't like got myself back into training and making videos on regular basis so I'll get back to making all my podcast series that I was trying to work on before all of this happened I hope this can help somebody and at least make them think before they try something I'll see you guys soon", "ULaV_ZP2b3Q": "[Music] hi friends welcome to weeks the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking a look at another thing from canna candies there our first lollipop the grape medicated lollipop hundred milligrams of THC as rated by SC labs which is always great to get that little reminder that has been officially rated and it does have the THC as promised in there thanks the good folks at SC labs as I said this is my first lollipop not my first candy I've had hard candies from Canada candies before and in the grand scheme or scope of candies they're not bad I still wouldn't necessarily that wouldn't be my first choice for edibles I'd still stick with the confectionaries as always but the kind of candies are far from the worst types of candies so the lollipop I think cost me seven bucks at my dispensary which is a pretty affordable for a 100 milligram edible so let's just go ahead and open up and give it a and give it a taste here this is the first time you've ever tuned in two weeks the way our reviews work is I'm gonna eat this lollipop and then I will come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I am feeling because that is the most important part of the edible review not necessarily so much how it tastes so here we go we've got our big gourmet lollipop purpley black give it a lick how many to get to the center one to our you know things yep it tastes like a great bali pop without a lot of flavor and just a hint of weed exactly what I thought it was gonna be not great not terrible pretty much what you think it's gonna be as well think of a mild flavored grape lollipop with a bit of an earthy aftertaste except not as bad as sounding as that and that's what it's gonna taste like but guys without how hey how's this gonna make me feel for that you're gonna have to stay tuned and I will see you guys in two hours I'll be back right here to let you know how I'm feelin thank you so much for watching see you guys soon peace hi guys my dog squid here and I are back to talk to you about panic and ease Medicaid and lollipops the hundred milligram great flavor here I and I'm I'm kind of hi about what I would expect for a hundred milligram at all not a lot of red in the old I boss but again it's only 100 milligrams and I'm feeling about what I would think for that maybe a little bit lower probably just because it's a candy and those don't tend to hit me as hard as the confectionaries um but I don't I'm not dissatisfied with it it's again right in the sort of wheelhouse of what I was expecting didn't taste terrible I'm moderately high and for a candy it's it's one that I can recommend and it's pretty cheap bet like I said I think it cost me seven bucks so it's affordable it doesn't taste terrible and it got me pretty it got me a little high so it's what I was looking for what I was about what I was expecting if you're in the mood for a lower dose edible or if you're a new smoker and you want something a little bit higher dose that you can sort of media it out over time maybe give the lollipops a chance especially these ones from can of candies I can verify I and SC labs can verify you know they'll it will it will get you high and it doesn't taste too bad so that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds guys I really appreciate you tuning in as always we we'll see you on the next review and thank you so much for watching peace okay hello and thank you so much for watching weeds if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below and I'll be more than happy to try to find the product to review it again thanks for watching and we'll check you guys out on the next video", "BzQ9i6EeCZQ": "all right so boom this is the official Twain 20 guy on how to safely consume weed edibles or any year for that matter because this is time that's advice you know I'm saying so I find that consuming edibles I eating it it's a lot more natural and has a less health risks than smoking anything you smoke and inhale into your lungs as the potential to affect your breathing cars in such as bronchitis and just overall get lungs see lungs other basic necessity of life right but at the point to note that not all edibles are created equal and being knowledgeable of the dosage level that you take is crucial in order for you to actually enjoy and have a good experience rather than be one of those people on YouTube that gives a story time about their worst experience of marijuana [Music] three hours later welcome back to no song edutainment yall already know what's going on subscribe to channel cuz I'm a fun guy I'm a cool guy I go through my day pretty normal like I'm a normal guy I'm a swell guy I'm a nice enough guy I'm a cool kind of guy I'm a pretty groovy guy I call this honest entertain you make you laugh but most importantly educate you on a variety of subjects that make you learn something they can apply it to your own personal personal life so mister my research the general consensus I see for a serving one serving of an edible is about 10 milligrams but not all will be dispensaries created equal like I said before some of them serve a bit more some of them aren't as precise and having each in each serving wrap individually so depending on where you get it from one serving we have a bit more THC than you might expect usually if it does have more THC than the 10 milligrams like limit it should have this image or however you wherever you see this image on the box right there but in the meantime products with too much THC must have these warning labels so I've told you why edibles are better than smoking or vaping me but how and what do you do to actually enjoy it safe so I got about five different steps for you to follow if you listen to me if you listen to me just listen to me you will enjoy your edible experience simple because I know it all I just played so most places require or from what I've seen research most states and my keys most provinces in Canada require a limit of ten milligrams of THC in a serving of edible but my suggestion Prasad is to tone it down a bit more and actually do five milligrams as your basic reduction to an edible cookie gummy bears or whatever so number one is important to read the packaging carefully so that you don't overdose or not overdose you can't really overdose on wheat but you can definitely take too much this easy there go anybody take a tab hallucinate you finished our trip the trip but chill out I got a heartbeat I can't feel [ __ ] so no longer do you have to play Russian roulette with your dosage amounts there's now a legal dosage of ten milligrams as your basic level of attaboy experience but if it isn't made at home then in that case be extra careful with how much you're taking in a given set or given serving size so especially if you're new to cannabis or you don't take it regularly it's important to dip your toe in the water a little bit before you dive in headfirst rather than taking the recommended ten milligrams take instead to five milligrams and then wait another two to three hours before you take another serving size just so that you are easing yourself into the whole edible experience and you can actually enjoy the high rather than you know some of the other stories I've seen on YouTube and even if you are a veteran cannabis user you should also implement my foot dosing which is start with five milligrams or even you start with the ten milligrams wait two or three hours and then add another one why should you do this because it gently stimulates the body's cannon but receptors which results in an increased high or increased mood productivity creativity without the sudden high effect that you might get if you were to just like consumer all I was in fact Oh Oh cookies very important to me I mean I love to me but they mean much more to me Tommy so the high is a bit more noticeable noticeable and more enjoyable like is you're kind of like on a roller coaster type of thing rather than already being at the top right so you're gently taking yourself to that peak or a high rather than just as soon as you get to the rides everyday at the top which is not ideal so again five milligrams as your basic level especially if you're a beginner and then every two or three hours just gradually take another serving size just so that you can safely and enjoyably each edible our number two is important to consider your tolerance having a low THC tolerance makes you susceptible to negative side effects of taking too much weed or taking too much THC such as paranoia anxiety and dizziness definitely without a doubt it's better to have an underwhelming experience than an overwhelming experience where you are shaking your you panicking whatever it is it's better to be disappointed than to be on the other spectrum if I'm gonna say okay do what you want you an adult but take heed take heed all right one word is good enough for the wise so he was so it's your first time trying a screen or not well since you interacted with marijuana in general don't try and keep up with the veteran smoker so don't try keep up with the rest of the crew just go at your own pace because there's it's not a race I see alright I got this off like that got the sauce little ketchup those sauce little ketchup thank you keep up with them because people that consume meet regularly already need a higher dosage to get their desired high effect and this is why I say it's important to take weed tolerance breaks the tolerance breaks for weed are important because it allows you to get higher for a longer period of time so your high or not it won't be like twenty minutes it'd be like two plus hours or so and you can get high on a small amount of weed which results in savings yeah I put it all together see it and trying to save y'all money I'm looking out for you looking out for your pockets so take means haulin sprigs periodically so that you can continue to not need a higher dosage and that your high can also last for a longer period of time simple so number three it just be patient like I said be patient with the THC and how it how long it takes to affect you depending on your metabolism and your body fat it can take anywhere from 30 minutes to two or maybe even a few hours so these snacks are not like your regular snacks at the grocery store or the corniche story these aren't regular snacks that you can - to eat as you're watching a Netflix videos or Netflix shows or movies whatever it is take heed to the serving size and be patient for 330 minutes any for 30 minutes to two hours if you feel the pips this is the moment you feel the effect is when you can like perhaps take another one but even at that let it right out for a bit on number four you want to be mindful of your stomach's contents so the more food you have in your system the longer it will take for weed to get metabolized in your bloodstream and take effect however in empty stomach I lost with the edibles to activate Kruger so just keep it just keep that in mind when and if you are eating edible did you eat already because if you didn't it'll take effect quicker and if you haven't eaten already before it then start with half a dose or what you usually take or what you want to take just so that you know just you can slow yourself in micro dosing same as the same thing micro dosing is the wave don't just jump in and if you drank alcohol beforehand alcohol can increase the THC blood concentration in your system so it's important to use caution if you're mixing alcohol with edibles and number five just this is more of like the nurture you know they say nature is the nature this is more of an immature type of thing it just be mindful of the environment like are you around people that you or as you care about you want people that care about you right and are you comfortable around these people so if you're taking a larger dose for the first time or long much more it's better take it at your home with your loved one or parent or francica with it your brother sibling romantic partner whatever it is just be around if you're taking a larger dose for the first time or just in general you are taking a new strain it's best to be around people that you actually are familiar with and you actually care about just to that part of for you to experience some type of anxiety or panic attack or just seeing a familiar face will keep you a bit more grounded if you did end up eating so much but again the more experience you have the more likely you are to be comfortable the easier it is for you to be comfortable in different situations or different environments but yeah so my kudos take it easy five milligrams or as your basis for anything for the most part and then just gradually increase your high once you start feeling the effects and its best it's always better to have an underwhelming experience then an overwhelming experience londo and take these five steps into consideration you will have a very enjoyable read hi and again have other videos above or edibles from marijuana lay the topics in the description pink ominous video and we showed with an addiction to read if you like you're smoking too much or you feel like it's no longer serving you I will hold mini course mini program that dancing walk you through steps you need to take to detox appropriately and to replace your weed habit with something more beneficial or something different all right god bless much love peace enjoy namaste it's always a member if it doesn't feed you do not wanna dish whatever you're watching whatever you're listening to what I be eating there's a nursery to make you better cut that [ __ ] off because too much of any good thing is good for nothing - the guys from the Jen can you kill the monster they call it the girl apps more please want to commend you thank you not this one", "iJwdqt7ebmE": "yeah here we go here we go again what's up yo back with another review today Oh edible gummies Mira Mira specifically Rob hots sour flavors I believe this is a relative new relatively new flavor for them I'm not a million percent sure even close to sure if it's on the REC side if it's not now I would imagine it will be soon so diving in the flavors we got inside here blue raspberry grape and green apple I don't know I had to look at it I actually know the flavors of jelly me anyway that's pretty much my favorite flavors enjoy ranchers and other candies so that was a super big plus for me I'm not really a huge tower fan so I'm really hoping they're not especially a sour yeah I was gonna enter a picture probably already did or I am now so we're gonna dive into what one thing to keep in mind is the brain all right we go is that the milligrams posted on the bottle or on the container are not necessarily the exact amount that are in your specific bottle your specific bottle will have a separate location where it is located exactly how many milligrams are in there I will insert a picture of it but it's I just keep smearing it you cannot see it at all anymore but I know that this bottle says 500 milligrams and it has 467 point 6 4 milligrams in it meaning each piece is not 50 milligrams but 46.7 6 milligrams per gummy it will always tell you the specific amount of THC that is in and milligrams that is in your container but it's not always exactly what's on the bottle sometimes it's more though I had another bottle of greens but I ate before I could review sometimes it's more the greens were 500 and something milligrams so each milligram or 5/10 I think or anyway doesn't matter because it was 51 milligrams per gummy i remember that specifically so sometimes you're getting more sometimes getting less if you're really a budget conscious person and you want to really maximize your bang for buck check out the different flavors and see what milligram is the highest of the actual bottle that you'll be purchasing we're gonna move on to the scent also it doesn't say whether it's a hybrid or indica or sativa so that means it's a hybrid most edibles are pretty much hybrids anyway I'm to get a edible specific video posted so keep an eye out for that because I'm gonna give like tips tricks all kinds of different information about edibles specifically that you can apply across pretty much all edibles sauer sorry I'm getting a little bit of the grape but I'm gonna be completely honest with you guys these two are the two that I'm gonna be eating and one of them is great the reason these are the two that I'm gonna be eating is because I licked the [ __ ] out of them getting the sub nail photo and specifically the purple one is the one that I started with so it got the most saliva on it so I'm not sure if that has affected the scent that I'm picking up the most in here I'm like rotating something like the blue raspberries up on top I still kind of get great more than anything else behind this hour cuz this hour is the first thing that I smelled so that's a little bit concerning for me but when I was licking them I didn't taste a lot of sour however in the photo you can see there's a lot of like more there's a lot of rocky material that's only on one side from what I can tell because the green one too it didn't have any on the bottom I'm thinking that's the sour so I would imagine that you could dust that off and they wouldn't be sour but tact tactically they are I'm gonna grab one that I haven't wet because that they're more sticky Wow they're mean Wow I'm having before but they are they're very soft and compression they're definitely gummies cuz they're a little bit sticky but let's see yeah they're a little bit sticky my fingers are a little sticky after that but I could be because I was also handling the ones that I licked so we're gonna let see my fingers do not feel sticky at all or the like least amount like to smile if anything so now we're gonna squeeze squeeze squeeze squeeze it is sticky yeah it's sticky and that's one that was not licked but it's not super bad cuz now after I've done it a few times it's pretty much not sticky anymore so a little sticky but you'll be able to like dust it off and no big deal as long as you don't like continuously looking and grab it and grab it and grab it that makes it sticky alright let's ride let's ride so I'm gonna be doing actually 150 because I'm gonna try all three well I was Jenni myself so harshly I'm like oh you're not getting quick enough that I couldn't actually think about adding up the numbers so it actually may be more like 135 levi's I am going to put the sour directly on my tongue with this one and then the other way on this one and whichever way I like the most I'm gonna do for the blue raspberry because that's my favorite and the apple looks like it's not got a lot of stuff on it so [Music] okay I push the gummy off to the side to just deal with the sour but it's really not bad like you can see my face with like a little bit but when it's really sour it's my faces all kinds of you know I am definitely getting a great flavor I would say that there is a mild earthy flavor to it I mean hash has a very very attached distillate has a very mild cannabis flavor to it but I'm picking that up so it's not but I I mean any edible honestly any edible is gonna have the slightest flavoring whether it be hashey or earthy which this is a little bit both I'm getting it's interesting you know I'm getting the earthiness of the you know cannabis component but which is in distillate but I'm also at the end getting a little bit of the tang or the dryness maybe that's it of the hash flavor if you have smoked hash or gotten it on it and like licked it and stuff you kind of know what I mean you the smell like honest if you know what the smell is you kind of know what the taste is so they're green apple oh and as far as I continue to talk the flavor I'm left with is a very mild grape kind of a again there's it's not really necessarily earthy at this point it's an off great like it's great but just like a little okay solid metal that straight-up tastes like Ukraine Apple the end part I got a little bit of sour and as I was coming out of it it tasted like a sour green apple so that was really nice not quite as much earthy flavor in that one I just think maybe the green apple complements or goes with the cannabis ever slightly so more than the grape so more I'm not really tasting the green apple anymore it was strong when I was eating it but it doesn't really have a leftover flavor and blue raspberry [Music] whoo Smiley's an idol I ate a boy okay that was delicious it honestly reminds me of a blue Slurpee but I I honestly don't think I've ever tried a Slurpee ever but it's what I imagine a blue raspberry a Slurpee tastes like blue raspberry otter pop that's the closest that I can relate it to cuz it's not quite blue raspberry Jolly Rancher but it's blue rounder blue blue raspberry otter pop so it's a little duller than a Jolly Rancher but still nicely blue raspberry we're popsicle I swallowed unexpectedly during that so some sour got in my throat so it's not the best feeling and I did just eat on three so I'm imagining the flavors gonna be a little ol kooky but I kind of maybe I just want it I feel like I have a remanence of blue raspberry in my mouth but I might just be wanting it so much that its existing you know for the placebo effect so flavors oh dude I didn't get any hash from that no earthy no hash maybe because I like that flavor so much or it goes better with it I don't know but it tasted delicious so that you know as far as overall experience I appreciate that the sour is not super sour I almost think there's gonna be people who are disappointed but it's not super super sour but I thought it was a nice mild level of sour what yeah I still get the grape more than anything in that particular whip waft I wonder if it's because I was also thinking it was gonna be so much more sour that I smelled this no I smell sour but it's not as strong it has before that's so funny anyway I love Rob hot gummies I've had them pretty consistently there's definitely other companies that make really good gummies but Rob hots from what I've experienced so far seems to be the best thing for the [ __ ] and having good quality like great quality gummies however I did want to mention gelatin and glucose syrup is in here I don't know how that relates to either vegetarianism or veganism all right so the milligrams are definitely affecting me at this point I'd say I'm Spacey relaxed [Music] I'm frontier I was more minute early and now I'm more relaxed and I think when I get to doing the video editing it'll be easier to focus than trying to pull thoughts out of this brain it's more just do versus think which is wonderful my hands are so dry my knuckles oh my gosh I need to get more lotion I have to go okay I just needed a quick thing yeah yes I would recommend rabbits gummies I would say pretty much overall at this point different flavors you you're gonna like and not like so that's gonna be a personal thing but overall I think that Rob Potts does a good job with their gummies and the sours were delicious and not super sour and I really like that I hope you guys have a wonderful rest of your day", "oeyt2zVqCG8": "A Man Ate 100 Zinc Vitamin C Gummies Everyday.

One day he stepped on something sharp. It cut his foot, and he didn\u2019t realize anything\nhad happened until he saw red puddles in the shower. He realized he couldn\u2019t keep living like\nthis. One doctor he saw wanted to start him on a\nvariety of medicines. He refused after looking online and found\na doctor who recommended and would do gastric bypass surgery. This doctor would cut in to his abdomen. They\u2019d create a small pocket of his stomach. Then, they would reroute his GI tract in to\nthe end of his small intestines. The small stomach pouch limited the amount\nhe\u2019d eat, so that he\u2019d feel full while eating less food. And the reroute would limit the amount of\ncalories he\u2019d absorb. After surgery, doctors warned GC that he would\nneed to control his nutrients, because the bypass can cause some deficiencies in vitamins\nand minerals. GC\u2019s diabetes cleared up, but he started\nredirecting his excess habits. GC started getting cocky with his health. Fixing his diet, made his blood sugar control\nbetter. Those doctors, were trying to pump me full\nof meds for my diabetes, but I fixed it myself, he thought. 2 years ago, GC caught the flu. This was the sickest he had been since changing\nhis life. He vowed to never get ill again, and started\nreading online forums about boosting immunity. He remembered doctors telling him he might\neventually have vitamin and mineral deficiency because of his gastric bypass. He came across some online videos that told\nhim zinc and vitamin C were absolutely the best ways to keep the immune system strong. Everyone in this internet group made it clear\u2014\nthis was undoubtedly the best way to prevent any illness. And it\u2019s simply impossible to take too much\nVitamin C and Zinc because they\u2019re water soluble, meaning that any extras will dissolve\nin the urine and be excreted from the body. And that\u2019s a great guarantee that the kidneys\nwill always catch any extras that the body doesn\u2019t use. He went to the pharmacy and started buying\nas many bottles of zinc and Vitamin C as possible. He joked that he was reliving his past life,\nbut this time was different. Instead of collecting high blood sugar, he\nwas going to collect the strongest immune system ever made by humans. GC started with the combination Zinc / Vitamin\nC gummies. These were delicious, just like candy, without\nthe calories and with only all of the health benefits. If there\u2019s no limits here, might as well\neat the whole bottle, he thought. Anytime GC felt a runny nose or sore throat,\nhe\u2019d eat an extra handful of Zinc Vitamin C gummies. Sometimes the pharmacy would be sold out of\nhis favorite brand of supplement. He read online that denture adhesive cream\ncontained zinc. And, if it was good enough for grandma to\nput in her mouth, then it was good enough for him to eat as a zinc immune booster. Anytime he was out of his preferred vitamin\nbrand, he\u2019d eat a tube of denture cream instead. 4 Months ago, GC started feeling a numbness\nin his hands and feet. But it wasn\u2019t that he couldn\u2019t feel anything\nanymore, it was that all he could feel were pins and needles, like his hands had fallen\nasleep, but the pricks were 100 times more intense, all the time. He had experienced this earlier in his life\nand thought it was familiar, but it wasn\u2019t. This was on top of him losing his sense of\ntaste. His sides would start hurting. Sometimes it\u2019d pulse, and he\u2019d feel like\nthrowing up. But he was usually able to keep it all down. One day, Kaycee noticed her dad was walking\nkind of funny. She asked him about it but he didn\u2019t know\nwhat she was talking about. Everything seemed to be ok, and he told her,\ndon\u2019t worry, everything\u2019s fine, as he chewed on more Zinc Vitamin C gummies. As the days passed, the pin pricks and the\npain in his sides started intensifying. He had trouble not only walking, but also\nstanding. And finally when one day he struggled to walk\ndown a flight of stairs, he fell. Instantly, he knew something was wrong with\nhis hip as he cried out for help, and he\u2019s brought to the emergency room where we are\nnow. At examination, doctors find that GC is alert,\nand oriented. He was clearly in pain, but he was coherent. His brain\u2019s in tact, so maybe he really\ndid just slip. Doctors\u2019 main focus was to fix his broken\nhip. And surgery appears to go smoothly. GC is going to need physical therapy, but\nsomething\u2019s wrong. A blood test finds that GC\u2019s red blood cells\nare larger than normal, called macrocytosis. They cant ask him to stand because he just\nhad hip surgery. But they find that the reflexes in his arms\nare more responsive than normal. His arms were also weaker than normal. His feet had some trouble sensing vibrations. And his daughter confirmed that this had been\nhappening for at least a few weeks. Since he was alert and oriented when he presented\nto the emergency room, then it means that his brain is fine. But reflexes in the arms go through the spinal\ncord. Feeling certain things in the feet also happen\nin the brain, but those impulses have to go through the spinal cord. All of this indicating that maybe he didn\u2019t\njust slip by accident, but that something is actually wrong with GC\u2019s spinal cord. And because he has a history of gastric bypass,\nthen that problem could be caused by a vitamin deficiency. Another blood test finds that GC\u2019s Vitamin\nB12 levels are on the lower end of normal. B12 is needed by the body to help the mitochondria\nin the cells make energy. It\u2019s also needed to make DNA, explaining\nhis big red blood cells. Without enough Vitamin B12, the nerves start\nto get damaged. And cells don\u2019t form properly because DNA\nparts aren\u2019t being made. Nerve damage explains why he fell while his\nbrain\u2019s mostly in tact, because his gastric bypass surgery didn\u2019t allow him to properly\nabsorb nutrients, the doctors thought. They gave him some vitamin B12 injections\nto fix this, even though it seemed to be borderline. He got better, and he was discharged as his\ncondition started to improve. When he heard about having B12 deficiency\nin the hospital, GC took this as instructions to double down on all vitamins and minerals. He needed another boost to his immune system\nanyways, because hospitals are dirty places, so might as well eat even more Zinc Vitamin\nC gummies to prevent any infections that could be from the hospital. As the days passed with after several hundred\nZinc Vitamin C gummies, GC\u2019s side started hurting again. His sense of taste started fading, again. And then Kaycee started to notice he wasn\u2019t\nmaking as much urine as before. GC started acting funny while stammering about\nnot being able to feel his hands and feet. And as Kaycee walks in on her dad in his room,\nshe finds him rolling around on the floor, confused, and he\u2019s brought to the emergency\nroom again. At examination this time, doctors find that\nGC\u2019s kidneys are shutting down. Quickly, they find out that he has calcium\noxalate crystals in the little bit of urine he\u2019s able to make. These crystals don\u2019t dissolve in water,\nand they can build up and stick in to the kidneys, blocking flow, not only causing them\nto fail, but also causing the tubules in the kidneys to necrose. Asking his daughter, what GC\u2019s been eating,\nshe was hesitant to say, because she knew that her dad didn\u2019t trust doctors. She downplayed the Zinc Vitamin C gummies\nand made it seem like he took the daily recommended amount. Peanuts and spinach too have a lot of oxalate\ntoo, and maybe that could be the cause if he ate a lot of it. Maybe he drank antifreeze, or a lava lamp\u2014\nthose get broken down to oxalate too. But this wasn\u2019t his only problem. The nurse noticed that GC\u2019s movements were\nspastic. Neurology consult finds that his reflexes\nin his arms were more exaggerated than normal, and his feeling in his feet was diminished\nagain. All of this looking like Vitamin B12 deficiency\nagain, but something\u2019s wrong. He doesn\u2019t have low B12 levels in his blood,\nand all chemicals associated with vitamin B12 were normal. And while his levels were low when he got\nhis hip surgery last time, they really weren\u2019t low enough to be causing his problems. An MRI of his head was normal, but imaging\nof his spine suggested some kind of neurodegeneration. Specifically, the kind that happens during\na long term Vitamin B12 deficiency. Nitrous oxide if GC had been doing balloons\nrecently could cause inactivation of vitamin B12 causing deficiency. But this isn\u2019t what happened. He doesnt have a Vitamin B12 problem, and\nhe never did. This same degeneration happens when someone\nhas certain STD\u2019s, but he didn\u2019t seem to have those either. Doctors order another blood test and find\nthat GC has low copper presence in blood. They ask him again about what he eats, and\nthey especially want to know what kind of supplements he takes. And when his daughter hears the question,\nshe finally blurts out about her dad\u2019s excessive Zinc Vitamin C habits, eating hundreds of\ngummies daily and even going so far as to eat Denture Paste to get additional zinc,\nand this tells doctors what they need to know. GC was in kidney failure. Specifically, kidney failure caused by calcium\noxalate. Vitamin C is broken down to oxalate in the\nbody. In massive doses, it COULD cause kidney stones,\nin men. We say \u201ccould\u201d because this comes from\na study involving a questionnaire about taking vitamin C supplements. And those men who said they did take those\nsupplements, had a higher incidence of kidney stones. So is that strong evidence? Maybe. But there is some scientific rationale that\nVitamin C does get broken down to oxalate in humans and that could form a solid crystal\nwith the calcium floating around in the blood, and these crystals can collect in the kidneys. But based on the data we have now, it\u2019s\nnot entirely clear Vitamin C always does this to everyone. There are cases where someone receives a massive\nmegadose of vitamin C in the hospital and then going in to kidney failure hours later\ntoo. But sometimes it happens, sometimes it doesnt. The risk, and the variable incidence, is enough\nto at least say, don\u2019t eat 100 Vitamin C gummies or tablets everyday, and this could\nbe the cause of GC\u2019s kidney failure.. But kidney failure, wasnt the cause of GC\u2019s\npins and needles feeling in his hands and feet. His kidneys didn\u2019t cause him to walk funny,\nto fall down the stairs and shatter his hip. Kidney failure usually causes build up of\nthings in the blood, because if they were working properly, the kidneys would be filtering\nthings out, so that wouldn\u2019t cause low copper presence in blood. And the kidneys are NOT the reason why part\nof GC\u2019s spinal cord appears to have degenerated, bringing us back to zinc and copper. Both of these are metals. They\u2019re not heavy like mercury or lead,\nand that\u2019s a good thing because it means they\u2019re generally more stable. More stable means less reactive so Zinc and\nCopper are less likely to rip, tear apart and destroy things in the body. Copper and Zinc\u2019s place on the periodic\ntable of elements indicates that they can have a positive 2 charge, positive meaning\nthey\u2019re missing 2 electrons, a particle that creates a negative charge. The body doesn\u2019t like it when things have\ncharges in the body, because that makes them unstable and reactive. And so if copper is plus 2, then it means\nsomething with a negative 2 charge would act on it. On the periodic table, counting back from\nright to left, shows elements that have negative 2 charges, so, they have 2 electrons to give. Oxygen is one of them, and that\u2019s everywhere\nin the body, but it tends to behave in a way that doesn\u2019t give out 2 electrons in this\ncase. Meaning sulfur is the chemical that binds\nto zinc in the body. And because sulfur is in proteins, then this\nstarts to explain all of GC\u2019s problems. Actually, metals reacting with sulfur is a\ncentral idea for why things like lead and mercury are toxic in humans. In the cells of stomach, and the small intestines,\nare proteins called metallothioneins. Metallo referring to metals and thionein deriving\nfrom thio- (\u03b8\u03b5\u03af\u03bf) Greek meaning sulfur. These sulfur rich proteins neutralize metal\nions that come from our diet. In normal function, some copper in the stomach\nand intestines bind metallothionein and get excreted in the feces. The remaining copper gets absorbed in to the\nbody and is used for essential processes. If too much zinc is around, it tells the body\nto make more metallothionein. It has a plus 2 charge too and it\u2019s not\ntoo different from copper, at least from this standpoint. And more metallothionein means that all the\ncopper is inactivated by it and none of it gets absorbed in to be used in the body. This is a problem because the brain is the\nmost copper rich organ in humans. We know the brain needs copper to develop\nproperly, because there\u2019s a disease called Menkes\u2019 Disease, that prevents copper transport\nto the brain in young children because of a genetic mutation. People who have this disease see their brains\ndeteriorate, atrophy, and never fully develop. And most of those patients never live past\nchildhood. All of this explaining GC\u2019s neurologic problems,\nthat he developed since eating excess zinc everyday, it simply forced his body to deplete\nall copper stores, and without copper functioning in the body, the nerves start to degenerate. The damage could be permanent, but we still\ndon\u2019t know exactly how all of this works. If GC is a fully developed adult, and hes\nbeen eating zinc supplements to the tune of hundreds of Zinc Vitamin C gummies daily,\nand going so far as to eat denture paste for additional zinc, then that excess zinc is\ncausing copper deficiency. The solution is to give him to copper, and\ntell him to cut it out with the zinc. You want to take some supplements to boost\nyour immune system then fine, but dont do it by eating denture paste out of the tube. Or by eating whole bottles of gummy vitamins,\nevery day. As the days pass with copper supplementation,\nGC\u2019s condition starts to get better. He\u2019s discharged from the hospital and is\nable to go to physical therapy for his hip. And as he finally learned a lesson about his\nexcess, he made a recovery. Thanks so much for watching. Take care of yourself.

the other day I want to say you sailor sunday driver I'm not 100% sure but the shade is bomb and any other boy with a little ounce of shape for Christmas so that's dope what kind of lead man gives you Christmas yes what kind of nanos Matt he's [ __ ] right here I ain't gonna front they probably the dopest they're probably the dopest edibles in my opinion that I've had that's on the market that I've had sorry he's gonna need no booze on the market I'm saying it was on the market that's I've had okay so I really like them it's a hundred milligrams and the whole thing and it's five milligrams each dummy now a lot of [ __ ] be like oh 100 milligrams etting she got it had thousand milligrams if you got a thousand [ __ ] from the [ __ ] shop it probably wasn't a thousand milligrams I don't give a [ __ ] what you say or what you think it probably was not a thousand milligrams now some people can't take that [ __ ] don't get me wrong but most people can't because I've had a lot of people that has say a hundred that ain't [ __ ] I ain't got I'd do a thousand I'd do 500 and then they'll take like 10 or 15 of a real actual tested gummy and number uh gonna be [ __ ] up so I don't want to hear that [ __ ] so you know but don't get me wrong some people's tolerance is stronger than that [ __ ] you know cuz I also know that because my tolerance is like probably 40 54 where I like my high to be and if I wanted I could go 60 70 and still be like oh I wouldn't like out there but I could see people being over 100 but my point is you give them up like as a try on the dole singing it yo [ __ ] is to hide I think you need to take a month like a break if your tolerance is too goddamn much so anyway in Tunisia's ah let's see you got twenty gummies in here so I can say it's 100 milligrams one gummy is a serving and so you're looking at 23 servings in this [ __ ] no I'm sorry so many free calories per gummy okay when you're looking at the fat to zero fats about six grams of sugar and I mean six rounds of carbs and four grams of sugar so if you're on a keto diet this definitely is not the one for you and if you are vegan this is not for you or vegetarian this is not for you and the reason for that is because this does have gelatin in it which is weird though because the main ingredient is going to be agar but then they put gelatin in it so you could have just stopped with the agar instead of putting the gelatin in it and this is why I say this for companies that'll do this I give you when I come into the dispensary and they'll ask hey do you have any vegan gummies right that's understandable I've never remember you might have had a [ __ ] come in and say do you have non vegan gummies even make sense so the average person I'm talking probably 95 plus percent of people do not know the difference between a vegan gummy and when it comes to the taste so if I was a company I would just make all my [ __ ] vegan because it don't matter who will eat it because now it can get to anybody because no one's looking for the gelatin the market is not looking for the gelatin so I would just change that up if I was you [ __ ] because they have some that are vegan and those are good and there's no difference in the taste so to me they might as well just do all of them as vegan so I don't know why they only do a couple of women beginning some of them not but that's that so the other dope thing with this company is that they do them in sativa indica and hybrid so I like that because now you can get a little specific with your filling and your effects of [ __ ] and some companies stick to just doing this shit's hybrid which i think is it I think it makes sense because you know if the person walks up and that's the only gummy there some people would not [ __ ] with it if it's in the car and not [ __ ] wouldn't fit sativa but if it's hybrid they're like all right let's go [ __ ] it let me get it so I see the positives of that however the ones who are able to beast like specific admission I see there should fly off the shelves way quicker then a hybrid ones so this one right here is a cran a crammed pomegranate punch weird [ __ ] I don't know but it did taste good and the other cool thing with this is that it's enhanced nano molecular technology that they put in here in gummies and what man no molecular means whoa I don't even understand how that makes it react faster because it makes it react faster but what that means is that's just like a way of like I guess you could say measuring like how the speed of your molecules changing inside of your body so I think what's happening here is that they've sped up the process somehow of making the molecules in your body change for you to feel that humming um it's scented at two hour waiting game these [ __ ] is like probably 20-30 minutes if that like I got to give it to a one what was it last weekend for some reason I couldn't sleep welcome to 1:30 was up like a [ __ ] and I had to go rock climbing at like 10 o'clock or so I was tired as [ __ ] didn't want to go because I hadn't had any sleep whatsoever so I took ten milligrams of this [ __ ] and this [ __ ] was like a six hour energy drink like it was dope it really worked there was no crash I was like goddamn that [ __ ] is pretty bomb and so I like that versus that two hours you don't know when is gonna kick in type of filling cuz I've had that [ __ ] happen before once and some edibles cup but god I took the [ __ ] because it took so long for dumb [ __ ] to kick in I'm sitting there and I'm like mm-hmm hey y'all see that leprechaun run by look how things are turning out of nowhere you forgot you took some [ __ ] so uh I like these because they react a lot quicker so I definitely say give these shits a try now let me show you what they look like they like in little coin shapes and they are gluten free for all you gluten-free [ __ ] out there so it's a little sugar sprinkles on top of it mm-hmm so I'm fine and taste of them are really good no no she was bomb man actually there's really really good so it says that the candies Awards I never saw this really the winner most accurate formulated edible I guess that you mean it's pretty consistent and what they're doing in it I guess it's on mark of what is supposed to but yeah I got a really say my Anisha it's a pretty dope and another thing is some people don't like it we on 5 milligrams per they like oh how come I can't get nothing stronger it's still a hundred milligrams in the package whether I gave you 10 10 milligrams or 25 milligrams it's still the same [ __ ] amount and I personally like when they can chop it down like that because first of all some of these gummies are just good goddammit and I like that [ __ ] so I like to be able to eat more than one and that's one thing the other thing is you have more control over your dosing so let's say you want to go 25 instead of going 20 or 30 like 20 is not enough but 30 is too much so you just want to be at 25 I ain't the one for biting the [ __ ] in half and then putting that [ __ ] back you got me [ __ ] up I don't think that smart I don't think that's a sanitary I think this is like a nasty bout [ __ ] you put that [ __ ] back into the bag with the rest of my fingers now you'll slime it and touch the other ones he you nasty so for me I like to go put five milligrams and so I can like micro dose my [ __ ] and I can have more than one I will say this does give you a little bit of after cannabis he tastes but who gives a [ __ ] it's [ __ ] candidates like I hate when people be whining over to flavor like my Adeline fat and in my mind I'm like I would like to taste the vodka but I'll still take a shot I know you know like oh I just love that case well you say you like the taste of survive

chronic leaves and [ __ ] take the tents guys damn it but even with that being said it's really just a good good gummy but you do get a little bit aftertaste a little bit weak but anyway so definitely I say [ __ ] these if you find these [ __ ] I say get them I'm gonna ask the the company when I see them why they don't just do it all it just you know Eggar and just make them all plant based versus doing the gelatin I say this ain't no like oh go on and be vegan and about that this is literally just to me from a company standpoint it'd be like if I was only in the company I would just make it where I know everybody can get it but I wouldn't even promote them as being safe vegan I would just put them out on the shelf and let them be what they are so that would be me if I was the one doing it but anyway that's the end of this video I hope you guys enjoyed it like I say have you seen these [ __ ] make sure you get them and before you get out of here make sure you subscribe and hit that

[Music]", "6J9aM0Gh0iE": "[Music] and welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and it's old-school today guys cuz we are taking a look at an edible just like good times good times I mean old times but the old times aren't necessarily good times anymore because here in California we are fully in the new recreational world which includes this ridiculous hundred milligram cap on edibles not just that but makes absolutely crazy packaging requirements for all edibles here in California so what edible are we talking about that is ridiculous today what we are gonna take our first look at Plus gummies that's right another gummy review I normally tell you to avoid the gummies but I have heard a lot of good things about Plus and I am a little curious I'm always hoping to find another gummy I like cushy punch or flourish or Tiki killers that's actually worth something so I'm definitely looking forward to reviewing these plus gummies first thing you're gonna notice is how crazy this packaging is so here it is here is our plus gummies I believe they are sour blueberry blue in case you don't know is objectively the best flavor of everything if there is a multitude of colors and blue is available always go with blue because blue is much like a like a law of thermodynamics or whatever the case may be blue is always the best fruit flavor even though I don't know of any naturally-occurring blue fruits other than blueberries and blue tasting foods are hardly ever blueberries usually blue raspberry or something it's always the best trust me on this though so we have a sealed bag with you know all these insane requirements on it batch number this that and the other I mean it's great because it has all of those wonderful serving sizes and ingredients and all the testing results all this stuff you know I like seeing but it's a bag and then a fancy 10 on the inside I think all edibles now have to be bagged in addition to whatever kind of thing holds the edibles they have to have these sealed maggots it's insane it just boosts up the cost because this uh 100 milligram 20 piece edibles so I believe it's 20 gummies each worth 5 milligrams of THC cost me 20 bucks at my dispensary which is outrageous of course but that is the world we now live in and we shall review it as if it's the world we want to live in who knows I don't know what I'm saying I know I'm sad I'm disappointed that the edible world has changed so much and so for such and in such a shitty direction over the past year but let's stop the bitching and get straight to the review of the plus gummies cannabis infused sour blue berry so we're gonna open up the first layer of the packaging here it looks like it's got a little tear thing nice Oh and then then we got our second layer the zip sealed bag on side of the tear bag and then we gotta figure out how to open this the childproofing I think you ground push down and that breaks the seal yes there we go so second layer of security through now we're finally to our chin on the inside and to the gummies in here ah so here are our blue raspberry or blueberry gummies whatever they call it blue flavored the best 20 gummies in there give it a smell oh definitely a cannabis e odor which is not a bad thing I I'd like to know that there's some cannabis in these but also a hefty flavor and aroma of blue but certainly in a cannabis aroma there as you can see just a bunch of little squares dropped one there and let's pluck it into our mouths but before we do in case this is your first week to review the way they work when we do edibles we reviewed the whole experience I'm gonna eat all 20 of these gummies and then I'm gonna come back to you guys in about two hours to actually let you know how I'm feeling because it's you want to know how have it tasted like [ __ ] but you what you really want is it gonna get you [ __ ] up it's gonna get you high are you gonna get what you paid for it and that guy's is what you need to stick around for but first the taste test so here we go first cube in the mouth um very spongy gummies very very spongy almost hard to bite into because they're so Airy um a surprising cannabis taste them it's not awful but there is a 4 what is 5 milligrams of THC in these cubes definitely a cannabis taste to it but the blue the blue sciency flavor counter sex but if you don't like cannabis taste maybe you don't stick with these because you're gonna taste it again not terrible not overwhelming but it is surprisingly noticeable for what is just 5 milligrams of THC so guys I'm gonna eat me about what 16 more of these and I said I'm gonna eat me which is very back woodsy and folksy way of saying I'm gonna eat the rest of these so guys I'll see you in about two hours I'm gonna scarf these down and I'll let you know then if they're worth your money or not so thanks for staying tuned this far sticking around this far sorry guys this is really my second video back here on weeds and this will probably be another video between season 3 and between season 2 and season 3 so forgive my rustiness see you guys in two hours thanks for sticking around 2 hours since I have had the plus cannabis infused gummies looking at the camera for the first time now since coming back the fuse but I also see now I'm saying the word let's just start over one more time BAM I'm back guys it has been 2 hours since I had the plus cannabis infused gummies and I think there was an even yeah it says create on there as well there are a lot of nouns and adjectives and verbs on that packaging I'm really not even sure what it's called I'm just gonna call it plus gummies plus gummies uh guys I am genuinely pretty impressed uh for a gummy and for a hundred milligram edible this brought the heat um I'm not outrageously high but I am at like maybe a 6 somewhere in that range which is way higher than I expected it to be after a hundred milligrams and especially after a gummy I am pretty pleased with this now that is in the relative scale compared to you know this new world of edibles because this is a very expensive product you don't get a lot for your money here compared to the old world but in this new world this is a pretty good little solution um I found myself not maybe quite as high as if they were like akarova or a Kanaka mini cookie situation but for a gummy and for how much less you have to eat then which is very important to me you have to eat a [ __ ] ton of those cookies from like all you know Pete's and Korova and Kanaka all those ones you just mentioned you have to eat like 20 of those you know many cookies to get the hundred milligrams the gummies here were a hell of a lot more manageable that 10 was no problem to eat by myself I didn't didn't feel like a gluttonous badass after consuming that whole thing at all so really really pleased with that aspect um have a cannabis taste for sure but not awful um I didn't feel like retching after eating that not even close there was a cannabis taste but it was not the primary taste and again didn't have that just incredibly bitter kind of almost you know a cynic that Pacific we've tasted no no just the taste is there but then again for as potent as these came you know turned out to be you would expect that so guys this is a a nice win I think I'm I'm pretty impressed with Plus cannabis infused gummies and then also that were to create for some reason on there as well so I'm really happy with this I think I'll be reviewing some more stuff from plus in the future and if you see these in a dispensary near you and you guys want to eat all of something to get the hundred milligrams Jesus it's it's almost easier to recommend this then which is hard to say which is hard to believe actually then like the Kanak o or the kirova because it's just such it's so much easier to do and they're they're sort of equivalently priced you don't get quite as high but it's it's it's easier to it's easier to manage for sure so really surprised me on this one guys and what the [ __ ] let's just shoot the moon here guys I'm gonna throw a cherry on top - my little cherries on top here just little things I like to add that aren't necessarily we related something you can just do to enjoy throughout your week and I'm just gonna throw this one out because I am having an ever-loving blast playing spider-man on the ps4 from insomniac holy [ __ ] guys it's so great to see insomniac get this win I assume this game it's going to be an amazingly huge hit it seems to be it's only a couple days since it's been out but reception seems to be great and it seems to be doing really well sales wise I'm so happy for insomniac I love these guys since the ps1 days back in like Spyro loved them on the ps2 days Ratchet and Clank so my favorite you know 3d action platformers ever even love the resistance franchises back on the ps3 days and then they have been one of the greatest VR developers as well and I'm a big big fan of VR so you know what [ __ ] it I'm going to this endorsement is not for spider-man which is an awesome game I am having an utter blast with it it doesn't rewrite the rules anyway it's it's not a you know changing the genre it's just a hell of a good video game you know it's not rewriting anything but it's it's wonderful I'm having a blast with it but instead this cherry on top is just for insomniac in general they make great great games they've been making great great games for like 20 years I love them as a studio I'm so happy to see them having this huge success with spider-man so insomniac you'll never see this video but great job guys really proud of you and that's gonna do it for this cherry on top and that's gonna do it for this review what a great time we had great gummies that were so good here's an extra piece of packaging we had [ __ ] spider-man and insomniac on our cherry on top woohoo this guy's has been a [ __ ] good review let's just acknowledge the fact that everything went aces this time which doesn't often happen so great job plus great job insomniac and great job weed thank you so much for watching this review it's gone way too long and I will see you guys on the next one peace", "hFAmvbrX07E": "well hello everybody welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of that crazy mixed up scary overwhelming place you call your dispensary today good old-fashioned classic ass episode of wheats which means it is an edible review my favorite kind of review if we're being honest love me some edibles and one today that i've got uh high expectations for no pun intended uh it comes at a premium price and it comes from a relatively um experienced well-known player in the field but one uh one of these players that is known for their cartridges not their edibles but they are branching out and so who is that that is heavy hitters that's right guys we are taking a look at the gummies uh now out from heavy hitters uh those are the fine folks that make really really nice um premium thc cartridges we've reviewed a couple of them here on wheats like them quite a bit uh and now they are making their own gummies that they say are ultra potent um there are some curiosities with this here first of all it says that they are five 20 milligram pieces which is a hundred milligrams what it's supposed to be uh it's just another sort of indication of how [ __ ] up the labeling is and how nothing really matters with labeling um because technically it's supposed to be everything is supposed to be uh at most or minimum 10 doses of 10 milligrams but this says five 20 milligram pieces well but then they get away with it by showing you actually on the back uh that even though it says they're five uh 20 milligram pieces oh sorry it's right on the front it does say two 10 milligram servings per piece so it's kind of very disingenuous to advertise it that way but whatever um we do have everything we want to see on our packaging here nutrition facts lab testing results showing our 100 milligrams of thc um and uh ingredients all that great stuff i'm not sure i've ever heard of a agar agar before it's one of the ingredients uh this is the strawberry flavored it's free of all the things you would hope it would be free of your glutens your dairies and your nuts um so you know if any of those things need to be free for you this claims that it is free uh and as i said this is at a premium this is an expensive edible uh at the dispensary i go to the gummies usually range in the about 15 16 range this comes in at a premium for 20 bucks uh so the heavy hitter's name uh given a little extra premium on the price let's hope it's going to be a little bit premium on the product so uh let's go ahead and open it here does have some opening instructions on the back i find those always to be those pictograms that show you how to open these child proof uh bags are very bad i think um usually they're not too bad it's usually about actually the trick is opening the bag beneath the zipper as opposed to above the zipper is the trick for most of these originally you know you rip the zipper anyways what does it matter um i just think the iconography of those things is terrible so here we go here are our uh 20 milligram pieces excuse me are two 10 milligram pieces i guess it is nominally scored as such does smell like strawberry and of course like all of our wheats reviews the way we do it i'm going to do the entire product i'm going to eat all 20 not 20. all 100 milligrams of heavy hitters strawberry gummies uh and then about two hours after i have that last one i'll come back to you guys and let you know exactly how we're feeling let's go ahead and try our first of five right here for you hmm wow that is a tasty gummy that is a very tasty gummy i like the gummy a lot almost zero weed taste i mean i'm really looking for it there on the aftertaste not not much i mean that is a gummy i would be very happy to eat uh just uh out of boredom and anxiety like all gummy candies should be consumed but yeah that's that's that's great um a shockingly shockingly uh devoid of cannabis taste which you know hopefully is gonna be a huge positive if these get me as high as their ultra potent label suggests we shall see look that sugar off my fingertips well we're two-fifths of the way there i've got three more of these to go i'm not gonna gorge myself right now i'll have these over the next i usually like to do this over about the next half hour to hour or so and then two hours after that last one actually that is not 100 true um what i'm gonna be doing is doing these next three on a live stream with you guys as soon as i wrap up this first half of this review i'm gonna save these three i'm gonna be doing a live stream hanging out with you folks saying hi getting high with you and at the end of that live stream i'll come back and give you my wrap-up thoughts but that's just a little pitch to you guys let you know we do the live streams now and i hope you will join us for those in the future regardless if you do or not we will be back to tell you if these heavy hitters strawberry cannabis infused gummy are worth the heavy hitters premium price until then stay healthy and stay high my friends see you real soon bye-bye welcome back to weights everybody looks like a dog might be joining us welcome back tweets guys it's been about three hours a little over three hours since our journey started with the heavy hitters strawberry cannabis infused gummy and the dog is still coming in hello dog uh and i am very happy to say and especially if any of you had watched the live stream i did while enjoying this review these are quite good uh these are a premium product at a premium price but i gotta say they do land in that top tier uh echelon of gummy edibles i am very high i'm very pleased with my high uh quite impressive with these and that's not to even mention as a taste which um these are among the best tasting gummy edibles i've had especially for as potent as they are um really happy with it the only downside is that price uh these are more affordable or excuse me more expensive rather than most of the gummy edibles out there uh but you know i i uh some of it may be just uh some psychology of uh wanting it to be more expensive more potent because it's more expensive but if you hear me rambling it seems like it may actually work i don't know might be more than just psychological tricks i really enjoyed it really enjoyed it heavy hitters strawberry hundred milligram gummies can i get a big old thumbs up from me if you can find it and if it's not that much more give them a shot for sure so speaking of premium products uh i want to share with you guys a little cherry on top a little something extra that you can enjoy that's not necessarily weed related that's like let's do something a little premium we're going premium edible let's go premium cherry on top what does that mean i don't know that's kind of a dumb thing but what i do mean is go premium on something and really what i mean by that is get rid of ads on something hulu spotify apple music whatever it is that you use that has an ad subsidized version pay to get rid of ads ads are terrible they're the worst i don't think you even realize how hey you're on youtube pay for youtube premium get rid of ads eat [ __ ] the music stuff who gives a [ __ ] who gives about anything else just get rid of ads live your life with as few ads as possible it's not until you start to consciously remove advertisements from your life that you realize how pernicious and awful they are so this cherry on top is a premium service of your choice and this review is a premium product heavy hitters strawberry that tree on top was really abstract but you know what i mean pay for something you'll be happy you did and that guy's is going to do for this chair on top that's going to do it for this review that's going to do for everything here on wheats i thank you so much for watching as always stay high stay healthy and we'll see you guys on the next video were", "ifjcIiolSS8": "[Music] what's up everybody welcome to the channel today we're going to be making cannabis gummy bears so let's get into it [Music] so the first thing you want to do is measure out your cannabis i'm going to be using seven grams of cannabis to make my gummy bears [Music] all right guys i got my seven grams of cannabis so now i'm going to put this in a mason jar and the carpet all right guys so now i'm going to decarb our cannabis for about 40 minutes and the oven temperature that i'm going to be using is 240. [Music] so all right guys so while your cannabis is the carving measure out your coconut oil so for this recipe we're going to be using a quarter cup of coconut oil i'm going to be using coconut mct oil to make my gummy bears so even though we're going to be using a quarter cup of coconut oil i'm going to measure out a half a cup of coconut oil because we're going to lose some of that coconut oil during the infusing process so just keep that in mind all right guys my cannabis is now the carb so now i'm going to add our coconut oil to the mason jar now i'm going to add a teaspoon of lecithin to my mason jar all right guys so now we're going to do is put this in a pot and let it simmer for about two hours add your pot to the stove [Music] add your mason jar now let it simmer for about two hours all right guys so i've been over two hours so now we're going to filter out our cannabis [Music] all right guys my cannabis coconut oil is now done so now let's start working on the cannabis gummies so before we start working on our gummies i'm going to spray my gummy molds with this non-stick cookie spray all right guys so now what i'm going to do is put my pipe on the stove and now we're going to turn the temperature on low [Music] so now i'm going to add in my water i'm going to be using 2 3 cups of water [Music] guys what i actually recommend you to do is turn your stove on like medium heat just so it can speed up the heating process and then once my water get kind of hot i'm going to reduce the temperature back down to two and then add in my cannabis oil and then all of the other ingredients so um so that's what i'm gonna do all right guys so i let my temperature stay on medium heat for about two minutes and now i can see the water is starting to boil a little bit so now what i'm gonna do is reduce the temperature back down to low [Music] all right so now we're going to do is add the candle oil [Music] now i'm just going to mix it together now another thing too guys usually water and oil wouldn't mix but that's why i added the lecithin to my can of oil so if you already have kind of oil made and it's not made with lecithin at this point i would add a teaspoon of lecithin so just keep that about all right guys so we're going to keep the temperature on low and i'm just going to let the water and the wall incorporate together all right guys my mist is fully incorporated so now we're going to add the unflavored [Music] gelatin [Music] and just mix it together so i'm just going to mix for about 2-3 minutes i want to make sure everything is incorporated all right guys so now we're going to do is add in our pack of [Music] jello [Music] all right guys so now we're going to do is add our mix to the mold all right guys so once you finish filling your modes put your bows in the freezer for a few hours [Music] all right guys so been about four hours so now we're going to remove the gummy bears from the mood so now what i'm trying to do is just remove some of the extra gummies from the gummy bears if that make any sense so so this right here i'm going to strip that from the gummy bears just to make it look a little bit better [Music] there we go [Music] all right guys my cannabis gummy bears is now done to my left is the medium-sized gummy bears and to my right is the small size gummy bears i personally like the medium size better but what i'm going to do is leave the link for both sides in the description below but um thank you for watching this video don't forget to like share and subscribe [Music] peace [Music] you", "KVKmLQ4HwZ0": "hi everybody so today I'm going to be doing a review on the medicated hard candies this one is great so it's a hundred there's the 100 milligrams of THC right there it's from cannabis no I did the blue raspberry one before and I I didn't taste blue raspberry at all so hopefully this one tastes like grape I'll take them all why not so open and all these flippin things I can never okay always stuck together but it's not just so like I'll show you what they look like Thanks so they look like this like usually come like this these ones are because of the heat but they they come like this so they're 25 milligrams each you get four blocks which equals the hundreds milligrams I'll just a little piece so they look I broke it off as I was talking they look like that just little little cubes so it tastes like a little bit like grape and that was probably add I can taste the grape in these okay I can still taste the the THC but overall the grape flavored hard candies from Canada's mom are good that's like sometimes you get a little bit of THC and the rest of time it's grape so it's just about 6:00 p.m. right now this usually takes like an hour and a bit to kick in usually I'll be back alright told you guys know when it kicks in you know all the good stuff but so what I'm gonna do actually cuz it takes so long I'm going to roll a joint and I'll smoke that while I wait for this to kick in and it should be decent ah-ah-ah I'll really join up and smoke that and come back and let you guys know [Music] all about the hard candies from cannabis no okay I'm back and as you can see this stuff has kicked in so I smoked it what I told you guys I was going to roll the joint I smoked the gorge and if you want to see that part you'll have to go and watch the video before mine or yet before mine in its video I smoked it so I took I took this at 6 and I want to say like around seven ish I could start to feel it and it was like oh this feels good and then so then I was like you know what I'm gonna wait a little bit just to see if anything is different or so I waited and I was like so lolling around because it's 8:30 right now and this stuff is I didn't realize how strong the scats and like you feel good but you don't want to do anything like you're like everybody I would recommend you take a shower cuz the shower feels good if the reason I took the showers because I wasn't feeling very well and cuz I just kept on getting stronger and like I tried to sit down and relax and that didn't help and then I was getting like these pains like it was like really really deep into like that the area where sometimes it's painful anyways and yeah like I didn't feel well so I took a shower and that that helped okay I feel like better like I don't feel like I'm gonna throw up cuz that's what I felt like I'm not really sure why but like if you were to do this at somebody else's house um you might as well bring like your pajamas or something cuz I think you wouldn't be leaving yet BRE thirsty on this this is a this isn't oh my [ __ ] like this is really good get in cannabis Mel cuz their stuffs good yeah you really don't feel like doing much like um you're in the shower for like a long time and it's like really hot so that you know that feels good whatever but then it gets to the point that there's like too much Steve in there so you know whatever and then you just feel like doing like nothing but you may want to find like a good place to sit or lay in watch TV or just think about things or just really do nothing I wouldn't recommend like reading a book cuz I don't really think you'd get far you me at this point in like I'll keep busy but like if you were to read a book I think right now I'm like if you started to you would you wouldn't get very far like you would you would have I could forget just talking about oh okay if you're reading a book like you may get maybe ten minutes and then you probably fall asleep because this stuff makes your eyes like really heavy like they just like they feel like heavy hit down here like I think anybody could tell that you were high because there would be no hiding that one not only hungry or anything thirsty yes but like I'm not hungry or anything so that's good because I think if you were to eat a lot on this right now just because I mean probably like not feel very well like you'd probably throw up or something yeah and the grape um the grape flavor yeah I think it's good I so far that's the only one that I've had actually tasted like what it said cuz usually like I say I could just taste the THC in it oh I am so thirsty what's relaxes you I find to like your I think if you had like sore muscles you know from doing whatever running or I don't know just it kind of like eases everything like it just kind of like your muscles don't feel all like like in a like in a ball like however like that they feel more like you know just like they're just relaxed so if you have pain regarding that this would take it away if you have like just general aches and pains this would be also the stuff that you would like to sit down to like this is the stuff that if I would like to be sitting on a porch and like in a porch I say in on Auto Parts I hope to god I didn't say invited yes sitting on a porch like you know like the farmland type of stuff I can't like a great big it's like I'm just meadow way out there and you can just sit in your rocking chair and just look out into the meadow um this would be the stuff to do it on because you may find like it would be peaceful because you wouldn't be around like neighbor you wouldn't have neighbors and stuff and I think that would be something good for people to experience you may find like a peace with yourself or something like that I don't not really sure so just walking away yeah I don't even I don't even know what I'm gonna do but I have to stay busy because I will fall asleep everywhere looks so comfortable yeah you're not like this high isn't getting any like lower whatever it's not decreasing it's just there like it's it's just there where like no matter like you tried to think it off or just like it's just there like your whole everywhere your whole body is high I guess which is a little weird and I never thought of it like that but I guess so right because that's so I don't know unless it I don't know maybe I just want to talk about stuff I can't um what else what else does this make you feel like doing mmm if you had a lot of time on your hands and you wanted to redecorate your say living room or something the base would be the stuff to do that because you'd be so concentrated on how you know everything looks and how blends in together and stuff like that this is like the stuff that I will say to that you would want to say if there was like one Christmas thing that you did by yourself you know I don't think putting up the tree would be that but if it could be maybe you'd anyways or whatever this is the stuff that you would want to want to do it on because you'd be doing that but then you have like a lot of thoughts just about things and hmm I don't remember what I was talking about so I will have to start I need a subject which I have no idea what it is you feel kind of like exhausted on this like you just you know such a hard day Wayne you did have a hard day but if you didn't have a hard day this stuff makes you feel like you had like just an exhausting day that's good seeing them like like now like it's getting closer to 9:00 and you're hungry like it's a little bit there now but it's not like you need to like be something really good and you're you may want it but then you may wait like Oh see I told you it makes you I feel tired and your eyes really worried I couldn't imagine doing like anything real like like I know there's people hide like drink and drive and I know there's people that do other drugs and drive including lead or edibles and whatever but I don't know why you would drive when you feel like this I mean yeah you would be cautious but I don't know I just I don't know I to me that's not a very smart thing to do but you know just my opinion and um so anyways it's an oh my [ __ ] that's what it feels like to me that's like a whole review of it right there you get it at cannabis no I the package is not here but it's the medication hard candies grape yet four cubes and it's each cube is 25 milligrams of THC um makes you feel like doing nothing I'm very happy before like you get to this part I'm still happy I just feel more relaxed if that makes any sense I can relaxed and I'm happy relaxed not like well yes you can be pissed off and relax because that doesn't even make sense like I'm mmm I think I just need to somewhere I think so that's that's everything that's I don't that's everything I don't have anything else to talk about get a cannabis mom just charlie so that's it that's all bye", "agLIlV_RBrU": "hey there so i wanted to do another video again i got so many messages from people interested in these cannabis drinks like i knew that that was a market i knew people are interested in that but a lot of people messaged me so i just wanted to do some more videos and content on that and last night actually i was messaging these folks that work at tonic i was just messaging them through instagram they were so nice and one of them was telling me like that they have different ratios of thc and cbd so if i wanted a more cbd focused one to be like for the daytime they have that you know all kinds of stuff different flavors so along that i wanted to post another drink from them um this one is much much stronger so this is the tonic beverage that i got at the dispensary and this one's a hundred milligrams whereas the one i had yesterday was 25 milligrams cbd 25 milligrams thc so literally five times stronger so for me like knowing this information knowing that this is a hundred milligrams i just know right off the bat that i can't drink this whole thing in one sitting or one day to be honest um so what i've got here is it's really nice that if you can see there's like little demarcations to tell you okay if you want just a little bit this is how much you should take and it's like got lines to mark it and a little see-through strip so you can see you know where you're at so that was incredibly smart because i was like all right well i can just measure out how much i do want you know so i had 25 milligrams right here and i just poured that into a cup and really really like this so this one is a mango pineapple flavor there's no cbd in it so it's a little more psychoactive and personally like i like the more light milligrams of of thc because yesterday was a really nice experience for me i had that one tonic seltzer and then the rest of the night i drank regular sparkling water like perrier bubbly you know other things so that was like my night but if i had this i would want to make sure that i hydrated a lot lot more because it's like pretty concentrated you know like like you need some water to get that feeling good one thing that can happen with cannabis beverages and i've seen this happen is people will drink only this right they think it's an actual beverage like i'll just drink this this is almost like medicine you know it's like a flavorful nice way to drink it but you need like an actual drink an actual beverage so consider that and i tell people that with gummies too like yeah it's great to have gummies but buy yourself some just regular gummies and eat those too like don't eat gummies that are infused with cannabis is like a main snack like that's not their point but that's just my opinion so again if you buy this super super good but hydrate yourself um this i believe was 25 milligrams or i'm sorry 25 at the dispensary so 100 milligrams for 25 bucks so i would definitely buy this there's no taste of cannabis it tasted like uh like mango popsicle juice if that's a good description um so i was really surprised by that like whoever makes this and formulates this it has come a long way since the ones that i had like many years ago like on our honeymoon my husband and i went to colorado and had different you know drinks there and things like that and they did taste a little cannabis but this was also back in 2017 so things have really come a long way since then but yeah if you're interested check this place out it's tonic they're made by a company pts progressive treatment solutions and this one right here is called their pure thc infused beverage all right hope you have a good day bye my youtube channel is sponsored by the wonderful folks over at killcliffcbd.com that's k-i-l-l-c-l-i-f-f-cbd.com and you can

about splatoon - as fun as the game may be we're here to talk about marijuana edibles welcome to wheats guys the marijuana edible review show the one where we help you make sense of your dispensary and it's late at night and I'm ready for bed but I can't go to sleep so that's why I've got my cushy punch hundred milligrams here indica variety right here you know Ben so I'm hoping this is going to do the trick this is the second time of reviewed cushy punch I reviewed their TKO formula before 200 milligrams and found it to be pretty disappointing to be honest it did not do much for me since that time I have had several several people come up to me and say and I come up to me I mean comment online that's what I mean by that I've had simple people comment to me online saying give Chris you budget another chance sometimes that their formulation isn't as strong as others but when it hits it really hits so I decided to give it another chance and this seems to be the perfect opportunity when you're ready for some sleep with the indica variety so let's go ahead and open it up give it a taste and I'll come back to you guys in just about two hours after this and hopefully be ready for bedtime so let's find out if that's going to be the case or not okay so we've got our little jar here it looks like a little butter Pat actually a little pad of butter that you would get at our restaurant it's a hundred milligrams of THC in here I said before so let's go ahead and open her up and slope her to him and hopefully get ready for bed in the there we go there's our corner and there she has one big gummy pop her out for little rivulets they're not gonna care just gonna plump the whole thing I'm not it's not super great it's better than the like confused creations or those kind of edibles I've done as good as the flourish it sort of tastes more like a flourish type edible than the infused creations or at a pure or any of those two so it's better than those but it's not as good as the flourish company's in terms of taste so from here guys I'm just going to wait it out and hopefully in two hours I'll be ready for bed so I will see you guys then I'll see you guys in two hours to let you know how we're feeling because that's the way the wheats reviews work for you it's just going to be a couple of seconds so I'll see you on the other side of the break and for me it'll be two hours and I'll let you know how I'm feeling thanks for watching weeds guys and I'll see you soon peace mission accomplished I think and a slight redemption for cushy punch I am ready to go to bed quite sleepy at this point looking forward to hitting that pillow and I feel pleasantly buzzed for one hundred and milligram edible this cost me eight dollars at my dispensary all-in with all the discounts so you know pretty affordable 400 milligram edible and I do feel about about a six maybe five and a half or so so you know I'm not super super high by any means but you know definitely high noticeably high and ready to hit the sack so I'm ready to give cushy punch another chance try another one there edibles because they earned their Redemption with this one I just there 200 milligram did not see you know any stronger than this for sure maybe it's just as people have told me their potency seems to fluctuate up and down so maybe this was just a stronger batch but we'll review some more could you punch in a few to see if my opinion changes but for now this was a pleasant surprise and that's gonna do it for this review here on wheat skies and we will check you out on a future review peace", "8G0uy08bGNo": "[Music] welcome back so today well yesterday we went to see bd+ and got some new and goodies he decided to try out some new radicals there little gummies yeah squid yep and so there are 10 milligrams per serving and there's ting servings in each pack yeah and they are full spectrum hemp so it does have less than point 30 percent THC in each serving but for us today we're gonna take the little thing just because 10 milligrams of CBD with how much we have been smoking it and everything isn't gonna do much for us so for it to really work and has to give you the full effect how did you open pictures open [Music] and yes it for me I have the blue raspberry I have the Concord grape and what's interesting about them is like they're colored with natural products mine's colored with cabbage as far as like rubbish yes that's interesting okay so yeah it comes out as these little video gummies I don't know even how to do the individual servings personally you try it yeah you'd have to definitely cut it it does have like little marks to show you like where to cut but don't think that's easy to pull apart that's all good I just say you can definitely do the CBD in there but you can taste how much more natural it is is there seriously like a handful of ingredients there's coconut oil full spectrum hemp extra citric acid organic sugar and water I mean I teach a little bit I taste a little bit of the grape yeah yeah so way to go lunchbox alchemy yeah these are really good so we are at our local mall and we're just gonna kind of walk around I was wanting it to go into forever 21 to see if they have plus-sized stuff for me to try on and probably get some lunch since we have an 8 today it's up for this yeah but alright guys so we'll see you in a bit later so now we're like in the middle towards the end of our walk we've come to a few different stores yeah I still hopefully energetic yeah we walk it's more the only reason why we're stopping is because I decided to wear my combat boots today and they're happy on my feet so they're beautiful yeah you know it's all aesthetic and cute but I'm just not very cute oh yeah and right now we're about to go and Macy's and I'm gonna try to spray the fragrances to you know compare from my shop right yeah and we back in the cop sorry that the lighting is a little weird the sun's like in a weird spot right now but there you go yeah we're back in the car I got to finally smell my Viktor & Rolf bonbon so good I knew that had to be I've looked at what's all in it it's good just don't we're at the price I just can't spend there it's been sitting us to get a fragrance rate like that whenever I spray for you freely all day long he has to over all those gummies definitely helped highly recommend it tastes good - yeah they tasted really good the only thing that I think people are gonna have a problem with is the splitting just because it is a gummy so I think you've been cutting it will be a little difficult but the only way I can see possible is to cut into it Jonathas definitely from TV first for telling us about them yes and I will be linking in our description exactly where you can get it online on CD plus stop yeah I know let's say it's a we're delighting right now yeah thank you guys so much and we will see you next time and remember to spread the peace in that we do best my guys later [Music]",

we got some sour patch dummies right here 500 milligrams straight to the dome you know we're doing them so it's like I believe it's like 10:30 in the morning so I'm gonna be in candy in the morning but which I don't like but I feel like this is gonna be a really good high so I wanna like have it last the majority of the day instead of like taking it like later in the afternoon then falling asleep like halfway through the high or some [ __ ] I don't know got these for $25 from the not from like directly from a dispensary but from a friend of mine so yeah there's a pretty good price I think if you were to go to like a dispensary or something they usually charge $10 per hundred milligrams so kind of a good deal but yeah I'll show you these guys again know if you can see right down there 500 milligrams yeah 500 huh so yeah let's dig in so that's pretty cool just like I don't know little sour patch kids they don't look quite the same the sugar is kind of weird it looks wet and another thing it says on the back here five servings per container serving size one piece but there's like just way more than five pieces in that I don't know if you guys can see but we're taking doesn't taste like weed at all it's a lot better than that nerd rope I had that [ __ ] was like I don't think I like nerds I don't know but I did eat like a banana like I think an hour or 45 minutes ago just to sort of like activate my metabolite I don't know but oh yeah and something else I forgot like I figured like people would just figure did I do it that way but like I keep like I got a lot of comments on the last one I did like the nerd rope the nerd rope 400 milligram edible I think it was there were a lot of people that like just thought that video was like one video or like one time I think like I just got a bunch of like comments that were like you know edibles take longer than 10 minutes to hit and I was like well you really think I've like a weed Tube channel and I don't know the edibles don't hit immediately after you eat them so I mean I don't know I mean but just this isn't gonna be the whole video like I'm gonna check back in like an hour two hours whenever I start like really feeling high and that's gonna be me then later so alright cleared the whole bag we're out of these shits so I'm gonna check in and like last like an hour maybe two hours maybe three hours however long this takes to take effect yeah I'm gonna take one more head of this [Music] little baby hit but yeah I'll check back in with you guys about two hours or so so peace alright so check him back in guys it is now 2:30 so it's been about three or four hours and I am [ __ ] high I'm so high like I just feel like good and like cozy like I don't know in movies right now I'm on yes man with Jim Carrey shit's hilarious but yeah I just been chilling and I had two bowls of cereal but ya know how feelings [ __ ] good this is like holy [ __ ] this light that I have for the lighting like he's really [ __ ] bright yeah I would definitely recommend these who these things are [ __ ] dope they smacked me in the face cuz holy [ __ ] I'm I like him actually like I don't know I feel pretty good about him at least right now edible you know just kind of chill cuz yesterday I got like I drank so much like an I passed out I'm so tired and I threw up it was just like a horrible day so this just yeah it's a lot nicer everything like I don't know everything I look at like specifically focus on like looks very like clear and like clean but then everything else behind it is it like such an intense like a blur well yeah I'm just really chilling you know like this I like I said this is definitely a [ __ ] fire edible I [ __ ] with this i 100% recommend it but I'm other than that I have no idea what to talk about I kind of just want to know getting my [ __ ] back get in my bed and watch this movie so yeah I'll take one last rep I haven't been smoking too much we're hiding actually I had a couple reps of this like I think three hours in or so not too long ago he's dying but I did that because I was like kind of feeling the body high a little bit but I was just like nervous that it wasn't gonna be intense enough for whatever reason sometimes he sings some like a [ __ ] hit or miss but yeah so I smoked and then I like got really high and yeah I think I'm like getting maybe close to like the full effect I don't know how long this will last but I think usually the potent ones are the more potent the longer it lasts so maybe it's still building up but either way I'm just trying to chill out so I hope you guys are smoking I hope you guys enjoyed the video [ __ ] sour patch dummies stay high stay lifted stay quarantine stay clean and peace everybody", "egNB5MXTmmc": "[Music] hello squid the marijuana reviews show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking a look at another drink Dixie elixir that's hard to read as Dixie there di xi\u00e8 elixir there are half and half lemonade NT th C infuse 100 milligrams so I reviewed a lot of drinks here on wheats and I find them to be pretty good there's some really great ones out there cannabis quenchers awesome Jasper's amazing there of course some Dead's out there but on the whole I do like the drinks so I'm really looking forward to this Dixie elixir half and a half a pretty cool little bottle here it's got a wrapper on the outside I kind of like the idea is that the cap there at the top if you want a dose the cap is designed to help you dose appropriately helps you decide like you know oh what's 10 milliliters blah blah blah blah blah what's it what's a dose of course we're going to ignore that and just drink the whole bottle in terms of half and half I love me some Arnold Palmer's which is what a half lemonade half iced tea is love love love them so I'm hoping like this the drinks in terms of taste are all over the map sometimes they're really bad like as Aspen but that means they can produce excellent rewards like zest and sometimes they're not too bad but they often have this really bitter aftertaste and I find that to be pretty often the case with the drinks I'm having trouble getting it off which is you know par for the course for me we're almost there keep peeling this plastic layer off until we eventually get to the goods oh boy there she goes okay there she is all defrocked there's a little cap that you can pour it in so on the back we've got our ingredients and our nutrition information I sadly don't see any lab and testing results but that's okay we're gonna hope that it has 100 milligrams in here it says shake gently before consuming which is what we shall do I assume this opens like a childproof lid it does handsome looking bottle there down the hatch hmm it's okay definite cannabis taste to it more tea than lemonade taste it's not too bad um it's only eight and a half ounces so I'll be done with it in no time again there is a slight cannabis taste to it it's not as bitter as the cannabis quench reserves ASP but but it is there so if you really hate that cannabis taste you might want to pass on this one but for me I'm uh I'm I'm I'm David it's again it's not as bitter as some of the the other brands out there hopefully it means it's still gonna be nice and strong so guys I'm gonna finish this off and then I'm gonna come back to you in two hours like all of our reviews to let you know how this Dixie elixir has landed thanks for watching weeds guys and I will see you in just a bit peace [Music] Dixie elixir half and half and it's pretty good it is in the oh it got me to about a six I'm about a six right now 400 milligram edible that's not bad and one that only costs eleven bucks which I think I neglected to mention the first half I'm pretty pleased with it the taste was good for a drink it wasn't outstanding tasting and it didn't get me crazy high but overall it's a pretty good little product one that I'm pleased with if you pick if you see it at a dispensary near you and you're looking for a drink and they don't and you don't want to get completely [ __ ] up the Dixie elixir might be the product for you I think I might try another one in the future see how it goes for me but overall this is a it's gonna give them my own thumbs up for me not a not a ringing endorsement but but far from uh from a negative review so uh that's gonna do it for this review here guys a nice short and sweet one but before I go and share with you a little cherry on top something I can share with you guys that isn't necessarily we'd really did something I just love that I want to express to you guys and hopefully you will dig as well and this week uh it is going to be Silicon Valley yay there's a little Dinesh in a little guilfoyle now normally I'm very much against these little pop vinyls I think that's what they're called these things just seem like capitalism gone amok but well here becomes capitalism run amuck I think I got in flight two for $5.00 at Gamestop and I was like well III have to have a Dinesh and Gilfoyle so Silicon Valley uh-huh on HBO great great show by the legendary Mike judge of beavis and butthead and king of the hill and office space the movie so it's a great show about that Lampoon's Silicon Valley and I just culture hysterical in its fifth season right now on HBO check it out if you haven't I'm sure you've heard about it from people other than just me and that guys is gonna do it from the cherry on top and that's gonna do it for this review here on wheat thank you so much for sticking around to the very end guys and we will see you on the next review peace", "UfXchhtG5NY": "[Music] hello everyone and welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary we help you decide what products are worth your hard-earned dollars at your dispensary and which ones are utter junk and today we are talking about one of my favorite companies when we haven't had a chance to review a product from in a while because they haven't had anything new coming out but now thanks to the new regulations here in California that make edibles be a hundred milligrams max and ten milligrams per serving Korova one of my all-time favorites has come out with a brand new line here they have the Korova Saturday morning mini cookies ten milligrams per cookie at it for a hundred milligrams total so ten cookies in here at ten milligrams each it's a huge package it's so much bigger than their normal packaging which is crazy its its massive and it was only ten bucks but then again that's a bit that's more expensive than their one hundred and fifty milligrams cookies that they used to have that were just single cookies but it's big packaging because it is holding ten little mini cookies in here I really like the packaging it's very handsome I really quite like it a lot it's got the new props on there keep refrigerated bla bla bla bla bla but shows you know it's compliant with them new regulations and then here on the back it's got it finally has nutrition information corroded before I don't believe actually had nutrition information on their packaging but they do now and it's got like the ingredients and all that fun stuff on there and now they have this child resistant packaging that is very tough to open because I've tried opening one of these before and they're quite difficult to open especially if you've not encountered it before I'm super excited to try these it actually I've been wanting to review them for a while they've taken me some time to find they're not in available and a lot of dispensaries yet which is odd because you know supposedly next month is when these regulations take effect although I believe you have until July to like get rid of your old stock of stuff but yeah I assume you'll start seeing these everywhere soon but I've been wanting to review these for some time because I assume they'll be as ubiquitous as kirova in no time so here's that obnoxious child-resistant packaging you have to place one thumb in the middle of the zipper and place one thumb into the back panel zipper and pull gently apart it's easier said than done you know what I'm just gonna cut into it because I hate it I hate the child-resistant label packaging I'm a child I'm too down for it dumb child here we go here are the mini cookies ooh they're handsome quite like them aesthetically they look a lot like the full-size versions don't have very much of a weeds odor chewy and kind of crunchy but good nice pretty good very little canvas ace if any at all I'd like it just as much maybe even a little bit more than their 150 milligrams Saturday morning cookie it's great it's got the rice krispies in there good cookie good cookie taste it's a little bit chewier and crunch here than I was expecting it to be but it's not bad it's not bad not a bad combination at all i I'm not dreading having to eat nine more of these so guys I'm going to finish the rest of this bag off I've got a lot more to get through and then I will be sure to let you know how I am feeling because that's the most important part of the edible review process I'm probably about two and a half three hours or something on my way to go see a movie and as soon as I get out of there I will let you know how I'm feeling thanks so much for watching wheats guys and I will see you in just a bit peace [Music] alright guys I am back it has been two hours since I had the kirova mini cookies medical cannabis Saturday morning cookies 100 milligrams THC 10 cookies and I am more than pleased to report that kauravas unrivaled potency is in still intact this is a strong hundred milligrams in these 10 cookies here in fact my only complaint about it is and it is a complaint well I guess my two complaints there the packaging sucks I don't like this child restraint and packaging because I'm I'm stupid I'll fully grot to that and you know I'm not I'm an intelligent person but it's annoying it's hard to open even trying to follow the directions it's not like the childproof pill bottles that are very easy to take off that's a minor complaint the big complaint is it's a lot to consume for one person I know these are designed for 10 servings and they really are because it's a lot to consume it's I mean you can see how big this packages and it's packed to the brim with those cookies it's for our calories of cookies which isn't a whole lot but at the same time ten of those little mini cookies it's not a insignificant amount it certainly feels like more than one of the normal size but still I'm gonna recommend it especially for this new wave of products that are coming in that are going to be these ten milligrams servings of ten servings each this is probably going to be really great III heartily recommend it if you cannot find if the any of the other Korova still lying around if your dispensary is only prop to 1/5 compliant grab these you'll be happy you did if not go ahead and stick with the original batch because that's gonna do you better but but these are a fine replacement it's not the end of the world for edibles but you know it's not it's not going to be the same same world we remember anyways guys that's gonna do it for this review here on wheats I appreciate you watching thank you so much and we will check you out on a later review peace that's okay", "o9c3-FqnrVI": "what up YouTube it's me Rashad a couple of my subscribers they hit me up in the comments and never fight how do you make gummy worms and kool-aid I'm about to show you how the technique that I use to make Magnum worms just so I can understand how I make them come on let me show you out so in order to make you good mornings with kool-aid you're gonna need it a couple things you're gonna need some sandwich bags you eat this this this one right here just thing of kool-aid this container DV something works alright yeah I've been eating on this thing I know so it ain't gonna be a full amount but it usually makes about 23 bags when you bag them up and put a pin in there first things first is you want to wash your hands so before that wash your hands before you touch any air anything all right I'm a working man as well so you get another plastic bag and you you do it like this I'm gonna put ten in the bag that's how I do it alright that's four that's ten in the bag that quick alright then let me show you how I put the kool-aid in it you just get a scoop like this right you see it's kool-aid in here you get a scoop I don't have to be a full scoop and you never put a fluid after much and you go like that in this watch I have a link in the description if you want to find out about this watch it's a cool watch you get from Amazon well yeah that's all you put up again that's all you put up in there and then you rub it around like that and you go like this it's I get all the air out so you don't want it to pop and you don't you want to save as much space in your bag as possible alright so now that's cool when you put it aside if you're making a bunch of these what I did was I put 10 in the bag right I built up the whole bag 10 10 10 10 10 that's all artists anyone who's going out of here alright that's right all those dimmer ones were going I'll get the scoops and up I'll get the scoops like this and I'll pour them in the bags and then I'll tie them up like I said I'll put them all in the bag right I'll shake it up and I'll tie it up get the air out and inside the trip you gonna need some of these little kool-aid packets to make the great time you could experiment with other flavors but I've tried it a couple of times with other flavors and nothing that comes close to the great time alright like I tried orange and didn't taste right but you can try an experiment you pour the regular kool-aid in there right you see how much is in there it's only that much because I'm not gonna pour it on me good I'm not gonna make that me all right and then you pour this one in there and see how it looks pouring it in there but you don't want to pour too much of this kind in here because it's real potent like it's real sour and then you mix it like this right it doesn't have to get real purple but if it you don't want it to be too pink or it's not going to taste that great if that's a freakin word this is great it's not a word okay it's not going to taste very much like grape it is trooper this is to paint compared to that pink one that's purple when you see it that's the paint regular and that's the one mix and I'll just make a city anymore just because okay these are the normal gummy worms with kool-aid and hair are the great ones but more pinkish and grape ones look more purplish now when you leave them in your bag overnight it precipitates they like it'll be moisture in the bag but that's normal all right that's how you make them work the kool-aid I'm done subscribe the light fighters I got more videos coming out random videos technology videos this me blah blah too long this channel just show you how to do stuff you want to know how to do something in the comments come out over shot talk to y'all later see you on my next video another", "p6oKnG_sEwc": "[Music] hi welcome to diamond delight edibles my name is Liz if this is the first time you stopped by and for the rest of you guys welcome back thank you so much so somebody asked me a few weeks ago if I could do nerds ropes and to be perfectly honest had no idea what those work so I googled those little puppies and found out that they're a gummy candy covered in nerds who sew off my kitchen I went a little experimented little tickety-boo and look at what up I can make your it's ropes so I am going to bring this recipe to you so without any more in further babbling here let's jump right into those ingredients what we're going to need and then let's get these guys made alright so the ingredients that we're gonna need for our nerd candies so this recipe is basically my W candy recipe with the cooked syrup and the reason that we're using the Kochs syrup is is going to help with those candies to stick better than just using the gelatin one so with that set you're gonna need about three or four boxes of the large nerds or about seven or eight of those small ones that are the two flavored ones you're gonna want one to two boxes of cornstarch and don't worry you can reuse it we just sift it up and you can reuse it over and over and it doesn't go bad so not a problem plus it's not expensive you're going to want two boxes of the small gelatin the three amps or the 85 grams two of those want three tablespoons of unflavored gelatin or three or three packages of the Knox a quarter teaspoon of kaurav cannabutter and we're going to melt this 1/2 a cup of either kanna syrup corn syrup or you can use inverted syrup if you don't like invert sugar if you don't like corn syrup and we're going to split that quarter in our gelatin part quarter in our candy syrup we're going to need 1/2 a cup of we're going to need 1/2 a cup of liquid so I like to use the kool-aid jammers or the kool-aid waters ones because it gives it extra flavor than just using water and it's pretty much like using water so you don't have to worry about things going bad so these are great to use so I'm going to use use a half a cup of this to bloom our gelatin and a half a cup for our mixture then for additional flavoring I know I feel I know these could be a little bit difficult to get is I use two tablespoons of drink crystals so I get these at the bulk barn Jurek from spring onwards they have me during spring in the summer during the winter they don't carry them or other box stores the stores may carry them otherwise you can just use the Lorena's oils if you want to add some additional flavoring but it's not really required because of all the nerds on it so it's not that big of a deal and that's everything that we need for the gelatin part for our cooked syrup we need 1 K 1 cup of sugar and again if you've got candace sugar you can divide that up a quarter cup of can of sugar to three quarters of a cup of regular sugar as long as you equal one cup of sugar it doesn't matter a quarter cup of water and a quarter cup of our corn syrup and or kit canister that's it for our syrup oops sorry and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid goes into our cooked syrup as well then for the glue that they that they used to stick on top technically they're nerds the Nerds use confection confectioners glaze unfortunately being in Canada wasn't the easiest for me to get but an alternative for an edible glue and glaze is to use tylose tylose powder and water so I'm going to show you how to do that and this is what you're going to need to this stuff a day before but it's super easy it just happens that time to do whatever it needs to do but it works great if you can't get the confectioner's late and for and then to make our clear to make our edible glue we're also going to need one cup of water that is all the ingredients that we are going to need let's get into that equipment there so there's a little bit of equipment this time so let's get into that equipment and then let's get these made alright so the equipment that we're going to need is a double boiler if you don't have a quote double boiler you can always just use a metal bowl that will fit securely into the pot and has enough room on the bottom for water without touching you're gonna need another small or saucepan a small medium saucepan for our syrup point you need a candy thermometer digital or the one that you hang on doesn't matter a couple of spatulas gonna need you're gonna need a pastry brush and I'm gonna use a funnel for putting it into our molds you can get these candy funnels or if your pot has the little specks on it and that will work as well or you can always put it into a measuring cup or something with a spout anything to make it easier to pour cause we gotta pour into some skinny guys offset spatula is something to be able to smooth out our corn starch and you're going to want to get some dowels so I got these at the dollar store in the craft section they're 12-inch by just slightly under a half inch size dowel so you want about half inch sized dowel by about 12 inches as I said dollar store craft stores usually how these pre-cut like so otherwise you cannot just buy one of those read it on once and cut up your own so we need basically one if you can is many has many dowels as you want to make ropes now this recipe probably makes around 10 to 12 I'm only going to do part of that today and the rest of the stuff I'm just gonna make regular gummies and I'll explain why when we get to making them all so if you want a bunch of those dowels a cookie sheet or doing them on and you want to line it with parchment paper another pan that we can use to press down the cornstarch with or something flat that's that's kind of heavy a drying rack and then another pan or something that you can use and we're going to put Phillip put the skittles in to cover them up later on once we get the glue on them so it makes it easy if you've got some kind of pan like that so basically all our equipment you know me I always forget something but let's jump right in and let's get these made so if you go and I'm using the tylose powder as your glues your edible glue what you're going to want to do is to bring one cup of water to a boil once it's come to a boil turn the heat off and then we're going to add in three-quarters of a teaspoon into into our boil water you're gonna whisk that around and you're gonna see it's gonna lump up and it's not all gonna dissolve it takes about 15 to 20 minutes for it to fully dissolve all right so my water's come to a boil I'm going to turn off the heat gonna remove that oh remember that thing that I always tell you I forget yeah it was the whisk one whit so we're gonna add in three-quarters of a teaspoon these are quarter teaspoons you want to kind of story sprinkle it around like so and then you're gonna whisk it and it's gonna stay lumpy a little bluffing like that for a while and every couple every two three minutes you're gonna come back and whisk it around and you'll notice every time you come back more and more will be dissolved and as I said it takes about 15-20 minutes for it to fully dissolve once it has you're going to put it into the refrigerator sorry you're gonna let it cool first then put it into the refrigerator overnight and the next day you're good to go and it lasts for up to six months so you can use this over and over not as well as for your any other projects edible food products projects that you have that you need glue fork so I'm just gonna continue to do that to stir that I'll show you once it is clear and next we're gonna make up our starch molds alright so here's my tylose my edible glue all clear now and dissolved so just gonna pour it into a jar and once that's cool I'm gonna cover that up put it in the fridge overnight alright so now we're gonna make our starch folds and starch molds are what they use in candy manufacturing so there's not a whole bunch of people on the line pop and they've silicone molds they use these huge place with corn starch they stamp in the pattern fill up the molds once they set the plate opens all the candies fall in Iraq all the corn starch falls to the bottom and they reuse it so we're going to make our own makeshift version at home so as I said you need about one to two boxes depending how large betray your you see because you do want it almost look for sickness of your cookie sheet whatever lip on that so carefully pour it into your pan and you want to do it on parchment paper because it's going to make it a lot easier when you need to put this back into the box as well as to get it thin too sifting and again you want to be very careful otherwise it's going to look like Scarface's come through your kitchen this stuff it gets messy again you want to carefully move it an offset spatula works really well so that you can move it and spread it out around your pan evenly so I'm just moving it around here so that is all trying to get it relatively all even so that our moles will all be about the same size and you want to have enough room as I said to be able to make them a little bit deeper there and you don't want to be going all the way to the bottom so once you've got it relatively smooth out gonna Mimi and stuff everywhere so what we want to do is to take another little piece of parchment paper and you want it to be able to fit over top doesn't all stick to our pan place it down on top and then use your pan to press down don't press down too firmly but a little bit just to get that compressed and the parchment will stop of the cornstarch from sticking to the bottom of your pan in defeating the purpose of trying to make a flat surface carefully pick this up so we're good like that there so now you want to take your dowels and that's why I said you want to try and have as many as you as you were going to make because your we're gonna press it down so you take the one with a your dowel and you press one down and rock it back and forth so that it makes a little bit of a wider crevice here or so it makes a little wider it up a little bit wider of a trench and then just leave it and then use your next one just go over a little bit button in half an inch or an inch and again you're gonna do the same thing gently press and work it down so the reason you say you want to use multiple dowels is if I go and I take this out if I took it out and push the next one in it pushes some of the cornstarch into the one that we just made so the multiple dowels will help you from avoiding that problem so I'm just gonna pull the camera in over top here so you can actually see it up close all right so it's that you just go over a little bit here from the other one about an inch is good and just gently roll it into place now if you don't have as many inch you're going to like you can see like I'd oh I'm now gonna take my first one so grab it from end to end with your fingers like so so that you don't interrupt your Bowl and now I can move that one there without interrupting that one and then the same thing carefully take this one and here how're we gonna get one of our box the Nerds I've just put them into a bowl or something for you to make it easy we're gonna fill up our little trenches here with our nerd on here a bowl here no jar from a bowl today and just grab some with your fingers and gently drop them fill out the trench chair you just gonna drop them along the bottom don't fully fill it up we just want to line the bottom of it and then anywhere where there's naked spots that we miss don't worry cuz we're gonna glue glue bunch on afterwards so going along do that my trenches removing the dowels grab them use your fingertips in the end to gently pull them up then once you're done filling up your molds there with nerds you're going to carefully place the tray into your freezer so we're gonna make our mold nice and cold nice and cold so when we drop our candy syrup it's gonna start to solidify and grab onto those candies really quickly but you want to be very very gentle because it'll fall easily and yeah you don't want to do this all over again so first case scenario you make a mess him if you have to redo it just to sift out your cornstarch and your nerds and just redo the process so the first thing that we want to do is bloom our gelatin so I've got 1/2 cup of and this has got to be cold but liquid needs to be called 1/2 cup of our I use the kool-aid jammer and then you're gonna sprinkle evenly on your gelatin all over the top and this is to prevent clumping and then you want to mix it in until it's all dissolved and while you're mixing it'll start to bloom and it should call right automatically kind of go to the texture of applesauce if it doesn't your gelatin is not is not very good it's lost its Jo so you don't want to add a little more or get new stuff so we're just gonna set that off the side until we need it God needs about five at least five ten minutes to bloom so the next step is going to be our gelatin side that we're gonna do you're gonna turn your heat on to medium low you're gonna boil a half a cup of your liquid so I used a half a cup of the cooling water pour that in and you're gonna stir to dissolve your jello and then just note for your double boiler don't forget to put your water in and also you your water should never touch the bottom of your pot so I said you just gonna stir this up until that just starts to dissolve and if you're using flavor drink crystals I this is where all added in as well so it can dissolve at the same time I add about two tablespoons as I said if not you can use the Lorraine's oil and you add that more at the end so we just stir this until it's all dissolved until it until it starts to dissolve then I'm gonna add in our corn syrup and our citric acid now that my syrup is mostly the sugars not have mostly melted I'm gonna add in 1/4 cup of my can of syrup or as I said you can use corn syrup or inverted sugar and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid and the citric acid and the syrup they are both for preventing crystallization well the can of syrups add a little extra but regularly corn syrup or the inverted sugar is to help prevent crystallization so again I'm gonna mix that stir that well until it's all combined and everything's melted together in the meantime make sure your can of butter is melted and you're going to get your hand blender ready to so we're gonna need that shortly and you're gorg um so now that our syrup our gelatin and that everything's dissolved now it's time to add in our can of butter and our corn gum so you're gonna take your melted can of butter throw her in mix that around just a little bit then we're going to use each ordered teaspoon of fargo and you're going to spread gently sprinkle it try and do sprinkle it evenly over the top please let it sit for just a moment get your hand blender and we're going to blender up [Music] so you're gonna let that blend that up for about probably about two minutes you want to make sure it's something it's a really wild ball supply then once you're done just let it sit for a couple of minutes for about a minute or two and see if any oil comes to the top raises to the surface and you'll be able to tell that the air the bubbles will start to dissipate and if there's any oil if it's not fully emulsified the oil will come up to the top and you will notice kind of little oil slicks if you do see any kind of little oil slicks just add a little bit more Gorica no more than about an eighth of a teaspoon and re blended with the hand blender until that's gone so you should have one uniform texture and then just turn off the heat on your gelatin mixture here there is enough warm water in in your pot here to keep your mixture liquefied now on to the candy side the candy syrup side so for our cooked syrup you're going to add in your one cup of sugar or I said or your mixture of sugar and can of sugar get add in a quarter cup of our can of syrup or corn syrup as I said use that inverted sugar and our quarter cup of water and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid mix those together and you can turn your heat on to high heat so you're just going to continue to mix stir this until it begins to boil once it starts to boil you're gonna stop stirring that and we're gonna cook it till two hundred and eighty degrees so now that it started boiling just do it's just start it just around the sides here I'm gonna stop stirring at this point and then I'm just gonna check my temperatures every once in a while till we hit two hundred and eighty degrees so I'm gonna need to check it right now because obviously we're not going to be there I'm gonna let it boil for a couple of minutes and then I'll check its temperature so I start my syrup has been boiling for a couple of minutes so I just want to see where it's sitting right now because we only use a quarter cup of water and we're cooking a high temperature it will get to the 280 very quickly so already at 270 almost there just after 2-3 minutes 280 once it hits your temperature pull it off and allow it to cool for until it hits about 240 so why I like to set it on a stone on natural stone like granite or any natural stone it helps to pull the heat out thicker or if you've got a trivet that helps as well so said just let that sit until it hits 240 all right so my temperature my syrup now is at the correct temperature it's down below just below 240 so now I'm going to and the reason you want to do that is if it's higher it's going to break your gelatin so we don't want to do that so now we are going to pour our gelatin syrup into our candy syrup if that well mixed well together and if you found that your candy syrup has solidified on the bottom or along the sides you can put it on to low heat just to melt that so you're just going to mix this for about a minute or two till they're both combined and make sure to get right on the sides it does like to harden up there see and once everything is all nice together and all melted well together we're going to treat our unflavored gelatin and I recommend kind of break it up into smaller pieces if you can plop her in there see this way again your syrup is not going to be too hot to break your gelatin and this way we get the gelatin all through everything kind of binds there both of those together so you're just going to gently stir that until the gelatin is completely melted so now here's a way that you can kind of give a kind of little pretest to know if your syrup is going to gel up well because on gummies were okay because we can always read about those but these a little harder having all the Nerds stuck to them so we want to get it right the first time just take your syrup take your spoon and allow it to drip off if it starts to solidify in midstream like it'll start to solidify and gel right up while it's dripping you're good to go if it continues to drip like mine is it's going to need more gelatin so what I'm going to do to make sure that that's going to work is I'm going to add another tablespoon of blooms gelatin so I'm just going to go bloom another tablespoon of gelatin in a quarter cup of liquid let that bloom and then add that in and that will take care of that problem there all right so I added one tablespoon of unflavored gelatin to a quarter cup of my cooling water and I bloom that for about five minutes and added it in and now you can see how much it's thicker and how it'll start to solidify find a mid stream and it'll it'll hold there that's how you should that's a kind of a quick test for you to be able to see if it's going to gel up correctly in your moles before you actually cast them so now we wait to pour it into my little funnel here well shoot and then just line up with your trench and you're just gonna fill up the trench I have to say this funnel makes it really really easy well I needs you then try to free pour it let's go just go along you fill up all your little trenches little cavities and then you take your Nerds actually found it's easier to pour and break from the box so don't bother putting them in a bowl it's just easier to pour them from the box just take off a little lip there so it doesn't get your way and just kind of squeeze it together so you have a little bit of control it'll all come flying out and then you just fill up the box alone and you just want to be gentle with it go easy because otherwise they'll come flying out and don't worry about all the excess that goes off into the cornstarch there we're gonna sift the cornstarch when we're done and we'll be able to retrieve all those I just give it a very very gentle pat you don't look like literally just feather touch it down there you go so we've got our ropes like that so you're gonna put them into the fridge for them to set up anywhere from about a half hour to two hours it can take for your gelatin to set now that our candies have set you're just gonna take them out of the starch mold here and just lay them on to a harsh line drying rack parchment paper drying rack and you're gonna set those out to dry overnight and I'm putting the start my topside is good with the amount of candies and stuff that are on it so I'm gonna I lay them with the starch side up and that's the main side that I'm gonna add any additional candies to that they need you the sec so I'm gonna let those set stay out overnight for them to dry before we apply our glaze all right so now why are candies for setting so you don't want to waste all that cornstarch and all those nerds that are stuck in there so you grab your um your corn starts with your parchment paper inches pull it up like so take a strainer take a strainer and pour it in a little neater than that and you're gonna slip your parchment paper paper back underneath and sift it back onto the parchment once you got all that all the cornstarch sifted through just drop your candies off into a hole here and then you can get your cornstarch box add your parchment again or back in the box and you're cute most of it and once your candies are dry take them off and just slip your parchment paper underneath it's just gonna catch the excess gonna catch the excess glaze so I've done this recipe a couple times using the tylose so I would recommend out of the two I would recommend going with the glaze and the reason is the tylose because we use water it makes them very well make sure candies very wet it does dry completely and that's not a problem but they are very wet they're very sly mean it makes them difficult to kind of work with and sticking the extra candies on so I think the glaze would be a lot better this you can definitely use if you can't get the glaze but I think they set the glaze would be better so a little bit so what you can do is you're going to grab your pastry brush dip her in and just kind of take off a bit of that access and you're going to go along and you're gonna dab it on your candies on your rope and you want to dab it you don't really want to brush because it will take the color off of the nerves their wallet water soluble so I think again using the glaze would help that with that issue once you get it get it blazed on you can fill in the little spots that are miss then just gently put them on and don't try and bustle it too much because I said it'll just kind of slip and slide off but just leave them like so and again we're just gonna dab that on and you don't get one they're wet you don't want to move them because if your ropes can fall apart they can break apart so but I said once they're dry they're really they're good so I know before I said okay we could use a pan to roll them in I found that method didn't work so well because I said after one or two it gets really wet and it makes it difficult to roll in so I found just pouring the freight from the box but is not the best method once you're happy with that that me and again you're gonna let those dry probably about 12 hours to overnight once they're dry they're good to go do not store your candies in ziplock baggies if it's especially for gummies it's not good you either want to store them in glass jars or in cell bags or the miler Ziploc bags those work really well so instead I'm gonna let those puppies dry overnight and I'll show you the finished product and here's our finished product so check them out look I hope they look just like the real things as I said we don't have live here so I don't hundred percent sure but looks like it from the pictures it looks like a lot of fun alright guys so I hope you enjoyed that recipe if you have any other questions or comments please don't hesitate to put them you know where and thank you so much for joining me today you have an awesome rest of your day [Music]", "FIvxTPO_x3A": "hi folks its flower child 1970 and as promised I am going to show you how to make homemade gummy bears the easy way this is the easy way there's so many ways on the internet I just this is what three ingredients four ingredients actually if you include the water okay so you are going to need Knox gelatin I'm gonna bring you up just so it's not crooked you will need Knox gelatin okay or brand name gelatin don't go I've tried to go the cheap route and just by no-name gelatin I'm telling you folks I don't know what these name brands stop having them but there is an extra ingredient or something that allows this to work so you will need Knox gelatin only two packets okay so I have my two packets of Knox gelatin you will also need half a cup of kind of oil which is kind of this oil or coconut oil infused with cannabis so this is kind of coconut oil a measuring cup because you need half a cup of hot water and whatever brand of jello you want to use today I am using grape okay so it's gonna get a little shaky I'm sorry so do not turn on your stove yet what you do first is put your dry ingredients in first so you're gonna add your jello I'm opening it up oh god I broke a nail okay so just put your jello in whatever flavor and use name-brand jell-o do not use no-name jello its I'm not sponsored by them or anything but it does make a difference folks okay you can try it doing in a cheaper way but I'm telling you it's not gonna work they won't set right though they'll separate that Kenoi 'el will separate from the jello and you'll get a two-tone candy gummy bear and it looks terrible and it tastes terrible so we put our gelatin in again you're doing the dry ingredients first grape jelly smells good my garbage aside and then you're gonna want to mix this really well so that you don't see the white crystals anywhere on top you can even do it this way just shake it about it works it either way of stirring it or just shifting it in the pot pan and I'm using a nonstick pot it's very important that you use a nonstick pot as well so I am going to add my half of cup of hot water I did boil it already and now it's okay to turn on the stove because you're putting in your water I have mine at medium art whoops terribly sorry about that just mix it around you're gonna want to make sure that the there's no clumps in here and all the grit is gone you don't want to feel great at the bottom of the pan you want to make sure it's smooth much like how you would make it when you make you jello so we're just going to stir this around for a little bit for a few minutes just to make sure everything's separated and something fell on my burner sorry so what you also need while that is it'll boil a little bit it's just on four but what you also need are molds okay and what I have here and you'll see it over on the other side once this mixture is ready and you will need one of these little plunger things but if you where did I buy these I think I bought these at bulk barn I think I bought them at bulk barn and when you buy them you get three of these trays which have 50 divots each they're little gummy bears 50 divots each so you get 150 total in three trays and you get two or three of these little plungers to suck up the stuff and the mixture and put it in here so you're not burning yourself or using a spoon or anything like that okay and because there's always overflow it makes more than 150 I have my other trusty Molde here with the emoji faces on them so yeah I mean it's pretty basic it only takes a few minutes what takes the longest in my opinion is having them solidify in the fridge so I think this is pretty well mixed yeah it's mixed so just because I'm going to rush it but don't rush it because of a mixture might not work out as well it's actually starting to bubble so I chose great because I find that you taste the can of oil I know it doesn't bother some people but I like to taste the sweetness and the sugar and stuff so I guess you could put it less than half a cup in there you could put a quarter cup in here depending on your tolerance but my tolerance is quite high I eat a fair bit of edibles and I do consume it by smoking it so throughout the day and so I use a half a cup of the can oil so it's pretty good right now I think I'm just going to add the can of oil okay so we're gonna add it slowly just make sure that it gets mixed in there's a lot of stirring involved in this it's just I mean I've watched different people do it online and I know some people just leave it be but I don't I prefer to keep stirring it because I find the more you're stirring it the more it's going to stay mixed together I find it separates a lot sometimes so just be careful of that be cautious and be aware because if they don't mix well when they're solidifying they separate and it gives you a two tone candy I don't like that I find the butter it just or the kind of oil separates from the gelatin and I don't know why that is so I prefer to do it mixing it a lot stir stir stir came and add the rest of it you know just see the gelatine ah oh no glad I noticed that it's a little hair there so you want to mix this once all the butter or the can oil sorry I keep saying butter and used to make it with butter instead of the coconut oil but it's just it's not butter it's coconut oil so I'm sorry if I keep saying butter I don't mean butter I mean it's kind of oil kind of as coconut oil so now it's starting to heat better and it's gonna boil up as you can see which is good you do want that but stir as it does that so you're gonna want to stir it for about five minutes you might have to turn your stove down like I'm going to do cuz I find that's bubbling too much I'm actually gonna lift it up off the stove and move you up I'm sorry my phone's getting a little hot I'm gonna move you over here okay you can still see hahaha sit in the bunk pot they're just silly to do that so yeah I'm oh five minutes four to five minutes you're going to want to keep stirring it as it's sitting on the stove on medium four or five degrees depending on how your stove how hot your stove gets but it's pretty well mixed even the stuff on the side is mixed into the pot I'm gonna lift it up just so I can see how well it's mixed and then it's all mixed and looking well together excuse me I'm sorry about that so I hope you guys enjoy this video I can't believe I've never showed you guys how to make gummies before but this is homemade gummies they're not gonna taste exactly like and the textures not going to be exactly like this way the way I'm showing you I mean they still taste gummy obviously because of the gelatin and this is the easy cheap way to make yourself some gummies you can use whatever mold you like but I prefer to use the little gummy bear molds and the emoji molds okay I'm gonna shut the heat or actually no I'm gonna keep the heat on low because the mixture kind of cools itself down when you're dispersing it into the mold so having it a heat source is a good thing because it helps keep it hot or warm depending on what temperature you're gonna keep it set at when you're putting it into the mold it's important not to have it too higher you're just gonna burn the mixture and it's not gonna work at all so I've got it on low because I'm going to get ready to put it into the molds and I move the pot back and forth but since I'm filming it I'm gonna put you in another spot yes so that looks really good it's mixed really well I don't see a lot of the remnants of the the cano around the rim which is nice that means I've been stirring enough and there it's gone off the spoon or the mixing spatula okay I'm gonna move you over here you're gonna see my broken picture on the floor I can't believe that happened to fell right off the wall and boom down to the ground it went and it smashed okay it's kind of crooked you guys are gonna be having crooked necks trying to watch this oops well I'm sorry for all the movement I'm just trying to get it so that I can film it set it like that then okay here we go you have our little little miniature turkey basters [Laughter] okay here we go so just take some up obviously you guys know how these little things work where are we start on this end okay and sometimes I noticed because it's so hot it'll squirt back out I'd yeah it's kind of hard to see that but just be careful this stuff is really hot so you just put it in squeeze it into your molds kind of at medium to fast pace because this whoops this stuff cools fairly quickly I notice when I'm doing them but you will get if you're using this small gummy bear molds about a hundred and fifty plus gummies yeah so you can once they are solidified I've noticed some people on the internet use sugar powder I can't remember confection powder sugar to sprinkle on them because they are a little oily from the kind of oil that's mixed with them but I don't do that I just keep them in the fridge and then if I want some because obviously the touched her when they're in the fridge constantly is a little harder than if you left them at room temperature once they are all solidified and ready to be eat so you just continue ba-ba-ba-ba-ba get them all in there squeezing as you go so yeah I just I couldn't believe I was looking through my videos going yeah indeed I've never shown anyone how to make the gummy bear so this is how you do it this is my way of doing it this is and I find the texture fine you just got to make sure that you're also doing this stirring it around because it does separate and putting it back on the stove is a nice idea to keep the temperature hot whoops making a bit of a mess but I mean I'm sure instead of using cannabis oil to make these like some type of edible or treat for the kids leave out the kind of oil obviously oops no there we go was a little raised up there we gotta have them even so they harden properly and they're all ready to go at the same time you know what I mean so I find this fun to do this I mean I love to bake especially when they're edibles we're almost done here folks I'm actually gonna put this back on the stove for a second be right back just noticed it was starting separate you don't want that to happen okay all right she didn't had the stove on hot so I might take a little longer for you guys if you have it on medium or low so obviously we're gonna get more than 150 there's 25 in each of those gummy bear sheets so we're just gonna fill these up now obviously the emoji the pink sheet that I'm doing right now is going to take longer to harden because they're deeper bigger so I won't be showing you those but I'm hoping that these little ones if I put them in the freezer will solidify really well and I'll be able to show you them in the video no guarantees because my phone's been really wacky lately and when I pause it it shuts off on my phone sometimes so we're getting to the very last of it and it will the last few gummies will be very mediciney because of the butter that stays behind that's really what I'm soaking up here I can just see the difference so I'm just gonna pour it in there okay okay so I am going to cheat and put them in the freezer alrighty and hopefully hey that looks see that that looks like the Mickey Mouse symbol you see that a little dollop right there two ears all righty so that's what we do so far so good okay got a bit of the counter in there that one was never used so I'm gonna put these in the freezer hopefully when I pause it it won't mess up but if it does I'm sorry and I'll show them to you in another short video so we're gonna pause it and put them in the freezer for about ten minutes okay see you soon folks and if not love and Huggies and I'll show you the finished product in another video if that's what happens okay so that's how you make gummy bears folks it's pretty simple it's pretty basic and it's really easy and quick it's quick nothing to it the longest it takes in my opinion is to solidify them in the fridge which is usually about 15 20 minutes but we're gonna cheat and use the freezer okay lemon honey see you soon right alrighty so it only took five minutes but here are some this is what they look like whoops it's just what they look like gonna eat one so yeah so there you go folks oh my gosh where's the camera here we go ha ha sorry so yeah they look like rug dummies they just taste a little different you know what I mean so there it is I'm actually gonna have a couple more and put them back in the fridge but there they are dummies ready to be eaten folks lovin Huggies stay true stay unique and enjoy I hope you enjoyed the video folks and I hope you give it a try and if you do please let me know how it turned out ok bye"}
