{"jyz3Ovwkj0E": "you - wassup it's your boy man 20 rooms back with an update on the on the am her side with diesel progress is looking really good on her man she's really chunking out I love the way these metal Highlands I'm performing against them on the last two weeks it almost seems to finish off a little bit just slightly with a different look than the high-pressure sodium which I don't mind I mean they're both they're both fire when I grew this under the high pressure sodium and you know the slight differences that I notice under the MH you know it's not really much I notice more vom of a density tour now I don't know if that has anything to do with you know the closeness or the other light to the plant canopy or or what or the double-ended bulbs but when I used to grow these on the single-ended bulbs high pressure sodium they wouldn't get like I could squeeze these things man and they'll be like no game look at that like I'm I'm squeezing and they just like rock [ __ ] hard and greasy is all hell can y'all see that but anyway man yeah and I saw with these was looking good looking fat like I told y'all man and like I think it was like week two video day 14 man I told you how to look at these things you know week eight week nine and here we are we ate well and we are week nine middle of week nine and my god my fault bought the quality about the quality of the video fellas I'm on actually a different phone here in the phone on now on this the camera on this phone sucks worse than Nam the same song so I'm not sure how the quality's gonna come out I'm not really sure if um the cameras even doin listen any justice but humboldt seed organization i'll did themselves with this one right here mary this has been a favorite state of mine for a while have you yell done pulling you know but yeah man that's the aim her side with diesel middle of week nine this twenty rooms already know what it is keep it green keep it growing in our mouth fellas hey", "GI2UcoVDlWI": "what's going on YouTube this your boy 20 rooms 420 head man I'm back with the update right now we are currently in the sour the ham her side with these little tank these plants are currently on their second day of week nine they usually go they usually go ten weeks you know I usually take them to the 1002 the end of 10 weeks but um they look that's still looking kind of green now I did have some issues with this run things then things weren't perfect with this run so I'm thinking they might be a little stunted so I might have to let them go you know maybe to week 11 let them go a little bit longer but they definitely don't look like they'll be ready you know in a few days so I'm I'm gonna let them ride out for you know another week or two see how they look then the only concerns that I have with that is that I'm used to taking these two you know ten weeks and I start my flush out at week eight so I'm ready starting to show signs of you know the plants cannibalizing themselves and now I'm running into the issue where you know that I might take them you know another two weeks and I don't want the flush to affect you know the final bag of tail of the of the product in other words sometimes when you flush for too long the bud leaves and the leaves on the inside of the bud you know and you know the other green material get yellow form you know cannibalizing themselves and then you know the end result looks looks ugly you gotta trim off all that all that yellow leaf that looks ugly on the bug then but the next round should be good like I said this round was rushed they're really small man I haven't good clearance this small in a while like I gotta get and I'm not at all due by any means and I gotta get down low to get level with these you know the only a number the only and three gallon pots so they didn't get that big they basically routed I let the roots grow out into the and till there Solo cups for about two weeks then I transplanted them into number one pots and let them stand there for two weeks and then from there I just do I'm ready to flower I threw them inside of three gallons let them sit inside the three gallons for a day or two to you know let the roots adjust and I threw them right in here the flower cuz I needed that you know month to month back to back harvest and boy they suffered man hey you know I usually like to give my plants a decent you know amount of veg time and you know let them get some height on them you know with some money strong dominant branches you know it didn't work it didn't work out that way this round but hey it's whatever I still got decent meds I mean it's still Amherst out with diesel it's a shitty run but it's still good product the mice didn't really affect these so you know thank God for that the vegetarian is looking good all the plants are starting to come out of the dish shop for one that's starting to come out of the transplant shock because I transplanted them into the number one pots coming into the three gallon pots but it's time to come out of the shock from the transplant and it's time to come out of the shock from the aggressive lolli popping and topping that I did you know I can tell that they're coming out of shock because yesterday when the lights went on you know it was the first day that the knees were really praying like straight up like the lead was standing you know at attention it's hot and I was like all work you know this time they starting to recuperate time to come out they shock so you know the next you know week to two weeks they're gonna go through a nice little growth spurt but you know I'm excited about because you know these got two more weeks to go well naturally we'll have another week to go but you know since whatever went wrong they got stunted along the way and they need more time so I'm gonna give them all the time that they need if they need two weeks I'll let them write out two weeks so that just gives me that just gives the veggies you know room to do two more weeks over there but I'm gonna I'm gonna let the red I'm gonna let that room veg out for two more weeks harvest this tank clean everything like when I say clean everything like I'm a cleaning the top of the hoods I'm gonna take you know whole exhaust system apart replace the pre-filter replace all the tag and I clean everything taking the whole fan apart wiping everything down wiping the walls the ceiling take the home the waterproof matting off the floor give that a good wash disinfectant wash the floor wash the poles basically wash every watch the whole [ __ ] time then bombing you know make sure there's nothing in here let it air out properly for a day or two let it dry up properly you know for you know good day or two make sure there's no chemical you know residue left behind I'll give it a rinse in with some fresh water let that dry for about a day and then I throw the version plants in here at that time what I'll do is on more than two weeks they're gonna get transplanted into the number five gallon and eight count of pods when these are harvested in the rooms wash I'm gonna throw all of you know I throw all the plants in here and let them you know veg out in here for two weeks after the transplant so the veg room got four more weeks of veg time to go and they're gonna be you know pretty pretty decent-size by the time flower in his own his home has a you know by the time flowering started they're gonna be pretty decent-size I mean I would go in and show yous right now I'm just scared to death because you know I didn't have a problem with mites in this tank and I just don't want to go from this temp to that tent and infest anything just in case anything is left behind over there that's the heart I saw just touching overharvest going on his third day of drying everything he's looking closer over there nice and everything like a nice smell to it I'm drying off at a good rate on temperatures I mean that climate is changing in my area so I had to talk the humidifier up in here to help the convinced to control the conditions or keep the conditions and check at night the humidity seems to rise a little bit at night I'm guessing is that the heat from the lamp since the lamp ain't air cooled you know it's open hood that the heat from the lamp evaporates any humidity that's in here that's why the humidity drops when the lights are on which you know which is a good thing so I don't have to use the dehumidifier at night the humidity Rises I gotta use the humidifier to keep the humidity in check for my drying plants I would take them out of here I just think I know other area that has a carbon filter besides the bedroom and if these plants have any mites on them I don't want to reinvest the veg room with them that's why I kept them you know isolated in here but anyway that's how we looking on day two of them of week 9 I'll probably do one more video on these before I harvest them and I'll give you all a heart of this video on the end here in style diesel as well let's go see what's going on with it but I'll come back at shower tomorrow with a veg room update you know I got a send myself off make sure I don't got nothing on me before I go up in there so yeah that's about it for this one fellas the ship boy 20 rules for 28k a secret city science this man y'all already know what it is keep on green keep on growing man among these for us being yeah that [ __ ] frostbitten and that's only the leaves man anyway man I'm signing off y'all", "iQWFy4Jsmdg": "hey what's going on

is all for educational value on behalf of YouTube and YouTube scout policies and guidelines so let's get into this of the product in question today for the trial by fire is oh this is Amherst Sour Diesel now one of my other favorite buds was a Sour Diesel but it looks and smells nothing like this bud here this is another bud that has a great deal of purple this came from remedy and Columbia yeah all the little darker spots that are in this bud are definitely purple and it's cool because you know it's kind of hidden there's a lot of crystals all these buds come out is kind of light and white but this one definitely called out to me so overall it's on point the smell of it yeah it's got kind of a piney a little bit of a piney smell but I don't remember smoking this I'm sure I did smoke it but I don't think it has a piney we'll find out in a second for sure but yeah this is M Hurst sour diesel from remedy in Colombia this was not recommended to me this is my personal personal choice and something I saw it physically called out to me we're gonna get one of these buds right here we're gonna get that one and toss them into the electric I got my electric grinder here just break up a little bit of material the electric grinders are good and it's got a I don't know why buy mine seems to collect dust when I keep it clean so it's easy to bang the dust out of it occasionally I gotta clean these out with alcohol but they're all fairly flat so it makes it easy to clean with alcohol and who doesn't love alcohol I don't actually I'm not a big fan of alcohol I do drink occasionally if you knew me think I was lying but I'll do it more or less for social because this is not a feasible means of entertainment right now so yeah this is M her Sour Diesel and I am going to try this out I'll shoot it's a sticky bud and this was definitely more not so dense yeah the buds got a lot of not a lot of give to him but it's some pretty good stuff all things considered and I'm a big fan of the buds let's give her a trial by fire yeah that's pretty good this one definitely has a little bit more of a citrusy essence to it but it's not bad yeah I definitely like the but I could see myself rolling a joint or two of this for sure and because it's not super super sticky yeah I'd be a big part of that but yeah you can see all the dust that think Lex and you just take a brush and dust that out and I don't know what you do with your key for your dust your pollen put it down in the comment section I'm curious me personally I break it into a little compact pill and then I melt that down to basically like a hash block and I put it in joints that's personal opinion but nonetheless this has been a Amherst Sour Diesel and like I say I've got a I've got another Sour Diesel that was one of my favorite buds it's very skunky this is nothing like that this is definitely definitely a different beast all around I'm not complaining there these are some spot-on buds let me see if I get a little bit of zoom boom but yeah em her sour diesel from remedy in Colombia hope to see you all at the peoples unity fest loud music good people good food and drink and I was put on by a grower in the dispensary so nonetheless I hope you all enjoy it's been an absolute pleasure thanks folks peace", "po_ajdE7Aq8": "all right mozberg 420 back with another another epic epic episode all right boys been a while we're doing the harvest smoke report bud report of the amherst sour diesel from 8 or so we just grew and will give you my thoughts on it let you know what i think about the chronic so four different phenols um all different all different smells all different type of [ __ ] and let's get into it right now so we got one job right here this is fido number two all right fino number two chrisley as hell bam what's that but right okay speedo number two now final number two as a very musky muskie let's get us off the bat first if we go any further right before we go any further let's get off the bat this it has no sour it's just maybe diesel it's not sour it's not the california new york sour diesel vancouver sour diesel that we know man this is not it this is you know it smells it's not sour it's not sour like eats pinot has a different taste right so let's get into it right so this is number two let's see if you know number two very crystally this one we burn it this one has a very classically cushy diesely skunky smell you know what i mean um no sour this is probably my favorite vino out of before right here's another bud let's get another bud funeral number two going very nice um crystal structures right yeah so it has a lot of fruitiness in this tool this is another female number two let's get another butt out here you guys check it out so a cushy musky fruity skunky smell and you can smell some diesel but i'm not gonna say it's sour it's not sour it's not sour at all and i got some nice-sized nuggies in this batch for sure right very crystally damn that's nice right all right funeral number one is my least favorite one uh wasn't even i don't i don't rate this one at all uh this one's okay i might just turn funeral number one to some right let's turn that into some hash all right final number three this is the smelliest version of them all very [ __ ] potent terpene um second favorite second favorite let's get a butt out um there's some big buds i don't want to [ __ ] yeah this one has very it's just a pungent sweet skunky smell it's not sour it's very pungent and sweet um very punchy and sweet um very sticky [ __ ] i don't know bro all right so that's that one this was the leafiest of them all right this was the leafiest of them all um and then we got fetal number four uh which is okay it was all right this one this one has a real spicy aroma to it right it's very spicy um i don't know it was all right it wasn't this was my last favorite tool this is number one not really digging it too much it smells like curry this one has a [ __ ] curry smell to it bro you know what i mean this one has like a like a curry [ __ ] smell to it it's very spicy it has some lemon in there i could smell some [ __ ] lemon and [ __ ] lemony and and curry bro as i smell i smell [ __ ] curry off that [ __ ] though you know what i mean there's another big bud of that one fetal number four which is yeah man i smell like [ __ ] tumeric and [ __ ] like masala curry and [ __ ] bro you know what i mean but then again my favorite one again number one you can see the difference in the bud from number one to those guys right number one is just like so crystally if i was going to keep any of these strains it's definitely going to be number number two this one here right these ones here right these ones are the [ __ ] bomb ass ghostly [ __ ] [ __ ] right oh that [ __ ] if i was going to keep a keeper off this this diesel is definitely going to be the number two um banging out here um then maybe the three the three taste is really nice um skunky and gassy sweet gas um on that one right so overall overall with with the diesel now or the weight okay four plants i got you know like a quarter pound of each of them you know what i mean uh of each plant a little over a quarter pound so you know what i mean for four plants you gain up a pound and a half i weighed myself out at uh some of the jars already empty [ __ ] like that man you know what i mean the conor rate is just what's left right uh curing up and just airing it out now i've got the beetle packs in there and i'm in so yeah would i grow this again nah i [ __ ] probably won't you know they tricked me uh probably gonna be done with hso for a while because you know what i mean um this is not sour uh diesel this is uh amherst it's like a this is probably the european version right this is european but it's not california new york diesel or even the one we got here in canada like we got some bomb vancouver and toronto sour that's [ __ ] sour and skunky and fuel right this is more fruity gas and a little skunk and a little muss you know what i mean if anything i would grow this guy you know number two again that was definitely my favorite pheno you know what i mean it's just more crystally and just was a better smoke overall right um but you know um that's how the story goes right you experiment with strings and you know i'm probably done with hso for a while i'm not really impressed with this one it was a good smoking thing right their chem dog wasn't even a real chem dog it was more piney it wasn't it wasn't chem dog it didn't have that kim funk on it so again again you know i'm done with hso for a while and i got a surprise um right now i got a surprise coming up right now so let's uh let's check that out all right peace uh hold on a second i'm gonna show you what i got in the tent all right back in the tent we got some og kush you know what me and this is the og kush for like years ago 10 11 12 year ago og kush you know what i mean and um private reserve you know and we just got this is this is two weeks i'm vegging man these are these these are doing great man these are these are two weeks veg they're [ __ ] getting tall i'm going to start bending them i want to bend them from here from here i'm going to bend these over you know what i mean and uh yeah we'll see how that goes right let's start bending these these plants over and uh see this up man so this is this is what i'm saying this is the og kush i grew this before years ago get it back again now this is the funk this is the skunk this is the the chem this is the sour og kush version we're gonna check these ones out right and um i already filmed there you see i've filmed the top so i found them already i'm gonna start and i'm bending them over and we're going to see how that goes all right peeps um yeah just look for the updates man it's been great uh sour diesel done not sure if we're going to grow that again og kush up front and um yeah we're going to see how this goes this one's the bomb grown this for years before so let's check this one out all right peace um i'm going to be out of here on the ellis tear i'm going to show you how that looks and um yeah yeah man we check it out all right mozberg 420 it's a good thing", "uIMhybrS2JM": "josberg420 we back with another epic epic episode this one grow tips now you know what i mean this is the sour diesel amherst sour diesel a hell of a wicked strain you know what i mean so again i didn't veg these ones long enough uh but i didn't super crop i didn't um train i didn't film i just let her grow out and i just want to get a quick one in so i just veg for three weeks and this is the results this is the beginning of six week flower and you know she's looking good man got buds everywhere she's really stinky she's really soury you know i mean great structure i am her sour diesel um you know i mean i got a couple different phenols i got more of a sativa one here in the back there it's another sativa lean in heavy indica and a very indica hybrid in the back right there right so you know what i mean different flavors they all starting to stink um the moss doing its thing got some ventilations going on uh one more tip there's a tip i'm gonna give y'all right now now this is what i got you get these things really cheap on amazon there's this guy right here a dehumidifier right a dehumidifier now this dries up the air sucks in the water see at the bottom there's a water reservoir you check that every couple days and empty it and just helps to um prevent mold prevent fungi you know this one's rated for a 130 square foot room it's set so it's good enough for my tent right yeah so there you are man the humidifier and her sour diesel looking chunked up they're chunking up man let's start you know at the end of week six at the beginning at the end of week six i'm gonna start hitting her up i'm gonna start hitting him up with some overdrive and get that overdrive going on in here you know what i mean get that overdrive nice chunky smell it real nice goddamn stinking like some skunk uh man you know what i mean so too bad i didn't get the trainer um if i trained her um you know my lst and topping tings i would even out the canopy and probably get you know all these buds see how much these branches this [ __ ] has right here tons man yeah i would have just made it all in some big colas right but you know i just want to get one in quick for christmas and then after i got another class of strain i want to really train and really super crop and really even it out and uh get that going after the amherst man but yeah i'll give you another update soon you don't know it's a good thing bless up", "-Zlect0QAmc": "all right now we got uh amherst sour diesel on deck this one is much more manageable i mean i might still take off a few fan leaves but the buds aren't packed as tight um yeah it's first of all it's easier to take leaves off of this and there is by far less leaves so be interesting to see if this one purples out at all um i've seen a lot of grows where it does get quite purple but it is so hot right now in my garage that i don't know if it's gonna get there i just don't know one more of the cookies cush for you", "2I59758izvc": "good morning everybody I don't even know what day this is but I'll put it on the description and title of this video we are very close on pretty much all counts pretty good I must say so this is the critical plus and getting ready to harvest that fairly quickly now I believe I still don't see many amber trichomes which Jeepers Creepers no I'm just going to keep waiting till I get at least 30% average right bones and the Amherst Sour Diesel is looking fantastic there's a couple different fee knows I guess because this one plant has virtually no red hairs yet and this one has I'm gonna see some branches 50% on some branches about 25% wow it's a big difference this one which I have determined I believe is black dog actually because there's no way it's an anomaly if I have heard Sour Diesel it's just so not but frosty all over the place and absolutely stinky it's me it smells like a cushion perhaps some of you who want to sample this what they will have an opinion it's absolutely just the dankest I've never grown anything like it and the leaf structure everything is so different than the antler Sour Diesel so there you go I've been kind of fee a little bit of what you call epsom salts which apparently supposed to get rid of the red red stems it seems to have done that decreased it anyway and a little bit of molasses as well for carbohydrates and also would be electrolytes in the soil and so yeah I will probably be a week I'm thinking I may not get a chance to harvest this until next week I didn't think would be that long but yeah we'll stay tuned so there you are everyone I hope everyone has a pleasant Sunday", "K1VtZ1vqo8s": "Crete [Music] hey guys what's up welcome back I'm glad you're all here today if you happen to hear some birds chirping around the background perfect because it is springtime here in the northern hemisphere which means it's a perfect time to start to germinate seeds whether you're going to be going outdoors for the 2019 outdoor season or you're staying indoors and want new genetics or just new seedling plants for your indoor crop today I'm going to be showing you the few little things that I use and how I germinate seeds just like everything I do it's a very simple method it's something I've been doing for a really long time I think you know I think I'm on like 14 years now I'm sure there's plenty of other ways to do this and possibly better and you know just slightly easier ways to do this but this is how I do this like I said it's been successful for a long time now so today we're gonna be showing you how I germinate seeds so stay tuned alright so let's show you the little bit of equipment that we're gonna need to get these seeds up and going so obviously first things first we're gonna need some seeds so whatever a variety company strain even species you may be going with get those ready now what we're gonna be using here is banana split from the homie loci grow he started his own little breeding company here a breeding genetic company under grow genetics and they're just getting up and going he's got about six or seven crosses that are in testing right now and I was lucky enough to grab them so I could take some dope pictures and also get them kind of up and going and do some testing anyway we have the banana split which is banana punch by symbiotic genetics super hot they're crossed with ice cream man was his mail from compound genetics another super hot breeder out there so should be some serious fire in there and if you guys have been following me on instagram at green jeans garden you have seen the fire pictures before these things have even germinated as well as some other strains that got some dope pictures up so follow me at green jeans garden anyway so we have our seeds next we're gonna need a shot glass or anything really that holds some water because the first step is soaking the seeds and to go along with that we're gonna need some water simply now this is where everyone's gonna ask so what kind of water tap are oh this or that doesn't matter guys use tap use are out use what you got but whatever you use use the best you got if have RO water use it if you have clean spring water use it the idea is that it's clean water and it's neutral water and what I mean by neutral is it's somewhere in the range of upper fives at the lowest pH to around seven at the highest pH so just say Gerry generally neutral pH and you should be good to go and then once we soak the seeds we're kind of moving in the second process and that's going to be germinating them in the basic paper towel method that everyone knows and loves so that's going to consist of a paper towel and a ziplock baggie now the Ziploc baggie could also be a clone dome it could be anything that's just going to keep the paper towel from drying out too fast could even be two bowls but we'll get into that once we get going I picked pick eight of the beans that I want to germinate here save a few just in case for a rainy day you never know it so it's just kind of a we save one or two anyway got them as well as the two twin beans that I have in there photo goes up now so all we're gonna do here is we are going to put a little bit of water in there and we are going to simply drop these seeds into the water now you'll notice most of the seeds will float any that sink immediately are usually duds but they could be okay anyway just give a little little swirl and we are going to let the seeds soak for 12 hours okay so we've dropped our seeds in water we're going to let them soak for 12 hours and we let them soak for 12 hours in darkness now by dropping them in water and having generally good temperatures those are the two criteria to start the germination process light can be harmful essentially it's just really not necessary some species and strains and things do need light but overall 95% of seeds germinate the best and most successfully in darkness so as long as you have good moderate temperatures over 65 degrees under you know 80 80 82 and some moisture for the seeds to start their process they're going to germinate so what we're gonna do is we're actually just going to put these in one of these cabinets I have behind me here and come back in 12 hours [Music] ok so it's been about 16 hours now and the timeframe anywhere from you know 6 hours to 24 hours is plenty of time to get these seeds soaking and as you can see here these seeds have already sprouted tails in the shot glass now these things these are new fresh seeds very vigorous ready to go if you have some older seeds they might they probably won't sprout tails a lot of times my older seeds won't sprout tails in here which is why we actually go to this the second step of the method here the paper towel method some people will just germinate in the shot glass and honestly these seeds right here these could go straight from here to whatever your final or starter media is and probably be fine they're vigorous and ready to go but for the sake of how I always do seeds we're going to continue to take these from the sprouted tails in the shot glass here and get them into a paper towel so let's do that now okay so let's get these seeds transferred into the paper towel and it is just as easy as it may seem we are just literally just going to pour them in try not to spill them everywhere and keep them in our palm and we got one being left in there we'll just wash it on out use gravity and water and bam just don't tell my wife I'm doing it here on the counter all right once we have the seeds on the damp or moist paper towel we're just gonna fold it up maybe two three folds tops you don't need much as you can see here you can see the seeds through it we don't want it to be completely thick that we can't see through it but we want to be covered enough that it acts like you know some form of medium or soil all right so we have our seeds damp paper towel just let it drip dry give it a little ring on the edges we just want it we want it moist damp not dripping wet but obviously need some moisture for seeds act like you know pretend it's some moist cocoa or some moist soil once we have that we're gonna open up our ziploc bag or simply just gonna put it inside now this thing is like I said just acting as if it's a clone a cloned oh this is just they've always done it in ziplock baggies cuz you know they're more accessible and pretty much everyone has a sandwich bag I'm using a gallon ziplock here because to me the bigger the Ziploc the better which is why I think I cloned a clone dome works great for this situation the small Ziploc sometimes if your seeds take a while to germinate maybe they take 3 4 days to get going and they can get kind of just a funky little smell going you might want to change paper towel something like that and I've noticed a bigger a bigger Ziploc or cloned um or something like that that kind of mitigates that just a just a touch but these things are so vigorous they're only going to be in here another 12 hours or so maybe 20 for tops you'll see them and they're gonna be frickin explosive so all we're going to do is put it in here and kind of give it a little little puff give it a little air poof in there so it's got you know so the bags not laying right on on the seeds and we're going to put it right back into that dark space where we had success getting these tails out of the four so wherever that was for you go ahead and put it right back there [Music] okay so let's look at these guys all of them have have sprouted and one of the twins has sprouted one of them has not guys are looking at just some singles here look at that beautiful beautiful growth here we go and this one see that's a twin that only one has sprouted this twin both of them have sprouted guys this is a little weird [ __ ] Wiggins I'm so stoked but all the seeds looking good look at that tail fantastic so whoo okay alright guys so 24 hours after we put them into the paper towel we've now taken them out roughly 24 hours might be like 18 you know but give or take these seeds are extremely vigorous so don't expect results exactly like this I just want to clarify that right now tails popping out after 12 hours beautiful busted tails out this is just a very you know these are fresh seeds it's a vigorous strain obviously all good signs but if yours take a few days to get to get some tails sprouted this or that don't worry that's that's totally normal but once they do once you've opened them up we can transfer them from the paper towel to whatever starter medium you have so if you're gonna try to drop them into a rock wool cube that's your thing if you're putting them in soil that's your thing Pro mix whatever it may be that that's your choice at this point but we're using coco here but the you know the technique here is the same we're gonna lightly we've already buried our unburied them holes give them some nice nice spots to sprout and we're just going to lightly place each seedling in there I have eight little four-inch pots here and we have eight seedlings we're actually not going to do all of them because that twin sprouted so I got to actually go take some some great photographs and that should pop up right here and if not give me a few days and get all these potted up and nicely watered in I have one little watering technique that I'll show you once we get these in here but that's that so we are actually we're two days past once we first transplant these seedlings into their Coco medium and you can see there up there sprouted all of them even the twins that are in this bag you're going I just want to get that shell off there so I can get each one of these twins into their own own media but but yeah they're ready to go now I told you there was one little trick I have two watering and guys its watering so it's nothing revolutionary it's crazy the point of it is just when you first transplant your seeds you want to get them watered you want to get that basically that bond from the seed to that medium it kind of wants their wet it just creates that bond and to do that we want to do it gently we don't want to just flood the top here with water and let it do its thing most likely the plants to be fine honestly but you know most people are paying pretty good dollars for seeds these days ten plus dollars a seed so you want to take care of it let's just be gentle so simply what I was gonna show you is just be gentle with the water bottle that you were watering with nothing crazy um we don't want to flood or this is the kicker everyone forgets most of you guys have a pump sprayer whether it be a little hand like hairspray or thing or you actually have like a pump sprayer and this guys is the most gentle way to water in the top of your seedlings because it's a very light mist you can be very direct with it right where it needs to go and the perfect amount where it's not too not too agitating or not too too harmful for these seedlings now my only tip is that if you use your sprayer for your IPM be kind of you know pesticide or preventative anything it could be gnarly on a baby seedling just make sure you clean out your sprayer or have a dedicated clean sprayer something like that I know it might be an extra step but that is my suggestion other than that you guys should be off to the races that at this point and should be able to start feeding these plants now that they're to this point they're just starting to get their first true set of leaves you have those they're called cotyledons the leaves that don't really look like real leaves once they get past that they need some nutrients so at this point we need to give them light and we need to give them nutrients and we need to start treating them just like real plants which at this point they are if they're above the ground so whatever you're gonna do with your seedlings this year whether again if you're going outdoors for 2019 or you're staying indoors with new genetics that's how I pop and germinate I've always had fairly good success rate overall obviously these seeds are extremely vigorous new so they're kind of you know stars of the show here so don't expect identical results of the EC's work again vigorous freakin nature's but yeah you guys should be often going have some beautiful seedlings up and started and some great new genetics in your rooms or in your gardens so guys I appreciate it like this video if you liked it go ahead and just like it if you don't is what it is subscribe if you're not and I will see you guys next time whether it's a back to the basics little tutorial here or we're back in the garden guys so I appreciate it I'll see you next time for chief [Music]", "cHXSMGJLgio": "hey gang so here we are on an update and so I have stripped a lot of stuff off fact I just finished stripping a little more of the undercarriage out so now all the tops will be left by my account I have approximately 33 tops going and they are looking awesome and everything is responding as I had hoped so yeah I'll do it in a probably next to week you'll see what's happening here but boy I think it's gonna be pretty awesome one so I just gave it some water I'm going to top feed them some more Gaea flour fertilizer and let her go from there so yeah things looking awesome I have put a little screen on the front here so it's now light tight velcro so it works very very well so pretty happy so there we go", "o4aJ3H2SIOw": "due to twin groomsman back at you with that update I promised you over here and Amherst either side see now I'm on my phone so I adjusted the white balance as good as I could and it's still it's still looking a little yellowish but just to give you an example look how much blue you know the metal highlight is compared to like the last video so I'm trying my best you know with what I'm working with here it's not gonna give you the best quality but I can give you an example of like some of the decides that his buzz man a hue he's gonna finally get that a little bit better put my hand around here my hand like this is man especially down like the Senate the center of it it is it gets so fat man and they still got three weeks left you know like this this is still hairy it's too thin it pop yet you know it's still gonna give it that that final chunk that pop so it's gonna get it's gonna get thick it in then what it is man and it's just it's just one of them strange man that just it amazes me every time every time I see it in action you know and these are the exciting weeks right now like week seven to week nine it's like man that's when it does it and I'm kind of excited to see like this metal section just sorry this middle section over here how it gets like you know both spectrums I'm kind of let's see how interested to see how you know those come on but yeah man the Amherst diesel man is chunking up man I got my light down to 50% man and it still great I usually pull these down around day 70 and the we tank just about two weeks after the Chernobyl side and look at that the canopy's thick like look at this like this is the measly that's a bottom side branch I'll follow it down like that's a branch from down there right and like look at that look at that hand grenade he gives man and it gives these things all the way around the plant really these are easily you know four to five rounds plans yeah that's how we looking on day 47 over here Amherst Diesel's see if I can get one with a color spectrum in here maybe it'll make some a bit of a difference the way it looks makers you know that high-pressure sodium is just it's not doing it any justice it's not doing it justice at all it just looks like a like I already blur when in actuality man these things are all staring get him Big Momma's over there now right there boy big pa fellas man that's the air hose diesel side looking fat his or her y'all see you you know all the way down thickness and the crazy thing is is that they just gonna get fatter three three weeks they still got three weeks three weeks of chunking up to do like these [ __ ] ain't fat enough but hey I ain't complaining I'm not complaining one bit man so this your boy man sleeper city scientist man y'all be easy keeping green keep them growing y'all know what it is Keep Calm and Tocco pays", "7jB5fLY_Ml4": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] YouTube was calling on y'all it's your boy twin roots man impact with another update for y'all this is the breeding projects right here um this video right here is more or less gonna be a dry product review um yeah let's jump into him her up top of where these two mugs this is of the dark helmet crossed with the Java pie I like the way it came out I got it I got a really unique smell and it's nice and dense you see that nice tan snugs and it gives off a real pungent you know heavy smell hmm these two right here it came off the same plane so it's the same thing no but home this pod right here got a little bit more law Fox tailing thing going on there you know right there in the center of the screen see if I can focus on okay right there I love fox thing right there's a little fox tail I mean but for the most part you know it turns out alright it was our home I have a yield up with our heavy you know cookie character a character it um characteristics during flower as far as the you know structuring the way the birds look um looking at it now it doesn't you know strike me as a as a cookie strain so much but it still came out you know fire regardless um the taste is amazing it got a a real citrus arm tint to it you know on a real citrusy um good smell you know sweet kind of piney um and yeah I like it um the second one over here is the Amherst sour diesel cross with the love potion oh it looks you know more more on the side with these inside well this phenol right here looks more on the sour diesel side and uh then the side of the you know love potion 99 um same thing you know it came on fire the density is really really good which is you know one of was one of my goals was that's enough you know the end product of the well that [ __ ] is tight and what it was - dancing up the end product of the Sour Diesel you know yeah really dense buzz so you know mission accomplished with that anyway um this also was a heavy yield it produced a lot it was only one plant I think it came out to like four ounces in like three quarters of smoosh it so yeah um definitely you know it was definitely a yield uh the smell is more of the of the inner Sour Diesel and of the love potion 99 but the taste I would have to contribute that to the love potion 99 you know it tastes more like you know the love potion 99 than it does the Amherst um up next over here was the pride and joy of my breeding projects of what you know I was so excited about and I'm impressed although there is still still some work that needs to be done um I like the way I like the way things are going this is the Chernobyl cross with the Java pie um also came out very dense and the smell is just crazy the smell that takes everything is crazy um it came out with like on with like gum the blood structure of the Chernobyl's but just bigger elongated you know II mean um you know I had one feeling with me that that length that means more towards the arms our pie but instruction but this one right here was was the keeper the yield on it was crazy [Music] everything about it you know the internal spacing the smell um the vigorous growth everything about this one you know this one clan was on was what I was looking for so I went ahead and I revenge this one and I reread the dark helmet crossed with the tower pot as well um mostly for the quality in the yield they both did they both have these two are both heavy use this is the heavier though but I wouldn't rank it in the same category of quality as I would you know that one and then um I mean it's so good it still get you on it's just not the type of high that I personally like um it sits in your mobile a heart-racing doesn't really let you enjoy your yeah hi hi you know what I mean this is more you know uplifting want to go out and do some type of high which is you know what I like um so these are the done three fie knows that I got you know cure right now all of them I'm impressed with all of them came out good all of them are fire and that's my review for today fellas sorry about that that's my girl's phone over there anyway man this twenty roots aka T secret city scientist man y'all already know what he did is

on 72 hours of darkness probably right around 73 74 to be honest with you Amy hit a little late the girls are ready to come down everything chunked out nice look at that nice little color on that ham her side with diesel right there [Music] super chunky super crystalline man I'm telling you I stand by that 72 UV rays and 72 hours of pure darkness look at does she rock solid considering all the issues I had with this run you know the mics and you know them being thrown in in the flour early and you know all the other issues that I had man it wasn't a bad run everything turned out alright I'm kind of surprised you know I was almost you know it was almost to the point where I was considering throwing this round away you know just getting rid of everything but could you imagine could you imagine getting rid of this [ __ ] look it is the mice ain't really affected what effect that if more was you know the whole the whole process being rushed the pent the plants being thrown in early I mean the only in three gallon bags but you know for considering everything that that they went through the end result is not bad man so we're gonna get to the chopping over here marian getz the harvest in this tank I'm gonna grab this one over head first I already harvested three of the arm of the am her side with diesels and there's the first one well there's the fourth one so yeah I mean everything take everything turned out all right on the em her sour diesel the Chernobyl's that I harvested last week turned out all right um there those are currently in the curing process I'm gonna make a video I'm gonna upload a video on on how they look you know I'll get to that when they ready after this video is uploaded I'll be uploading a video of the veg tank I'm going to into a video on that real quick but besides that mean everything is looking good over here Mary we get these things harvested I'm gonna let them dry out properly in the dark after they after they dried I'm gonna throw them you know throw them in the jars let them cure and watch this whole 10 oh man I gotta I gotta get the other plants in here to start to start fetching the amount underneath the to the 2000 watt mm their bulbs you know I want to give them at least 2 weeks of an adjustment period before I flour them out [Music] but yeah that's how we looking over here man just harvesting [Music] should I let show I'll let you you know let y'all see what I'm seeing when I harvest number frosting chunk zone [Music] so I'm gonna finish up over here fellas I'm gonna get to the arm I'm gonna get to the

rooms here man in the back with a inverse Sour Diesel final harvest results as you can see these two buds right here I like the normal size of the bus that I got after the colas were broken down like you know the colons were huge and that's a small but you know after I broke broke off the little bottom pieces and sick you know you end up with something like that's wrong like you know that big so these are the average size of you know the inverse diesel boats like I said straight hand grenades you know my father had a bun in my mouth you know I'm moving again medicated figured I get medicated you know while I mingle with my youtubers you know smoked with y'all hopefully y'all y'all got one led to him we imagine but right now she's sitting that leg about she's sitting that about maybe 10 days tried I took her off the line at 7 days you know I broke down the buds and I put the buds inside home you know the bags and the jars on untrimmed and as they cured you know I went ahead and trimmed them up um I got my flash on I don't know if he's doing more good than harm I should probably upload another video with the flash off from the lighting in my in my house is not doing it justice like even with the flash you know I'm getting not what I want you guys to see cuz what I want you guys to see is what I'm seeing and it's not pick the camera's not picking it up but with the flash so far is the best the closest to it you know what I mean the natural lighting in my house is that you know regular and dancing and it's just it looks blurry and it's not giving you know the detail that I want like even this ain't even like giving the detail that I want cuz these things is frosty let me tell you but on yes you got a real pungent on classic Sour Diesel you don't smell you can't you can't hide hell for nothing like I could take what I got on the table right here anywhere with me and I'm leaving a trail you know I hop on a city bus with this and everybody looking at me you know um I walk by somebody that knows what they're talking about and you know I get a you know that I smells good or okay got that fire you know i movies getting something like that so she's very difficult to conceal the smell with her man but I love her you know I mean like I love her cuz she's she's huge and it's not just fat buzz either you know I mean they're big buds but let me see if I can get this man let me get that brightness off there for you okay right there good example look like the bitch's Terence she's dance you know like that's not just oh it's a big buzz but it's airy and it's Laura fee and I bet you squeezing it flatten right out how [ __ ] know like this [ __ ] right here is the rail do like hso on both see old is a new organization I know I'm giving them a shout out um yeah they did they thing with this you know I'm not getting paid by them for you for me to tell you this or nothing this is just me telling you that I ordered me some some ham her Saudis who seeds from Humboldt County and their way is ridiculous this [ __ ] is fast she eat everything you gave her very easy to grow wasn't picky at all um resilient to mites and mold um I liked it was all-around good plan um yeah and get two of these man I would put the other one up but it's holding the phone you film me so yeah that's the update for today man sorry for the quality like I said man I'm on my phone upgrades are coming soon and that's including the camera fellas stay tuned this twinning rules aka secret city scientists yall already know what it is keep them green keep them growing and amount peace", "0gZJKrq3G_A": "it's going on YouTube streaming room 420 head man when I move your head trimming up to the M her side with diesel I failed I figured I'd get my YouTube fans you know a sneak peek at at my process um these Amherst I was been trying for about five and yeah about five days and I like to do a dry trim from a certain number of reasons um the main reason is I like to keep well when I initially harvest the plant I cut off all the family I just leave the Bundys um I like to let the but leaves curl over I like to let the Bundys curl over the bud protecting it a little bit that's one of the reasons look at that [ __ ] frostbitten but anyway another reason why I like to do that is you know I've been doing this for a while you know I got like 20-some years under my belt I'm growing you know you know I don't want to trophies I'm saying I'm the best 9 like that but I tried all different types of methods and know when you let your plants dry out and you cut all these fan leaves off and you expose that you know right now with the arm with the foot with the leaves on it you know the outside of the bud is exposed to air so if anything is gonna degrade you know it's going to be you know that outside layer are you cutting that outside layer off like you know buddy's you know you're exposing product that you know hasn't you know seen like or you know touched it and you release like you know the smell is crazy like I do it you know if I do a wet trim on the inside with diesel and that's what I should have done to do the comparison to show y'all but if I do a wet trim and then I do a dry trim the dry trim is going to come out with a stronger more pungent smell then the but that was trimmed wet for the reason being that is exposed to air you know it you know if you got a fan in there now the fans blowing on the you know on the actual bud instead of that protective layer you know of leaves now come in here and you know I'll chop all that them leaves off and then I get left with the underneath bud that's been protected by that and then it's the stench is crazy you know but that's just the way I do it you know that's my method I ain't saying I'm I'm right ain't saying I'm wrong you know I just like the results of it and that's just my personal preference other people do it different ways that's okay as long as you're producing fire medicine it's okay I'm just showing you my method you know so I'll let them sit here and dry after I trim my phone back on the on the line for a little bit you know eventually I'll cut them off at the smaller buds and throw them on the drying rack but they looking good right now you know see if we can get a nice close-up on that right there focus yeah frostbitten definitely so I'm in here man just trimming away got a lot of work ahead of me um I usually cut off all the top like a quality stuff and I'll leave like you know the bottom popcorn but for last I'll trim off whatever I can use for like b-grade you're not putting the beet red jars you know a lot of this stuff I'm just going to use the tops of it for the 8th grade but you know and then a lot of this stuff right here will be for like the beet grade bugs and then most of them stuff up there like that would be like you know your popcorn stuff that I would run for like shatter or whatever but anyway yeah man I just want to show y'all you know my my method of on trimming this light don't stay on yummy these these plants are in the dark um I just got my bedroom plants over there but I cover that during the day that way there will be here you know it's dim I wouldn't say it's complete darkness but you know it's them and they I you know they got the carbon filter up there they get you know fresh air flow the only time this light comes on is when I come in here you know two or three days you know after they will put in here to start trimming which is today you know so there it is fellas I'm gonna get back to work man this your boy twin rooms 420 yellow ready know what it is keep on green keep on growing keep them healthy man look at that [ __ ] healthy all healthy no deficiency no nothing no purple in no striping nothing but healthy healthy medicine and that's to go regardless at a technique oh look at this I forgot let me show y'all some of the dark helmet and it's popped see if I can get a close-up of that right there you see it you see it yeah man you know they coming up they coming up so you might got them underneath some light right there down right there it's just you know I've seen the white of the of the stem it's gonna poke through the dirt so I know tomorrow morning when I wake up that thing is gonna be you know sprouted but the Olsen groans looking good you know the jowl pine the love-potion 99 now we got

right now he's pulling on a few weeks cure probably going to bum a week dried and about a three week ill and I'm telling you I hated shits thanks man like that's always been one of the problems with with like the thieves man it's very hard smell to hide but this is on this is the harvest from the first run the second run is again harvested that you know was getting harvested at the end of this week and then the Amherst you know two weeks after yesterday um last time I looked at you know we'll go on to the and the week eight first week uh first day week nine this time I won't let the Chernobyl go the whole nine weeks and I'm gonna chop it on the first day of week 10 only because it looks like it could use a little bit more time it looks like it didn't ripen as fast as the last ones but yeah right here this right here is the Amherst even she came out father fellas nice and dance movies did she sponsors right back up nice and dense this is on for Mom humble seal organization and you know I went and grabbed a packet hand hurts our and you know um to phenols I kept out of the whole pack and that's what you're looking at right here well two plants out of the the two plants were sowing the same characteristics and you know same same type everything seemed type of smell and growth pattern and everything so you know basically you know two plants for the same phenotypes from from the other ones a super dang love the way she smells Marin out late I wish it was like smellivision or you could scratch the screen or smell it a song you know some scratching [ __ ] but this [ __ ] right here smells fire you see if I get a close-up on them to track home production here four year old lighting frost big then I'm telling I took these buds out you know for the purpose of the video maybe five minutes at Goldman you got my whole house smelling already yeah man you know I figured I showed you know the YouTube is hotter Amherst you know is coming out um this is the size of like the average buzz right obviously these were you know like the big ass you know monster tops that that was in the videos I got a lot of them um next from it I'm trying to structure my plans in on a video of a continuance on how I structure my plans for and get them ready for flowers coming up either today or tomorrow you know I'm gonna go in there and show y'all some of the pruning techniques that I use as far as you know what branches I keeping what branches I don't you know the reasons why um but anyway yeah that's a quick update on you know the ham her side with diesel I want to show y'all you know what it looked like you know after after a few week yer taste amazing I already told you about the smell I probably get a call from my landlord in a little bit talking about the downstairs is complaining about the smell it's like [ __ ] but yeah man that's the update for today just a little quick video on the am her side with diesel and I was curing as soon as this uploads I'm gonna upload it uh the other video that I got ready for y'all which is a veggie update video flower time update video will be coming either tomorrow or the day after I am going to do I'm actual harvest video like you know usually gonna actually get to see me chop down the chernobyl this with this this round instead of you know me showing you the before shots and then you know the next video you see the plants are on hangers long usually you know I have somebody holding the camera you'll actually see me you know harvesting and I'll show you how I go about you know harvesting and the way I like to do things over here just a little homemade personal moon rock yeah man it looks nuts you know and I have to say you know I impressed myself with it man as fire is crazy so basically I didn't have the ingredients to make the oil so what I basically did was while I made a run a shadow I basically while it was still you know purging I basically rolled the buds or some some of the buds in the shadow then I let it sit and I let it dry and once it was dry to the point where it was you know touchy like taffy like that stickiness attack taffy you know I put it in a jar Keef and shake it around but it seems like it seems like the the shadow soaks up the kief you know like I had to put it in a jar a few times you know I would get the whole body coated with chief it would look beautiful and I'm like word you know put it there let it sit to dry you know and I come back like a hour later and the keys is all sucked up you know I'm just singing a brown [ __ ] butter shadow and I gotta put it back in the jar and shake it around but anyway I'm pretty much there you know what I mean um the Keef is I mean oh the shad is dried on the meat you know like I said I know it's not the proper way to make it it's homemade some of y'all might call it ghetto some of y'all might call it fate but listen here man into a job it do the [ __ ] job that rake day I take I take like a point five of that right there since it's so sticky I'll take a point five uh see little song like this throw it in a backward and you already know beam me up Scotty off to the moon but anyway that's my update for today and well that's my update for right now um I got other updates coming today so you already know what it is keep on green keep on roaming keep them big chunky and healthy this is secret city scientist

tell you about we 89 many things for me [ __ ] they all the way around looking good all the way down and that's gonna be a nice polo so this is the Amherst diesel side looking chunky smelling good then we come over here to the Chernobyl and she is looking at right his world my experience with the Chernobyl's in the past underneath home magnetic ballast cities are digital on my experience with them in the past underneath magnetic batters is that they never really filled out like that like a cola and I mean it will usually be like more more or less the lines of see like sound like this like you get like one chunk of it just one thick nug up here and then like you know I'm not over here and you know another nug over there and that that'll be like the way you all the way down I've never really seen it fill up like these so I'm really I'm really I'm really impressed with these double and two balls and and the performance they're putting out you know I'm very I'm very happy with where ye left their battle is in the double and the boat set up but I am to be honest with you i am gonna run for the legs um super high the whole deluxe dog OMG super high high pressure sodium next round inside of these instead of instead of their Pope so you know we'll see how that goes but you know I'm loving the results so far they looking good I'm supposed to water them today but on top of the weight test like I can go through Noah and I can still feel it very well very well moist i get almost squeezy and still squeeze water up so I think you know it's our and that's okay i can imagine wilson in the center so i mean another day won't hurt them yeah i mean summer i'ma let I'm member i'm gonna let them write it out for another day and you know go from there I got a lot of leaf pune to do get up indian expose a lot of them but ago just exposed that little one right there give her a fighting chance you know so you know I still gotta go do this and I have to delete a lot of material it open up bomb open a play for a lot of them other places to grow picking up you know so that's what we're looking at man four weeks one day guys cities looking sweet everything is going good oh my ended up grabbing the dirt the transplant arrested are on the veg in the veg actually is on day two oh yeah today's Monday so they did the veg tank the other tank was their first day of flour yesterday I didn't get a chance to lollypop them yesterday so I'm going to go through thoroughly today when I transplant the last 7 and give them a very you know good lolly pop in and get them ready you know to produce top quality top quality [ __ ] like this you know and i can't wait for week eight nine minutes he ought to see what the [ __ ] I'm talking about with these men like these [ __ ] right here get thick all the way down like all of that right there like you see that that's already that day more like they could say still got six weeks left six weeks I mean ten weeks they go six weeks so these things going more than doubling the size man it's crazy they like hain't really when they dried up she's bananas but anyway Yodas is secret city sciences everything looking good on my end man i hope everything body out there growing keeping it keeping it green keeping it league will hopefully and yet min amount man y'all be easy", "cEcRgGCfhR4": "[Music] [Music] what's up my canvas loving youtubers it's important bugs are blazing back and you guessed it today is harvest day so I'm going to kind of go through and show you guys how I'm gonna turn this one up and we'll just go ahead and get started I already went ahead and disinfected the whole entire closet it's basically all taken down except for like the the power strip and stuff so it's been disinfected and cleaned and I've got some string up there that's going to hold these buds up while they dry so go ahead I did I do have these scissors right here this is all I got right now that I'm gonna be using just snip these they have been disinfected with rubbing alcohol so we don't have to worry about anything contaminating these so we start with these some of these smaller ones here I can hold it still so we're going to go ahead and take off the smaller leaves here anything with trichomes we're definitely going to be keeping those this is definitely gonna take some time here to trim these all and the reason I'm trimming that you know the reason why I'm harvesting this now I was going to wait a few more days and stuff but unfortunately with the stresses and stuff that this plant took on whether it was a pH issue or a nutrient deficiency something like that it just hasn't had the smell that I would like for it to have so as you can see these stalks are pretty purple so I'm not sure you know what that was caused by whether it was a deficiency or a lockout more than likely it was probably a lockout of some sort would be my guess it's another one these little smaller ones right here maybe smaller lower buds all right you guys pretty much get the point of that I'm gonna go ahead and kind of pause the video and go through some more and then I'll bring you guys back and show you what I've got done so far so I'll see you guys here all right we show you what we've done so far that's what I've got hurt so far just get them good on that this is probably one of the bigger of the colas so I'm going to go ahead and start on this one all right she goes what I want ahend it did is these are all the leaves with no sugars on them no trichomes no nothing and then this is all the trim with any kind of little bit of trichomes on there i go ahead and i save i've got a couple of these aerial ittle tiny buds that i just kind of stuck down in there as well I'll probably be purchasing some bubble bags off of Amazon here at some point and but yeah this is this is what the stalk looks like this is just I mean most of them would be green this one's all purple it looks dead [ __ ] I just get it try to get that out of there show you guys the roots on there have it looked at those yet drying temperatures in here it looks like it's gonna be 36 humidity and 82 degrees right now temperature-wise so we're just gonna see how these do I'm gonna put them in the darkness here most of the little buds I trimmed off all the leaves but the bigger buds when you pull those leaves off I'm not sure the exact term or what the stuff is that will kind of like leak out of the stalk and just kind of run down the buds so I left those on there for now just to see I've never done it that way before so trying something new and we'll see how these do so I'm gonna go ahead and close up the closet and I'm gonna take this pot out back real quick outside and see if we can pull pull this out of there and see what the roots look like so I can have a better understanding as to maybe why this plant didn't finish out as well as I thought it was going to so I'm gonna go outside I'll be right back with you all right you guys if you take a look at these roots right here it is pretty compact swirled around it's a pretty good root ball it's hanging on there pretty good just shake some of this dirt off of here that way we can get a better look at what the root system actually looks like so I'll be right back all right this is after a lot a lot that a lot of shaking this is what my root system looks like brown brown brown roots now as far as I know healthy roots are supposed to be white these are all pretty Brown all right you guys well that was the end of the the harvest part and like I said with that smell and stuff we'll just hope that the keyring will kind of help bring out the natural aroma of the Sour Diesel and right now it's probably just you know it has that chlorophyll type smell to it you know like it's had that for about two weeks maybe even longer so that's we're just gonna wait on it and see what it does try to keep the temp and humidity under control in there I want to try to get the temps down to like 70 but it's it's like 90 almost 90 degrees here today so it's gonna be a battle trying to get the right temperatures and stuff humidity should be okay it's at like 35% right now so if I can keep that around 40 I would be happy with that so we don't dry too quick that was one mistake that I made on my last or on my very first plant was it just didn't dry properly the temperatures and humidity was just totally crazy during that time of year so oops so that's what I'm hoping for hopefully I can get that under control and get these dry properly and then we'll get them jarred up so I will be back with you guys probably when it's time to jar them up and start the curing process and stuff I might show you guys some clips of trimming up the leaves and the buds and stuff real nice so I will I will see you guys when I get to that point so it'll be you know roughly five seven days or so so I hope you guys are having a good weekend everybody have a good week next week and I'll see you guys then buzz blaze it out peace [Music]", "IMR-ASQiYcU": "[Music] [Music] YouTube was going on your steam rooms 420 head man in the back with a quick update for y'all what you're looking at right here is our last round breeding projects this in particular one right here is the inverter side with these across with the love-potion 99 it was phyno number two the the smaller bud phenyl to me anyway this one the budget assemble more of the love-potion 99 then it does the Emirates our diesel but the smell it has a real heavy gassy smell to it with a sweet undertone kind of unique which is on one of the reasons why I kept it plus like the buds of free condense dances all hell doesn't look like much but you put it on the scale man they weigh up but on what you're looking at right here is just it's just what I trimmed up just for the purpose of the video I'm gonna go ahead tomorrow morning and you know trim up the rest jar I'm off and let them you know do their thing however long it takes but um you know I'm I'm impressed with on my liking you know the it came out it came out a little bit different than I expected um you know certain phenols especially this one like this one came out more of a love-potion trade but with a heavy inverse our diesel in profile I mean see if I'll see how close I can get up in there look at the crystal production on there man frost big frost big but anyway yeah like I said man you know these just got a quick trim job just for the purpose of the video I didn't want y'all looking at a bunch of leaves so when I went through when I trimmed up you know as much as I could you know I forgot a lot of this stuff over here but you know all of that will get taken care to Marvel when I come through and do the final manicure but on overall impression I'm impressed I mean I have yet to smoke any of it so that you know will tell me a lot of what you know I need to know as far as whether I'm gonna keep it or not but so far our menses you got a spot on the tent you know the other female that I have is more of a fatter bud and I mean it still it still has that that inverse Sour Diesel you don't smell with uh with this you know sweet undertone but it's just you know bigger buzz and um to me you know by I it just looks more area these came out dance these came out really dense and the buds look similar very similar to the to the love-potion 99 it's just really the terpene profile that separates the tool you know like like if you took a love potion like in Ireland you took this and put it together they're gonna look pretty similar the only thing is the smell and I have yet to smoke it but I'm you know I'm I'm willing to bet that the taste is gonna be quite different I mean the smoke the smell in itself is unique so I'm excited about this you know these are these over here these over here with some of the top buds you know the top colas let me see if I can give y'all some to to compare it to here we go right there it is now a lot of this still won't get cut down you know that spacing between there I'll nip that you know I'll nip that space right there Bing and keep that butt right there separate these two bugs and these over here were some of the bottom branches which filled out you know just as dense as as the top branches which was another heavy trait of the love-potion 99 I mean that the the love-potion 99 phenyl that that I kept you know it kept tight internal spacing and tight you know bud sites throughout throughout the whole flowering cycle and they seem to pass it on you know to to the cross the other female that I have inside there you know it has bigger buds but to me it looks a little bit more area than than this phenyl um I have yet to smoke either one so you know ultimately that's going to tell me which ones I'm going keeping which ones is you know gonna get tossed out the garden and you know continue to either stabilize it you know back cross it or you know whatever you know I have a few options but on yeah that's how to hone in Versailles with these with love potion looking he's looking fantastic let me see if I could get it closed up come on baby focus look at that frost big yeah buddy frost big and I mean the smile on this man is its it it's heavy solid D you know but then after a while you're like wait they're kind of sweet you know but you know I'm impressed so far you know but like I said the final the final smoke test is gonna tell me it's gonna tell me everything I need to know as far as you know what I'm gonna keep and what I'm not gonna keep um I also be doing a review on the Chernobyl cross for the Java PI which by far looks better than then what sings in front of you right here not it was two different phenols that I kept out of the Chernobyl CrossFit Yavapai there was a long tall phenol that I kept that had long like forearm sized bugs on it man think is all hell - and then there was another one that has smaller buds it had the bud structure of the Java pie but the color and the smell of the Chernobyl and what I mean by that is that that phenome was you know a turn purple on damn they're black the Chernobyl during flooring and the right times it gets almost black um and you know phenol number two of chernobyl job Picross has that same trade funeral number one is the tall thick one you know I got I could just see it it's gonna be a heavy yield oh that one's coming down sometime next week um this week it was dug in her Sour Diesel love potion and like I said you know I'm pretty impressed I'm pretty impressed it's nothing but frost on over the head man you know that's so icy frosty the snow man couldn't hold that anyway man that's the quick update I just wanted y'all I just wanted to give you all a review of all of the breathing projects how everything's looking how everything's drying how everything's curing and eventually how everything smoking will get to that point in no time and you can just look at this some of these bottom bugs like these were like the bottom bottom bugs you know like way at the bottom and no they got good density today anyway see boy 20 votes for 20 yall already know what it is man keep them green keep them growing you're a mount Hayes", "6KbtmcWD2gw": "this is my Sour Diesel and it's been flowering for about ten weeks now and you can see it still has white hairs most of it's pretty much brown hairs but it still has a Brad we one second let me pull it a little closer make sure my lightsaber burning it my fans in the [ __ ] way and I like throwing away [Music] [ __ ] get you guys a better view from the bottom can get it in there turn it around get one of these shots better here we go [Music] it's [ __ ] crystally but I'm getting bugged already man this is my 10th week of growing and it still [ __ ] throwing white pistols come on now you know enough already come on start [ __ ] throwing Brown pistols and only Brown so I can harvest as you can see my leeks are yellow is because I've been flushing already for about three weeks about two weeks two and a half weeks I don't know maybe longer I have no ideas up here starting to get like a little pinkish purple ten ugly at least but it's alright the bud still good over here my newest addition to this well a budding wise let's see if I can get you there to talk shop kind of going purple already and the temperatures are not here this is mr. nice guy perv well it's pretty uh the buds are for forming pretty decent you know not bad about a lot of branches what I want to ask you guys is for the growers that are experienced out here you know the really experienced ones I have that purples you know the perfect going on not no purple stem but her believes you know what can I do to help that shade get out you know I flush my plans very often and I hear people saying that it's like a buildup of nutrients or some kind of lockout or something you know I hear that all the time that my plants have like a stalks in it you know and well not my plants but the reason why it's purple is because I was like a toxin in it and that's the reason why they go purple like that well I flush the [ __ ] out of over the still doesn't help them so I don't know what the hell do you know alright here's one of my newer ones that came in the flower box just recently is my OG Kush stems getting very fat honest good branches thick branches right here is what I talk to that still no signs yet I don't think I've been looking pretty often right in this area right here for the people that I'll know when it does turn female or male the sexes will show right there right in that area that's where my hairs will pop out or the seeds whatever you know all in sacks or the little pistols depending on what it is hope it's a female I took two clothes of it and it's in those roller pots and a really good thing over here I'm not even sure how many weeks it is in the flour maybe about two weeks three weeks so I don't know I haven't really been keeping up with this plan I haven't really been given it nutrients you know just a little bit of flushing here and there damn it's looking good [Music] like I said guys this is my Sour Diesel when it's ten weeks in a flower the hell do I do with the white pistol would you guys pick it would you guys let it grow longer than ten weeks come on now I'm on my ten weeks already that's [ __ ] a ten week strain that's all it should go but it's still going alright so this seems going on they're here got another little baby it's an OG Kush seed it's a purple OG Kush back here I know they're looking kinda bad and all that but this is my oh gee cush I had the one that's in the flower box and my other one over here back here is a purple OG Kush also and this beast right here is Casey Jones for the people no normal Casey Jones is Casey Jones is a trainwreck cross with Sour Diesel crossed with the tie and it comes with this [ __ ] right here Casey Jones and my god these [ __ ] these branches my goodness they're just growing on top of each other the [ __ ] stem is like oh my god it's almost two sides two times thicker than a closed clothesline closed hangar or whatever the hell well yeah as you can see it's growing very healthy there is no burn there's no damage it's a very green healthy plant get it off ah [ __ ] what the hell is a I don't know what that is I just noticed that right now [Music] see my lights might have touched another t-shirt I got a couple more plants over here give me one second to get them one second guys I don't want the window sill that way we had a really nice day today out here and I wanted the sunlight you know the natural sunlight to help them out I'm going to go to get them out and show you guys alright right here is my white rhino see it's growing very good very healthy starting to throw off little branches already my white rhino looking very damn good all right over here is a clone that I took of my mr. nice guy that's in my flower now the one that's flowering in mr. nice guy this is a clone I took of it and I clipped off all the leaves you know like all I made them all flat like that and you can see I got a lot of new growth you know it's already throwing a lot of deep roots and then over here really popping out but I have another mr. night uh what the hell is this oh gee cush another og cush purple purple OG Kush whatever the hell you want to call it we'll put this back in there right away that's right right there rearrange my plans I have like I said I took these out so it could be in the sunlight for a little bit all right so there's my little ugly clone yeah it's pretty ugly but it's coming back so that's all that matters it's actually alive now so I'll probably be sticking that outside in about a week maybe two weeks when he gets a little warmer you know the day times are really nice but nighttime is one cold [ __ ] all right done there yeah oh yeah here's this other one guys forgot to show you this one this is also purple OG Kush yeah man I planted so many of those og pushes you know I'm not sure guys I it might just be regular OG Kush but I'm pretty sure I said purple OG Kush when I got it it's not a 100% sure if you're I'm wrong correct me but I'm pretty sure that's called purple OG Kush so there's our one purple OG right there right right now mr. nice guy purple OG Casey Jones purple OG purple and just regular g.push to clothes so back to my flower box as fast as I can it's my video doesn't get too damn long give you guys a little shot of my back buds I harvested awhile about a week ago or two weeks ago whatever you can get this [ __ ] to focus yeah you can't really see it very well bloods better go here I'll pop out a button guys [Music] this is after caring for about five days maybe six days I'm not sure it's been hanging drying for about six days and I've been carrying it for about four or five days maybe six at the highest dam at this camera just not wonderful I'll give you guys another shot of these other bugs popcorn buds [Music] all right more so yeah look I'm asking you guys what would you guys do with this would you guys pick this plant it's on ten weeks today actually tomorrow is going to hit the ten week marker would you pick it with a cup with all these white hairs would you let it grow a little longer and see if all these white hairs start turning red would you guys do having a hard time with this I'm having I'm wanting a pick it so bad the end I see all these white pistols that it discourages me no I don't want to pick it when I see all those right like that but like I said I do have a lot of orange pistols to going I don't know so alright you guys I'm going to leave it on that and I'll be making another video right after this one for everyone that always asked me to show my grow box I've been telling them I will haven't made no video yet so after I post this video give me about another hour and I post that video alright YouTube take it easy guys letters", "2rCxs3s2SMA": "[Music] what's up my canvas loving youtubers bugs are blaze it back for another update as we get closer to harvest on this Sour Diesel let's go to the calendar here and see what day we're on it a little bit behind on marking these days today today is day 59 we're shooting for day roughly day 62 between 62 and 64 days on harvest and just took a couple hints off blaze and some of this Keef right here took a couple hits off that and let me tell you boy buds is definitely blazing right now some fire key focus good Keith and hold on get a lot of this for a while and just kind of treat myself every now and then when I need it and dealing I'll tell you what it's been about a week and a half I've been dealing with this I attica pain absolute worst man still hard to get around I got a chiropractor appointment today I already been to the hospital you know they get me vicodin and you know all that [ __ ] [ __ ] vicodin man [ __ ] vicodin [ __ ] the opiates that's not medicine till then I'm trying to medicate with this is Keef and tell you what if I call offense a [ __ ] so try not to call but um but what we're doing today is we're gonna give her another flush today I'm gonna take a gallon of the REO water what's left of that I'm gonna run that through and then I'm gonna take and probably run about three three gallons or so my PPM's on the last run off last time was at 190 so I'm guessing today we'll probably get it down pretty low with three to four gallons so I'm gonna go ahead and get down there keep in mind I'm not in the best shape right now to get down there but I'm gonna get the camera down there for you guys and start running some water through and we'll see what we can get our PPM's down to and that way you guys can take a look at the plant - all right you read that all right just ran a little bit through there and that actually absorbed quite a bit before it started to get any runoff go ahead then ran through let that drain now he's gallant number two and just so you know I didn't I didn't end up pH in that I just went ahead and let that go down through it's really the pH is only four if you're going to fear wanting it to uptake the nutrients and at this point we don't want it let's go ahead and take our cyclin pump here market cycle pump take it out I love this other picture it's what our color looks like okay that's just the first little bit of runoff so it's not too much yet run the third gallon through [Music] and then we'll probably check the PDMS right after that okay we get that ppm reading again for you guys because it did go up from the last time and that could be it's not hope this could be because of the drainage from the yeah keep the ends are 250 and obviously it went up from 190 to 250 but that just could be drainage from all the stocks and stuff like that that could have added to that number so we're going to run at least another gallon through maybe two and see what you can get after that but let's go ahead and I'm gonna get another gallon ready and we'll check it after that yeah here we go the gallon [Music] okay you guys I just ran the fourth gallon gallon number five see what we get ppm wives after we run this through all right you guys after doing about 5 gallons or so I was able to get the PP ends down to 96 so I mean that's not as low as I'd want it to be but I mean I'm not gonna run any more water through it so this lady basically I'm just gonna let this dry out and then probably when the soil is dry get this little bit and dry that's probably a little heartless so it'll be a few days maybe about four days or so five days see yeah we'll check it out at that point close up on some you know overall view the plant there stop just doesn't look healthy at all for some reason I mean it's I always see nice green stalks and this one's far from nice and green we'll see how she harvest so we'll probably be back here in a couple days and be harvesting so I will catch you guys then budget blazing out peace [Music]", "uIBrl1PY9g8": "what is going on welcome back to the I smoke Channel and another cannabis inspired video with me your host Tyler Greene today I'm gonna be taking another look at a strain that we've covered before but this is a new version of it ladies and gentlemen this is Sour Diesel bx2 so Sour Diesel is actually one of those legendary cannabis strains it is believed to have originated as a hermie seed in a packet that came from a cross of chem dog and super skunk by the man chem dug himself a strain which as I said we've covered previously on the channel but now there exists a new version of it be x2 is the short term for the backcross Sour Diesel is actually the parent of the head banger which is a very famous common genetic strain as well what he's done here is he's used his Sour Diesel female as the mother plant he's then crushed that with his biker cush male he's then back crossed the Saudi crossed with biker crush with the mother plant again so this is Sour Diesel mother Y kirkish father the result of that then we crossed back to the Sour Diesel mother to lock in those traits that is what we've got here I am expecting a hybrid strain Sour Diesel is a very strong sativa strength mica cush is a strong indicator this should be more like the Sour Diesel ciders it's a B x2 but it should also have a little bit of influence of that og that boy could cush influence it's a very strong male that Carmen takes is using for that as well so yeah that is what I expect when it comes to the Sour Diesel let's talk about the appearance of this cannabis strain right off the bat I can tell you that this looks like a lovely bit of bud I love the shape of this nug it is protruding in all directions all the calyxes fighting their way away from the sense of mass an interesting thing that I picked out about the coloration of this bud it has got more Browns in oranges and browns in the layers amongst the greens you sort of see more complexity in the color than I have in perhaps trains that I've covered in recent weeks the pistols are there they're out in full force but they are not sort of bold and big and wild look in they sort of look like the collectors have almost grown over them like green color very good trim job very good shape to it very high density to it gosh that is almost rock-solid there's a bit of give to it but that is very dense this and I wouldn't be surprised if this weighs a couple of grams it's a really nice-looking bit of bud let's talk about the smell of this cannabis train initially what I'm getting is this nice sort of light scent which I wasn't expecting doesn't remind me of Sour Diesel or by Turkish but it is because the bud has not been disturbed that's just the scent that's coming out the jar let us first smell this then we're going to crack it and smell it some more not giving too much away just yet I'm getting hints of the Sour Diesel but it is not terribly strong but kind of an old-school smell to it it's not super pungent in fact would have really worried about leaving this out on the side at the moment it's not a lot of rum or escaping from this bud let's get an idea of how the Sour Diesel bx1 really smells here we go that is what I was looking for it is got a incredible amount of the pungency that you get in the skunk plant an incredible amount is really pungent it's kind of like a a smoother or a cleaner pungency than you get from those truly skunky strains but it has got that smell to it it has got a slight gasp it's sort of seeping into my nostrils along with the pungency it's got this boom that kicks in it's like kick up and fun the kicker it makes it a bit more wish that's what I call gassy that kind of jet fuel type learn to the nostrils it's got a little bit of that in as well yeah this one smells like diesel it's got that easily smell to it I know I would say that this is perhaps more easily distinguishable a diesel smell than I have ever smelt in my life before this is the most true to the term diesel that I have come across in terms of cannabis Wow mad because before I broke it open I wasn't getting any scent and it's like the center of the bud super impressed with the smell of this one guys in fact let's grind it up just get an idea of whether for listen any extra flavor notice when it's been ground it's like a gassy pungent diesel it's not hundred percent sure I shouldn't be putting this in my car is potent without further ado let's talk about the taste of the Sour Diesel bx2 I've just remembered a little bit more information about the Sour Diesel actually the biker cush that goes into the Sour Diesel BX is the biker cush that is the male in karma genetics headbanger it's the male when the cell power OG it is a really really strong plant that you guys probably have smoked or the descendants from it one of the two let us see how this is going to taste through the eye smoke bomb join me for this one you know what to do get yourselves ready get those joints rolled bongs ready dab rigs heated up I'm about to hit this bowl and I'll see you all on the other side Cheers [Music] [Music] clean gassy that these always creeping through through the bolt the pungency isn't there as much but it's got this kind of strong expansive sort of taste to it pics fantasy but my lungs now the intensity of that bowl is hitting me slightly after the fact I wonder why that it's not to be sure on that one while we our second Bowl I've also got a right got the mighty here filled with the Sour Diesel so we're gonna see how it tastes get a good idea with the flavor profile in my opinion you need a vaporizer to get a good accurate idea of the flavor of your cannabis during me Bowl number two Sour Diesel see you on the other side [Music] and it hit is clean but it hits hard feels like the trichomes on it ever expanding in my lungs is probably the best way I can describe it interest in the different feeling inhaling that bomb it's not a critics not making me need to cough it's just nice and nice and intense and I can tell you is strong cuz I can already feel this start kicking in but we're still on the flavor section let's go whoa there's two or three strains that do this the gas eNOS is so strong that it's making my eyes water from the first puff of the of the mighty Skywalker og does this crow man Skywalker oh gee which just won second place in the UK Kanaka indica category that does the same so wonder whether it's an OG thing it's like this strong sort of piercing pungency and gas that just comes through in the first hit of the vape and I've got that with this it's a really nice flavor guys it tastes like diesel mixed with weed mixed with gas mixed with skunk that's the best way I can describe it that's about everything I'm getting from the flavor let's talk about the effects of Sour Diesel this new BX cross of Sour Diesel is strong from when I started inhaling the second bomb I think I started to feel the impact of the first one it only took a few minutes it's only gonna get stronger it is a sativa leaning strain but it also has those slight indica traits brought to it from the black oak if I feel particularly chipper I'm enjoying filming this review today and I think the effects are kicking off nicely in my system at the moment this is the sort of strain that I can imagine myself smoking if I've got [ __ ] to do if I've got anywhere to go and I want to get high and still be sort of up be actually this would be a perfect one to smoke before cannabis events when I want to be high but I want to be in the right frame of mind the network chatter people sometimes I'll go too far with the indicas you smoke the wrong strain and it just makes you want to sort of chill out I'm out what's going on you know there's some strains that are suited but when I'm at home chilling in the evening this is maybe not one of those it feels like it's sped me up a bit actually quite like it there's something's up I'm getting more and more stoned as I talk to you now this has been an interesting strain to smoke the appearance of it was very very nice indeed I like to look at this one good marks from me didn't give off much snow initially maybe because the sample is a little bit older when I broke it open it smell absolutely fantastic most like diesel strain I've ever smelled smoke in it and vibes in it I enjoyed the smoking experience and the taste of the vapor very nice strain in all areas guys including the effects got me chatty got me bouncing around a bit look lucky I'm standing up amok and I feel more free to move there's been about 10 more minutes and I am really feeling super high right now this has definitely got some indica in it it's definitely like hitting me in a buddy highway as well so I've got like a wave an awesome wave that started with the uplift the chattiness and then the strength of it has actually made me so when I sit down I sort of zoned out for a minute I thought you know what I need to do a quick update just to let you know that this is stronger even than I anticipated even when I was doing the review I was like wow actually I'm getting more and more stoned here and yes sort of culminated now in me feeling extremely chilled out so all I want to do is say props to karma genetics and chem dank this is a really good strain in terms of his genetics this sample has been done really well I've enjoyed this review what do you think of this video do leave your comments below and let me know what you think of Sour Diesel and if you've had the pleasure of smoking this particular variety remember to hit that like and subscribe button it helps the channel grow I'll be back soon that's it for the moment as always thanks for watching and keep talking your roller coaster going down but I never felt this high biggest right of the century [Music]", "qmGNhhsf1GE": "due to what up just 20 rooms back with another update right now when the veg tent and these girls well the lights are getting cut off in about four hours and they're gonna stay off for this six hour cycle when the lights kick back on at six o'clock tonight I'm gonna transplant all of the Amherst diesel which is these two rolls over here and them two over there and the seven Chernobyl's I went through the other day and I gave him a decent lollipop and and I also thought when I went through and talked to each one I took a lot of client wall I took nine clones off of the Chernobyl's cuz in a week from well in a week from today these things are going into flour so I took a bunch of clones out well I took nine clones off the Chernobyl's and I took ended up taking 12 clones off of the Amherst diesel now what I did with the Amherst diesel I don't see the the Chernobyl's I just talked to my regularly compliment but with with the Amherst diesel I came and I actually took that whole top as a clone so late this plant just plant right here you know the top was like you know right way right up to there and I went and I took that whole that whole piece for clone instead of taking you know some verses you know down there um the reason for that is I wanted to get them a little bit more pushed out so I went through and I took clones off each 12 of the Amherst diesels and man clones animals um I gave them their water in a little while ago but these things are drinking these things are done yeah I got a lot of these things like every day by by the end of the day these things are freaking light so like they ro pound they're ready to be transplanted I'm gonna transplant them now give them a week to UM get used to the today new dirt let the roots spread out a little bit and then I'm gonna flip them into flour when the other tank is exactly four weeks in so the other time will be four weeks into harvest I mean the other time will be four weeks in the flour then I flip these and and then my clones with syrup here will go into veg and those will go into flour four weeks from today so I'll be on every I'll be on a monthly schedule so that's what I'm hoping on so as soon as the other tents flowering that's what these clones are gonna go into the other tent the flower and before these go into flower I'll take clones on for these and those will go back inside this tent when this is done so the girls are looking good everything's green everything's lush these arms Chernobyl's like I sold using the last bit in the last veg video they were kind of like I hit him with a full-strength loot the nutrients and they they green right up everything's looking good everything's looking healthy um yeah there it is guys veg these will be here I'm gonna save I'm gonna save them see this one right here was supposed to be animal cookies but it's not animal cookies I don't know what the hell it is but it's fire I went through when I great guy gave it an aggressive topping I want to keep these from other plants these three big ones over here I'm gonna keep from other plants okay these two over here are Chernobyl's and this is that mystery one that I told you about that was supposed to be like that animal cookies just it's definitely it strikes you more like avid easel just like by the papaya the growth pattern like the buds the way everything looks when it finishes it strikes me more of a diesel strain than than anything else did the curling that you see up here is cuz I did kind of long to transmit them they got kind of root bound the roots didn't have nowhere else to go so sometimes they have a tendency to curl up but everything should be straight it's really it's not cause like if you look at the tips nothing's burnt gonna mean everything straight so it's not any nutrients it's just they will root bound for a while and they were kind of mad at me but they're inside the three gallon pot so give him a couple of days in about a week they'll be happy again same thing with these arm Chernobyl's over here I came through and I aggressed I aggressively lollypop them um get some nice big shoots coming out of here so what I'm gonna do is okay here here how is it gonna work sixteen plants are gonna go into flower that's gonna be nine of the nine of the inverse diesel are gonna go into flower with these seven Chernobyl's 16 plants and the leftover ones which is going to be three of the Amber's diesel I'm gonna take three of the smallest ones that the three runs and I'm gonna save them to fly our mother demo so I'm gonna have three mother plants of the MS diesel two mother plants of the Chernobyl's and one mother plant of this mystery batch I went through and I took four clones of this mystery one so I could throw inside the tent for the next round it's gonna go inside the other tent but that's where we're at on veg guys everything's looking good and yeah I'll see you in the bottom of this well what I'll do is I'll make another update after I transplant so probably tomorrow I'll upload another video of the girls transplanted in the new 3 gallon pots Maison happy where they're gonna spend the rest of their life um if if I was gonna get these bigger like bushes what I would do is I would normally put them inside three gallons and let them get real bushy and then take that right and I will cut the bottom off of the bag and fill up a five gallon tote and just sit this right on top of the dirt so I actually get more more root space for for the roots to spread out versus you know burying the whole thing up to there and wasting a whole lot of room zone so what I'll do is you know I'll cut the bag all the way around over here exposing the dirt exposing the roots and I'll just sit that right on top of the filled 5-gallon bucket filled with there so we got five it actually has five whole gallons of soil to spread out in two verses I don't know three or this is a three gallon pot so if I was to put this in a five gallon pot it would only have two gallons of soil to spread out versus the way I do it you know has a hole five gallons of soil to spread his roots out and do it I tell you by doing it like that they they just blow out they blow out like they say more root more fruit guys the old timers but um yes his veg let's all see the clones up here real quick this tray this tray of the clones is the Chernobyl's which are these nine over here and then we got four of that mystery you know fake cookies because it's not the animal cookies I know that but home yeah and over here I got a guy gotta spray these things too before the lights go out the lights go in 300 songs clones gotta get sprayed and over here we have the Amherst our diesels they look good everything looks lush these clones were taking two days ago you know will tend nothing everything's going according to plan everything's looking good so what I'm gonna do is sorry I'm just trying to get that cover back on so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna cut the video here I'm gonna head over to the flower tent show y'all what's going on over there yep secret city scientist aka 20 rooms a mountain man y'all take it easy and happy growing peace", "4QSuFq2lMEk": "what's going on to all my growers out there so outdoor 2020 actually before i get started we're up to 25 subscribers thank you so much for all the love the comments the support the feedback the tips the tricks i appreciate it keep it coming all right so um as you know i finished everything indoor so everything's hanging drying essentially uh and here you have it this is a sapphire scout outside so yeah this year during the summer i thought i'd take advantage of the uh of the weather and then try to do some stuff outside as well so this one's been going since i would say maybe like late may uh yeah she's pretty big so fire scout my humble seeds this one is sitting in a 10 no i believe this is a 15 gallon bag um and yes did a lot of straight training on that and that was pretty good this one is a uh this is the amherst cyrus diesel uh by humboldt seed as well a lot younger i had to uh essentially wait before i started growing that one since we're only allowed so many plants so i'm off with the time it's not like i started all four plants at the same time outside so they're all at different stage in their growth but uh yeah this one is uh starting to look pretty good as well this is in a a 10 gallon bag um and yeah you'll see actually this is uh old shot this is about seven or eight days old now um when it comes up to the next shot here you'll see how it's uh bushed up essentially uh but this is uh i go back to the sapphire scout again um so it's just getting bigger taller the branches are getting a lot more uh solid on it this was probably like 7-8 days again after the previous shot you saw so uh everything is looking good there's even a some pistols that are showing up but i don't think i caught it in a shot there but uh yep it's looking good it's looking great i don't see too much uh issues with nutrients everything is nice and green uh and look at the uh amorous sarah diesel so you see how it bushed up was from topping it a few times and did some little stress training to it and uh just hope she gets a bit taller but so far so good again uh no major concerns outdoors doing going pretty good to be honest with you and there's no caterpillars like um we've been very good at least in my area with the weather mind you it did rain the last two days but uh it is what it is those are uh quite small and uh that's again because i can only grow so many plants so i started those like very not literally not too long ago um that last one we just went over was a surprise train i don't know what i don't know what it is i got found some seats somewhere and uh i grew that and then this one is another amherst cyrus diesel so um all four of these uh little girls are gonna try to make it to uh to the point where they start flowering and hopefully i get some size on the last two to the left uh but for the two on the right here i have no doubt that they will be pretty good and mind you guys uh as far as nutrients or whatnot all i'm using for these ones is compost tea okay i'm not using any uh any kind of uh of chemicals whatever the case is now this is the uh indoor stuff that's been hanging for some time now and the last so i had cut the tops off the blue gelato and i it took me 10 days to dry this to dry those so now we're at day number five um for the rest of the harvest and everything's looking good uh something i'm learning is last year when i did a grow i had nowhere to drive so i ended up going into the garage and um it was like 80 degrees in there and i noticed every time i'd burped the garage you would like it would smell nothing but like dank which was amazing but then realized that i was probably evaporating everything so when i open the tent and i uh you know mess around with the buds and whatnot yeah i actually don't smell i mean it smells like butter don't get me wrong but it's not overpowering if anything i kind of smell the uh the smell of vegetation when it's essentially dying or whatever the case is so uh which is a good sign because that means you know i'm not losing too much terpenes or whatever the case is my temperatures must be right as far as humidity goes i'm probably off i don't have anything that i'm it's actually uh measuring anything with but i'm just going to wing it and we'll take it as it is right so this is some blue gelato that i've been carrying and you still have the agro-meters in there and it's sitting at about 66 percent so just trying some new things trying to figure out how to dry how to cure it properly because that's always the stage that i screw up and there are some shots of the some of the small nugs that i have for my blue gelato and it is so hard not to smoke these things the moment you put your you open that jar up you just want to like go in it and and then curl up and spend the night but anyways um yeah this is uh where we're at so far this growth has been pretty cool a lot of things that i would do different obviously but um hey trial and error you live and you learn and that's it so so some pretty interesting stuff coming up next week can't tell you right now but it will be pretty cool so just hang in there and stay tuned until then you know the drill be safe wear your mask wash your hands do what you got to do but stay alive to the next one peace", "lBr9JqnUvtg": "hey guys good morning everybody I'm grateful J here what's going on this is nuking and today is her last day harvest some of these top branches it is gonna be a staged harvest because I want to give the lower branches some more time and I want to try doing

in here and get closer because you guys gotta see this beautiful videotape some of the harvest but this stuff is outrageous dude and it's so huge it was a good eight foot plan that's beautiful isn't

got some trimming there were some harvesting to do this morning and I'll get back with y'all later hope everybody's well and warm and smoke some weed today haha love y'all peace out", "G0lStnQeepE": "okay folks this is an update here is the critical plus and you can see it is what's different that the Amber's Sour Diesel but you'll notice how lovely everything is looking it is just incredible so maybe now you get an idea of why was popping yeah I am very very very happy", "VLDeeCW9B1g": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] what's going on Digital collective my name is steve stephenson welcome to the show how y'all doing today I hope things are going smoothly it's been kind of drab whether you're in the state of Maryland for the past couple days I don't blame Maryland I blame myself for not going someplace ani yeah but that being stated I may be on my way to someplace sunny so I'm going to get this video in here too yeah it would alleviate anything else I got going home today we're going to take a quick look at as quick as I can we're gonna take a look at Sour Diesel I have two separate soured Diesel's grown by two separate growers at two separate price points yeah so one of them I got is $180 ounce from nature's medicines on route 40 um Ellicott City Maryland that's what I actually we really got both of these buds but um growers I'm not entirely sure according to weed maps there are three different growers that grow the same product here in Maryland so yeah I don't know I'm not entirely sure it's gonna be hard for me to track this down considering none of my labels really have that much information on them they might tell something here and there but um generally speaking they're not that full of information sorry folks but uh yeah this was more or less taking a look at bang for buck and once you get exactly for the price range as I stated I don't want to discuss growers just discuss the price points and the value or the quality versus whatever else is on the market so I got the interrogator here and our first look is going to be at a product called Sour Diesel number five I don't know who grows it I would rather not say even if I did know but um this is the Sour Diesel number five I don't think that's gonna autocorrect really anyways it's a really thick bud it's it's so word I'm looking for it has a lot of density to it it's not very spongy if I was to give this a pinch there's no gift to and it was just crushed though in terms of bud it's a lighter color the other you know back in the day I did a review on Sour Diesel that was like almost the color of iceberg lettuce it was a very light green you know like yeah just a really light green I can't come up with a better word for it unfortunately I don't know too many colors I know when I was younger Crayola had 72 of them that numbers probably doubled by now so back to the topic um this particular but if I'm just giving it a quick looking glance it does have a Sour Diesel smell to it um let me see now I don't really have much information on here but this was a higher in but I got this at $40 an eighth I believe it's not bad but it's not very good either like price wise for what Bud is worth or which you can get it for another means if you weren't buying it legit you could get it for a lot cheaper just across the line you don't I'm saying um so this is a more expensive Bud but it actually only has 17 percent THC and if I was doing a comparison the side by side to this other Sour Diesel see if I can get a bun of this stuff and this stuff looks a little bit more chunky to it it's not a super dense bud it's still generally speaking feels like a flower and if I was comparing and contrasting the two I mean they both look like really exquisite buds but I got to be honest I kind of like the look of the cheaper one its fluffier you would get more you would have more sigh of product versus weight of product as those smaller denser nugs you would get less of them so in that sense yeah I'm totally cool with it um other than that they both look really good I mean this a cheaper one and when I use the word cheaper I just mean in price this cheaper Sour Diesel is actually sitting the one of the more expensive we'll call number five because it's actually listed as Sour Diesel number five where is it yeah okay so the cheaper one is plain Sour Diesel and that one actually smells in my humble opinion it smells better it tastes better it smokes a lot smoother it's a smoother toke all around and it's a lot cheaper like buying I'm gonna I think like also the the heavier stuff is like two forty to eighty announced something like that so you know what I mean all things considered it's not um yeah if it was me I would go with this cheaper one just because I'm not against cheap buds but these buds here actually one of my favorite strings so if I had to choose I would choose something like this this is one of them scenarios where I didn't even go in for an ounce I wanted to go for a different deal of nature's medicines does what was it quarters for like thirty or thirty five a shake which isn't bad I use the Keefe end of my weed actually I have a shaker I said do a video on that sometime but I try to shake the majority of my weed and then I use the Kiefer projects or some hash type scenario always come up with something creative to do with it yeah if you all follow me on Instagram you'd probably see some of the creative projects i made the layer cake it was a cold practice the gritty super world it might work well if you were at a hotknife it you take like a piece of metal a hot piece of metal and you know that may work but uh yeah that didn't work so well I got a new one that I'm working on that's really cool quick thing if I found out another youtuber watches my videos I don't know that I want to shout about like that but he's left the message in my comments mentioning something about edibles I'm gonna try to make a video doing tinctures and doing RSO these are the two products that have an interesting rumor has it the tink atures or however you say it they activate a little quicker because there's an alcohol base to them I'm not much a drinker that doesn't mean I won't do what I have to do to make make it happen you don't I'm saying so yeah we'll do a an RSO video of how to make RSO yeah and then I guess the tink atures will do something with that and then maybe we'll take that RSO and use it to cook with or something I'm not entirely sure but um yeah I am thinking about this I've put it on my to-do list and um yeah I might just try eating weed for a period of time it might be a a changeup on the moon and it was a self-proclaimed doctor we got a doctor ourselves or try different things to see what works holy sorry about that interruption folks I had a pipe malfunction I just didn't have a pipe I had to run and grab one so yeah we back to the story here we got two different buds at two different price points the one I'm gonna start with first is the higher end bud higher costing mode not that there's anything wrong with the either one of these buds both of them are in my opinion solid weed I would be honored to smoke either one of them but like I say we were doing a compare and contrast today of which one in my opinion is the better bud and I've already discussed it's the it's the lower end but yeah I'm going to give an honest opinion on this product and you tell G leaf does oh I don't think this is G leaf I could be wrong but G leaf does a Sour Diesel and they're one of my um I don't want to say one of my favorites because I'm impartial but I like a lot of their buds I think that's so much more honest way to put it yeah as companies I try not to put any of them ahead of the other because well they all put out killer [ __ ] it's just waning of what booboo it's not bad you know it's really not that bad but I gotta be honest with you it doesn't have a specific flavor that cries out like by me and that was just on the higher end bud and they could say crosswise it's about $100 difference per ounce yeah I mean it does taste like really good weed it's just not there is no standout flavor you know what I'm saying bang for buck and it's unfortunate because this is one of my favorite streams I was really looking forward to seeing you know I'm looking for that really sour really diesel bud and it doesn't have to be Sour Diesel because they have these flavors and other weeds but um yeah there's just something about Sour Diesel that's a really good good - I mean this will be my cheaper bud and by cheaper it's just in cost and not in quality you know what I mean all things considered respectively speaking yeah in nature's medicines has a tier system so this would be the difference between top tier and bottom tier or mid tier and bottom tier murder huh see that's magic right there smacks lips yeah it was really badass that was actually a super good hit it doesn't have a super lingering taste like some of the other buds but um the instant flavor is just gratitude or you know what I mean it's it's great it's amazing and like I say bang for buck I mean you can spend a lot on buds but if you can get a bud like this at a price like that a 180 an ounce that's really not that bad for getting something store-bought that's a you know right off the shelf hmm so yeah that's my honest opinion on this one Sour Diesel first versus Sour Diesel number five in my humble opinion I'm going with the original Sour Diesel and the number five I'll still smoke it I mean I wrote a joint of it earlier and wasn't that bad yeah but the other one I gave a digital high-five to the groomer that's some good [ __ ] y'all are smoking it yeah hmm maybe someday I'll find out how they grew how they decide to grew what they grow you know what I mean maybe they grew like a test sample hmm but folks I guess that's about it this has been Steve stephenson with male marijuana review providing an honest opinion on the products I buy and today this was more a bud verse Bud Sour Diesel vs. our diesel 5 now and the Sour Diesel gets the gold title or the golden star we'll give them a little gold star for the day now but thank you folks ever an ounce pleasure peace", "mBA7TD7pFTk": "well outright outright all right let's welcome back with the first time growth this is once again yet another harvest so with this harvest right now we got some Sour Diesel strains in the tent we also got some OG Kush this thing is very potent very powerful smoke really helps you get a good night's sleep at night and once again we got the Green crack I bought this plant because it was really high demand the dispensary is where I live and it's really good I got to admit I like this plan also so we got the Giga bud plant once again and Giga bud is a good plant but it grows funny and I don't think I'm gonna be keeping this one so and the last plant is candy cane which has become one of my favorites for tasting and enrollment and smells this thing is just absolutely lovely now check it out these plants at the end of week 8 I have been keeping them in darkness and they're still in darkness right now and while they're drying so right now before we cut them all down we got to mark these plants we got to put the coat hangers because we cut them right at the base and then we hang the whole plant upside down this thing helps me a lot it saves time the foliated all these 11 plants right here took me and the wife approximately three hours so yeah three hours is a long time you really do want to get help so thankfully I have a nice beautiful wife that helps me do this stuff so here you go with the night shots these plants are finely cut they're hanging upside down and it's really beautiful look at them alright now eleven plants drawing you don't want to keep them all so close because you don't want to get them to get moldy and stuff like that so you try to let them breathe I did turn off my fan because when I didn't turn off my fan my last harvest I did notice that they were drying out a lot too quick and then up with really really dry weed which is not something I liked so yeah so the fans off right now no light has been on while these things have been drawing and I gotta admit this is probably going to be a really good harvest and it does look like it's gonna be over a pound now hanging plants upside down some people say it originated by bats who's to say I mean some people say yes some people say no but in the end we don't really quite know if bats taught us how to hang the plants upside down but in my opinion they really did they honest well alright so now that we got that out of the way I mean just take a look at one of the plants that I cut down and this thing pretty much took me about 45 minutes to trim anyways very beautiful sort about this time you know I always post on how much I harvested from my harvest I always try to aim for a pound but before we do this check it out the bags of shake at the bottom that's from all the trim that I have I really never add that to the harvest weight because it's just stuff routable so check it out right here there we got the Sour Diesel and here we got the green crock let's just try to see what the green crack one looks like just try to get a close-up right there and the green crack very good smoke very high buzz and and it's pretty good and then here we got my og cush this is one of my favorites it's a good high actually puts you down it's a good time to have before bed or maybe just have it at work that's pretty much what I do and then here you go we got some OG Kush here and here we got the candy cane now with the candy cane I really love this plant this plant really does taste good and really does gives you like a sativa type buzz it's really good and I'm deciding this is a keeper I'm always gonna clone it and always gonna have it now this is the giga but this gigabyte plant grows really weird and I'm not going to keep it around we're done with the giga bud we're not gonna go any more but it is a good smoke alright so now it's time for the harvest weight let's see how much I got now that I get a pound or more let's see with three planets of the Sour Diesel I got 110 grams with the green crack two plants I got 45 grams now that's not good alright so we got the OG Kush with three plants I harvested 53 grams now what's going on it's the nutrients I used I swear so it's candy cane with two plants 67 grams and there you go with the Giga bud with one plant I grew 26 now with the nutrients lineup that I use it was just cal-mag and pH my water and that was pretty much it with liquid karma I didn't given any but enhancements so maybe that's where I went wrong and and maybe not the foliated this whole girl so anyways this is the harvest I hope everybody likes there's more to come I'm gonna post more videos and another harvest video to come", "IAT95kn9T84": "[Music] Sour Diesel comes in around 21 22 percent THC on average it's a poly hybrid some of the stories a little unknown but we know that it's a Massachusetts Super Skunk - a Northern Lights 5 and then maybe two and ohok in CHEM a little unsure on that part what we have is a strain that finishes the end of October outside 77 days indoor Sour Diesel at least the cut that we run at the shop has a tremendous yield potential and so we're looking at anywhere up to 12 13 pounds in a three to four hundred gallon pot outside and 3.2 pounds under a de 1000 indoor thus our D is it's a foundation strain of modern cannabis it has a very rich fuel like flavor coupled up with a very nice citrus tone that clears it and gives it a very uplifting effect unbelievably popular with smokers and with growers it's a longer flowering strain and so you have to make sure you pay attention to that seventy seven days is a little while indoor and so you have to make sure that you get all your inputs planned so that you're able to know that it's not gonna finish in nine it's going to finish in eleven and so it's an important consideration so you can get all your nutrient timing in place Sour Diesel like most of the cushions is magnesium hungry and so I would say supplement with additional magnesium all through veg and into flour in terms of velocity it moves like I'm saying both the track star you see it and then it's going the east coast is the main market for this cultivar but well done Sour Diesel has basically an unlimited distribution [Music]", "oeMwsR-rkx0": "ol\u00e1 everybody welcome to day 29 of the Amherst Sour Diesel bro we do have a little bit of variation though in here I had ordered five Sour Diesel thinking I could fit five in and I have fit one two three four five in trouble is is this little one is a Sour Diesel and her sour diesel that just failed to to keep up with everyone else so I went and popped critical class seed that kena was a free seed that came with the order so it's the only indica now in the bunch now the other interesting thing is one of this 20 of these things is not like the other we have for Andrus our diesels that this is one of them this is another and this is yet another the fourth is this one see something different so I don't know what happened this one acted like it was choked for a while I brushed a piece of seed husk off the stock and suddenly it took off but it looks like more like this but it looks like a lush indica so obvious seem to see what that one puts out but it's supposed to be an adverse sour diesel so I have removed all the fan leaves from these three and I've topped them and I've actually tried to do what's called Femi which is [ __ ] I missed so when you take the top off you actually got a really good picture of it here but you actually kinda instead of having to shoot off you pinch the top usually get two shoots coming out in this case I might have three coming out here or four because I actually pinched about Oh two-thirds of the way down the bud instead of pitching the whole butt off and it gives you often what's called the [ __ ] I missed or film result if you're lucky so that's it day 29 for some her Sour Diesel d9 for the critical plus we will keep you up to date as best we can and I'm just not being as yeah as I should be doing more but anyway these are looking good the soil has all been amended properly so we've got some general a guy at general 444 we've got some won 13-6 we've got some glacier dust in here as well for more of things like calcium and minerals and we'll see how it goes they look absolutely beautiful I have not added any liquid fertilizer whatsoever nothing at all just watered and I've sprayed them with some seaweed I some kelp juice other than that that's it so they seem to be going playing well so we'll leave if it ain't broke don't fix it so there you go folks we'll see how this girl goes you guys have a wonderful evening and we'll talk to you very soon", "zJNBGs48yX4": "what is up YouTube we're back in the flour room just wanted to do a weekly update they're getting pretty close they are actually they're starting to fall over a little too much I didn't plan ahead and I don't have enough green tape so some of them are just kind of sitting in here and overlapping I mean as long as you don't have like high humidity or any kind of like moisture building up in the room for the most part you should be okay but I do come in here like every day and just kind of make sure everything's nice because we're getting towards the end here but yeah so let's see here I have been feeding them I believe it's we shoot we hold on a second I've been feeding him week 10 off the Fox Farm schedule and I do still remove some of the nitrogen I don't put the grow big in there currently I might do it every two weeks I think I said that on the last video you really you don't need much but you still do need a little bit I'm not gonna go into that because I'm pretty sure we discussed it in the last video but yeah so we're on week ten still got maybe I mean what a week to to go here they're already starting to yellow but I mean they haven't sucked in all the hairs yet as you can see there's still quite a few just going on a lot of new growth coming in still but yeah I mean that's that's no biggie because these things do get pretty big pretty big nugs on these this one however will probably have you know more moderate size nuts because of the bushy effect that we got going here but like I said it did this on its own and I just didn't have the time to really keep it up so this is just how it how it ended up I just actually put these in the flour because I didn't have any herbs so I mean that's the only reason I floured them other plants but I could I could easily take clones from the next next batch coming in here and have the next little army ready I might even go with a whole different strain just because I'm probably gonna be making a few videos and I know it's it's I mean it's fun seeing seeing some some pretty good grows and learning how things go on on a particular grow but I mean you really it's it's fun to explore and just try all the try all the different varieties that are out there attitude seed banks really nice I mean there's really no no reason to not get pure genetics when it comes to growing these days because I mean as you can see I mean you're it's it's just actually if you really can't see it's hard on this camera to get the true glory of these however these plants can only go as far as the genetics can take them I mean you could juice these puppies up and everything and just have them have them like doing great no burns no stress no nothing but I mean it's only going to go as far as that DNA is gonna take it there so I mean it's good to start with just the top-notch genetics and go from there try to try to get that as good as you could go because that has a pretty high bar when it comes to what you could do with it you know you could definitely play with it some of them might be a little more picky though but I mean that just goes without saying some strains are harder to grow than others and I mean it really comes down to pH and the atmosphere and I mean just general things that the plant needs that might be a little bit different than what you're giving it I mean that's a given though so yeah not much not much else to see in here like I said we have a couple overlapping branches would I which I wouldn't recommend doing if I had green tea I would fix that I did fix some of this other lower part that was falling down but there's still quite a few lower branches down here and like I was telling you guys the lower nugs on these things are just they turn out amazing they're just coated and white I mean there's no point to lollipop this plan I mean look at that it's just white the little powder white balls like all the way down to the bottom but with this plan both these plants we're probably going to go over a little bit of selective harvesting and how I treat the plant after I selective harvest because sometimes when you're doing that you really don't want to leave just you know an open open wound on these plants you want to kind of keep that in but we'll go over that on the on that video when it comes time probably about a week or so just because like I said I don't have any herbs so I'm definitely down to harvest a little bit early to smoke and not spend money this is all personal so I mean whatever I do is just for me I mean I might help people out but I mean I never get anything off of it I mean this is just it's for fun and I mean it's probably one of the most rewarding hobbies you could do so yeah I guess that's it till next week or later on in this week we will check back and anything I do you guys will see I want to say thanks to all the new subscribers - that really helps me a lot I'm trying to get to a thousand it's not an easy thing to do but I'm hoping I'm hoping I could say some stuff that might help everyone out and be able to get my goal I guess that's the best way to say it anyway I'll see you guys later on this week all right like and subscribe peace", "gLNGoIK0zZ8": "due to what's going on and she boy twin rules here back with another update well this is the flower tent and I know it's not as pretty as on the first run that I had going on it's a totally different style of growing it's not my preferred method of growing but I do have some product but they're looking decent you know they're just compared to like the last ones like I can completely hug these before their little things were monsters and you know that's that's what I prefer um see I got 12 I've got 12 a.m. Hertz diesel just on this one side you know four rolls of four and you know I couldn't land them got a little bit of bigger there's still a lot of space in between so I mean this this run right here was kind of rushed just for the simple fact that I needed a month back-to-back month-to-month harvest so these were you know throwing in premature and they didn't really get to their full potential um yeah that's about it um besides that you know the other issues that I had inside this tent was the mics that I got from the damn cookies that's the cookie over there and you know from this far away you can see the damage on the leaves from the mites so yeah it was a shitty run this know all this run right here was shitty but you know the my problem I got it under control after I harvest you know these plants out of this room everything is everything inside of here man it's gonna get taken apart washed thoroughly the whole room is going to get cleaned and basically disinfected before anything else comes up you know comes in so hopefully this would be the last city round y'all see foam from me anyway I got some buds back there from Chino was that collapse they're all over the all over the place over there man I don't know what to do to control them see the problem that I was having was that since these parents were so small coming into flower I didn't really think I needed the trellis netting kind of forgetting how much the Chernobyl stretched the Chernobyl looks good like always the Chernobyl always comes out fire um it doesn't seem to me it doesn't seem how big the plant gets like they usually yield about the same each time like this Chernobyl right here probably give me like you know two ounces but your Nobles that I had in the first video where I was getting like three ounces off for them and there were you know not that much you know there were a whole lot bigger versus you know these I'll probably grab like you know maybe an ounce and a half maybe two ounces off to each one compared to the other ones I was grabbing like six ounces off the east plan and between six to seven ounces off each plan so huge difference in this arm in this run right here compared to my first one but this is not my preferred method or style of growing so you this is not the norm for me like you use ain't gonna see too much of this if you do see stuff like this down the line for me it's because I needed I needed a harvest and the plants were rust besides that everything is um I like to take my time with everything let everything get proper size that way they can fill out properly and give me some proper meds I mean there's nothing wrong with these meds guys you know I mean everything still looks fire everything is on point the smell is crazy you know the trichrome production is there it's just the size you know compared to the first run it's the size that's really the only thing lacking it's that big that big you know freaking 16 litre [ __ ] I mean 16 ounce you know soda bottle tops that's that that's what I want but I didn't get it this wrong that's okay I'll grab them next round ain't no sweat so yeah this is the run I figured I'd give y'all the update man I didn't want saw the thing just because this round was City that I wasn't going to show it I'm not like that man I saw the good with the bad that way there you know if anybody else is going through some [ __ ] you know y'all ain't the only one everybody run into issues you know I've been doing this 25 years you know this is the first you know major issue I mean and I'm and I'm over here talking like it's a total loss it's not a total loss you know I mean it's it's a decent running you know considering the you know the factors in you know the obstacles I had to overcome so I mean everything is decent it's just not what I'm used to or not what I'm accustomed to so it's a bit of a different disappointment on my end um you know it's probably people out there like dude that [ __ ] looks great you're crazy but I know what I'm used to get in I know what I can produce and for me this is [ __ ] but I'm just being honest fellas well anyway man this is the flower turn I figured I'll give y'all a quick peek in here Oh as a matter of fact hold up I'm gonna bring y'all to the fetch tent real quick let y'all in let anybody see what's going on inside the veg tent I did an update earlier on the veg tent when the seedlings but now I'm going to do a regular update on em her Sour Diesel in the Chernobyl's now it's blue like this because I couldn't reset my white balance I'm sorry about that I apologize fellas bear with me but those are the seeds I did update on them earlier it's all about these girls right here now now if you remember about three days ago I came in here and I did like you know a second part of my series on how to structure your plant to get them ready for flower and look really nice later man look at the results man the tops they're blowing up man they're blowing up you know I'm getting like explosive growth it's crazy now I notice the difference between head look at that where I cut it right there look how much that no grew up right now come let's come over here and let's check out these mother plants that I topped normally where is it okay right there that's where I topped it look how tiny the note is you see what I'm talking about when you cut when you top a plant down here whether the stem is thick it's gonna deliver water and nutrients that it would normally deliver to these you know two inches of growth directly to that note which is gonna cause that explosive growth I'm getting the same thing over here in a channels look at the little look at the channels you know it looked like I didn't even touch them they're just blowing up but I'm gonna be coming back to home to do a third part on them how destruction yup all how I structure my plants for home flowering anyway that's gonna be coming up soon and that's basically what branch is the key you know there's some dominant branches and there's non dominant branches and you know you get dominate branches and non-dominant branches from seedlings and you know once you once you can distinguish you know the dominant branch from the non dominant branch you can do a better job of structuring your plant the way you want to uh to grow um oh I know you see a lot of this these damages right here all that foam right there it's from the treatment that see the damage like that right there all that is from the SN s treatment one day I came in here you know I was you know as everybody knows I've been at war with the mice I'm currently might free inside this bedroom right now there's no mice at all I've been checking everything like digitally you know two three times a day and I haven't seen many mice for about you know a week which is good but I've been on my three days schedule every three days I come in here new morning three days after that SNS but about three days ago I woke up and I was like I'm gonna hit him with the SMS and I did that you know before the lights went off I said yo you know what then I want to I'm uh you know I want to make sure I get rid of these [ __ ] for good I'm gonna get them you know another dosa SMS which I shouldn't have done because it seems to cause a lot of well not a lot of damage but it seems to cause some damage on the leaves maybe it was the way it dried not sure it's not it's not catastrophic by any means they're gonna bounce right right back out of it you know they'll grow right out of that [ __ ] in no time but you know it's still ugly I still don't like [ __ ] up you know but a is the [ __ ] up you know I [ __ ] up I shoulda done it I own it but it is what it is you know they're gonna bounce right back by next week that leaves will be trimmed off anyway you know so yeah that's the update for today men flower turn and veggie update man y'all already know what it is this is secret city scientist man AKA twenty ropes keep them green keep on growing and amount man please", "OqcQp60vd8o": "[Applause] [Music] whoo day 28 flowering and she's really come along this week she's really packing it on and I moved those tops they've grown enough to be sort of resting on this side of the hood so it's still getting light from the other light so it's good so far it's all right I got these tea they're a bit too close but keep an eye on them everything looks good I just got done cleaning out the undercarriage here there's a lot of separate branches and whatnot keep all the energy going to the top she's a big girl starting to show some resin here trying to find a bud to zoom in on show you the start starting there let's see there we go you can get a good good idea here and while I'm doing that check out the Skywalker doing the same thing and she's starting to the resin production - and she smells good man day 28 is well let's get a shot of her it's good looks good said most recently tied back that top she she really started filling out and kind of got way too close to the light here and resting up on this stalk here got a lot on her actually but get one more skip in behind her actually give a view from the backside see under the hood here it's it's a good distance to not quite get burnt see the airflow here on this side here but you're looking good one would stay still for the plus I'll give you a better view so my apologies on that there we go that's that's er that view sneaked by these girls real quick one more look at the Skywalker it's pretty tall looking pretty good looking pretty good 32 gallon here just got done feeding her one more look up top all right that day 28 what a fun project this is man having a lot of fun growing this all right guys later see you next week check in next week", "3OQzFP0Q9XQ": "hey guys coming at you with a phone video got the flash on so you can see the crystals nice smoke report of some original satyr diesel by Cali connection this was a feminized seed that I got from an attitude promotion so I got it for free this but it's nice and sticky super smelly just like any Sour Diesel would be the one thing that kind of threw me off is I was expecting a sativa but I got a straight indica plant and usually want to think of the original Sour Diesel I think of a fluffier sativa type bud but this is really dense indica tight bud so um yeah I mean no complaints so gives you the munchies like hell I probably gained weight this week from smoking this bud just eating popcorn and chips and just all that good stuff it's got the nice nice lemon kind of lemon pledge diesel taste rather than the fuel I don't get much fuel from this I just get a lot of lemon pledge and a lot of sour a little bit of earthy dirt type smell with it to grow it in soil the Fox Farms ocean forest soil can't go wrong with that it's really proved to be a good soil for for a beginner like me yeah some nice buds Kelly connection original Sour Diesel no problems not even a single banana popped on this - just thought I should throw that out there because I've seen a lot of problems with Cali connections gear sometimes people have gotten Hermes but alright peace out guys keep growing stay high see you", "pa2VdNdTXHQ": "give it back view here again this guy right here she's c99 my first plant coming on fast now this Sour Diesel it's got some ok buds on it here this one right here is really fat you know compared to like that one but yeah it's got some nice nice tops on her that's another c99 here back up this way it's my biggest plant back to to c99 they're my biggest plants the stairs [ __ ] she's my slowest plant far as budweis second-biggest in size as you see she's uh she's just coming on now this is my runt I don't know what screen this is but I'm happy with it pretty fat cool up there on top these are my three white widows 25 gallon or 55 gallon barrels cut in half three bags of Fox Farm soil with 30 percent perlite mix and I use the Fox Farm trio it's only the only firts I use these boards are eight feet tall so she's a couple inches shy of that get some nice buds on her nice big colas up there another white widow she's got two big big fat ones on top I'm gonna White Widow here smarter pottage section spiders this plant here is an ak-47 just coming on real nice she sure got bushy man it's a big it's a big plan this one here is American dream also American dream it's my biggest plant far as bunny wise goes there they're coming on fast this is the 4550 de strain so they say and yeah she's she's fast this is American dream again another American dream all these plants are natural I didn't know topping no no nothing I just let him grow that's a Sour Diesel back there I like this plant strong ranching uniform growing some nice heads on it she's she's about almost 7 feet tall that bar up there going across the seven feet well of course she's in a pot too but yeah she's fat give its back shot of this a K see how big she's gotten this big bush there I'm gonna have to do some more netting on the bottom get those bottom leaves falling down the dirt let me walk back this way sorry about that guys someone give you a back view here I was gonna get up on my roof but too fat nowadays for holding the camera trying to do that so yeah anyway check back guys I'll have another update here soon surely all right take care", "LNepuv-PQ2g": "what's up YouTube this is week four on the sour Diesel's in the flowering room the two mother plants I kind of adjusted the lights because of the heights of the the height difference here I should have super cropped this main Colo probably I could probably low stress it or something like that but I'm just gonna leave it alone and let it do its thing I'm gonna have a few more plants coming in here so I mean got a few other concerns too to get ready for I'm gonna have to tape off this room with some of the Panda Polly just half it off for now so I could have this side still in veg a little bit more with a little bit higher higher power lights a little bit more lumens so they'll come through nice and strong hopefully I'll get a fan in here sooner or later I mean they do okay as long as I don't get them too close to the light and I mean I do have consistent flow in the room it's a nice airflow from two different CFM fans and it all comes through of course the filter the sports screen just to keep everything know no bugs nothing like that never I don't think I've ever had any bugs except for the gnats but I mean a little bit of diatomaceous earth if you ever get those will take care of that problem that's a different subject so yeah I think at last time I was actually talking about the two different spectrums that I use the metal halide and the high-pressure sodium the metal halide is closer to this plant because it's a lot taller and it's more centered it's more in one spot you know it's not as it's not as wide as this plant right here as you can see it stretches out pretty far it's it's kind of far away from our lights right here I mean it's like a good I don't even know two feet away or something like that so I mean the high-pressure sodium right here gives it a few more lumens to kind of hit this other canopy and I could drop it down it's probably like what foot and a half away from the plants right now and they're still gonna stretch out maybe a little bit more who knows I'll keep tying them up maybe I could bring these ones a little bit closer they'll definitely benefit if I had some kind of fan in here it would be nice but we'll just have to deal with that later can't think of too much else to say I actually have not been giving them beastie blooms this week I think it was week seven I'm on on the on the feeding schedule however I didn't have BC blooms so I just kind of gave them the cha-ching last time and this time both feedings and I mean the BST bloom is supposed to bring swelling which I do notice it do and I ran it twice through the feeding schedule on these so I mean it looks like they did benefit a little bit from our from the from the beastie blooms but the chi-ching really does bring quite a bit more crystal growth I got to say like that's one that I probably would never go without like I would incorporate that into my main line like the macronutrients like the grow big big bloom and the and the other one there yeah I would I would I would incorporate all the tiger bloom I would incorporate the pitching in with those three just because it really does bring nice crystal growth they do say to run it towards the end of the cycle but it seems to be doing pretty well I don't know if it's because I've got the the the pH a little bit more dialed in on the second grow with these our third grow I can't even remember how long I've had the Sour Diesel for how many grows but yeah definitely the pH is helping it quite a bit I think I had it off the pH pin I had might have been a little bit messed up they do tend to get well they need to be calibrated I should say every now and then which I just don't like to do you know they're like $4 pins so I just buy another one yeah but pH is very important I mean it depends it it it judges what these plants take in you know like what kind of if if you're at 6.5 you're at a very good range for like all the nutrients that this plant needs a little bit up like six point seven or so I mean it's gonna take in mostly like nitrogen and some of the other stuff you know it it's pretty picky on when it takes what in if you're following me but yeah that's what another thing anyway yeah so this is a this is the flowering room after for four weeks wish there was more to see but uh I mean it's only week four so we still got a little bit to go here another three weeks or so four weeks who knows so yeah we'll check it back again next week and do a little update this camera just won't stay in focus so yeah like and subscribe take it easy Thanks", "QOZ_U8j1UYs": "[Music] hi my name is AJ I wouldn't say I'm the creator of Sour Diesel I am servant and keeper cannabis it comes in varieties or cultivars not strains strains are bacterias and funguses and things like that in 1992 I was working as an intern at wetlands which was a nightclub in New York City I met a guy there asked me if I would smoke some weed with him and was telling me oh I'm a grower he ran up to me it was like check this [ __ ] out that was the first time I'd ever seen chem 91 well the first time I ever tasted the the chem dog I just it almost tasted familiar to me and I just got this weird feeling and I was like we're gonna be friends we're gonna be together for a long time you know from the moment we met it was like going home for me some people feel that way when they start a relationship you know with with another person or with any but you know we were always on the prowl for like the best weed back then I mean it was never tough to get weed in New York it was tough to get good weed well people didn't understand is that we always had cheap weed in New York you know there was good weed around but it was hard to come by and it was very expensive but you had to be out there looking for it I mean that's why we hung out in Central Park we had to like constantly be on the prowl for a good weed kids today don't understand you know we were like facing like prison you know and there was such a negative stigma attached it's a cannabis back then it's not only with the cops you know love to come and find you but your landlord or anybody else might love to call the cops on you for doing it and police are cracking down on what they call quality of life crimes like traffic violations subway fare beating and public drunkenness and those small busts lead to bigger bust because what broken windows theory is all about I mean if some guy is urinating in public he's and if we got if we got a problem I think they were looking to arrest you for anything you know we were terrified to smoke weed outside so scary you know were scary times sometime I believe was in 93 I found a seed bag of diesel so we were now growing these new offspring of what was cam 91 and we were doing small things in the 90s because that's all we needed to do we thought they were huge at the time well [ __ ] ten lights of this rumor oh you [ __ ] dude you know like we just kicked it up to 20 you know like that was huge you know I was gonna call with this 20 we're gonna be in deep [ __ ] [ __ ] all right you know instantly it created mayhem I think people were you know begging me for diesel and you could never have enough diesel you know we used to call all we'd that was good diesel we just say that's diesel you know it was a huge pit bull we'd be like that pit bull is diesel this weed is diesel back then people were afraid that that we was sprayed with chemicals and you know kind blood was just coming on the scene in New York you know I remember the first time I actually like possessed like a quantity of it in my hands and looked at it and I said this is the diesel forget it like cam Dawg forget all that [ __ ] we're gonna call this the diesel what made it Sour Diesel is that it made everybody sour you know you could never have enough and people would become more and more bitter as time went on because you just you couldn't produce enough for everybody so now you had to pick and choose who were gonna give it to and that's what made you know the Sour Diesel sour it was just souring relationships all over the place you know first of all you have people in New York City that are not living in noir okay you know you have here you have grocery stores where you know they sell tomatoes for $20 there's boutique markets for fancy things in New York City you know I feel like I had the opportunity to focus on quality because if you have a product that's flawless in New York City you can get a fortune for it and I don't think that's the case in all places I don't know if that could have happened anywhere else quite the same people accepted the fact that that's what that's what the prices were and they were happy to pay them look up was that they were getting hem dog and Sour Diesel raised the bar and brought awareness to the public that you know that there is something better out there that's why I stuck my head out because it's time to like turn the world on it's a good week [Music] you", "rhBhdCZPAYw": "[Music] and really it starts back in the day probably 1990 the story I did ditch now it's a soul that has three seeds and it's a little different okay let's take it up okay well we really need to start before that because now we're in in near 91 and I'm on tour come home just from Madison Square Garden shows and there's a man that walks by my house he's a hippie and wave you know comes back around the corner and next thing I know is I'm buying a sheet of paper because hey my friends are over here around the corner we don't have a place to stay go out meet these guys you know so here we are it's September right at the you know Brent had just died and won't be stepping in good show and so I need this guy he walks by he sells me some acid well I was happy in and then you can say my friends are over here we'll have a place to stay but he's funny on it so it's gotta be nice hanging out like nice conversation and stuff and talking bro he's the second person they started telling me about growing next thing I know was a month 12 we gather going down RFK and we requirement seats from bucks I had already been grown for like six months seven months now what year is this this is probably early 92 okay so we read RFK and we acquire some really [ __ ] Holly but it was green house were on and we got these few seeds this leads up to the chem because this is how I meet the connection for the candor right okay so I start growing this stuff called the RFK which was just a [ __ ] hash play even today meeting my friend Joe we talk about this planet so I got that I got a couple sister plants nice sativa number two we called it the one was the one arcane and the number two and one was this very skunky green now I'm hanging out with G again and we're going to see fish at the Roseland he said hey I met this guy he's some Massachusetts and so we hooked up with them start talking Papapa at this thing like that he's got this I got that hey Cutlass I said yeah I'll give you this for that okay he had the chem this is like early 92 okay he had to chem that he acquired from Colorado just like these guys said he'd gotten he told me like six seats but this guy says 12 seats whatever that's fine he was grown he had grown too he had come to Kemah boom that was the wrong dog and was it D 8 WG like everybody says that it it was the og right and people were like yeah what thank so much he ate them Yuki yeah it's really it's dogs but we call it well and I look at I just walk away but this so it's so now early I guess is 92 and in fishing playing in the Roseland was and so I go up to Massachusetts and I'm bringing in my product okay sell them with girls and coming back with the other girls difficulties okay so I gave him the number two and I had another plan I gave him he gave me the Super Skunk and the Kendall now this Super Skunk was beautiful I got these two plants I'm growing them for a while and now I find a nice place in noodle on Staten Island thank [ __ ] two-bedroom loft see love addict huge kitchen garage yeah right cuz I hadn't grown in Elton villa on the island like a rock so I had to move I know I've been going back and forth Massachusetts for a while hanging out my friend that and so like now I got a connection upstate New York I meet these people on tour and at the following year what happened looks ok so I went also in this time I went over the Amsterdam these guys all went to Woodstock [ __ ] up there this is before that so I went over the Amsterdam time to go anybody's over there looking at all those idiots I came back with Northern Lights the Jack Herer the Oasis ok Northern Lights 5 and Big Bud but the one I prime L in Hawaii and the one that I used I took the cam and I took this desuka scum ok and I started breeding with these seeds that I got males Adam and I would beg up pile in little plastic bags each smell you know get rid of it and now I had Hawaii to use ok and I had given it to my friend FB just say that and he was still in it and I had the Northern Lights is what I believe I had a Northern Lights super scum crossed into himself twice and pollen II might accidentally with some wine I've got a half a pound of it we that had seeds in it what the [ __ ] this so I sold most of it to the guys and the Upstate crew they come back to me and one of them happens to be like this guy Joe that is in the article with with Adam where he meets him over in Amsterdam Greg Enix Greg over in Amsterdam and he was living up there I had a really calling and I sold him he grew some and I grew some of the seeds and believe it or not these were pretty stable for him but his cuttin was a little bit better than mine so the Sour Diesel what I know of has no no dog it's the super strong to Northern Lights and a little bit of Hawaii [Music]", "5Co0gvB2Vaw": "hey everybody real sorry about the lack of videos lately I have been so busy

there's one here sugars brown sugar breath we'll put in there sorry for I can't see him on down there so these are just about 72 like 70 like three days so for these to get a good inch or so long tap roots so I'm going to do five more sugar breath here and these two are the blueberry blueberry and then there's the other one so on the other side that I will do in a minute so that's that to start off our next little group of babies alright don't forget to subscribe like that I need a taping again without recording me I mean that's a little rent so of course fit in the 5 I've got a runt but obviously you can see like the big ones I gotta be really careful there we go now and she goes okay hon this is kind of tight quarters while I'm doing this I'm beat it get out of here serious okay so we got a problem here with this one it grew right through paper towels so I'm gonna try and slide it out Amherst our days off this guy here like that since it's already a plant we should just throw it into flour right now okay so Howard diesel baby yeah if I knock off the top of that plant it's done so that's why it's kind of nerve-wracking to make sure I don't screw these up and oh there we go there's five [Music] so these are with the the inverse this would be the hash and the blueberries are worth the sugar brush so so I figured I kind of put the sweet ones together I don't know right kind of makes sense now and then the hash named her Sour Diesel together of course these ampersand easy let's just decide to go right through the paper towels I did here somewhere maybe on a video or something you're gonna do this paper towel method by actually the cheap ones paper towels not the expensive ones they do grow through the tap roots through these paper towels they don't get caught up as much and the cheap ones as they do like very cheesy get up there I want me to take couple with an extra day or two to pop up that's the expensive ones they get kind of caught up in the the weave of that paper towel so get the cheap ones five more Amherst to do with this bunch yeah see do I have five germinated here there's one curly one and she and therefore curled up underneath there it's okay if the head of the seed pops out that just has that little extra nutrients so that's not a seed that's just a top of that seat over here so it's fine if it falls off it just means it was ready to be planted probably a few hours ago so everyone germinate and every single one germinated Niagra seed bank and yes I did pre-moistened why are you still recording I did pre-moistened the soil just so the soil was a little bit more compacted down so when we water it it doesn't go down and in half you know in half soy I want more soil this time I've got a little bit bigger pots for this just because the other pots of had it was a little bit too small and just didn't seem to support the plants last time as much I don't really like the way they grew in there so there you go there's 12 the other 12 and that's it right here and why do I hear a fly [Music] oh man and you started a blueberry - blueberry with the sticks a time and the sugar right and then the and her star diesel hidden - okay that's it for me huh - new night-night I'm gonna keep the temperature in here probably for at least 75 for sure and that's that", "CWnxVBFAoKk": "Hello everyone. This is J\u00e1sminka, from Dinafem Seeds. And today I am with one of the most famous girls in New York. This cannabis plant is very well known in the US. And she\u00b4s one of the most famous Sativas in the world. Today we\u00b4re learning more about our Diesel. Why is Diesel such a famous strain? Because she is a complex and exotic hybrid, coming from the cross between a Mexican Sativa and an Afghani. This Sativa-dominant marijuana strain is easy to grow and turns into a vigorous cannabis plant that produces many long and dense buds. She has high-quality sensory properties because her aromas and flavors are intense with a complex scent of oil citrus and exotic fruits. And what about the effect? Well, it is very powerful, more cerebral than physical and long-lasting. So our Diesel is the perfect Dinafem Girl to meet during a funny evening with friends. Did you like our Diesel? Then get more info on our website and leave your comments below. Thanks for having the Dinafem Girls. And remember that we\u00b4ll be waiting for you on our Social Media. See you there!", "kcbkkllDW9g": "what's going on YouTube it's 20 rooms for 28 figured today I give y'all an update of things that you know went on though you know the last round anybody that follows me or watches my channel notice that I had some breathing projects going on last round so I'm pretty sure you know people out there curious on how things turned out so today I figured I'd give you all what I got left over anyway a product review and the only guy you know that you know boo which is what you're looking at right now and am her Sawadee which is what you're looking at right now but the purpose of today's video is not so much depart but to see that I got off of the bud and how how everything you know how everything went off um I ended up with way more seeds than I expected which is a good thing I'll put on the line right here I'll go down the line on the strains that I don't have right now as far as product Java pies I ended up with two vials like this and a half to four vials and a half of vial all these little jarred things filled with gel Pisces um I didn't separate them I haven't said you know separated the good seeds and the bad seed yeah I haven't really had a chance to but from the looks of things there's not too many you know bad seeds sorry about that I need three freaking years but um yes you can see you know there's still a lot of light seeds in there I don't want to dump amount but they'll go flying everywhere but there are a lot of good seats too no viable seeds I see one right there but you know there's some of these that uh that I like that's a lazy butt thing you got some of these that uh you know good and dark so I still have to go through them on the Java pie seeds have a little bit different look then the other series they're more they're more like um point that I would say there's a picked out a quick three good seeds right there but it's a whole bunch of home love potion I mean I'm jaw higher seeds like I said I got two and a half of these vials so with child has seeds few hundred at the least I haven't really counted amount I'm like I said I'm I have anything you know gone through the process of separating the good from the bad yet I just you know had so much [ __ ] going on lately I really had a chance to get to anything much so I still need to separate them I won't even keep you know the best seeds everything else is gonna get tossed the best ajal pies the love potion ninety-nines I ended up with about six vials but it was two vials of the love potion 99 number all right the number five you know the number five female Fino I love potion 99 I pollinated two branches I pollinated one branch with the Shortino of love potion 99 which was number four and I pollinated it with tall phenol of love potion 99 which was number six so I have two vials of love 1499 you know female 5 Crossway 4 and 6 and then I have the other at the other 3 vials that I have are the love potion 99 number 3 female crossed with the love potion 99 number for male which was both short they you know both short character carried short both short love potion characteristics a lot of these seeds came out good you know like the Java pies a lot of them came out like and I mean I got a lot that came out you know Dart but you know I would say 60% of them came out kind of light on the love potion I would say about 80% came out dark and about 20% came out light um saw me so that's good I like the love potion it kind of it kind of surprised me I had a really really good smell um the job I had a crazy smell definitely a winner um this right here the only seeds that I got off of the one dark helmet um the dark helmet I didn't have a male dark helmet Tom pollinate it with so what I did was since the Java pie I basically what I had in mind for the dark helmet was locking down the key lime pie trees so since I didn't have any more you know since I didn't have a male dark helmet I pollinated it with the Java pie that you know has key lime pie carry on you know genetics in it so I went ahead and I you know across the dark helmet with the Java pie the only child pie mill that I had which was Java pie number one um but all five sees that he gave me you know turned out good you know I didn't get my leggings they all turned out you know nice dark viable good seeds so like that's an A+ so so far that's you know three strange right there that we covered me guitar tell me the love potion 99 which is basically three different phenols of the love potion 99 in seed form oh we had the number three cross with the number say which is the short funeral characteristics then we have the tall female characteristics and the female number five and I mix them with both I mix them with the short characteristics in the in the love potion 99 number for male and I pollinated a branch of the taller characteristics of the love potion 99 number six men and then we have the Java PI's I only have one male child pi so i pollinated you know three child PI plants are pollinated number two which was the one I didn't really like but turns out to be fire I pollinated number four number four no my father I'm sorry I probably needed two five and six of the Java pies with the job hi number one man and then we'll be here for the love potion ninety-nines my fault I'm sorry excuse me the shinobi stitching over here real good smell real good taste I like it so this is the channel we'll see right here this right here is the Chernobyl cross with love potion and it's the Chernobyl cross we love poison 99 number four which was the short ma'am not the love potion well a lot of these seeds came out good um you know I would say 85 you know 75 to 85% came out you know good dark viable seeds a good percentage of them you know came out good so I'm excited about these but the ones that I'm really excited about is the Chernobyl in Java Picross now I didn't get I got a lot of seeds but I was so excited about this sorry about that I had to open up the cab but I was so excited about this specific cross right here that you know I went and separated basically all the good seats that I had I didn't end up with much but what I do have I'm excited about and this is the Chernobyl cross with the Java pod so yeah kind of guys see what that turns out to be like I'm hoping out all of these seeds that I have here I'm hoping that you know I find that you know a few keepers oh so that's the Chernobyl crosses that's everything that I ran off for the Chernobyl Chernobyl in love potion Shinobu child pop then we cook to the in her side with diesel which is right there and I only crossed the endpoint start with diesel with a love potion I didn't bother crossing it with the java part which you know I should have experimented a little bit but I didn't I crossed it with the with the love potion 99er before ma'am and I pollinated a different plant with the love potion 99 number six ma'am oh yeah dynasty IDs turned out to so those two the seeds that I intended to get I got a lot you know I got all of them you know like I said out of the love potion these are all the dark helmets that I got which was basically five I had a few hundred love potion and demands because like I said I got like five or six of these I'm not sure I got three different feelings of the love potion 99 Oh baby form on the dead cow pies I ended up a life I'm not sure ended up with a lot when I have sound like that but home ended up with a lot so these are the C's that I attended some students and you know I told you while I was pollinated you know that you know I do get you know a few stragglers seeds from the surrounding buds and this was basically done so these are random all these seeds right here there that I over here I just ran them I don't know if it's love folks in the Java PI's crossed with whatever you like all the random seeds that I had out of the the Chernobyl's all the random seeds that I had out of the universe start with diesel that were not intended to be pollinated that I don't know what they are I just doing this out here you know so there's a little bit of mixture of everything inside of here and there's a lot of good seeds in there too you know it's good product is you know it's a it can only be you know a few things I only mess with a female so you know that's I like to call that the you know the surprise that's a batch of surprise surprise me you know plant you a surprise we type [ __ ] and yeah these are the seeds that I've been going through so far the lighter ones separating everything taking all the later seeds all the greater seeds yeah man that's why I met with the seeds for y'all all Yahoo you know curious about that there it is I probably got you know I don't know somewhere around fifteen hundred seeds maybe man I got a lot you know like if I gonna show you that whole bag and pack up sees that I got over here man it's like nuts like I'm not posing just mad seeds oh but that's what it is Mary quick look at the garden y'all I didn't adjust the white balance their homes well maybe not guys I tried that's that purple of the LEDs but anyway man is twin roots 420 a KA to Cebu City scientists

I just live down the wall whoa yeah Jesus oh alright anyway personally I'm a keep it totally aggressively honest with you guys really ain't too much of a difference I mean I mean you know I'm not hey not really too much of a difference but at the same time but at the same time I don't know I just I really don't as far as like Oh who's growing better who's growing wet I I'm kind of like him he's the only time I don't like these plastic bags and when they gotta pick up a movie but if they're like little plants I wouldn't trip these plastic ones to be good if I wanted to put like a tomato cage just I'm on top of it Oh No I think I'm just really I'm really disappointed and the whole like Geopark you down just keep 100 because when it when it began it was all American it was all Cali all done in Northern California it was always some real [ __ ] I don't know what the [ __ ] doing no more I don't even [ __ ] with him like that no more someone catch me trying to ask me in all videos like blehh what's up with this I'll be like they're gonna keep watching videos do you mind you might want to go to the videos now and they gonna start working your way back because literally for the price of a Geo pod let's say that's the 7 gallon let's say we got a we got it on a jig for two dollars right [ __ ] you getting 25 [ __ ] plastic bags they go for like $5 so financially if when they got their trapping grinding and hustling getting his money go you want this Thank You sex you go mama it's not good with the price point now when it was made in America and [ __ ] was given American jobs you know I'm saying like [ __ ] like that and they got who were who were our odd let's do this real low carbon footprint like all that [ __ ] but once it started going in the direction that aside now now [ __ ] with that I can't I can't explain it that's like I'm not I'm not into outsourcing American jobs just not interested I rather than it I'm not saying no [ __ ] that I'm not into outsourcing a single [ __ ] American job and once these [ __ ] started shooting that [ __ ] over there you know keep it 100 the reason why everybody kind of like keep it fair game isn't it gosh so much [ __ ] video but it would just shut down the whole [ __ ] thing so that's why I kind of keep my mouth shut and you kind of feel one I think I've ever say done to you does make that uploaded be detrimental but I just want [ __ ] jobs in the United States I want to build up the American Medical Marijuana community also I probably went with chronic lounge today we're gonna talk about a couple of Senate bills and went through some of you [ __ ] is gonna love it and if some of you [ __ ] gonna be like did that really just happen and it'll be like yeah dog that [ __ ] was ugly and it just went down like this and since you weren't a person with a voice and actually spoke up you're getting handed over what these [ __ ] in backdoor deal the [ __ ] Wang dang doodle is and hustled over here in our team's favor and not your team's favorite suit I'm saying like why did I say our team's because I think I don't lose place that know my position I'm a place in this game I see how much growth I get to have I see all that in them cool with that happy camper but all that silly [ __ ] that [ __ ] be doing or didn't know on a minute the cannabis games gonna be so taxed so hot and a watch No mark my words I can promise you that from [ __ ] will be getting taxed from this stage [ __ ] to this stage to this stage because you know everything that's got to get so loaded watch [ __ ] and crazy because we're listening marijuana medical marijuana as an agriculture product yonder you thought it was bad now going to the club [ __ ] spinning 50 bucks - damn - six dollars for eight the weed 44 some high 30-foot some damn thing I'm just smoking 24 Mike [ __ ] last year outdoor small blood [ __ ] you [ __ ] a little get attached to the nose because everybody's looking at this marijuana crop [ __ ] cash me out so like you you y'all have problems and you need to hurry up and if you're going to become actually legitimate make it like get in like how you see me doing this I'm over here with them over here with it I'm doing this business that business trying to get this back were these attorneys on our team you just make work file getting this [ __ ] sealed and stamp and ice on the [ __ ] is because these [ __ ] gonna make a hardship if you [ __ ] don't get your [ __ ] straight in an expedient fashion you [ __ ] who be on the other side of the gate and I will be probably feeding on the English through the straw hole in the crack of the mortar somewhere let's just keep that [ __ ] real so I hope you guys take a little less than that and run with it I've talked to you guys a little bit i'ma gear up for this [ __ ] chronic glass so we can actually sit down and talk about these laws it's your boy tonight eg from GBI one time one time coming cool now", "Ue6r60vHh1E": "what's going on youtubers she's 20 boobs for 20 hit man and I'm back with what I consider and I say I because you know I do things a certain way that other people you know probably don't do my methods are different than other people's you know I I do what works for me but anyway I consider this a very important step out here as you can see in my living area I got a lot of my own supplies out the reason for that is inside the tank I have the running Ian Harris our diesel drying so while the inverse our diesels dryin before I clean the inside of the tank I took everything out and when I say everything man look you can see I took everything out of the room oh this right here I know I ain't gonna pass it by without telling y'all that's a whole bag of trim that I'm gonna use for you know 4runner moon rock but um as you can see I got all my supplies out and the purpose for that is in between every run I consider it critical that you clean and sanitize your growing area surrounding your plants in other words inside this room I have my tank before I sanitize and cleaning my turn I want to sanitize and clean my room why because if I wait and clean the tent first while I'm going back and forth cleaning the tent whatever the [ __ ] is that left over inside the room is going to just recontaminate the tank it's almost pointed so it's critical well I consider it critical that you clean and sanitize the surrounding area before you clean and sanitize your tent that way there you don't recontaminate nothing and everything is fresh so that's what I'm in the process of doing right now I'm gonna come in here everything is gonna get wiped down and everything is gonna get cleaned take it off there all of this is stoking I'm gonna get taking off i'ma wipe everything down i'ma clean everything wash everything properly make sure this all this duct work over here for my intake it's gonna get taken off clean you know everything everything is going getting you know sanitized the walls you know this this board over here what we'll come down and get in good clean golf all my dollies you know my my metal control this whole control panel will get washed down yeah everything and then I'll go inside there and clean the tank sanitize the tank and then I'll come back out here so extra measures and you know do another quick clean up but that's how I keep everything you know sanitary especially with the issues and the only reason why I'm going through this extent right here I mean I do it all the time but I don't go through this extent like taking everything out and you know sanitized and everything but the purpose for this is because I have mics with this issue and now the veg tank is my free I want to sanitize everything in this [ __ ] to make sure that they they don't come back like I want to I want to guarantee that they don't come back so I think that this is critical you know whenever you have an infestation problem and you want to get rid of it don't just worry about your growing you know area with a pen syringe you have to worry about your surrounding areas as well man because if you go in there and you come out here and you go you know while you was in there a few mites came on you and came out here you know that you got you know a few months running around our head and my you know the possibility of recontamination is greater if you don't clean your surrounding area that's why I consider that important but anyway that's just like I said that's just a personal preference that's just what I do to keep everything to keep everything in checking in order but anyway man that's my quick update for right now the square roots already know what it is keeping green keep them growing and keep them sanitized man keep your room sanitized okay", "5B1KfyAGCkg": "[Music] Wow [Music] party what is up guys and welcome back to Chris cloud TV this 21 over channel better get people of marijuana music sports game in a very much more so today's

lock productions like I said twenty eight bucks for an eighth limited edition let's go ahead will real quickly give you a close-up shot of this purple diesel here get it to autofocus a little bit nice light green bud to kind of a blondish color up in there got some nice amber orange hairs in there and of course we got some purple you can tell but broke off there so the huge the center up there is really light green almost white pretty good trichrome production kind of leafy though be nice if it was a little bit better manicured job but this was only twenty eight bucks and eight so can't complain pretty good manicure medica job for what it is show you guys another bud here and we'll be getting into the smoke look at the purple there there's some purple for y'all apologize about the shake and holy [ __ ] my hand will not stay steady so yeah we got some purple some white green amber orange two bright orange hairs on this one here like I said you can see that Center right there we got a little purple in the center on this one a very light green like I said a really good try chrome production really dense nug not too fresh not too dry but we're gonna get into the smell test the taste test and the heart test high test the high test of this purple diesel here so go ahead and get smoking along guys and so the small test of this purple diesel here gets a 5 out of 5 very strong lavender floral smell mixed in with a very strong Sour Diesel funk smell to it they blend in very well so you get that nice mix of a floral lavender that's kind of sweet but also very strong very pungent mixed in with that super pungent that district that's just that just makes you gives you that stank face that sour faces whoo that Sour Diesel pungent and with mixed in with a little bit of pine but the small test hopefully a 5 out of 5 likes it very strong very loud package as well as great smell greens taste us cheers y'all Green's taste-test gets a 5 out of 5 tastes just like it smells get that very strong floral lavender sweet taste mixed in with that very strong Sour Diesel funk with that little hint of aftertaste at the very end of pine it's not very strong very long-lasting on the palate still taste it right now it still feels like I'm still got smoking my my mouth right now as you can see I don't but definitely a 5 out of 5 for the greens taste test like I said great tasting with that sweet floral lavender taste mixed in with that Sour Diesel funk skunky counter taste to it it's a little hint of pine in the aftertaste now after green taste test on this purple diesel here gets a 4 out of 5 and the fifth and six hit you lose the aftertaste of that pine and overall you do lose a little bit of flavor and the overall taste itself but besides that even in that fifth and six it I still got a very very strong floral lavender sweet taste mixed in with that soured Diesel's you know skunky funk kind of taste to it and it's so has really good flavor like I said I do lose the aftertaste of that pine in the after greens taste test and like I said it does it's not as strong as it was in the first hit with the floral and the Sour Diesel skunked to it come up for the most part still has a great flavor and I definitely give it a 4 out of 5 for the after greens taste test after greens taste us and the high the high I definitely give it a 5 out of 5 I'd say after taking about seven hits here we still got nice fat Bowl in here I am well and [ __ ] stoned I got a nice relaxing somewhat couch walking indica hi body hi with that very energetic kind of heady Spacey sativa head high but very strong first couple hit you start feeling the effects immediately and it's a very well balanced fit 250 head - indica split high and like I said very strong hit you right away so you don't have to sit there and smoke up a bunch of your weed to get stoned so definitely a 5 out of 5 for the high and my official review here of this limited edition purple diesel that is done by couch lock productions I will have to give it a five out of five it smells great it looks [ __ ] awesome it's definitely you know it's something they look something cool to look out you know we got the [ __ ] the purple on there you got the light green no it's definitely a very interesting but look at when it smells great it tastes great but on the green stasis and after greens taste test it get your stone real quick and has a good well-balanced 50/50 hybrid split heart so my fissure review is definitely a 5 out of 5 definitely some great stuff I do like this I will be picking this up again for 28 bucks an 8 that's a great [ __ ] deal as well for some really good [ __ ] cannabis there don't be some top-shelf quality cannabis for only 28 bucks and eight that's it that's a one hell of a deal right there but I definitely recommend you guys to go to your medical or recreational wherever you get your cannabis at this sounds like a frame that might interest you definitely go check it out I enjoyed it it tastes great smells great and they get you stoned that's all you need with weed so if you like those flavors that I was telling you about those smell sells

so let's get on with the show and don't forget to subscribe to the first time grow alright my friends welcome back to the first time grow show so right now we're just about the harvest only one of these plants which one will it be alright so it's the Sour Diesel plant and I'm about to take it down so let's just see on how nice shots I can get before I take this down start defoliating it and then just give it a final cut and hang it upside down for a few days well alright so welcome back and check it out just before I'm about to cut it down just before it's about to dry up when the plant is still alive still craving that pH water this is what it looks like so I'm trying to give you the best angles the best shots that I could show you and I harvested this plan I had proximately week 9 this is the way I like an uplifting high throughout the day so some that can sustain me at work so this plant is gonna be beautiful I smoked it a lot I mean I used to buy it off a friend of mine and he taught me how to grow it so this is how I grow it according to his schedule and his timing on when to take it down now the other plants that I have are still going on right now they're still flowering now and they're just not ready I'm gonna go to 70 days 77 days or possibly more possibly less I'm not too sure right now I'm still thinking and there you go so the plant is cut down it's drying out on the side of the tent and it's just doing very very good so I really love this plant I mean check it out this best shots as I can give you I'm gonna try to work on this for my upcoming videos to try to get better angles better shots and better lighting I know I keep saying it but this time I'm gonna do it so just for the comments below right now I mean how do you say it sour diesel Sour Diesel Sour Diesel or Diesel I mean nobody knows everybody says it their own different way most people say diesel I mean I'm starting to think diesel and why I don't know for the comments section below that's right so here's my sour diesel plant anyways I hope you like enjoyed subscribe stay tuned there's incredible things coming to the show I hope you like it and I'll give you the tally on this soon", "AjuDA3B-GyI": "plays a man of a STONER [Music] the stoners alright cannabis love with youtubers what's happening buds back for another update and excuse me anyways back with another update day 21 and I do have that fourth set nodes popping out now as you can see it's very slow one thing I just did some research watched a couple videos actually and started to realize that my humidity is fluctuating quite a bit if you guys can see that or not the lights kind of blocking it but anyways it's at about 60% right now temps at 72 let me zoom back out and it fluctuates quite often just for the simple fact that we are in the winter months the furnace is running drying out the air I've got two humidifiers in here that I constantly have to fill back up with water so there's times where I don't get to those in time to get those filled up and the humidity will drop but then as soon as I get them filled back up and I get them on you know the humidity Rises back up again but you guys won't be able to tell I don't believe on the video just because I just don't think you guys would be able to see but anyways I'm looking closely at my cup earlier and there was a gnat crawling up the side of the cup you know probably from the the the soil and I spotted another one just a few minutes later crawling up basically between the the space of the soil and the side of the cup there's just a small little gap there and that's where he was crawling up from and I actually saw a small ant which is really weird crawling on the bucket on this white bucket he was right there so how the hell he got in here I don't know that would be the first ant that I've seen you know at all this winter season so far and we're in January so just kind of weird but anyways on top of that soil I can see a slight green pigment like it's gonna have you know some mossy type [ __ ] growing on top of the soil and I'm guessing that's because my humidity is too high everybody's got their preference as to what their humidity should be you know I've heard 40% during this stage I've heard 50% during this stage I've heard even 60% this stage but I'm starting to realize that 60% and 50% right now are probably too much so I do have this fan going right here on the plant itself and then I just kind of rotate it every now and then just kind of to give it evil air movement around there now I don't leave that family all the time on it all the time I just every now and then I'll turn it on maybe a couple times a day for just a little bit just to get some extra air movement till I can get that bucket out of there I don't really want to raise and lower my lights I'd rather use you know something to raise and lower the cup so that's my plan but anyways I don't know I do have another seed germinating right now in a cup I'm actually gonna put that on a paper towel today I have it soaking in some water you guys know how that whole process goes if you've watched my previous videos and if you haven't check out my previous videos hit me up with a like on some of those if you guys like them hit me up at the comments but yeah I'm gonna have that one probably putting a paper towel today because I really don't have high hopes for this thing right now so just in case this one goes sour no pun intended on the sour Teasle but anyways if this will go sour I want to have that backup ready to go and you know I might even grow both of them just get another tote and maybe do one in each tote I don't know so but I just want to make sure I've got kind of a back-up plan in case this one doesn't make it because I'm not sure what's going on I think the humidity is what's stunted the growth along with me dropping the cup a while back but that was early that was like day six so I'm just not happy with the progress because my other two plants my very first two plants I didn't have any problem with them during the seedling stage I mean this is this is probably a time where you would think you wouldn't have many issues and it'd be smooth sailin till you get you know mid veg and we're gonna start dealing with you know deficiencies or toxicities or anything like that depending on your new strengths so but that's what's going on somebody hit me up with a comment on on if it's the humidity on what's doing this what's keeping it so slow and if that's what's going on with the soil on top there if that's gonna have an effect on my plant then I definitely just want to get another one going I don't overwater it as far as I know I don't believe I'm over watering it I did put some extra holes down here along the side of the cup and then an extra one in the bottom so there's four in the bottom and then roughly four off along the side to become for extra drainage because maybe that's what's going on is it's not I only had three holes in the bottom and they weren't really huge holes so maybe it's just not draining properly and it's holding too much moisture too long so that could be yeah hit me up with the comments guys I appreciate it just wanted to give you guys an update on what's happening and yeah hopefully it uh picks up the pace here because I don't want to wait too much longer on this see what's going on but like I said I got that other Sour Diesel seed and it's germinating down so and if anything I'll just switch this you know plan out for the other one it will just you know take off with another plant and show you guys what happens with that so alright guys I'm gonna get out of here and I'll catch you guys on the next video let's blaze and out peace I candidates 11 youtubers what's up bugged his back with a quick update I'm just gonna make this quick for you guys it is day 22 and yesterday I talked about go ahead and planning the germinating Sour Diesel seed the second one that I had so I just went ahead and did that today I did notice some pH issues the jug that I was giving this first Sour Diesel plant a feeding with or just a watering with was I thought was at 6.0 pH and come to find out I tested it today just out of curiosity and it was actually at 7:00 and they I think it was like 7 or 7.1 so the pH has been a lot higher I don't know if it would affect it that much right now but yeah this plant just isn't progressing at all for day 22 so I'm happen and you know and now that I think about it this has gotten quite a bit of water and that green mossy [ __ ] that's growing on top of there it's just due to probably a high humidity and then the soils just not drying out quick enough like it should so this new cup I didn't poison the soil all the way I just moistened it around where the seed is right now then as it slowly gets bigger I will up the amount of water but never too much because that's why I was finding gnats in this cup yesterday and I definitely don't need those in here so judging how number two is gonna go that's how I'm gonna refer to these by the way in my videos is Sour Diesel one Sour Diesel number two I've got my plant marker in there just so I know which one but more than likely this one might go just depending on what it does so but I'm gonna try to do this one differently I've got plenty of drainage holes along the bottom so when I do give the full water it will drain properly maybe give the roots a little bit of air once they reach down there so we'll see yeah I just wanted to do a quick update well you guys know I started that one up and we'll see what happens here in the next couple of days hopefully I can have better control of my humidity and temperature now I'm only running one humidifier at a time now so once one turns off the other one's filled up ready to go and I can just go ahead and turn it on fill the other one up and have it on back up ready to go so I've always got my humidity going so right now it's about 46% it hasn't really gotten any higher than about 51 52 percent in the last 24 hours so with just one humidifier going at a time so that's working out a little bit better as long as I can keep the temperature at about 75 even when the lights are off that would be great sometimes it does drop a little bit so I don't want too much fluctuation with humidity and temperature right now I want to keep it as is good as possible so but alright guys I'm gonna get out of here I'll see you guys here in a couple days with another update on number two and see what's happening with number one see if it picks up the pace so I'll catch you guys in blazing out peace not canvas loving youtubers what's up buds are blazing back another update for you guys alright this is what's going on in my groped oh so gay 28 over here which is so pathetic but I'm just curious as to what's gonna happen with it at this point I just want to see what its gonna do if it's gonna you know kind of bounce back but it's on the fifth I believe the fifth set and look here to this degree four five five of them on there right now and this is Sour Diesel number one day 28 pretty pathetic obviously it's it's got some growth issues and I have no idea why the fact that I dropped the tub back on day six or so so but it's somehow still [ __ ] going I don't get it I don't know why it's you know hasn't bounced back yet it should have by now and then over here we've got Dave for now I'm counting this as Dave for from the time that it came out of the dirt not from the time that I put the seed in or started germinating or anything so this is Dave for from the time that it came out of the dirt and it's working on its second set of true leaves coming out there in the center and it's pretty tall compared to this one over here I mean that you can see how this one stretched up quite a bit even it was even pretty close to the light but it's still stretched up quite a bit and I've only got it probably three and a half four inches away from the light right now still turning this little fan on every now and then just to kind of help with circulation a humidity is at 55% temperatures at 79 it's staying pretty close right there right now so it's pretty good yeah I just wanted to kind of give you guys a quick little update on what was going on nothing really new to report just other than this little thing right here I don't know I mean it's staying pretty green all the new growth looks pretty good I'm gonna top it once I can get my fingers in there I'm just gonna top it because I don't want it to even if it does decide to start stretching and get some room in between all these true leaves I don't really want it to get any taller than that because I'm gonna try to use the toe so it'll be if it does decide to keep going all LST it and keep it low so yeah that's what's going on so I'll keep you guys updated I'll be back in another couple of days just given these water no nutrients or anything especially for that one even if I was to start doing nutrients you'd want to wait till about day ten maybe twelve just depending on you know how well it's doing so yeah just water for these plants and seeing what's gonna happen so but alright I'll catch you guys back here in a few days and hopefully we see some more progress alright I hope you guys are having a good day that's it blazing out piece of the stone", "tgOBwBPsvIQ": "hey what's up YouTube just giving you a quick update not sure if I'll publish this as a standalone or merge it with another video but we're back in the garden here oh boy I'll see if I can put in some text but when these were planted but I think today's date is May 11th and I believe they were planted like April 29th so they're they're coming along pretty good the yellow tape on the edge of the pots is just I rotate them 90 degrees every time to make sure that the light kind of spends equal amount of time on each side of the plants and then I actually rotate that the plants clockwise once the pot does 360 degrees so strain wise from the previous video lemon cush headband was looking pretty sick in the last video it had helmet had pretty bad was a really slow starter and then the stem kind of got bent up and had to tie it up and it's still looking a bit funny it's it's kind of strange because the bottom of the stem isn't very thick kind of compared to the middle of the stem we'll see if I could show you she sees kind of skinny legs and a big upper body it's skip leg day so that's 11 cush headband but it's coming back nice I almost pulled it over the ground I didn't think it was gonna do anything and over here we have the Amherst Sour Diesel from Humboldt both the Amer Sour Diesel and the lemon cush headband are both from humble seed company Sour Diesel is coming along nice but it's kind of got the same thing with the skinny legs and big upper body not sure what's up with that and then in the back I allstar the cookies cush from Barney's farm and that's that's just powering its way up and looking real nice you got a new light on the way right now is the spider farmer SF 600 so I got a Mars SP 150 coming in the mail pretty quick and then once that's here I'm gonna shove this one over so it's directly under that pot from the back and then the Mars SP 150 is more of a rectangle shape so it'll cover the two plants and there's these positions here when it comes and then ya after gonna get him try to get him topped twice and then go right over at my buddy's house will be done flowering and will take down that tent and then move these into the flowering tent and take a couple weeks off of them plant some more anyway I have to tell you not much nutrients just using kind of Gaia green teas there for for for general purpose dry newts I just kind of mix it with water and I've got a kind of a liquid organic tomato food that I just mix very lightly in as well tap water let it clip dechlorinate not testing pH right now we're gonna get these transferred into probably pots one size up from these I'm not even sure what size pots these are probably three gallons and we'll probably take them up to fives and yeah we'll start putting them on more when we do the transfer all that the soil and the the larger pots gonna be a real high mix of cocoa and perlite probably 5050 and we'll switch over to to a more hydraulic our hydroponic based supplement system at that time all right talk to you guys later Cheers", "b43Idr-CI_4": "hello everybody and today's the day we've been waiting for for the past 12 weeks this is the chalk day on the AJ Sour Diesel like I said this is a week 12 I've run her three times before but this time is the one I've gone the longest there was a lot more knives if you look at some of the other videos or a khole as I should say but I've systemically chopped them off because I wanted to taste them along the way to see what they were doing how they were tasting interestingly enough on this run I would say it's been the least gaseous and flavor although the gassy sour D smell is there that you normally smell that is just so beautiful when I've been smoking it it's been completely completely dominated with a very sweet berry almost like a jam flavor with a hint of citrus so it's kind of interesting I don't know what changed this time I think I may have used a little bit of more of some of that sweet and I think it may have affected it unfortunately everywhere it read online it says there's no way possible you can alter the flavor but it seems like it did have some kind of effect so we'll see sorry about that finger there but just kind of wanted to give you my final thoughts on her I did like running her the full 12 weeks I could definitely see the difference in the nuts because you can see they're very very full calluses are swollen right now if you can't see the the microscope but if you looked at it you would see that there's about 10 to 15% amber as you see here this is a bleached top I had had a few more that bleached but she just got a really dense really heavy very gassy and the smell of a nose and the in the flower room but like I said when you smoked her very fruity other than that very happy with her gonna run her probably a couple more times and then put her away so they so after following up and now we're going to be featuring the candy land I have a keen quad cut for PCG so that will be coming next stay tuned", "n6a_kNEFwo0": "[Music] for over 40 years genetics have

that your fuel system stays lubricated and prevents the formation of algae and it should also help you in colder climates too should definitely help you in colder climates along with cleaning your fuel system and maintaining it it'll also help you bump that cetane number up for a more efficient burn of your diesel fuel and if cetane is just what you're after there's the fuel bomb hellfire which is our straight eight plus cetane enhancer yeah and you guys asked and we brought them back uh we did go away from the bottles that didn't have the measuring little parts in there we brought them back for you so now you can measure out your one ounce per 32 gallons for the f-bomb or four ounces per 32 gallons for the hellfire both these additives are available on our website dieselpowerproducts.com now let's get back to that episode i'll be honest or not i don't really care about it i don't either do i but you know what it's kind of some of this stuff's kind of funny um oh guess we'll just get right into it the headline all right did we even talk about this truck we got a new f-450 and that's the headlining article so um we recently did a build on a 2020 f-450 uh did some carly suspension some dd uh ddc wheels um it turned out really awesome i mean those 450s are killer especially if you want you know a dedicated tow rig so after that truck we decided to purchase one and uh do our own build but this is a 2021 we've got some really cool uh you know parts going on this truck and i'll be honest with you and i've said this before in other podcasts these fords are hot dude they're hottest new floors are freaking hot i'll be honest with you man i think i think rams shaking in their boots after 2020 and 2021. uh hell yeah i can't imagine like we we have that dually out there ramuel yeah but don't get me wrong it's a very purpose-built truck but and i know it's a tradesman like i get that it's not the loaded one but even like a normally trimmed out power stroke even for 17 yeah just smokes ram yeah the transmission's on point the engine's on point the rest of the truck is great i mean it's fantastic as well i mean so awesome truck so we look forward to we it's actually in the shop right now getting some parts i don't know if i could tell you what's going on right now because they're probably doing some sort of post so you just check us out you'll see later but there's some really cool stuff and we'll definitely be talking about it more on the podcast so keep you know we're just trying to keep you posted i mean it's the news so i gotta tell you the news so i'll i'll leave you with this cliffhanger it's gonna be big right okay yeah keep in mind that we have a uh like 40 some odd foot fifth wheel that's designed for a lifted truck so it's designed to be pulled behind a truck with usually at least 40 inch tires yeah um it's gonna be big it's gonna be tow rig and uh um it's gonna be sexy one of the words that uh would not be accurate to describe it as subtle yeah it might be a boy i think we're gonna name it a boy i think it's gonna be a girl it's gonna be a boy yeah yeah yeah she's she's a beast it's really cool like i said it's in the shop the beds off of it there's a little hint the beds off of it right now but uh yeah it'll be really cool we're super excited to tell you guys more about that down the road but speaking of fords there's a limited edition ford f-250 okay it is the ford shelby f250 super baja oh baja come on it is a diesel they're only making 250 of these trucks so i imagine the price that i'm going to tell you at the end will probably rise uh once they start getting down to the uh you know some single digits on that truck probably i i would imagine you're probably going to see some of these at like the meek and car auction or like barrett-jackson i guarantee you'll see one of these rolling through there so 250 trucks that are going to be available it's got racing stripes it's got racing stripes factory lift with fox coilovers right out of the box coilovers yeah he's got fox coins wow that's what the thing said i'm gonna eat my words before i even said them because i was about to just start and i'm a four guy okay so i i i kind of you know i brought people down with the racing stripes they're like oh stupid i brought you back up with the lift i'm about to bring you back down okay stainless steel gauges because everybody stainless steel gauges yeah i don't understand fully with that i mean the gauge cluster which is pretty much like ninety percent digital now is stable it's all stainless steel yeah or is that like a whatever okay well all right i i imagine one of those boards that uh you like type something in and it goes and it rolls the numbers like i'm imagining little stainless steel plates that are just going every time you drive it like at like grand central station yeah yeah yeah so that's what i'm imagining it's got billet racing pedals because everybody needs those do you remember like back in the day like i'm sure everybody went through this phase with like tuner cars and like because fast and the fear anybody that is in like maybe our age range you know there was a spat of like i don't know when i was when i was younger and that like that stuff was like kind of coming out and that's like right when i was getting my license so like everybody was like well what kind of car you want you know and you go online go to like jc whitney or whatever and like look up all the little little things you can add you can add the racing pedals or like a shift knob i'm just bringing me back because i uh when i was in high school i worked at pep boys yeah so all my high school friends come in tuners just their freaking shift knob the pedal inserts a pedal insert steering wheel cover a little fart can on yeah some lighting that feeds to the base of your stereo so you have some neon or you're doing wonder glow yeah your dual stereo with your dual subwoofers and i don't mean duels on tool too i mean the brand the brand dual where you can buy it already in the plexi class yep lighted deal pre-rattle had one of those um the price the price of this truck okay so super duties an f-250 like a well-equipped one 80-ish grand right around there a well-equipped one yeah not like a platinum but like a like a laramie lariat i'm gonna back up because i was originally going to try to talk [ __ ] about the price but now that i'm thinking okay we've got a brand new probably loaded i would imagine loaded super duty right so you're probably pushing maybe 90 grand for that truck i don't know i haven't priced one lately because it's way out of my mind if they're going so hard as to say it's got billet pedals and the stainless steel gauges i'm sure there is more but i kind of picked out the stuff i hope they're actually going race on this like that well engine i didn't see any differences to like engine tran it's a power stroke so but uh i started it's 125 000 for this truck which really isn't that bad if you think about if it's got fox coil over suspension and some some like some gangster [ __ ] going on underneath like we're talking like suspension-wise drivetrain and engine i i can almost guarantee they didn't do anything too but it's got like custom embroidered seats of course and i think i saw um some like freaking uh like floor liners custom floor liners or like shelby i'm sure it's got some other cool oh and it's got a you know like in the challengers like the first like srts they had a little plaque on the it's got one of those so i'm going to retract my statement about being super stoked about coilovers because i just remembered that companies like icon make a bolt-in coilover for radius arm super duties yeah thanks ford yeah appreciate that they're probably getting them from one of those guys anyways 125 805 125 805 each go pick yourself up a couple of those bad boys it'll be worth some money down the road probably not probably not anyways okay moving on all right so this is where i started running out of diesel well i did and then ben reminded me of one so anyways we're gonna get a little less serious and more serious here so um this next story comes from i think the uk south wales new south wales not regular south wales the new one diesel the jack russell under engine of moving car for 30 minutes what's up dog survived unbelievable jack jack russell named diesel has been you could tell us some of the wording you'd be like all these british douches [Laughter] uh jack russell named diesel has been rescued uninjured from under the engine under the engine i don't know how that works he's just latching on of a moving car as he traveled on a busy highway for a half hour diesel's owner had been traveling along the hunter expressway in new south wales on tuesday afternoon when he heard a familiar howling okay you don't say the 18-month stowaway had hitched a ride under the bonnet of the hyundai suv from singleton to braxton okay so the car reached speeds of up to 100 kilometer uh kilometers an hour i have no idea how fast that is and i'm thinking like 50 or 60 probably um so yeah he's okay his name was diesel made it into the news evidently things in the uk are pretty pretty stale pretty stale pretty still but i tell you what things in india are heating up oh yeah things in india are getting a little crazy okay i don't know if it has to do with this like you know some sort of like sickness going around i don't know haven't heard of it um high diesel prices in india prompt smuggling so we've got okay have you guys ever seen um there's a show i can't remember if it's on like history channel or discovery or whatever but it was like dangerous roads yeah you've ever seen that yeah or like it was like when when ice road truckers was like real hot yeah yeah well they're roads like through the what is that the himalayas or is that in india i don't even know if i'm in the right country anyways i know their roads are like super sketch yeah like super sketch carved into the side of a mountain pretty much and like not even wide enough for even one let alone two cars so i'm just imagining like a fuel truck like who's that guy that's like screw it i'll do it i'll do it we're gonna load it up so i got it i got it i'm fine it's from bloomberg oh let me i'm sorry the jack russell story was from the daily mail so i'm not trying to steal that um the first story was from us uh the shelby i forgot to write that one down so sorry but this is for bloomberg uh pump prices are so high in india that some gasoline and diesel uh that some of the gasoline and diesel exported to neighboring countries is being smuggled back through porous land borders oh imagine that because there's not like no walls cops that like picture all those roads maybe they don't have enough petrol for their control vehicles a large oil truck this is the their large oil truck 359 gallons it's like that's like like a glorified slipstick yeah i think we got one of those tanks in the super duty that'll fit that um so a large oil truck with 359 gallons of diesel has been smuggled to india where pump prices are at a record was uh held last week in nepal please actually stop this guy um 359 yeah that's it so how i think we need to look up rupees rupee rupee two to u.s dollar okay because it's a hundred rupee so pump prices of gasoline which have breached the 100 rupee a liter mark in several parts of india are the highest uh in the south asia region according to data compiled by global petrol prices.com blah blah resulting in illegal trade as indians grapple with soaring fuel prices ironically nepal gets its petroleum from petroleum fuels from india which is which also exports to uh neighbors bangladesh and sri lanka so how much was fuel 100 rupees a liter 100 rupees earlier that's a dollar 38. yeah yeah how many liters are in a how many liters a gallon about four like 0.26 liters per 1 gallon moral of that story is sorry guys quit complaining all right it's a freaking dollar a liter give me a break can i get a leader or koa yeah a liter a cola is probably more it is it is well they got to pay for all their new training so yeah okay um all right enough with india um [Music] we're gonna move on to i'm trying to decide which one all right so this next story we've had we've had other manufacturers sort of proclaim this okay you know recently ford you've seen the commercials they're like promising they're gonna be all you know their whole fleet of vehicles they sell are gonna be electric oh yeah lame anyways they're not the only one that's jumping on that bandwagon we got gm to eliminate gas and diesel light duty cars and suvs they didn't say trucks they didn't say trucks but i have a feeling that's it's incumbent encompassing you know anyway so gm by 20 2035 they hope to have a whole electric fleet of electric vehicles okay whoop do you do honestly it's it's it's anytime i see articles like this i i have an idea of what the what the goal is with this what they're doing they're obviously with i don't like to get political or anything on this show but the way that politics go of course it's like the first one to what is that what is the phrase i'm looking for um that uh you know a certain group of people will you're losing me right now i'm losing you golly it's like um they're just trying to make themselves look good at this point because they're saying they're going to do something that's great for the environment are they actually going to do it i don't know yeah and that also kind of goes you and i have had this debate a couple of times well actually not debate but we've discussed it the whole like electric truck and stuff like that and you i think you and i are pretty much on the same page as like if if you could build a better mousetrap build the better mousetrap right but we are also on the same page of if you build the better mousetrap it has to be you know everything has to be better yeah and what i mean that by that is if and this is information that i don't know if i were able to dig in deeper maybe find the manufacturers and figure that out i wouldn't mind it um but the main thing for me is like okay we're getting rid of these diesel trucks that you know are x amount of harmful for the environment whatever it may be because everything has a cost everything has an environmental impact i'm fully aware of that but is it actually better or worse than making batteries yeah and the energy it takes the energy that it takes to store energy on batteries yeah um if if that process is cleaner and can be done better than a diesel truck okay i understand that i'm not saying i'm the guy that's gonna be in line to buy a freaking electric truck yeah but i'm not like i'm not against it you know uh no i'm not against it either i mean i would i would i'd have i'd own a tesla yeah like i don't a tesla i mean they're if it actually was better and then and it's and i'm not saying that because like oh you gotta prove it to me but like what's the goal is the goal here to make something that's more environment truly environmentally friendly yeah or is the goal to just like change the industry and now we just have a new set of problems yeah well the thing that that kind of irritates me is nobody talks about the process at which it you know it is to to make batteries and to do that stuff i mean there's obviously adverse effects from making batteries like they're you you're not you can't sit you can't say they're telling me that the whole making of batteries is like a zero emission process right there's got to be something but the other thing too that frustrates me it's like gas cars suvs any internal combustion engine they have they have find those things so well nowadays oh yeah that it's like is that really the the biggest problem like we talked about in the other news episode where we've got you know cars driving around on freaking four out of six cylinders and you know like stuff like that i think i feel like those vehicles like and i'm not bashing old vehicles i love old vehicles but like get them running right you know what i mean like but you know all these new cars where they're they've got these new transmission technologies they've got new egr systems new after treatment systems on diesels like they're getting these things to the point where they've they've never been this clean so it's like why can't we clean up maybe if they're really concerned about the environment let's clean up other aspects other things that are that that are causing this rise in in emissions in the world and let's face it it's a world it's it emissions is not just us year after year i believe the u.s has been on a downward trajectory as far as emitting emissions it's the other countries that you have to worry about so we could go to zero emissions all we freaking want if not if all the other countries aren't doing that it's it's pointless well especially if it shoots our own economy in the foot doing that well yeah i mean look at the price of some of these electronic these electric vehicles they're they're not cheap and they're not they're not cheap to maintain i would imagine after time i don't know you know i don't know how much a battery pack costs or how long a motor lasts you know i i i don't know i think it's i think it's i'm trying to think of the the phrase that is used for this where it's like um shapiro uses it all the time or it's like oh i'm proclaimed that i'm doing this because i'm a good person but you know you know what i mean like what are they it's a phrase social justice it's kind of well they do it a lot those people uh gosh darn it i'm gonna think of it after this is done and i'll be like that's the word and i'm just gonna do it yeah anyways the fun like i'm not even gonna read like this article that i added on here i'm just going to read the last part of it because this is the part that i was like you guys are freaking morons so g so this article is about gm saying how much money they're going to spend on electric vehicles and make these things you know their whole lineup electric blah blah blah blah gm statement also left some wiggle room in continuing internal combustion engines critics noted the company did not rule out using carbon offsets or credits if absolutely necessary to reach its goal of eliminating tailpipe emissions that means gm could invest in programs that remove carbon dioxide from the air such as tree planting right so and i thought the whole one of the whole things about the big paris accord and all that kind of stuff and still well it's carbon credits getting rid of carbon credits you can't just buy your way out of this one guys no you can plant your tree out of this one apparently okay i'm gonna get a hot and bother we keep going on this so then when i started thinking i was like okay plant a bunch of trees it's like california can't even manage their forests that they have so it's like well let's give them a freaking billion more trees they'll take care of it that's outrageous that is it's stupid it's stupid yeah anyways i'm you know i i like electronic vehicles as far as the the features that they have as far you can't beat acceleration of an electronic motor the the the power to the power to the ground or whatever you want to call it is hard to match on a gasoline engine i mean it's as hard as what can what can be produced so it's they're they're a great idea but i i just especially for big trucks or people using their truck as a truck the technology is not there the infrastructure is not there okay you're again like the kenworth the cascadia electric has a range of like nothing like basically only good for like local deliveries so anyways you know i i think a lot of these again these companies are just kind of throwing that out there to make themselves because i mean these companies get probably government subsidies especially gm i mean especially like you know we intend to do this oh you're that's your intention yeah so you go man yeah so they they're they're gonna try to make the loudest voice the happiest the happiest one yeah so anyways last story this is the most relevant story to our industry um as probably everybody has seen there is a new drag race series coming to the west coast yeah woohoo uh which is it's pretty awesome because there's a lot there's a a lot of the big diesel events or east coast or midwest um events so it's cool to to bring one over to the west side i'm sure california is going to be jacked how does that work i don't know like whenever i see people post videos of like yeah going to the sled pools and they're like in california like are you guys like are you being hoodwinked yeah is someone there just gonna arrest you yeah i feel like there's like a guy with like a ponytail and someone got him yeah i can't believe these people showed up we're gonna just hand them hey we're i'm gonna be writing tickets for the next four weeks um so it's a hot shot secret hot shots secret whole shot diesel series whoa uh pretty cool i mean uh it's going to as uh they will so they're going to limit overlap of other diesel drag race events incorporate eighth mile passes instead of quarter mile which i like quarter mile a little bit better because you could you know in some cases you could beat someone at the eighth mile and then have or that or you could lose at the eighth mile and then catch them on the on the court we've talked about why they went away from the whole quarter mile thing and i get that hopefully they come back around and start doing cool yeah so they're around all the same classes and rules um in conjunction with odss don't know what that is probably should look that up ultimately develop an east versus west world final event that will be cool in other local news spokane raceway has called it quits for this uh season that's what i should have put in the news dude like 15 20 minutes ago that's right i'm gonna screw this article that that i honestly i i think is ridiculous because it's an actual it's a it's an okay i mean it probably needs some maintenance but i mean it's a that track when i was a you know a kid just getting my license like that was the thing we did you know every they had the uh high school drags there you can go you know it's like it was i think it was like free to drag racer it was like super cheap to drag racing you just race anything like there was guys racing go-karts freaking snowmobiles like all sorts of different [ __ ] so i've got i've got a lot of uh i really i like that track i like it it's it's and it's that track has gone through so many different owners and has been up and down up and down up and down the last one that i don't know if they purchased it or whatever they did i thought they were going to keep it going for a while and like had a good thing going but yeah that's unfortunate now i don't have a track we don't have a track it's not like i have anything to race at the track but yeah it's one of those things where like i it makes me sad because i know there's a lot of racing enthusiasts up here um but at the end of the day it's like i've been there twice it was for work yeah like i i dude back in the day that place was hopping dude that place was hopping we would literally go there every friday night every friday night and drag racer with my brother and he's like drag racing his ram 1500 standard cab like race truck yeah seriously i i [ __ ] i our drag truck i blew it up two times at that track two times yeah good times good times good times so that's that's sad but cool we got a west coast series oh maybe we'll end up making it to one of those events that'd be kind of cool in other news uh i'm currently daily driving a forward [ __ ] ranger say uh 2021 and uh i wanted to touch on this with the whole like how vehicles are getting more efficient yeah so i just took this thing back and forth uh from spokane to kellogg which is it's about an hour hour and 20 minutes but it goes over for july pass yeah so you go go through a mountain range you have an up and down and i legit set this thing cruise control either like 65 or 70 and it it shifted out of 10th gear once really and i got it that's got the the in the four cylinder small you can use the 10 speed and i i reset the odometer like for the whole trip thereby because i kind of wanted to see it's like i yeah this kind of fell on my lap so i want to check it out yeah 21.5 miles a gallon that's not bad for a little pickup like that yeah and that's what kind of makes me wonder like the whole going straight you know no gas no diesel it's like they're getting these gas engines pretty dialed yeah oh my gosh i forgot one okay so i'm to backtrack a little bit so we know this is we actually have talked about this before but just kind of in passing but we've got all these manufacturers so we got four all these so we got the big three obviously ford chevy and dodge ford and chevy both are like our whole line electric that's what we're doing then you got freaking dodge over here putting hellcats in minivans like that's why i love you guys that's why i love you i saw an article about it and it was like like it was like uh dodge's remark was like hold hold my gas pump something watch this like hold my beer and watch this moment as a ford guy here's my response to that go drive a new suv with a 3.5 liter ecoboost and a 10 speed in it and tell me how much you actually need a hellcat and something like that um [Music] if you've got like a thing between your legs all right see absolute freaking lily we need a hellcat and a freaking good dodge caravan all right so i i get that that's tight like the whole the kid and he's like awesome but also and keep in mind i'm a cubic inch guy yeah if i have the option for a big engine i'm going big engine yeah but i will tell you this right now after driving that ranger with that stupid freaking ecoboost in there i'm starting to get it like i get the home okay okay small engine turbo lots of gears i hear you if they would have gave you a ram trx with a hellcat for a rental i'm sure you'd be like dude this hellcat is insert like you would be a totally different like yeah this ford ranger is quite nice it's got a smooth ride and it's super quiet it's got good mileage screw all that give me the hellcat okay you're not wrong all right you are all i want to hear is horsepower and tires burning off that's what i want to hear okay i want to have two keys one's red for party the other is for the wife and we're gonna get loud we're going to freaking roast these brand new tires off in about 38 seconds all right i like it dodge keep it up don't go electric let's put hellcats in a freaking what's their small car the dart let's put a hellcat in a dart let's put a hellcat and a what's another small one i don't even know didn't even make a neon they're gonna need anybody no i'm making neon anymore caliber is that one i don't know hellcat their answer is like oh hellcat yeah i like it i like it keep it up that's an american manufacturer you know what dodge like the history of dodge is kind of cool like if you ever watch the series like there's a really a really good series on uh the auto manufacturers when they were first starting out like ford you know chevy and dodge like the dodge brothers and all this like they've kind of always been on like the outside kind of doing their own thing and i will say someone like the early dodge like hot rod like cars badass like they're one of the coolest look like it's freaking this is dodge man it's freaking just doing it i like it growing up a ford guy it was always affordability keep that dodge for yourself keep that door to yourself and i'll get that [ __ ] around here but nowadays man they're just they're they're i think it's cool and i think it's i don't know if they actually like that article i read where they're like oh my gosh like i don't know if they actually said that because i did then see an article where they're like yeah we're looking at doing an electric truck or something down the road but hey man answer to electric hell cat done how about you get something better than a 68 hour fee yeah he's got a hellcat in who cares and all that very enthusiastic conversation about nothing that has to do with this podcast oh well that's great i just thought it was funny because they're like screw you electric people horsepower yeah i like it that's not wrong yeah i mean and you were 100 correct they're like would you like this ford ranger or this trx man i'll tell you what i bleed for blue but [ __ ] it bro give me the trx seriously seriously that didn't come with a red key they could have they could have gave they could like if it was me if i was in your shoes they could have gave me like it's it's like winter right snow ice like well we've got this one pickup or we've got this challenger with a hellcat i'll be like challenge your hellcat i don't give a [ __ ] it's snowing we don't have change or hell yeah but you do realize it's snowing about a foot an hour listen what i said i'm gonna take this thing home i'm gonna go in my garage i'm gonna fire it up and i'm gonna sit there and rev the piss out of it for a half hour that's what i'm gonna do i'm gonna take the restrictor plate off but don't tell anybody it's not entirely street legal i'm just gonna sit there and just rev it that's all i'm gonna do i'll take an uber to work i'll rev this thing art whatever all right that's gonna wrap this up finally yeah we're wrapping this one up thanks for tuning in guys we'll see you next week see ya thanks for tuning in make sure to subscribe and check us out at dieselpowerproducts.com", "cJCv_MVqJzc": "good morning good afternoon everybody and possibly could even depending on where you're at this is you grow I grow and I'm here on day 71 week 10 of the AJ's Sour Diesel and like I said before this is about my third run with her and this is going to be the longest I've ever taken her and I kind of just wanted to show you this what's kind of going on with her I did notice that on this on this run in reducing the nutrients down to about 80% possibly even a little bit less she's don't lot better stuff like this for example on the last run that I did she had a ton more of these kind of I don't know they're kind of like these little tiny leaves in here that a lot of people say or do to you know heavy nitrogen instead of that nature and this run she didn't as much but what I also notice is that she did not have as much frost as the last time but we'll see you know because not always having a super frosty plant means that it's the best right now I would definitely say between last run and this run less frosty this run way better smell super gassy and yeah she's doing really good and I'm going to probably post another video journal a week 11 so you can kind of get an idea and then obviously on week 12 when I cut her but she's doing very very well in soil it's just been getting really really fat as you can see and she's feeding out really nicely and unfortunately I got a little bit of bleach because she got too close to the top but other than that she's doing great and here's a full view get an idea right in here I got rid of some of the sub branches because I wanted to taste them and test them out so far they've been coming out perfect so I'll catch you guys soon here and here's the finished of week ten day 71 of the G Sour Diesel take care everybody and happy girl", "IPzDxIMV2wg": "[Music] let's go grow to real life so quick update No - happy new year hope everybody's investors so it's the planet actually looking at it's about eight and a half weeks I'm looking to take it maybe nine nine and a half just to get a nice and time I checked the trichomes with the microscope about 30 percent clouds so I'm going to wait till I get amber animal [ __ ] down I'd to take that might take a bottle me the sort that would vote not from the homi J hunter aliens card or via finish enough doing her thing easy to grow plant man got a 15-gallon it's actually the biggest I've grown up indoors on other side is kind of missing because the Galactic gorilla died harvested a few nights ago I had to make special accommodations to hang dry him because the class was so viewed I also had to put my lights up out of bed room for about 4 weeks the trellis baby alright so I want to touch on my diesel I'm making my F tools and I got different phenotypes that I pollinated simply because I don't have the space to keep clones from them as a bed stone then go back to the one so I'll do the pollination and I do all my assessments while they are in flower like this one these beans I won't continue to use like I won't pop them again they basically going to be birdseed if some more birdseed plants like this is what I'm trying to breed out of my line of the doc diesel because they in there you know might get a plant that's gonna give you problems that's always gonna seem like they hungry so I'm trying to get those plants out of there all right this is a plant that I pollinated that I'm gonna continue doing tests with I like the track production turkey smells coming off for her she's showing me that she got more sativa indica this room right here is my winner this was the best phenotype that I got out of my F once that I liked you know and she's shown that sativa dominant is what I'm looking forward to to continue in the line and the buzz also turned black when his dark purple is black more blackish purple or dark perfect so once the temperature once you very ate the temperature so you gonna get you a little color change a by like a little color in a bud so boom f2 is continuing I know that the beans the phenotypes that come out of this majority of them is gonna look like this so I like that also the nuts are hard I got that sourish gas what I'm going for because regeneration Sawa and f2 over here I utilize pollen from the original father the original salvos ex-father so this is the IBL this man back cross of mah gahd diesel about my f2 two different things people this is I used two minutes I use the male and a female from the f1 I got my f2 this is my back cross this is where I used the female from the f1 generation but I pollinated her with the original father that I made the line you do so this is gonna have more dominant of the father treats and of this phenotype that you see right here nice little small tight nerves so yeah I BLF twos let's go check out my Amherst Sour Diesel y'all know me y'all know I love to grow Diesel's that's that's basically why I started growing it's to find that neal of that Sour Diesel but things don't change so much but I'm sticking to my roots Peter I might create a line with little fruitiness but it still gotta have some kind of gas appeal that's just how I roll so my Amherst our diesel humble seed organization I love that seed company this plant it's beautiful grow - look at that man she look like a lotus flower hard nugs turning dark purple talking with the temperature in here a little I'm looking forward to this plant this was from my femme run so basically I didn't give them much bedtime so it's a small plant I got her nestled inside of the 15 gallon that I just cut the Galactica or a lot of and over here is the cush brothers mas cush it's a company out of Spain and I must've um about these beans from a 420 convention that we went to a couple years ago yes so this is a company out of spam ask us it's a nice little plant same thing here this this off my FEM run I didn't get a opportunity to grow these plants big you know I'm saying oh look at the perps coming in I didn't get a opportunity to grow these plants big we have to flower everything and put everything in seed form that I would like to world while the future they look differently I grow tube gonna check you on the next one I'm Malia would have shot at this am her solid diesel Wagle one", "1gpqV_iUV9c": "hey everyone new bud back here with a different kind of review for you today still another review but something a little different uh make sure you like comment subscribe all that stuff as usual and uh i just updated the ranking system for the previous videos got some more videos coming up in the next week or two and have a huge sweet christmas stash that's going to be uh ordered here in the next week i'm so going to be doing a whole bunch of videos over christmas holidays which i'm pretty excited about so uh today we're gonna do a couple 510 cartridge reviews um so i've got the daily special og kush and the daily special uh super sour diesel so got both of these at the same time on the ocs obviously and uh i have to admit not bad i really enjoyed smoking them and the convenience of the carts themselves um i found for me personally with these two carts um that was probably two or three four pulls that got me to a good sweet spot of being high um the taste i found on the og kush to be a little bit better than the super sour diesel did not have a real chemical taste which was nice um i know these aren't the live resin um aren't you know the full spectrum they're the distillate but still i enjoyed them not bad didn't clog at all used the super sour diesel pretty much all up and looks like it's a pretty clean chamber not much residue left there were no air bubbles even after the cartridge has been used it's pretty clean um yeah i know i'm pretty excited about it um same with the og kush looks like i'm pretty much three quarters of the way through and uh yeah same thing overall seems to be a pretty good cartridge for the price i would love to try some of the um full spectrum the live resin all those type of things heard really good stuff about the gray beard but also heard a couple complaints that it was clogging um what was the other one the white rhino island honey the pure the full spectrum from pure sun farm i would like to try those two just as a comparison but i find with these ones anyways with the distillate that it doesn't get me as high as the actual flower more of a short term intense head high opposed to a longer term full body high on a flower and by full body i don't mean you know a body high but more of like a full i guess for lack of better word full spect from high i don't know it's different i find anyways maybe other people feel differently but i find with the distillate it's more of a intense head high rush um also want to try the new bingo carts out there i suspect they're probably pretty similar to the daily special um but yeah so not bad so i've got none left of the super sour diesel oh like i said probably a quarter left of the og kush so why don't we try a little bit here just so you guys can see firsthand what it's like and uh obviously you can't put these ones under the microscope but you guys can at least get the uh the taste and um overall experience with this card itself so let's give it a shot and see [Music] laughs i find it like a little bit more harsh too with the um with the carts that's a nice taste doesn't taste too chemically which is good um like i said it's got some decent it's almost skunky sort of but i like it and for the discreteness discreetness and convenience i'll probably buy these you know as a uh a little traveling kit although we're not traveling much anymore um but maybe you know just for something throughout the day where you want to quit something quick nice and easy but you know i i would suggest if you enjoy cards something cheap these were good i would probably buy them again um let's give another shot and see [Music] [Music] excuse me [Music] blew a cloud on that one boys and girls um thc percent i think they came in at around 80 which is pretty good um i wonder though [Music] you know what's the other 20 obviously it's to distill it but like what's the percentage of to distill it that is probably not the best for you should we say i wouldn't say you know uh toxic but you know 80 thc what's the other 20 i don't know hopefully more clarity comes with this industry and these carts and the live resin the full spectrum all that kind of [ __ ] we stay away more from the uh butane extractions and all that kind of stuff um and just don't find them to be the most enjoyable to smoke but like i said if you guys like this kind of stuff if you like these carts definitely try this uh daily special og kush super sour diesel out and let me know your thoughts and look forward to doing some really good videos for you guys in the coming weeks like i said um got some pretty good stuff gonna be ordering on deck i'm going to be getting some wapa radicand i really want to get some white wedding and i'm from miss foo um what was the other ones that i wanted to get white wedding guapa um royal city i want to get the uh rc goddess there's one more that i was really excited about getting but anyways i'll be doing a huge like uh review and pictures and all that kind of good [ __ ] so stay tuned guys and girls for our next video here and uh look forward to uh talk to you guys next time alright enjoy", "CwXj8D9LkRc": "hello welcome back JB Ford 20 let me start this over again I just made a video for you guys and then it didn't I was making it and it wasn't recording so idiot anyway uh sorry I haven't talked to you guys for a bit we had a little bit of a backswing whatever you want to call it mishap and these guys had to come down ASAP before anything else happened so we had some Hermey I don't know if they got pollinated whatever we're not a hundred percent sure but seed started to farm so they had to come down ASAP so I've been cutting non-stop for seven days anyway this is the last of it some some of that kosher dog that's a gelato I think that's Bruce Banner yeah that's Bruce Banner that's Bruce yeah so nowhere near as big and fluffy as they could have been I'm not impressed because if we've had way better but amazing to smoke amazing everything else just neither not as amazing as we usually have so this Bruce Banner to me looks amazing but I think there's a couple seeds in there so anyway I've had three batches of all of these wires hung already so as you can tell I've been really busy cutting every day for hours and hours and hours so I'm gonna go downstairs quick time show you guys we're doing a major overhaul clean so quickly go downstairs sorry you want to make you guys Disney we'll say hi to Bob hi Bob and I'm sorry sir sorry and here we go sorry huh I'm actually tape recording this time yeah so here we are obviously close to the room huh that's very sad sight nothing on the calendar but that will change shortly so let me see there you go there you go everything is bleach every chord every sheet the bulbs are down the ceilings been soaked we're putting more reflectix up here uh knows but we've already bleached Oh see links to we use the that pump spray are there that we were using for potassium bicarbonate for any p.m. tissues but now we've switched that over we're going to use that for bleach we're cleaning from now on and then we'll get another one for potassium bicarbonate if we need it anyway everything's like I said getting a major overhaul overhaul clean and that's that we're gonna raise that up because everybody you know down the down the 420 right huh down the 420 highway so the Nigeria I told us to raise that up a little bit so any co2 that we are getting in here will drop obviously cuz you know two drops and I'm gonna raise that up a little bit and what else anything else huh that's it for now so yeah like I was saying and that last recording that didn't record we have will be starting 10 garlic glue for 10 cookies Girl Scout cookies and 5 chemo Remo chemo so 25 there so we'll get started and I will record from day one everything from you know breaking open my seeds getting them ready sewing them seeing how fast they grow and then I mean we all know kind of how long it takes to grow them but anyway and we'll watch them day by day and keep you guys updated at least every once a week okay anyway so sorry for the little gap in that but obviously like I said I was busy cutting and scrambling so wish us luck crossed your fingers so for now guys bye", "_yWiG0aSpdE": "hey there welcome back to

really like the effects i don't get too stoned from it i'm actually not very buzzed from it more or less it took away all my pain and helped me relax i put any information i can in the video i can't really tell you much more about it it's just pretty basic you", "zVQruAIpxWk": "[Music] welcome to wheat entertainment and we love talking about grandy flora strains and this bud is something called yada da and it's really a unique looking bud but it was crunchy dry when i got it i opened up this bag and then i set it down and now it's even drier because i think i got this thing i don't know three weeks ago a month ago it just sat in the back i don't know why i didn't review it but i didn't do it so today's the day for yada da and let me load my little scooper into vapor cup straw i've already got two in here we're gonna add the third then we're gonna tamper and we're going to stick this down in the vapor cup then we're going to talk about yadda da yada comes in this bag and i got this at cookies maywood i got this at the apples and bananas drop down there i ran down there they held that for me and there were some comments on wheat entertainment so i grabbed it when i was down there and this flower has 26 thc and people are asking for the package date and uh so i'm going to give it that but to get that date i need a magnifying glass because my eyes aren't so good anymore so this is the package manufactured it is 9 29 20. oh no wonder it's so dry it's been in this bag for months right and you know what's crazy you would think that they're saving money on the jars right so at least they would give us some kind of moisture pack in here so these flowers when they come out of this bag are more fresh so let's say i got this the beginning january was harvested three months before crazy just crazy but anyway it's not about the dryness i don't wait for that so even though i note it that has nothing to do with my ratings my ratings are all about the something something and everyone's got their own something something that they're looking for but what i'm looking for are heavy flowers with focus that could grin me out i have to stay active i have a lot of responsibilities have to take care of i need flowers that can let me do that now i'm also a heavy hitter so a lot of the flowers even though i call them focus flowers they could stone you to the bone but it doesn't necessarily do that for me but certain ones do like the couch lock flowers but this isn't about catch lock i'm not looking for those type of flies this is about focused flowers that can grin me out so today it's jan dada turn to get the review we're looking for the best well let's check it out so you can see that's about amount a time it takes for vapor cup to work you can see that right there that's the terpenes the cannabinoids the water vapor and the oil vapor you can see it condenses right on the straw it takes about a minute and 20 once this cup is hot and also a lot of people have vapor cup so make sure your cup is hot if the cup is hot you need less time in the chamber if it's a fresh you just start it up you're going to need more time in the chamber and that's one of the things when you get vapor cup you got to learn use but i love this thing this thing changed my life but today it's about yada da so let's check it out yada da by grandiflora at 330 degrees out of vapor cup let's do this again so this flower's got a light og taste with a pungent pal but there's much bigger pungent pals than this one but it has it and the pungent pal it's i'm gonna say it's something like the chicken wing you know when you go buy chicken wings you smell it it makes you kind of like the ammonia taste people say ammonia but if you try vapor cup i'm going to tell you it's a pungent pal this flower took me a lot of flour to get stoned actually but it definitely got me stoned this flower's strong enough but not super strong and i thought it was good so what did i rate yada da i'm looking for the best and this flower you know at first i'm saying it's not strong enough but i used a really lot of it i used up half an eighth on the session i mean i really used a lot of it and in the end the feeling was actually kind of good it wasn't heavy it wasn't you had focus or didn't have focus i would say it was like a cruiser a little bit i wish it personally would have been a little heavier this flower gets an 8.65 which means it's a good flower if you're not a super heavyweight yeah it's a try but for someone who's a super heavyweight this flower may be not strong enough for them it was good but there's definitely better out of granny flora if you want to get a vapor cup this item right here and i'm telling you instead of smoking your flour up and joints get one of these things that little bit of flour that i put into this cup can last you 10 minutes and stone you to the bone i love this thing makes so many opportunities for use i love it and you can see it at vaporcup.com if you want to see my favorite picks you can see them on wheat entertainment.com that site's just getting updated right now it's going to have my top 100 strains in la out of 1500 strains i tried this is my journey i'm looking for the best thanks for joining in if you have a tip for me leave it below the video i'm the doctor i post every day but sunday it's my day off party on my friends [Music] you", "hSHRUiCR0fg": "hello again everybody and welcome back to the channel in today's video we're going to be talking about our week 11 and week 12 indoor cannabis grow but before we get into today's video folks if you wouldn't mind if you're new here to the channel please consider subscribing and helping out our farm i would appreciate it and for those of you that have already subscribed thank you so much i really do appreciate all the support you all have given us so folks if you are interested in supporting our farm go ahead and check out our links in the description below for hamp flour and hemp seeds if you want to grow your own hemp retail sales have been pretty decent this week on the farm so i do appreciate all the support so folks let's talk about what is going on here with week 11 and week 12 and what we've been doing and what the plants are actually showing you right now so first and foremost as you can see there are two males in the back there and they're doing very very well um we actually had three males so the three plants of bioxberry that we put in they all ended up being males which was kind of surprising considering that the other two weren't really showing that they were males but they're it's sometimes very hard early on to tell the difference um so as you can see where we cut one down so here it is we cut it down and now we're down to two males and honestly i really would only prefer to only have one male so one of these may get the chopping block relatively soon but one of the reasons that i'm keeping two males is that i'm going to harvest the pollen and actually save the pollen for a future seed project where i can actually just flower one plant in the tent and actually pollinate it myself so that's one reason that i'm keeping uh the two males the other one is a little genetic diversity they're both very strong plants but as you can see the one on the right hand side here this guy right over there is the bigger and stronger of the two plants so that's the one i would really like to see breed with the other plants so now we put in the other three bioxberry plants let me kind of move these guys out of the way here and i will show you what's going on with them so here you go there's the bioxberry there's another one and then there's another one way back in the middle so we put all the plants that we started in here now um the other thing that we're doing is obviously flowering two of our other strains which is auto sweetened and cherry wine and i'm going to bring you close up to them so we can take a look at them so as you can see auto sweeten is flowering uh it's in full blown flour now and we're on our way to pollinating our auto sweetened our cherry one on the other hand as you can see is just starting out it's just really starting out and um it should really start catching on here in the next week or so as the plants start moving on in the flower stage the flowers are going to keep getting bigger bigger and bigger and the the males are a little bit ahead of the female so i'm hoping that the females start speeding up a little bit they were both very reluctant to switch to flower this is this is really the first few days you've been able to see the flower heads on the plant um the biox berry has yet to show now i cut that third male about a week ago right at week 11 and i put the other three in there they still haven't really shown yet which gives me a lot of promise that they are going to be females so that's really about it folks uh it's been pretty pretty steady going uh feeding has uh continued and it will continue to be uh the cold war organic angel touch and i'll show you that right now as we as we're closing out the video here this is what we've been feeding them a very steady schedule once a week and we're just giving them a lot of nutrients that they need now again folks the reason using this is it's npk value which is uh 0.5017 and that that is really important for the flowering stage i found that the potassium levels uh increased really do give you some really superior flowers but folks that is really it for today it's been uh pretty steady and i'm really excited to start getting some genetic diversity here on the farm i'm really excited to breed our cherry wine with our biosphere i think that's going to be a really special strain and i'm really looking forward to seeing that in our grow this year um and then of course auto sweetened we're going to give it a little bit of a boost being bred with our biox berry i'd be interested to see how that one turns out because owl sweden has some really large flowers and our biox berry has some really large very nice flowers so be interesting to see how all this comes out but that is it for today folks if you guys are interested in hemp flour go ahead and check out the links in the description below along with seeds if you guys have any questions feel free to drop a comment on the video i do always appreciate hearing from you guys and as always you can find me on instagram and facebook but that is all for this week folks i hope you all stay happy healthy and i will see you in another video", "AwXuWjRuEVc": "hey guys YouTube's been a real tank about the Community Guidelines so if you are over the age of 18 you're cool but if you're not please don't watch this he'd even dudettes welcome back to mr. Canucks crow by the way I'm matter this is the first time you've ever popped into this channel today's video is all about the art of simplicity remember when you were a kid and planting a seed was merely just that you placed a seed in the soil and it sprouts well honestly it seems like us ganja growers like to add a few steps in between before that seed ever sees soil cut say that five times quick anyways I never really got that memo so here's the old-fashioned way of how I germinate my seeds [Music] so heading on downstairs to where I like to do all my transplanting and I'm gonna grab my medium of choice which is cocoa and the brand I prefer to use it's just called no cocoa it's exactly like can of cocoa but the only difference is you can't make the joke about how you need mo cocoa get it [Music] anyways I'm also using slow time-released dry amendments as my nutrients which the brand I'm using as Gaia green and a little using these small cell pots which are large enough for the seeds to germinate and then veg for a couple weeks before having the transplant them into bigger pots and yeah before you even asked me bro I do amend the medium right off the start because it's slow time release food so the seeds will germinate and then begin to veg with food it's genius really so all you need to do is water when dry at a pH of 6.8 to 6.5 and then the plants will be looking at you like geez you're a good guy you know that yeah yeah the plants out high [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] I'm just using four four four all purpose from gaia green and mixing up four tablespoons per one gallon a medium and this food is going to last the plants until it's time to transplant into the next pot size up i'm just gonna fill these pots up and head upstairs to check out the four new strains i selected for the next phenol hun if you're not familiar with phenyl hunting it's merely the process of hunting and finding the best seat of a strain it is a timely process but it's what gets you that high quality and consistency inside your garden you see once you find that mother plant that produced the best flowers that have the highest quality look flavor whatever it is that you prefer the most you then keep it as a mother plant and you clone it as needed this is going to allow you to grow the exact same quality time after time on each run [Applause] now for this next phenol hunt we're gonna be doing a wedding cake which is a Girl Scout cookie times Cherry Pie which of course is becoming a household strain from its powerhouse parenting genetics I'm doing a dose II dose which is another Girl Scout cookie crust but this time it's crossed with face-off oh gee another high THC producer strain much like wedding cake and both have the potential of producing over 25% THC or more the last train from Canucks seeds is a gelato which is a cross of Sun FET server and thinman cookies coming natively from the bay and as you would expect it does carry a fruity dessert aroma and this should make for some special flowers as is typical of this strain to produce dark purple hues with fiery orange pistils the last strain is SoCal Master Kush from the BC bud Depot which has the potential of creating a home run fee know with how resonance these flowers can get this strain does produce that signature cush flavor and is beyond potent the other strains are eight to nine weeks suggested flowering times and this so Cal Master Kush is a 9 to 10 week flowering time but let's pop these seeds into cell pods and get these germinated [Music] the water I use when it comes to germination of my seeds is simply tap water it's the chlorinated for 24 hours and no I do not pH the water when I germinate my seeds I will start to pH my water once the seeds have rooted I am going to be placing them under the my Z 600 which has the bed switch on only so it's only running roughly 200 watts and it's set to around 3 feet away from the top of the trays and right now it's just a waiting game [Music] it took three days from planting the seeds for them to pop the soil surface and look at all these soldiers coming out to play wearing their cute little helmets a lot of the times the seeds will shed their shells fairly easy and other times they wear those bastards like is World War two either way be patient because sometimes they just need an extra day for that shell to loosen up before you can just pull it off and sometimes if you're inpatient and pull hard the shell will just decapitate the seedling and you will have to start over ah crap [Music] now the seeds are germinated so it's easy breezy from here on out just got to continue to water them when the pots are drying that is going to be at a pH Jose for an 8 to 6.5 the seedlings they did start to stretch from the light being too far away and also because I had little air movement on them just for the sake of shooting the time lapse so I am going to have to help support the seedlings that have fallen over just by placing something in the medium for them to lean on while they strengthen up their lower stems and who hasn't needed a little help from time to time and someone to lean on

cookies okay uh this is i haven't i haven't pressed a lot of moxie uh in a while so this will be fun this stuff is ringing in at uh 26.9 percent combined thc thca we've got a 121 micron bag here and the crd 30 ton triptech rosin press is set to 180 degrees fahrenheit i don't use timers i don't use the gauge that's on this pump so please don't ask me how long i leave it on just watch the video and you'll see how long i leave it on for okay so this has been rehydrated with hydra stones and we're going to load this bag up hope everybody is staying safe staying medicated and being good to each other out there just a reminder if you are a medical marijuana patient in the pittsburgh area and you have dispensary flour and you would like to have it turned into gold please come and see me in penn hills here at the studio i do that for patients i press form for free that is a patient's helping patients initiative that i've been doing since 2018 never charge a patient to press their medicine for it it is important that patients get good quality medicine at a price that they can afford and i am trying to help in that respect so here is our quarter get this thing all put into a nice little package and move these lights up here and get this placed right where i want it to be there we go that paper of course anytime you're doing live stuff okay all right so let's get that out of the way and get this centered up where i want it to be get the light in there on it real good so you can see it get real close and put it right there all right here we go let's get this valve closed on the pump let's make some medicine there's nothing i enjoy more right now than just getting the best that this flower can offer and as long as you treat this plant with respect she will give herself to give you the best medicine that you can have much better quality than anything you will get in the dispensary as a concentrate solidness is definitely the way to go and rosin whether it be hash rosin or flower rosin is a step way bigger than any of the commercially available chemically extracted concentrates so let's just remember where the quality is and the flavor because this is a full spectrum extract and take terpenes and winterize it do all kinds of crazy stuff they just you just get the buds and the essence of them their soul that's the way i like to approach it so as you can see it's going to get harder and harder to see so i'm going to let this go now and start concentrating on this press i'm going to let that heat soak in for about 30 seconds before i finish get the full pressure i don't know if there's any big drops tomorrow for the weekend but i would be watching the healing center my tree rise all of those guys because you know how that goes friday if you get a big drop and if you're not ready to grab it online you can lose out real easy all right almost at pressure there we go that's where i want to be with it let it sit there for a minute i'm going to pull this shot back out oh yeah this should be fun so again moxie doesn't come out with a lot of flour they've been coming out with more lately and i don't get a chance to press much of it because it's usually at the high end of the price spectrum not a lot of patients bring it to me so i figured i'd grab some and we'll see what see what it does you know and there isn't a whole lot else you can do except uh try it and it goes into my database you find out how it stacks up against the other grower processors and the other strains that they're putting out so i'm just getting the scale ready i already have a jar make sure i get the tear on that first seventeen yep that's great okay are you ready you ready to see it here we go okay viper cookies what'd you give us oh oh yes oh yeah i'll tell you what take a look at that that looks mighty mighty fine to me so let us get that paper off of here turn off the i am done pressing unless unless there's a patient that comes over with something for me let me get the shot out and redirected all right a small blowout no big deal take my tools here clean a little bit of clean rosin off the end of that but like i said blowouts happen no matter whose bag you're using luckily they don't happen all the time so let's get this fired up tara and philip she looks like a happy plant this thing was coming off looking like it was made from washed flour uh and that it didn't just come from straight flour some of this consistency is very reminiscent of a lot of hash rosin i see being shown on ig gas rosin's fantastic it's just not practical for medical patients in pennsylvania because of our prices you know so pennsylvania and the medical marijuana program flower rosin is king of solidness because you can't get the good stuff good ash rosin at the dispensers they don't sell it they don't make it people who do make it aren't making it for the legal market so best you're gonna get medicine wise from somebody who can craft it immediately for you somebody like me who's doing flower rosin just like this gotta love this plant with all your heart to be good at doing this consistently you got to be having access to flour that is of amazing quality to get this kind of result oh this stuff came out so beautiful oh yeah oh moxie my good friend dave perlow gabe pirlo who is the ceo of moxie he and i have had a very nice relationship as far as his business ideas about doing solventless believe me when the feds lift the the lid off this whole thing and deschedule this plant you're gonna start seeing a lot more solventless on the market because it will be on the recreational side probably but you will see it moxie has always been a concentrate centric company it started off they didn't have the canopy enough to to sell flowers so all they sold were their really nice concentrates and their cartridges i love their cartridges liquid moxies melon wreck is awesome ellerange is fantastic a big fan of their distillate cartridges but their flowers always been kind of rare you know now they're stepping up their their production ability and now they're coming out with more flour which is really cool so let's see what we got for a yield and wow 0.61 well when you take away the 17 grams for the jar that is well that is not what i would consider an acceptable yield okay again my bare minimum acceptable yield is half half a gram per eight this comes out to be point three per eighth which i mean here's the thing though the quality is amazing okay and in terms of the look of it it smells incredible you know but there it is maybe i can get it you can see the better light i mean look at the quality of that there's no disputing the fact that moxie makes really good flour the problem is the flour that they make or that they grow doesn't have the wax and lipid profiles to make them a good candidate for solventless extraction via rosin press so always bear in mind that when you're going to buy flour you need to pick strains that work for you and you have to be willing to accept that you may get a strain like this like this viper cookies which looks to be amazing probably going to taste incredible uh but the yield is not sufficient for for me from for me personally it may be for you as a patient you may be a baller and can afford to buy enough eights to get enough of this pressed to make it worth medicating with it i tend to look for the higher producing strains i think this is an excellent strain i bet it's a great strain for the other uses dry vaping quote unquote um but for rosin it's one i would probably take a pass on personally but if you're seeing this and you're liking what you see grab yourself some dispensary flower and get on over here to penn hills and come and see me and i will do this for you too

they've made so much music like it's like they're i think they're going to do their own thing now yeah they're all as a musician you're always going to be creative right but at some point that because something is holding you back yeah i mean you're already been successful at this point you might as well just take a step too so something like that change it up make yourself uncomfortable for a day or two see what you've got not that i don't want to talk about no for sure they're great they've been in like countless movies how many movies they come up in right because they're just great intense action scene [ __ ] movie music a lot of beautiful news a lot of beats and boots pips and pops shoulder popping that yeah for sure yes take it home to casey and show her what it was supposed to taste like yeah definitely uh i'll give you a couple bugs in their stuff too a couple notes of the other ones quite talking quiet i forgot there's some [ __ ] light oh yeah talking loudly they probably yeah just like subtitles maybe we should start editing them after also adding subtitle comments here i've been watching a lot of simpsons on the disney plaza segway from disney places the subtitles because when i'm exercising on a rare occasion i put just subtitles on i have music some of the subtitles are amazing like they'll describe what's happening on the screen like one was like that was like uh circular screaming is what i said on the bottom because they were driving around a roundabout and homer was like yelling at the window and they just said circular screaming as they're driving around i wonder what what a deaf person thinks when they read that [ __ ] who's never heard someone who's never heard it before yeah circular screaming oh that's intense yeah i remember this they can see it too i was super vaped to have this intense discussion with casey about brooklyn nine-nine and how like like how do you watch it oh it wasn't closed captioning it was they post they showed like the spanish credits different countries after yeah and like it was somebody else it's him like obviously doing the spanish [ __ ] and like it's like man how can you watch a show and not have andy sandburg's like voice doing it like honestly to me he's like sixty percent funny at the show you know what i mean like it's just him being he's the reason why i watched yeah but like you have to watch it with some like uh like like latin guy doing the voice or whatever like but like and he's got like jump deep he's totally different characteristics yeah like how is he is he emulated well they definitely do like uh for sure they try to do that emotional stuff but it's probably like listening to a soccer game in spanish or something yeah i've also recently realized from listening to a lot of books that uh audiobooks is the only place you can get away with using an awful accent without being racist because these guys are reading these books they're reading like a book and then they have like accents of like asian people and they're doing like a just a horrific like oh yeah because they're it's like it's a voice right like they have the asian accent i mean i'm not doing racist i mean this is what this the people are sadly sound like i'm like oh man like i was getting away with this thing this is atrocious i guess yeah it's really your own discretion right you're listening at your own job i guess having to be offended you guys reading the book because you're supposed to read it in one voice like that's what they're supposed to you know i mean like yeah that's a character yeah he's an actor i think that well it's fine anyway right like robert downey jr was a black guy obviously that might not fly now but at the same time it was a hilarious white guy he did it was a real black guy yeah there was black guys in the movie it wasn't like getting white [ __ ] lips like a [ __ ] you know what i mean like there's a difference because back in the day like they were just trying to make well they stepped it up and just they made the black face perfect like they tattooed it crazy dedication and it wasn't uh any unless you thought that it's in itself disrespectful then other than that it wasn't right like funniest brother movies when the guy explodes right when they drop off and you know just like blows up especially honestly when i saw that movie i was like i was expecting it to be stupid to shoot but it was one of the best colleges i've ever seen i don't like whatever tom cruise's top cruise but less grossman oh amazing yes dancing at the end of the g5 song or whatever oh [ __ ] yeah yeah i was getting ready dude check it out trophy thunder triple x's make by uh gross without like how you use it yeah you do awful movies oh yeah i was like a subconscious thing too yeah totally like that's a statue yeah yeah i don't even i don't even think i've seen that movie it's that's triple x standard gauge i know of the movie for sure but i've seen pieces of it but [ __ ] vintage old movies i can appreciate an awful like just a fluffy things exploding hot girls taking their clothes half off like guns going off and like you know i mean whatever that's what that's what i'm here to watch i don't know i don't want to close our direction yeah i want to watch someone's in the real world they'll [ __ ] flip on the news that's right yeah like you know i don't every romance is the same [ __ ] movie every book every movie they all follow the same there's only the exact same we don't know what it is i'm not a movie major but there's only like so many different what's you know i mean like it's all well they won't even finance it if it's not in that structure right like it has to be to hollywood's [ __ ] structuring if you wanted to flat [ __ ] crazy [ __ ] right anyways we're really high yeah we are happy friday very friday happy march thanks for coming out yeah theta pretty name pythagorean", "E5HmfY7jcxE": "[Music] hi guys welcome welcome welcome bettan here taking a look at my babies we're going to do a quick little review here on some insane in the membrane I picked this up at best buds I don't know if you guys can see oh goodness best buds t-shirt this is a dispensary I had not been in before it's cute little dispensary had a little bit of everything just like most of the dispensaries do I really like the way that they packaged this and it's childproof but their label actually has a section on it for and it's not going to pick up very good whether or not it's an indica or sativa or a hybrid cut the confusion simple as that cuts the confusion I really like that I wish everybody did that unfortunately yeah unfortunately it doesn't always happen sometimes I'll get on weed maps to find out whether or not it's a sativa and indica and it won't even be listed on the menu anymore because they don't have it in stock anymore well what am I supposed to do then guess I guess okay so let's light this up it's Friday night see how this looks there's a little bit of it I don't know well you guys can't even see it sorry hmm yeah anyways I mean it smells good alright this is a sativa where I'm trying try and see if it'll get me perked up a little bit not bad so tell me what you guys are doing tonight are you smoking on something are you dabbing are you using a distillate are you munching on something good tell me what you guys are doing in the little just comment section down below also if you haven't liked subscribed please do so I would appreciate it I would really appreciate it guys I'm having fun doing these and I'm always into trying something new but I seem to be going back to the same old stuff here lately because I found stuff that really works this plant right here believe it or not I started in a coffee cup in January this plant has been growing since January I found it which means hold on just you guys can see this but there are four stems on this there's one two three and then four and then down in between are several more that are popping up I found it I actually intended to top it yeah it actually turned out better than topping and then this baby back here that Cola oh she's Purdy that's about five inches that one actually was turning in a coffee cup too and then this was a Skywalker clone that I purchased at mom Paul's Kenna shop I made huge mistakes growing these plants and it being a brand new person growing yeah I made some huge mistakes some of the mistakes I made with these plants were not watering often enough because all I had read was don't over water don't over waters well I ended up under watering which caused them to not grow very fast I also did not feed them I'm only growing or I'm excuse me I'm only using the loca Coco Loco from eerie oaky and I didn't use really any fertilizer I just recently started using the general hydroponics three-part system and I can't really tell a difference because it's so late in the game to be giving them nutrients I think but I'm gonna see where it goes I have been feeding them and keeping them wet I don't know what stage I mean stage the flowering is in but I know that they look pretty for somebody who has no idea what they're supposed to look like they look good all right you guys I'm gonna wrap this up because I'm starting to COFF a little bit a little bit goes a long ways for me yeah she's out and I'm not going to relight it but that little bit right there was a lot for me so yeah it tasted good it looked good it smelled good I'm sorry I don't have any other information for you that's something that I feel like I'm not doing a very good job at in the reviews is actually having the information because I watch other people like from other states and they have an idea of what's in there you know it gives them some description of course like in Washington most the products or prepackaged so that stuff is all on the label it's not up to the dispensary to put that information on there this is coming straight from the dispensary I wish Oklahoma had some sort of system like that but you know I can't complain too much it's legal here and that's a major major major win for Oklahoma guys thank you for watching sorry for the ramblings we'll see you in the next video bye", "-x3UYdAmjos": "[Music] what's up everybody thanks for stopping by weeds reviews and checking out another one of my videos today some more products from a platinum vape new strands that come out that i was slacking on getting but i have gotten and i'm here to review for you guys today i'm gonna look at a sativa and an indica the sativa we'll be taking a look at is apple fritter and the endicott we'll be looking at is motor city kush motor city kush indica apple fritter sativa which one should we do first blindfold motor city cushion is one gram indica testing at 76.86 lab test 835. now this is indica so look for a relaxed kind of hungry euphoric thing out of this one at least that's what it says on the packaging again i will say everybody's body's different right elon some of it isn't healed some of us don't that being said screw this bad boy in let's get a taste of it that bubba um uh detroit was it bubba something about detroit bubba that i reviewed last time that was a really good cartridge from an indica strand um i'm hoping this lives up to what detroit bubble was motor city kush let's see boys girls yeah we have girls on this channel now hey how you guys doing for a while there's just us boys all right this cartridge is nice too cool this one has its own taste not really peppery like i was thinking we were going to see a lot of pepper from platinum vape now like it was going to be like their signature taste not the case this one here not peppery whatsoever real sweet decently real sweet diesel earthy taste no pepper whatsoever smooth nice tasting cartridge tell you what platinum knocking out of the out of the park at least with their indicas a couple of their hybrids nah i don't know yet like there was khalifa or that was cleveland khalifa kush with khalifa there was khalifa no they're uh khalifa kush it wasn't that great i was kind of let down with that one it was okay it was still like a three it wasn't like like hitting like a presto or uh you know like being like a a mittens extract it wasn't nothing that terrible but it was nothing great either like what you expect from planet vape like you expect kind of a quality cartridge quality cartridge sorry package quality cartridge every time from platinum vape because that's just what we're used to we're just using quality from planet vape when we're using instructions coming out kind of being shocked at how good they are because it seems like they're put way more and more into this they're coming out with new strands all the time now which that was something i had complained about with platinum how cool quality of the product was and how i would just wish more with strands would readily be coming out and that's something that they seem to be doing which other companies aren't you see mkx they're not keeping up with platinum vape platinum vape is blowing them out of the water right now because these new strands keep coming out all the time and they keep doing a good job with the ones that come out but every now and then out of the couple that they let out there's a few disappointments and that was one of mine so far motor city cush though definitely a five-star cartridge i'm not gonna give it up our sorry definitely four-star cartridge i'm not gonna give it a five yet because there's just so many of these other products that i still have to test i don't wanna make that make it so high that i have to keep giving out fives whenever you know there might be some fours and then one will be incredible to where it'll be at five but so far just a four nothing blowing your socks off but a really great cartridge again this was motor city cush indica one grand by platinum vape also i want to touch base on something you guys platinum vape's got a thing going on right now for the golden ticket when you buy a cartridge you get a golden ticket you win their little um sweepstakes that they got going on right now so they got a golden ticket sweepstakes going on right now we've opened three so far we haven't gotten it um i'm sure it's not gonna be too easy to get but it is a thing going on so when you open your cartridge look for your golden ticket willy wonka you want your golden ticket because that would be your golden chance to make your way because with the golden ticket it's a golden day you know come on people it's how it's gonna be so apple fritter sativa you guys all know you're on the channel you watch me if you can watch the channel i'm not a big sativa guy i test the sativas i do occasionally like to have steep around i have two up there so you know i open this one they're probably all going to fall nope i opened this about a month ago you can see i just really don't hit them that much i really don't his teeth that much um just because it's really not my thing and i'm more of an indica guy or a hybrid guy i'm really more of indica person myself if i'm going to buy a cartridge not just to review just a smoke i'm going to pick it in to come most of the time but this apple fritter was last tested 12 22 of 21 comes in at 70 76.6 we'll get off and take a look into it i had never known this around i actually went to a dispenser i never go to i've never really been to i think i've been to it maybe once in two years i went to it last weekend just stopping by coming back from my sister's place because it was actually close to there and it was a sunday and all the other ones were closing so i figured i'd stop by this one because it was on my way home it was close i could get there in the time allowed it and they happened to have this so i just grabbed it i seen it i was like um i've never seen it anywhere i'm gonna grab it so if you guys have seen this you already had it let me know in the comments what you think if you think the same thing if you haven't had it well we'll see what it's like together right away and outside of the cartridge is really sticky feels like maybe bad pour and maybe they clean it up as good as they should have but yeah the whole outside of this one's really sticky so this is the apple fritter sativa by platinum vape like like i said again 76.66 coming in lab tested 12 22. now this says it's supposed to have a real that's why you never go by what it says in the backbone i'm telling you you can't ever go by what it says this one says here it says earthy apple and sweet okay now i'm gonna tell you what it tastes like there's no earthy there's no apple there's no sweet it's a real chemically gassy off-tasting smell our taste and smell that comes off it not pleasant not whatsoever oh this cartridge is bad guys i mean i'm not putting on either i would give it a two and that might be pushing it i don't think i can even smoke this car the rest of this cartridge the reason being it's real chemically tasty it tastes like i'm smoking uh one of those trees for your car the air freshener trees that's what it tastes like i'm inhaling really bad cartridge i don't enjoy this at all elon even if he handled he wouldn't enjoy it yeah if you guys bought this dude if you agree with me let me know in the comments if you haven't bought it you probably want to think of it twice before doing so there's no apple to it there's no fritter to it there's nothing sweet there's nothing that tastes good about this cartridge and now like i said i'm not just putting on i'm not making it up if it was good i would say it was good i'm not just saying it because it's a tiva and i don't really like sativas because i there's a lot of stevia i did enjoy um this one here is just not there especially after tasting like trying like the new um detroit um kush and all those other ones and this it's just this just does fails in comparisons big time big time big time that's the apple fritter by planet vape i don't know if i would erect i can't recommend this car whatsoever i wouldn't say waste your money on this maybe if you're picking up four or four hundred you just want to try it or you haven't tried it you said [ __ ] it i don't care what this guy thinks i want to try anything for myself go ahead and do it but let me know in the comments what you think if you agree with me if i'm crazy but this cartridge here real chemically real are it just doesn't taste good at all it doesn't yeah i mean i can get a sense of what they're trying to do with the apple the other tastes there like this it just doesn't balance out well and it ends up tasting chemically yeah it doesn't balance out you can pick up the apple in there and what they're trying to do but it's just too artificial and it becomes chemically balanced tasting it doesn't it's bad it's not a great cartridge guys so that being said if you
