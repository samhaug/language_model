look I'm gonna need to borrow your beach towels yeah that's just not possible listen I was up all night long with my towels I've been creaming them they're plumper than ever they're plump enough for the whole family to sit on all of us total phony showing up to the beach with a goddamn World War Two parachute sent me into a frenzy so I decided to drive to Maine by the time I get there Bloomingdale's should be open but as I'm going through the kitchen I have a feeling that my fridge is in a state of disarray I think here my fridge is screaming in my head sure enough Terry forgot to fold the cold cuts before putting them away you don't have to fold meat in this house you do just because you've been living like a hippie freak out unless out islands with your own veggie doesn't mean that you can come back here and not live by this mamas rules nobody folds cold cuts before I put them in the fridge it's a smoked turkey it's a thin meat I don't want meat sitting in my fridge unless it's been retail folded like an Ann Taylor knit top now you know there are consequences for this oh I'm not the meat flag well that's not humiliating that's just a weird thing to do gonna be swinging that sheet of smoked turkey at full mast until you get this school you're here I'm humiliating hey everybody check out Terry she's got a meet flag on her car was right as I was trailing Terry

like a tuba from up there Oh Papa I can't stand it I want it out but I gotta stay focused on those beach towels do i floor it to Maine pick up the beach towels and then floor back home I decide to

expense of 30 in a second for those people who haven't seen it and they said here full-size beach towel that is composed in to fit your pocket so let's see what it's all about first one I'm gonna open up a pop towel just to remind you how it works okay this is what they look like they look like candy but do not eat them because they're not edible so you open this one up and look at this so what you do is just put a little bit of water in it and let me show you what happens boom it just expands and look it sucks in all the water that way you got yourself this little moist napkin towel or whatever you want to call it check this out it's huge you can even use it like a toilet paper it's perfect for camping wipe off your hands wipe off the table it's pretty amazing I like this one a lot and of course if you want to dye it out you can just squeeze it and they will get dried out but by the way look at that they do not come apart unless you put a little bit of water before that I put a little bit too much water so I'm wasted way too much so if you put less water they're gonna be a lot more dire look at that they expend a little bit more in the middle nice they go as you can see without water they don't expend that much so if you put less what are they a lot more drier look how well they can clean the table love that I might just keep them here to clean this table up whenever I have to sir just perfect mini travel size or kingpin size paper towels I love them a lot I also wanted to see what these bigger ones are all about and see how well do they work pop them open they go pretty much similar thing but as you can see a lot bigger Wow again they don't have come apart unless you add water into them see what happens whoa they go so much love it maybe a little bit more water so such is fine when they go like that whoa check this out how much water it can absorb nice now I can take it out take it apart well this one is a lot bigger that's for sure here's your quick size difference this little one and this one a lot bigger so if you want to have much bigger napkins I'll go with this one for sure if you happy with this ones there have been more compartment than this ones so it's just your own preference what you want also what I love about them when you grab a napkin you can easily squeeze it and they're very very easily dies out check this out boom and now you have once again pretty dry napkin as you can see it's silver stone so it could be even usable for a few times and as you can see it's dry its picks up all this water okay let's find out what this pocket-sized beach towel is all about actually very convenient looks like anyways wow it is over compares that's for sure only five ounces so it's a lightweight as you can see it fits my palm very well so I can definitely fit my pocket let's see what it looks like when you put it in your pocket boom not bad it's like a little hockey puck not too bad at all as you can see not huge so well film around it I guess so it's BLB waterful very nice Wow it still stays together really well doesn't never come apart that easily so we will need a little bit of water okay let's pour a bunch of water into it and see what happens okay there goes nothing definitely absorbs a lot of water you can stick it in a bowl of water whatever you like whoa it is expanding a lot is it done yet it almost took half a bottle of water easily I still dry up this side I'm gonna do a little bit more on this side wow so amazing look how much bigger that is already at least good twice in size I'll put a little bit more water just in case so it's easy to take it apart and now let's see what happens there you go feels like it's the same material as this stuff but maybe a little thicker yeah but let's unknow it and see what happens still very dry in the middle wanna see Wow amazing it even feels like it's died I thought it'd be a little wet well now I actually have to zoom out cuz it's actually so big okay let's see if it's actually size towel whoa this is huge I can deliver how big it's getting that's insane check this out Wow and honestly most of it it feels to I and again it's the same material as the other stuff like this stuff so when we put a lot of water on it or why oh it will be easy to dry out I love this logo right here it's beautiful so I'm gonna pour another bottle of water I already have pour half a bottle of water so let's see what happens if it's going to absorb a lot of water you know when you try to dye yourself off also you can obviously lay on it on the sand it's just like a towel they go the whole bottle of water let's put it together pretty much got almost all of this water I don't think you would have that much water on your body but just in case just to see how much water doesn't really absorb okay this is most of the water there's a little wet smudges but for the most part I think it did good it just be stable for some reason water sticks to it okay now as you can see we picked up a whole bunch of water now let's go outside and let's start to squeeze all the water out and see how much water will come out and we'll see if it's good to get to I again okay guys let's squeeze this towel Wow look how much what a day sir it's absorbs a lot of water that's amazing so I wipe myself off let's say got off from the swimming pool or the ocean break whatever you go to then you dry yourself off wipe yourself off and then you can squeeze all the water out and use it once again that's amazing and let me show you as you can see it is a beach towel size easily as you can see it covers my whole top of my body amazing definitely it thumbs up for me I love this towel pocket size beach towel that's huge look at this one more time this way I'm six seven it at least like three feet one and at least couple feet wide this is huge and can you believe it it was so composed it was fit in my pocket let's see what happens once I fold it up as you can see it's definitely usable many many times fold it back up it's definitely a lot bigger than it's used to be so this is the size defense before it was composed and after that you added water into it so you still can use it many many times I'm pretty sure it's moved purpose I love that anyways guys let me know in comments below what do you think about this pocket size towel it's definitely amazing especially if you go in camping or traveling somewhere just all one of those pocket size towels in the car it doesn't take too much space but in case you never know you're gonna jump in somewhere you forgot towel you always have a little towel well guys that's pretty much it let me know in comments below what do you think thumbs up this video I'll see you next time", "64xWokRjPKE": "welcome to the how to beats channel today we got a product review for you my friends over at echo sophie or maybe it's eco sophie i didn't ask so i'm not sure exactly if it's echo or eco sophie but she sent me some really cool stuff this is a microfiber towel and this is a sand free blanket if you guys haven't used these at the beach before this is going to blow your mind these are we take these to the beach with us every time we go the sand doesn't stick to these towels they dry super quick look look how thin these towels are these are super thin they take up almost zero space in our backpack when we come to the beach and two cool things about the bag here that comes with it she's got cool branding on everything there's branding on this and it says it's made as a cinch sa cinch scent sack so you can actually pull this and cinch it down so it takes up less room in your bag so i'm going to set these up and show you what they look like so if you're interested in buying the stampery blanket and microfiber towel i've got links in the description below and if you haven't subscribed to the channel yet please hit that subscribe button and if you like this video be sure you like hit the like button as well do [Applause] bye [Music] so here is the blanket all set up it's like twice as big as my old one and this has a couple features that my other sand free blanket doesn't have the bag is attached to the blanket so you don't ever lose the bag my other one also has these pockets in the corner if you don't have the stakes or you lose the stakes you can put sand in the corners um or you can to hold that all the edges down but you can also use it as a little pocket to put your cell phone in but i find that they tend to get sand in them so i don't think they work great for that and it also has another little pocket over here and this one actually has a zipper on it so you could put your cell phone in here or your keys or whatever and you could fold it under here and no one would know that it was there little security device if you want to hide some money or credit card in there in case you wanted to go to the bar like that little bar over there you could leave your stuff here so this thing is pretty sweet it's big you can fit probably four people on there easily this lady is very oversized just kidding she's a normal sized lady so there is my model exhibiting the joy that the echo soapy sand free blanket can bring to your beach trip we are here in beautiful st thomas in the us virgin islands and there is a look at that now we'll show you the also the microfiber towel [Music] that she sent along as well now that my model got sand on the blanket it obviously just swishes off super easy especially when you're getting ready to go you don't take it all with you in the car here is a look at the microfiber towel it's reversible have a different pattern on both sides and she even said this because she knew that this color would look good with this blanket so you can get this exact color combination when you order from echo sophie my beautiful model how does that towel feel it's softer than the other ones i think that we have also nice and the sand doesn't stick to the towel like i said before it dries super fast so it is cute too yeah our other ones are just black and our other samford blanket was just blue so this whole little color combo is really cute together so this is our new sand free blanket and microfiber towel collection that we'll be taking to the beach i'll put links in the description below if you're interested in ordering one of these sam-free blankets

so thanks for coming by the channel and we'll see in the next video", "EoHzDrlLMbo": "hi guys welcome back to my channel so today we are doing an unboxing and a review at the beach with test light towels so Tesla towels are an Australian towel company they are based out of Bondi Beach and their whole thing is that they are essentially on a mission to create the world's best towels and this review is kindly sponsored by them so they sent me two of their towels so this is their double size and then this is their single so their double two people can lay on and they're perfect for like a picnic and stuff like that because they're a little bit bigger so like the mail wrapper came over this and then this is what I opened it to okay so it comes with this little note and it says make something we're proud of we started tessellate with this simple idea that's why we solely focus on making the world's best beach towel even though we've come a long way from our origins and Bondi Beach markets we keep this idea in mind every single day everyone at Tess light sees themselves as a craftsperson and we believe details matter if there's anything wrong with your test light towel get in touch and we'll either replace it or give you a full refund okay and then it also comes with this little guy and it's just a little information card so it says sand free so we will be testing that at the beach absorbent as well it says rapid dry and compact and then on the back it actually says that there is a lifetime guarantee okay easy care fabric so you can machine wash these in cold and hang to dry and they are designed in Australia so this is a good little car to keep so this is what the towel comes in in this little bag it is very compact as they said and I'm going to move you guys over to my glam table and we will do an unboxing please don't mind my band-aid I got my finger caught in a door so yes so I got this style it's called mojito time and I just love it it's green and blue and it has all of the fun tropical leaves on it and it's reversible so on this side it has this black and white pattern I love it and it's really thick and it's a very interesting material it's not what I would expect from a towel but I guess that's how it kind of stays sand free and easy to dry so this is the single one like I said I will show you guys at the beach exactly how big it is and then this is the double one so I'm going to unbox this one for you guys well so this is the towel for two that I got it's The Alchemist style and it's really pretty and again it has this black and white pattern on the inside this feels a lot heavier so yeah it's definitely double the size so we're gonna head off to the beach and I cannot wait to show you guys how this works right up to the beach yeah it's a beautiful day the sun is shining we have our towels I cannot wait to try these out [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] you alright guys we are heading home from the beach it is such a nice day but it is very windy so while we were at the beach there was sands like flowing all over the towel and as you guys could tell we piled a bunch of sand on top of it to do the sand test just to see if any of it would stick and as you could also see none of it did so it really is like a sand stick free towel and as Sean said it comes in a Lardon size and Sean sighs John sighs being yeah so all the links will be down below for you guys so you can order your own towel if you want I think it's definitely worth it if you guys go to the beach often like we do here in Australia especially in the summer and I think it's worth it too if you guys like to do a little beach day and then you know kind of go in for like a lunch or a late afternoon drink because you can literally dry off and you're not gonna have sand stuck to you you can literally go straight from the beach to wherever you're going and you have to worry about like rinsing off or anything like that so thank you guys so much for watching I hope that you guys liked this quick little review and unboxing please like comment and subscribe and we will talk to next week [Music]",

should run terrycloth towels they're bulky sand sticks to them it's designed to dry you so has all the loops on it so when you take it to the beach to the park you lay it anywhere it's like a magnet it just sucks up all the dirt and all the sand it sticks to there you gotta get a better towel to make them this fluffy it requires so much cotton and that makes them bad for the environment I think it's too bulky you're not gonna you're not gonna waste the precious space so you're gonna want something small it's like half the size if you're gonna go travel which one you're gonna take with you this one that has pool unique patterns that's woven flat sand rolls right off of it dries really fast doesn't get mildewy has cool trendy colors versus this right here you get it wet at a stays wet and if you get it sandy its day sandy its small its portable it fits in your bag and stand as a stick to it so it's perfect to take to Cancun Hawaii to the Caribbeans so did your old terry cloth towels and switch to something coasters you [Music]", "05fl-CNMQCk": "[Music] so today I have a super easy way to customize your beach towels turn those boring towels into something less boring and it's very very easy this is not gonna be much of a tutorial because it's pretty to the point but I can still give you some tips and show you what I did with mine and hopefully it will be somewhat entertaining for you let's get started I look like an idiot I just felt the need to wear them anyway you literally only need two supplies for this project some solid-colored beach towels I got these for like $3 each at Walmart so yeah top quality and a bleach pen or more like a buttload of bleach pens cuz these do not go that far I had to turn around and go back to Walmart to get more because I ran out you literally just take the bleach pen and start drawing on your towel it is kind of nerve-wracking because you can't really sketch out what you're doing whatever you put down is permanent that is not coming out so who any mistakes will be very apparent but I think that's kind of part of its charm you know it's it's handmade and I don't know that's at least what I tell myself when you first lay it down it's like a clear gel after a few minutes it does kind of soak into the fabric and then bleach it into white lines for this one I did like a beach scene type of thing because you know the beach and Beach yeah I will show the final product at the end of the video but for now I'm just gonna show you the progress for all three of the towels so I did this pink one also which was like a tribal print obviously I am using this yardstick to kind of get straight lines I mean freehand straight lines are like completely out of the question for me I could never do that so I use this to help me out but somehow I still mess them up and they are not completely straight at all but that's okay I am okay with that it still ended up looking pretty cool Wow look I'm discovering my shadow ignore that once you've completed your design just walk away from the city and let it do its thing it takes like 30 minutes for all the bleach to sink in and completely take effect oh look I have to pop in and do some touch-ups I look like a frog and then once they are dry I came back and threw it in the washing machine and washed it you don't have to do anything really special and here I am doing the final towel which is like the green one and I just did like random doodles and flowers and hearts and girly stuff like that for this one originally I was actually gonna do this with liquid bleach and stencils but because I was so cheap and got these kind of thin towels the liquid bleach just bled way too much and it just it just ended up being a big blob of bleach it sucked so I had to switch over to these bleach pens and I'm actually really happy about it because these are way better way more fun to use you can get a lot more detail and more customization going on and voila here are the final beach towels after they've all been washed and dried and they look pretty cool I am pretty happy with these honestly I can't even choose a favourite because I really like all of them and now enjoy these clips of me really awkwardly trying to like model them what am i doing oh wow total pro at this obviously oh geez wow wow wow anyway if you end up using this tutorial to customize your beach house please email me a photo of your beautiful artwork because I'd love to show it to the world or at least the part of the world that watches my videos and speaking of I would love to show you this fidget spinner by Erin she used my fidget spinner tutorial for this custom fidget spinner that she made for her brother isn't that nice of her it is a nautical theme obviously and I think it turned out amazing so thank you so much Erin for sending that and that about covers everything for today so thank you all for watching this video and I will see you next time bye [Music]",

does it dry you off let me show you sand cloud towels are made from turkish cotton which become more absorbent the more you wash them here's a glass of water now simply apply pressure and watch what happens sandcloud absorbs most of the water and can continue to dry you off and dry itself off in minutes now you deserve a better beach towel the sand cloud and 10 of profits go to marine conservation", "C15t16FpPXc": "[Music] we're still out here on the little deck but we've completely transformed it into a beach party come in here with a Harley well done well done and she's a DIY that's gonna make us want to spend all day at the beach with our toes in the sand because sometimes being on the beach and trying to get that pillow trying to get that neck just right and it doesn't work very well Cameron every time I smoosh it up I take all the time I create a pillow and then I lay down there all is lost but for the first a couple seconds yeah great and then all the sand settles and then you're like this you feel cool and then not so much until now until now we're making a smushy pillow so take a look at this and can we discuss my skirt and my pillow you see we see that I I use the leftover fabric to make a skirt or they do mess around I don't it's really fun because you can use pops of color to kind of play off of the towel that you have to make it even more of a fun statement but this is a really great way to use old fabric scraps of fabric because you only need like a half a yard if see yeah fantastic okay I know you got started on the pillow a little bit earlier I know everybody had to do it let's take that's right so here's my towel the first thing you want to do is measure how wide you want your pillow when I looked at it about 24 inches felt right to me and then again you look at the length there it was about 14 inches this is really just eyeballing it it's up to your discretion on how big you want the pillow first measurement there I did on my fabric was my 14 inch length and because my fabric is folded in half the second measurement was 12 inches because when I open it up that will then give me my 24 inch opening I'm just pressing it out because it had a couple of wrinkles and this next part is really important just to make sure that everything looks really clean finished so take your iron and fold back your edges of your fabric basically just creating like an ironed clean finish hem now when I lay everything down I double check to make sure that it's even on all tops and sides so that my pillow will be straight centered and perfectly level and then pin it into place the bottom you want to leave an opening just big enough that your hands can get in there because we're gonna stuff it just like a regular pillow you want to sew as much clothes as possible while still leaving enough open that you can actually get your hand in there so now I'm just stitching everything down with whatever seam allowance you want to do you can do a fun zig-zag stitch or a decorative stitch as long as it's on there nice and flat with an opening now I'm using my polyfill to just stuff the pillow as much as you can pull it tight in order to lay it flat and pin it in place and now I'm just stitching it closed you can stitch it closed with a needle and thread too if you want like if when you get in there and you start sewing it it's a little bit difficult you could totally do that with your needle and dart that base is so good this is such a perfect DIY for me I'm in love with I know it's really cold I know you're not done yet no and you could be done the cool part is you could just have a pool or a beach towel with a cozy pillow and a pop of color and call it a day but I did not want to call it a day sir because your or leash is I wanted to add some strong to take a look at this the next thing you do is take that fabric a matching fabric whenever you're creating straps you need to make it twice as big as you actually want it cuz you're gonna sew it in half again I'm cutting it when it's on the fold so my fabric opens up longer there this is what you do you just fold it in half lengthwise and a simple straight stitch all the way down now put a safety pin on the end feed that safety pin inside of your strap and kind of like scrunchie it on to the safety pin and it flips the entire thing inside out this is about as technical as you need to be see the whole thing just flips inside-out it's really fun and now press it so that it looks like a nice clean strap and it's not all bulky now here you can see I'm just folding back my edge again so I have a nice clean finished seam and I'm pinning it on the backside of the bottom of my towel pin it in place simple straight stitch back and forth one on the bottom one on the top and you've got your straps on the bottom attached now when you actually cut your straps you're going to make a second one okay because you need that in order to make this into an actual bag got it so you can see that it's attached you can see everything is on it's nice and clean finished and this is the fun part Cameron Mathison alright so we're gonna take it like that yeah and fold and this is where having a reversible towel comes into play nicely right but yes if you can get a reversible towel I recommend it because you're gonna need to fold it up inside out so that your last strap is on the bottom you don't want that strap to be here you want it on the back side of the towel sure if you can fold it up that way then even better so here I'm actually gonna do it just a little bit looser than that I'll go on standby like this there we go okay so you want to lay it so that it's like this it comes even on top now once you know exactly where you need to be on the back side of your towel take that next strap gun take it and fold it so it's clean find your line here good you would pin this into place on both sides and then unravel it and sew it into place and now you know that they're perfectly lined up but right now even if you pick this up it's held in - oh my goodness stop it so good so good now what about the little secret storage pocket I see over there well maybe not so secret not so secret so the last thing that you can do is again on the back side of your towel take a piece of that fabric that you have and cut a piece again as big of a pocket as you would want maybe like a 10 by 8 pocket cut it do the same exact thing press your edges and now when you come here you can see what I did is I just sewed down the side across the bottom and up on the top and then I did one stitch down the side I mean down the center to create an individual pocket so it would be hidden on the backside when you get to the beach you take your things out you unravel it and then Cameron yeah you have this bad boy which is just comfort is so good it's so good I mean I I don't even know what to tell you it's made for me other than a sewing detail which I got to figure out I'm learning in that department buddy Hallmark Channel full instructions let me tell you right now this guy is comfortable you can also go to DIY designer calm as well", "qpUCdikVujU": "[Music] hey guys dana from madeeverday.com have you ever thought of making your own towel before or rather semi homemade towel well today we are going to make one i love summertime i love fun fabrics and last summer it dawned on me why not make my own towel with all those cute fabrics it's kind of like an outdoor blanket for swimming and besides who doesn't love a good excuse to use some pom-pom trim so here's what you need one and a half yards of terry cloth fabric or a bath towel one and a half yards of fabric and two yards of pom-pom trim this project is basically like making a really simple blanket or like a burp cloth where you take two fabrics sandwich them together sew around the edges and flip it right side out and you can use a bath towel for your project which i've done before but you can also find terry cloth which is the fabric that towels are made from in most fabric shops and what i love about this particular one is that it's very lightweight and won't be too bulky when i combine it together with our fabric you can make your towel any dimension that you want today i'm going to cut mine 30 by 54 inches and i've already cut my terry cloth to those dimensions so i'm going to set that aside for just a moment i'm going to pull out my fabric here and oh i love this print it is so cheerful happy summery it's adorable okay so spread that out so everything is nice and smooth and then i'm gonna place our terry cloth right on top and the thing about terry cloth is that you will get little pieces of the fabric all over you all over your room but it's so worth it and resist the urge to clean it up until you're all done okay just kind of smooth it all out so you don't have any big bubbles there okay and then if you are a quilter you're familiar with this step i'm going to take some safety pins and i just want to attach the two layers together so that it stays together while i'm sewing there's no specifics on this just i don't know 10 safety pins just attach enough that it's staying together and i'm not going to put any right at the edges because that's where we're going to attach our pom pom trim and you could make your trim go all the way around the entire towel that would be adorable too i'm just gonna do mine at the very ends but you know do what you're feeling and there's so many cute trims out there you can find the pom pom trim in so many colors you could get cute tassel trim or fringe [Music] okay now i'm going to cut out my fabric and as you can tell i have the two with right sides together if you're having a hard time cutting straight lines on a large cut of fabric like this it really helps sometimes to place it on your floor if you have tile or if you have wood floors sometimes those grout lines can help you find long straight lines to guide you in your cutting and you can also watch my video where i show tips for cutting straight and curved lines that might help you too okay we have both of our pieces sandwiched together now let's grab our pom pom trim there are many different sizes and quality of pom-pom trim that you can find at the store and online this is the kind that i used for these towels here that i showed you and it's really cute and small but i did find that because these aren't quite as secure on these threads here that over time when i washed this towel a few of the pom-poms came off so i prefer one that has a little bit thicker of an attachment here and you can find this in so many colors i love this orange there's yellow there's pink there's coral turquoise i mean i almost can't stop myself from buying every color so that's adorable and today we're going to use this even bigger pom-pom which i think is gonna look awesome so set these aside and let's attach our trim now we're going to peel back this fabric that we sandwich together and the reason i like to keep the layers together before attaching the pom-pom trim is that it helps ensure that your two pieces are cut the exact same size because once you have a three-dimensional trim in the end it might be hard to cut them precisely okay so we're going to attach it first to the fabric piece and i know you might be thinking place it in there sandwich it go for it which is totally what i'm always thinking but it really helps to do this preparatory step to do a basting stitch to one side first and then sew them both together so place it on here and let it overhang just a little bit and i'm just matching it up with the edge of my fabric here [Music] like that and then i'm going to pin it in place i mean it already looks cute seeing it next to this happy daisy fabric okay just pin that down we're gonna pin it on the other end too and then we're gonna go to our sewing machine okay and then just cut off a little bit of the tail here okay let's go to our sewing machine i'm just going to sew right down the middle of this trim here again this is just a basting stitch which is something to hold it in place until a later step so if your trim was a little bit thinner you just sew to the edge something to hold it in place do a back stitch at the beginning okay i've sewn both of my trims on the two ends now we're gonna sandwich the two layers together spread your towel back out and now we're going to sandwich the trim and pin it in place in between those two layers so make sure that they're all tucked in you want your trim sewn into the towels that when you're done they fold out and they are sewn inside that seam okay now like i was saying because this is three-dimensional you sort of have to pull the towel piece over a little bit and we cut our dimensions perfectly the same for both layers so you can trust yourself to just match it up like that and pin it in place all the way down for both ends [Music] as you're pulling these two layers together be careful with the terry cloth not to stretch it it's not a stretchy fabric but it does have some give to it so just try to work carefully so that everything matches up and lines up with your cotton fabric underneath okay pin the other side also i'm done pinning both of the ends here let's go back to our sewing machine now before we sew these two layers together i am going to change the presser foot on my machine to my zipper foot and if you don't have one that is fine just use your standard foot and we'll make it work because what we want to do i open this up for you i'll take this pin out is that we want to sew past this large wide attachment piece so that when we're done all we see are the little pom-poms sticking out and you don't have to do it that way you might prefer to have this trim piece showing i've seen that on projects before too and that looks great you could just sew it right to the outside and have this cute band of white fabric there so the thing that's great about my zipper foot is that i can get it really close to the edge here without it bumping into these palm palms so that i can sew past this trim if you're using your standard foot just get your needle all the way over to the left and get as close as you can to the edge on my baby lock this pops off in the back and then i take this foot and pop it right on and you can see how this edge is a lot smaller i can even shift my needle over if i want to to get really close to the edge there now as you can see i can't really see where the edge of that trim is right there but i can feel it with my finger so as i sew i'm going to try to sew past where the edge of that trim is just keep using your left hand to make sure all the pom poms are not in the way okay i made it to the end cut my threads there and then i want to do a little quality inspection here just to make sure i sewed past that little trim edge and if there's any places where i didn't i can just go back and fix those oh there's one right there well actually oh yeah just a tiny bit that's not too bad i might just leave that but oh there's a spot so i'm going to go back and i'm going to sew that real quick okay let's see how it looks everything's looking good everything's looking cute okay i think we're ready to sew the other side okay i'm at the end i'm gonna cut my threads i love this cutting feature on my baby lock okay now we're gonna go and pin together the long sides of our towel now let's trim off some of the bulk off of the end of these seams that we just sewed that will make it a little less bulky inside when we turn it right side out and if there's any extra trim hanging out of the corners i'm going to cut this pom-pom off because it might get stuck in the other side and trim that off and let's cut these two off also okay trim down the other side i'm so glad that we have these safety pins holding everything together it just makes it so much easier okay let's trim off these all right now let's give that guy a trim too okay now we're gonna work on the long sides we're going to pin those together and one thing that we're going to add into one of the sides is a little piece of trim like this you can use bias tape you can use cotton twill tape you could use ribbon because then you have something that you can hang your towel on a hook which i think is a little fun addition so i have a piece of cotton tool tape right here cut it about five or six inches long and let's open this up i'm just going to find the middle point i am eyeballing it you could fold it in half and see and we're going to stick that right in between the two layers make sure it's not twisted and that looks a little bit long i'm going to trim that a little you can even have it hanging out a little bit just to ensure that it's sewn in there really nicely lay those back together and then pin that in place okay and then just pin down both sides okay now one last thing we need to do is leave an opening here so we can turn the whole thing right side out when we're done so i'm going to leave it in the middle of the side not the side that has the little hang piece so about 10 inches wide and i'm going to use double pins here that's kind of my method to remind myself to not sew so then we're going to sew down this side pause down the other side and then this whole way here let's go to our machine i'm going to switch back to my standard presser foot instead of my zipper foot for this step because in general your standard foot has a larger surface area and works better for pressing down on your fabric okay come to your machine and make sure that this last pom pom is not in the way of your seam allowance and i'm using about a 3 8 inch half inch seam allowance there's no right or wrong here as i get to these double pins i'm going to stop and do a back stitch cut my threads [Music] and then move down to the next double pin so that i'm leaving this opening gap here okay now let's do the other side okay let's turn this whole thing right side out and finish it off okay i'm just removing the safety pins here so that we can turn this whole thing right side out and see how it looks find our opening there it is and you know this terry cloth has been pretty good it hasn't been as messy as other ones i've worked with oh my goodness you guys this is so fun i love a cherry print okay pull those corners out or get your hand inside and push it out i might need to do that right there there we go nice and let's see how our little hang hang tag hang our little hanging piece looks that looks awesome that'll work great you know i think this would be an adorable look for a bathroom also there's lots of cute towels out there don't get me wrong but if you want something really unique and special and exact to what you want this is a fun idea okay one more corner there we go okay now we want to close up this gap here so we're going to pin that closed first fold these edges in and they should just naturally want to go in because they're part of the seam here and pin it closed and then you could just sew the opening closed and be done but i kind of like to do a top stitch around the entire thing pull all these layers out make sure that it's nice and smooth there we go as i sew this closed i like to sew all the way around sewing that in place and it just kind of polishes it off and then after that i'm going to go ahead and pin this now i like to sew two lines that kind of cut this into thirds that again holds it together sort of like quilting if you've made a quilt before and you do the quilting stitching at the end you don't want to sew too many lines or it starts to be kind of stiff so i am just going to eyeball it maybe i'll grab a ruler here if you have a print that has a really directional design it's easier to see where a line a natural line would be but i'm just going to sort of you could draw a line with a fabric marker or something i like to do sometimes is just place pins along like this and then i know as i'm sewing to just keep sewing from pin to pin like that that's just my method you can use the method that makes sense in your brain okay so there's one there and again if you've watched my burp cloth video this is the exact same way that i do those let's see that's about a third i'm trying to smooth this all out so there's no bubbly spots let's place that right there i made one of these last summer for my daughter and i have to say it's kind of the go-to towel that she always wants to use and i think this would be so fun to make as birthday gifts for her friends i'm always wondering what new thing we could make for the friends so this might be it okay we're gonna go back to our machine first we're gonna sew all the way around the edges and then we're gonna sew these two straight lines and then we're done i'm gonna sew with about a quarter inch seam allowance right around the whole thing [Music] when you get to the corner here go slowly because it might be a little thick there leave your needle down turn and pivot like that [Music] foreign [Music] wow okay i made it back to the beginning here cut your threads and now we're gonna sew those two side or center we're gonna sew those two lines that cut it in thirds okay i'm just following along these pins here like i said i'm eyeballing it down to the next part [Music] here's my next pin i know that i'm going to sew right in between that great okay we are all done let's see how it looks okay just cut off any little loose threads here do one more inspection make sure everything looks great oh my goodness you guys i love this towel the pom pom trim is the perfect proportion to the fabric the weight is really nice the size of the whole towel is great i am definitely gonna be making more of these for summer i hope you make some too for more ideas and tutorials you can check out my website madeeveryday.com and for all of your sewing machine needs go to babylock.com where it's all for the love of sewing i'll see you next time bye [Music] you", "mAIX2r0YJOg": "(gentle music) - Going into spring and summer, there's nothing better

to fold the towel long into long end so that it's like this right down on the table I usually put the double lines at the top then you fold the bottom half up that Midway and the top half down overlapping a little bit like an inch and a half flip the whole thing over pull down the top about I don't know eight ten inches roll up the bottom and when you get toward the top lift up that corner and roll right into it and then take this little tab and tuck it under and now you have a pillow that you can lay on the sand you know take two towels one to lay on and one for a pillow and also it's

profits the dragons are after sarah and david glashan husband and wife from essex think they can deliver the returns the dragons expect if they get an investment of quarter of a million pounds [Music] my name is david glashan this is my wife and partner sarah we are here today to ask you for 250 000 pounds the product we're going to show you today is called an itza it's a multi-functional sun lounger towel that converts into a beach bag it unfurls a full 86 inches in length most towels stop here the sun lounges are still hot and you end up burning the backs of your legs we have six pockets the first one for a book magazine whatever you wish the middle one is a bigger pocket for the bigger reading book for the beach and the first pocket is for your mp3 player you'll notice that from the mp3 player pocket we have loops to the headphones when you're laying on your itsa you can now not have to worry about the wires going across your chest on the other side we have a further three pockets we have a hidden zipped pocket so we can place our camera on our mobile phone and our car high keys which has a registration number on push it over outside out of mind and go and have a little swim last but not least when you finish with it at the end of the day fold up the end fold up the pockets all with your possessions still in it get the end product with all your bits in roll it in over your shoulder and off you go we need to educate the market to this product and we believe the way we can do that is by targeting cruise line cruise line companies on a corporate basis i'd now like to invite you to ask any questions you may like to ask david and sarah glashan have got off to a confident start with a polished demonstration of their multi-functional sun lounge recover stroke beach bag but will any of the dragons be tempted to invest the 250 000 pounds they're asking for in return for 20 stake in the business david i'm almost speechless quite often people come here with products uh looking for investment yeah and when we go through the analysis i think i couldn't invest in it because the price isn't right but i'd buy the product now looking at this i don't think i would buy the product this product is already being sold online we launched it three weeks ago people are buying it online so how many people have bought it 700 online from a cold start how many 700. you've sold 700 in three weeks yeah from a gold star what price 24.95 plus five pound postage and packaging i'm just trying to work out from there yeah where you get a valuation of a million pound for your company now to be honest with you you cannot put a valuation on a company that's just starting that's that's crazy but you just did david because you said you wanted 250 point four twenty percent which would value the remaining eighty percent okay at one million pounds you put the valuation on it not me i don't like it okay i wouldn't use it straight away david has fallen foul of duncan banertine who seems irritated by the itza and infuriated by the one and a quarter million pound valuation david has placed on such a new business theo pathetis with his years of retail experience thinks he's seen it all before i was selling these eight years ago yeah the duffel bag type as opposed to a square bag yeah same thing in fairness i haven't got the um secret pocket at the end correct and haven't got the pockets at the side but got everything else so somebody so somebody could quite easily a cruise liner do their own absolutely right but they're in the cruise business but somebody's supplying the cruise liners who already has a contract absolutely absolutely for their towels their linen and everything could quite well do their own yes theo what you're looking at is risk risk to equity risk to investment okay you're thinking in your mind well if i invest 250 000 in this product i'm going to try and learn you're telling me about i'm not risking rewards what i am going to tell you what's the reward what i am going to yeah risk to reward absolutely and the only way you can get that is by how you market your product where you market it what you do with it and who you use to get it there really you look at what the competition is doing you look at what the competition isn't doing you find out what the competition isn't doing you find out what it's going to cost you to do what the competition isn't doing and then by the time you've divided it all up your percentages should be right because you know business is about percentages i believe and i will challenge it and i will challenge you if you want to bring one out to copy me because i'll take you to call i might think twice about it okay but i was there before you no no it doesn't matter doesn't mean it's not cool if you put the pockets on the side you copy it i said not do something well sorry there is a choice there is no comparison i think that's the way i can sum it up he's going to sue me now i've had the business lesson i'm very defensive of our product lesson now i've got the lawsuit david's attitude is alienating the dragons deborah meaden wants to steer the discussion back to the business opportunities for the product in the cruise liner market if it's for cruise liners yeah who provide you with towels and presumably as many as you want why would i bother packing that into my luggage you wouldn't no we're talking about they give it to you yeah as a as a corporate gift when you arrive in your cabin um how much are you selling that to cruise liners for six pound maybe we ought to get behind the business plan then because i thought we were talking about a retail price of 24.95 when you set a retail price in business of any product please don't tell me how to do retail prices that's got to drive me potty i'm not just concentrating just concentrate on your product and you tell me how you're going to how many you're going to sell what your revenue is going to be what the profit looks like in future years okay 36 000 online sales through an increase in spend for public relations awareness campaigns 50 000 is wholesale i've just come back from the canary islands where i've appointed five distributors in the canary islands to sell the product um and they will be selling it through either beach bars by the beaches and are they distributors are they buying the product from you or are they distributing they buy the product from so how many orders have you come back with what we're talking about is 50 000 wholesale orders in the canary islands in the first 12 months of trading okay so you've you've got orders for 50 000 of this product no but i will have have you got orders for any no to their utter disbelief the dragons have discovered that david has no wholesale orders on his books yet he's asking for a massive 250 000 pound investment deborah meaden wants to find out where the cash would go what are you going to spend 250 000 pounds on stock right and how does that happen we've got 72 000 on order now it's being made in china when you plan ahead for any stock position you've got four weeks to manufacture um anything you manufacture again you negotiate either at 40 to get it in manufacturing it might surprise you but i think a lot of us here probably understand how that process works i appreciate that despite having no firm orders david is about to take delivery of a massive shipment of his product richard farley thinks the strategy is unwise where i think you're making a mistake is is just trying to do too much too early you know i would keep if i were you i'd keep the business small i'd really pursue this cruise ship activity i would try to land that big order then you've got a valuable company until then you don't if we're talking about valuations you have to come back should you should you have put your money into some of the companies that are got no track record of any kind that float on the market for billions um you know you've got to give up that habit of giving business lessons every time you're asked a question i wouldn't go and spend huge amounts of money until you prove that it can be sold to the cruise ships when you do you've got a valuable company if you do okay until then i'm out [Music] an exasperated richard farley is out david isn't endearing himself to any of the multi-millionaire investors by trying to explain basic business principles to them so will any of the four remaining dragons invest business is all about what you achieve on a day-to-day basis and right now it's three weeks old the business so we have nothing to say to you this is what we've done you should write a book how to run a business all the facts in business you've been given so many business lessons that's not a very nice comment and i'll ignore that don't try and treat me like one okay if you didn't like that question you're really not gonna like mike but let me tell you something i could work with this guy david the point is i couldn't work with you that's not problematic that's the point you don't have to because i'd run the business and i'll consult you deborah's got a good question let's share debra's questions well actually duncan you kind of covered it because i was about to say if you'd if you didn't like that comment you're not going to like mine there's two parts to invest two parts to investing in a business there's product and there's personal whatever you do wherever you go and whatever you achieve you're going to give me advice aren't you i'm out david's apparently over confident attitude has cost him deborah meaden only peter jones duncan bannertine and theophitus remain and his chances of investment are dwindling you get a cruise liner to about a hundred thousand of these and you know what those greedy banks they'll be queuing up outside your front door to cut you a deal for funding that so tight and so competitive that you'll take their arm off i've enjoyed the business lesson this particular time i'm going to pass up on this opportunity so i'm out fine with theo per feet is now out david's pitch is falling apart peter jones is ready to declare where he stands i kind of think you are being silly about your valuations but that aside i can see you selling this i think people would buy it the question comes down to how many would they buy and i don't think that you would sell the volume that you expect and that's the only reason why i'm out it looks all over for david and sarah it's left to duncan bannertine who took an instant dislike to the product to have the final say you have a product called it's a and it's a mystery to me as to how you value it it's a complete mystery to me i don't understand it um so i don't invest in things that i don't understand so i'm going to keep myself out as well so everybody's out now thank you very much i need to lie down after that we carry on guys david might have made an impact in the den but it wasn't the one he was hoping for and he and sarah are walking away empty-handed daily was not exactly how to win friends and influence people there was a certain hostility in there was that your fault or theirs i don't think i handled it very well if i'm gonna be totally honest duncan i'm not schmuck don't try and treat me like one okay what about these business lessons you see you did start an awful lot of your answers with some general principle that they probably hadn't understood and you were going to explain it to them and it was i think they i could see their backs arching at the uh lectures wasn't that good wasn't that good that it got them thinking because it's too easy to sit there you know and everybody to nod and say what they want to say for them you know and they don't always know it all they're still learning too [Applause] you", "9Y7tjK06PFQ": "first up having to travel 17,000 kilometers isn't the perfect way to prepare for what might be the most important business pitch of your life chess but that's exactly what Ben Muller has had to do to pair up with his business partner Andy Jeffries I'm live in Sydney in Australia and Andy's base here in the UK and we run our business from opposite sides of the world [Music] in a traditional business it's not the ideal way to operate but we absolutely make it work hope the father's worth it yeah this chat doesn't hit him brother and the duo are hoping their laid-back approach to corporate life doesn't deter the suited and booted dragons I'm not sure how Peter Jones feels about people wearing flip-flops to a business meeting here we go we're just living the brand [Music] hi dragons I'm Andy and I'm Benna and we're the proud founders of docking bay a unique Beach and travel brand with our microfiber towel products we're here today seeking 75,000 pounds for a 5 percent equity in our business we weren't to completely reinvent the traditional towel one of our biggest issues when traveling the world was always on microfiber towels they were small dull would collect smell and be unappealing at the beach and we couldn't take a big bulky beach towel with us they take up far too much room and besides they take ages to dry and the scene gets all stuck in them so here's what we created our signature microfiber towel a 2 metres in length this is the biggest towel on the market nearly big enough to cover Peter Jones from head to toe last financial year we made 1.1 million in revenue with 330 K net profit and in the UK and the USA our top ranked sellers in the world's biggest online marketplace Amazon now we want to push hard into the worldwide twenty two billion dollar beach and swim market now we'd love you to see our products firsthand hoping their towel business can soak up some dragon investment a Ben mullah and Andy Jeffries who are asking for a seventy-five thousand pound cash injection in return for a five percent equity stake in their company retail magnate touka Suleiman has a global manufacturing Network and he wants a bit more background from the business Beach Boys I'd love to know your journey where have you come from yeah how did you start this okay so me and Ben used to work in one of the UK banks about two and a half years ago now and you know a quite common story we decided it just wasn't for us we weren't fitting with the people sort of trying to enjoy ourselves as much as possible which didn't it was sit well in that world so we started brainstorming of new ideas and what we really settled on was our biggest passion which is travel so we thought how can we build a product that we would have wanted when we were traveling so we started talking about towels and after months of liberation and choosing you know how the design would look how the brand would look then we started looking at the manufacturer you're not the first board and dissolution bankers to come into the enzone i resonate with that and it's amazing what great entrepreneurs we make so well done on the product itself I love the vibrancy but it doesn't feel very welcoming to me a towel needs to feel cozy and I'd feel like I was wearing a flag or something here's what I feel it's a really good point Jenny and we you know we do get that feedback a lot from people in that you know this feels different to what I'm used to sometimes we use the analogy you know you don't you don't only have one pair of shoes yeah you have you have flip-flops for one purpose you have boots for another and you know if you're looking for a compact portable towel we think that eles is number one the entrepreneurs stand their ground with a confident defense of their brand to fellow ex-banker Jenny Campbell now textile King touka Suleiman wants to find out more about the makeup of the compact cloth this is what is yep nylon cotton is eight percent polyester and twenty cent polymide it hasn't got a lot of absorbency due to the microfiber material these will absorb you know three to four times more water than your normal cotton towel okay so how much is a two meter so to me it's at our retails at eighteen pounds cost so our landed cost is four pounds 40 wholesale price well it's half the retail so 750 so you've got a good good margin yeah so um you're doing that 1.1 million turnover yes the last financial year we turn over 1.1 million you're making three hundred thousand pounds a year on a million turnover you don't need a dragon so where it's a turning point in our business and some mentorship and some guidance would be really key so we can really take our brand to the next level in terms of online sales how much is selling through Amazon how much is selling through your website works out about an 80/20 split from Amazon to our website and what's the sales you're doing at retail total if you add it up for a month so [Music] admittedly it's not a number I just have to my idea at the moment it's probably you know five to ten percent of our revenues yeah so do you think it's because people don't know what the product is when they see it do they believe it's a towel it doesn't look like a towel you know why do we think we haven't got a large retail footprint with our products yeah so I think the answer is this is a area that we're yeah we're lacking in at the moment yeah and you know that I mean that shows something we can improve you've clearly got a business but what's the future of that business if somebody went toe to toe with you on Amazon my feeling is that you actually would lose a lot of business overnight is there another product like this on Amazon so now not at the moment that's my point you're not fending off any competition like to could probably bring this out very quickly I would imagine yeah and then what would happen if he did we want to be a step ahead of any competition cuz so Tuukka brings it in tomorrow but we've already got the next product coming out that's gonna take Takeko pastoralism the next core product we want to be known as the number one tower company across the world that sort of changed what towers are and what people want and need them for I'm gonna be really honest I'm struggling even though the profits are there I'm struggling to get excited about a towel Peter one of the most exciting brands in the UK at the moment could you say that with a little bit more excitement Peter with one of the most exciting yeah it's really strange I'm always feeling conflicted because my brain is thinking hang on this company is doing really well it's making a lot of money but it's a towel I can't believe I'm settling around about to invest in a towel business a deliberating Peter Jones hints that he's warming to the business proposition will his nod to a deal encourage Jenny Campbell into making an offer I think you guys are great and the product is professional and everything but I can't get excited about a towel sorry so on that basis I wish you every success but I'm out thank you we really appreciate the feedback [Music] guys I know where you're at I know the textile business very well product development sourcing from China but I would want a lot more and I'm and I don't really want to take it away from you guys yeah if you want me to offer I could offer but I don't want to embarrass you offer make an offer I would give you all the money for 25% so you have an offer okay Mexico a curveball from Tuco Suleiman who makes a reticent play for the business but at five times the equity stake that the entrepreneurs are willing to give away so far the pair have lost one dragon but gained an offer on which side of the fence will tase Levani for I think you've got something going here you're right you need to be out there first you need to be getting market share as soon as possible building the brand I think I can help with that because that's what I do so what I'm gonna do is make you an offer five percent however a dragon is is a very low amount to get out and do things for but what I'll do is I'll offer you all of the money for fifteen percent of the business but if I get my money back in three years I'll drop it down to ten percent thanks - thank you very much the beach loving buddies are drawing in the Dragons flip-flops and all and now former leisure supremo Deborah Medan appears to have come to a decision about the travel towel offer I think it's very interesting because you know it's it you've done a fantastic job you you know you're all over it I'm gonna make you an offer and I too will offer you all of the money but I also want you completely motivated because I think you've got 99.999% of everything you need and I get a sense that you wouldn't be all time-consuming you know for me or any of my guys so I think a fair offer is for 10% of the business as my author perfect Thank You Deborah [Music] the short loving entrepreneurs certainly aren't short of offers as Deborah Medan makes her own pitch for the business three dragons have now tabled bids but there's still one multi-millionaire who is yet to play his hand could he make it a quadruple guy I thought but I made my decision and my decision is based on one of the Dragons actually with the offer that's been made and that dragons Deborah I think if I'd made that offer I'd need a towel to lie down on I think you've been given an outrageously good offer there and I love competition but I just think I'd want a lot more than that a lot more so that's the reason why I'm going to say sadly I'm out oh thank you thanks but Peter Jones throws in the towel but the duo still have three dragons in play can we have a take a couple of minutes think about it two entrepreneurs three offers one difficult decision textile tycoon touka suleiman who's outsourcing expertise could make him the perfect fit for the company wants a sizable 25% stake tej Levani wants 15% of the business but will hand back some of that equity if his investment is repaid and a 10% Deborah Medan is seeking a smaller piece of the pie right guys first see we just like to thank you massively for the offers that were made and we've come to the decision to to go with Deborah on this occasion excellent good it's really really pleased let's do that with the entrepreneurs walked into the den wearing flip-flops thank you but they walk out having filled their boots with a deal yeah pretty pleased what just happened there they took us around the water tank it was tough when the offers start coming in we just didn't know what to do well done Deborah that was a pretty amazing offer though that is not bad no it's not bad but it is a towel but it still makes hay is way more than just a towel join the revolution you I'm out", "8zlNSC6hSso": "towels are handcrafted from the finest turkish cotton making them both lightweight and multifunctional these perfect gifts can be used at the beach as a decorative tapestry or even as a stylish start in the winter literally the possibilities are endless but most importantly our towels connect people to a bigger purpose with every single cloud purchased we donate to preserve our oceans and marine life in fact we want to show you a video of one of our charity partners releasing sea lions back into the ocean after rescuing them earlier this year that's great sharks we are not just looking for money today we are looking for a mentor to help guide us to the next level now which one of you sharks wants to wrap up in a sand cloud and help us make a difference now bruno is going to go around the room and pass thank you thank you thank you thank you here's our baja beach blanket this is our best selling towel cool our wonder which one the wunderlust tie-dye so brendan it's very thin yeah it this i wouldn't think this would make a good towel after i got out of the water right well those are all actually handmade in turkey from fine turkish cotton actually all in villages in turkey by families so it's really good quality and that's why we charge 47 dollars but it feels like a wrap as opposed to a towel yeah maybe it's just our condition but look i started my own company with my first commission check the first thing i did was buy nice thick fluffy towels because they just feel so luxurious right actually yeah when we first started our company the first thing we want to do we went to the towels that were thicker and luxurious and we tested the market selling one by one by two at the beach we found out that people wanted something different and they wanted something that was easy to carry in their backpack easy to fit in their purse fair enough so this is more as a beach product for the beach as opposed to in your home in your life though yes so the great thing about these is because you know because of the light weight in the material it doubles as a sarong and what we've seen a lot is people hanging up underneath is tapestry so how much is this that one is actually 47. 47. and what's your cost our cost on that is ten dollars so we have an eighty percent margin yeah you're proud of that 50 bucks for this because it's really about the whole lifestyle give back right baby we see ourselves as the next toms of the city because millennials need a social cause to get behind in order to support you the only thing is that everybody has a social cause now 100 of millennials that come in selling it's all about cause right the three of us we own 100 of the company for you we've been in business for about two and a half years now our first year in business we did 30 000 in sales year two we did 430 000 and this year so far to date we've done over 1.6 million and we're on track", "FUxwkkP2TgM": "all right guys we are back with our latest product review it's inside this bag we're gonna get right into it right after this all right guys so like i said we are back with our latest product review i'm super excited again always excited for when i get new product in because i get to do fun product reviews which is basically kind of turning out how this whole uh youtube channel has been unfortunately with a quarantine it's been hard to get out uh do a lot of amy eat san diego or kind of touristy things but i'm super excited because my sand cloud towels are here so i have purchased two sand cloud towels i'm super excited for these guys because i am so excited to try these out at the beach they are made of a turkish cotton it's 100 turkish cotton and what's really great is that uh they as you like use them at the beach or sand or anything like that sand won't uh stick to this like it does with normal towels so it's really cool um i do i will make a product review video of me using my sand clay towels at the beach i have a regular sized towel here and an extra large towel here i bought two just because i never know exactly when i'm gonna need what for certain situations so like i said they're made out of 100 turkish cotton which is super cool they are i think based here in san diego which is another really cool like hometown product for me uh to be using and one of the things i never knew is once i actually got my product that all my friends actually have sand cloud towels and no one has told me about the amazing product that the san cloud towel is i this past holiday i just recently bought some for my friends for christmas presents one of the other things that is really nice as well is they have a mission to save marine life that really goes along with my beliefs and my just kind of overall uh you know virtue and aura and whatever i put out there right so one of the really cool things is that they have a hashtag on here that says save the fishies and um they've got a little mission statement written on here so i'm going to read that to you because i think it's really important to know products mission statements soundcloud's mission is to create the best sustainable eco-friendly products in the world while raising awareness for marine conservation a portion of profits will go towards organizations that support our mission to save the fishes with save the fishies one of the really cool things is they donate 10 of their profits to different organizations like they said to help save marine life and help conservation so that's really cool one of the things i really enjoy so this one that i have in my hand right here this is the mint baja towel that i have here in my hand let's go ahead and pop this open again this is the regular sized towel i'm just gonna scoop back and pop it open like this i love the colors i love the black little diamond design that's right there i love that one of the super cool things is that they have regular towels [Music] like this one here that you can lay perfectly on it covers me completely i'm 5'8 so touching the floor you know like that it's maybe about five six feet long i wanna say um but it's super cool i love the colors i'm in love with this one of the really great things too is that they have towels they have big blankets oh it's so soft and so light i love the little fringe accents here on the end that's really great but i really really love this mint baja color the other one that i purchased is an extra large towel so let's see what the extra large towel looks like this is the luna extra large towels this right here is the luna extra large towel it is big it is pretty and tie dyey oh i love this so this is the extra large towel this is the luna extra large can easily fit maybe two or three people if you're using it for a picnic if you're at the beach we'll easily sit two or three people if you're having a picnic like that but it's super great super large can also be used as like a tapestry too like that's a really cool design i love the colors this is one of the reasons why i bought the luna extra large towel again super soft all right so one of the things that i liked about the towel is that it's not supposed to really abs it's supposed to absorb really well and dry really fast because of that turkish cotton so one of the things i'm going to actually do right now is single layer this so it's straight against my kitchen table right now i have here a tablespoon of just regular water look at that it's not even soaking in it's just beating on the towel look at this it's just beating right there it's not even soaking in until i actually push the water into the towel like it's so great that's that's amazing i love that so one of the really cool things about having this towel is that because it's so light and it's not going to be like one of those terry cloth towels that has those loops in it that it's going to dry fast it's not going to mold it's not going to get stinky and it's going to be super great to kind of just you know use while you're at the beach and then just kind of soak up uh salt water and then just you know use it for the next time there are some care instructions that come with it it does say to wash machine cold on a delicate cycle do not bleach hang air dry do not iron the item and do not dry clean the towels so make sure you really follow those instructions i have not taken a peek to see what exactly their return policy or you know if you damage it what their actual policy is but i'm super excited i mean that water i literally just poured it on there and it beaded like it didn't even really absorb until i pushed that water in with my hand which was super cool i'm super excited to see what the product will be like when i'm at the beach because it's supposed to kind of just absorb that water and not get me as a person using this product sandy so that was my unboxing kind of just first impressions of the sand cloud towels this is the regular towel and then the luna the tie-dye one was the extra large super gray i'm super excited if you follow them on instagram they usually have a bunch of different promo codes so you can usually save about 15 or 20 depending on what kind of promo code you use so i really do encourage you guys to take a look at that one of the other things that i'm super excited about and i will probably have to purchase and make another product review on is bath towels they have bath towels so i'm super excited i really want to purchase those and again like i said i if if i do purchase those i will make a product review on that but i'm loving the sand cloud towels cannot wait to get this to the beach do a comparison next to one of my regular towels that i have so with that i'm super excited i'm so glad that i own this now but yeah i'm so happy with this thank you thank you thank you so much same cloud for making such an awesome product great cute i love the designs i love the colors so that i can use it here on the beaches in san diego and you know tell people yeah i got that at soundcloud you should check into it too you should also check into purchasing with sandcloud they can take that 10 and donate it towards marine conservation and help save the fishies so with that thank you so much for watching this video i am super excited i cannot wait again like i said to get to the beach and try these guys out so thanks for watching this maybe next time you see me i'll be at the beach getting sandy or in this case not getting sandy because i've got my sand clad towels thank you guys so much and i'll see you guys soon bye [Music] you", "cWxEebHTJS4": "Hey there pate repeats of people today\non Tony's reviews I'm gonna be reviewing something very exciting I'm talking\nabout a towel no no no not this towel I'll show you\noh and no no I didn't I didn't say ShamWow\nI said towel so let me show you today on tony's reviews i'll be reviewing the\neast hills microfiber beach towel and this East Hills outdoors beach towel\ncomes in its own elegant beach bag how do I know it's a beach bag because it's\ngot mesh on the bottom so the same will pass through it\nthat's how and water I guess - so first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna\ncheck this thing out I haven't even looked at it yet beach towel actually came wrapped nice\nin tissue paper inside the bag here I can't even put it into the camera it's\nso big and it's super thin this is hung up on a closet door here and you can see\nthat this is a very long towel and it is 36 by 79 this tala is super super thin\nbut it feels very durable it's got a real good texture to it and it's very\nsoft this is such a thin towel it probably will dry quick and the idea is\nit is microfiber so it's supposed to dry you good and then the towel itself is\ngonna dry out fairly quick and you can see right here it's got a real nice tag\non it so that you can you know snatch this thing thing up easy by the corner\nand it's it looks like it's in there and good it's got like a little button\nholding that in place so you can check that out there I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\nget this towel wet and I'm gonna get a regular beach towel wet and hang them up\nside by side on my deck just like I normally would beach towels and we'll\nsee how long it takes these to dry out both these towels soaked and wind my\nthroat over my deck here like I normally do when I actually had a pool so let me\nget this stretched out over the deck and then I'll show you the microfiber towel\nand it will leave them out here to dry okay here's the microfiber towel and I\nreally can't wring any water out of it even I ran it in the water for a long\ntime it just kind of repels water it's have to trust me on this it is very wet\nright now it's just not letting a lot of water loose so it's holding on to the\nwater and it did repel out of water too so I don't know what that means I\nhaven't ever dried off with a microfiber towel so we're gonna check it out and\nsee how this works now mates I have to tell you both of these towels are\nsoaking wet and stinking of gin they're not really sneaking a gin I just want to\nsay that damn I can stay here the whole time they dry I just want you seem that\nand right here's where my pool is that - last week ain't that beautiful\nokay the microfiber towel and touch it right now and it's pretty much bone dry\nit is bone dry so the microfiber towel is SuperDuper\ndry and the Jamaican towel is still soaking wet so just to let you know just\nto give you an idea test went really well for the microfiber towel it's been\nout here for an hour and a half and it's bone dry the old Jamaican towel which is\na standard you know it's the standard beach towel it is soaking wet so anyway\nthat's a good thing because when you're at the beach or you're at a swimming\npool or something we want our towels to dry quickly right so in case they get\nwet or you know these are gonna get what we dry off but we want to make sure that\nthey dry quickly so that's a huge plus also this thing shits really good so I\ndon't think you're gonna have any problem with sand or anything sticking\nto it a lot less trouble than you would have with a towel like this it's gonna\nstay damp all the time I really like this microfiber towel so far so next I'm\ngonna test out the drying properties I'm gonna take a shower and dry myself off\nwith it and see how well it dries off the body as you can see this folds down\npretty small I'm gonna be using it as my bath towel today just to see how well\nthis thing will dry you off so now I'm getting in the shower I wasn't going to show you my wet rat\nself too long but I do want to tell you this at the end this East Hills outdoors\nmicrofiber towel is a pretty good towel it drive me off really good it dries\nreally quickly it's very large I think it's perfect for the beach it's durable\nthe sand will fall off of it super easy I do want to mention though is while I\nwas drying myself off I have to say the texture feels a little strange it's soft\nenough but for many years I've used for regular old towel dries your body off\njust as quick as a regular towel but it is a little bit different than the hair\nit will get that general dampness out of your hair at first just like a regular\ntowel does but it does not get your hair as dry as a regular towel does so that's\njust a little warning but all in all it's a great towel it dries out quickly\nI think it'd be perfect for the beach and now that I have this East Hills\nmicrofiber towel I definitely would never use another regular beach towel\nagain so anyway I'm very impressed with this East Hills outdoors microfiber\ntowel if you're interested in one of these there'll be a link down in the\ndescription so you can order one off Amazon and if you enjoyed the video\ntoday and learn anything please remember to Like subscribe comment and share\nI want to thank you so much for watching and God bless you", "_NikdbEa-Bk": "Hi, I'm Jen from Online Fabric Store. Beach towels are essential to have in the summer, whether you're laying out by the pool or on the beach. I'm going to show you how to make a double sided beach towel using terry cloth fabric. So let's get started. The materials you'll need are: 2 yards of terry cloth, I'm using 1 yard of navy blue and 1 yard of red terry cloth fabric, scissors, a yard stick, red thread, navy thread, a hand sewing needle, and ballpoint pins. Take the two 1 yard pieces of terry cloth and make sure they're cut evenly. The dimensions should be around 58 inches long and 36 inches wide. Trim uneven sides if needed. Place the pieces together with the right sides facing each other and pin around all four sides. Make sure the red thread is the top stitch and the navy thread is in the bobbin. Stitch around the edges with a 1 inch seam allowance. Leave an opening at the end that is about a foot wide. Fold the towel to the right side by pulling the fabric through the opening. Use the yardstick to poke out the corners. At the opening, fold each side 1 inch over to the inside. You can pin to help keep the fabric in place if needed. Hand stitch the sides together by using an invisible blind stitch from the beginning of the opening to the end. An invisible blind stitch is a stitch that is sewn from the inside and not visible on the outside. Double knot at the end and trim the thread. Starting at one corner, stitch with a 1/2 inch seam allowance along all four sides of the towel. Back stitch at the beginning and the end. Once you've reached the end, the towel is finished. Terry cloth is the best fabric to use for towels because it's soft and absorbs water quickly. Thanks for watching this OFS project.", "0LyQoaOemy8": "hey friends you are crafting with kim byers at the celebration shop and today we are going to decorate beach towels so we're going to use either you can use your maker you can use your explorer you can even use your joy this is a really easy iron-on craft but i want to take you into cricut design space and i want to show you a couple of ways to do it i'm going to show you full name and then i'm going to show you a way to make your own monogram shape so let's hop over there and i'll show you what it's all about we'll hit the craft table and put it all together if you like what i'm doing here today i hope you'll give me a thumbs up and i would love for you to subscribe and join me every week for new videos okay let's get going okay so here we are in qriket design space so just from the home page i chose to start a new canvas and once in the canvas i um i personally want to put my full name on my beach towel but i'm also going to show you how to create your own monogram shape so let's start first with the full name so i chose um a very easy font this is actually called varsity um and i use it a lot because i have boys and so they don't want anything freely or frou-frou but this fawn is really nice because it is just very clean cuts okay and so then i personally wanted to do something sort of tropical because my beach towel is not bright colors i wanted to put bright colors on it so i just went into images and you can search anything that your kids might be into or that you're into i searched palm originally and so there's palm trees and things like that and then i found you know just a palm shape and so i added that and i added some fronds but i'm i'm loving how it's coming out and so i'm going to be using really bright colors like pink and bright green and yellow and orange but say i wanted to just do a monogram like i just or i just wanted to do the the letter k or if i wanted to do my full monogram so here's a little trick to be able to create your own let's take this one palm leaf we're going to duplicate it so let's just move it down a little bit okay and i'm going to make that larger just so we can see it we can always resize it um depending on the size of your towel okay so now that we have this what i want to do is go into the contour tool and so for any shape that you choose remember contour allows you to eliminate things within the shape that you don't want so like i didn't want that centerpiece because i didn't want it to interfere with the shape i'm going to overlay onto it so i just took that out so if you were doing a mermaid tail or if you were doing a whale or if you were doing any number of things an alligator and it had cuts in it that you didn't want to be there you always remember you can use the contour tool and take those out okay so now that i have my palm and i'm just going to rotate it a little bit let's go over into shapes and i'm going to grab a circle okay so let's take the circle and if i was going to do a monogram this would be about the size i think i would use okay so now what we want to do is i'm going to duplicate that circle i'm going to move it out of the way i'm going to grab the palm frond and my circle here and then i'm going to slice them okay so now see i can take out and delete that piece of the the palm i'm going to delete that piece and i'm going to delete that piece now this circle is going to fit in there fantastic but because i don't want to overlay um so much i don't want to waste any material and i don't necessarily want to overlay my lettering on top of the circle what i'm going to do is duplicate that circle and make it slightly smaller i'm going to change the color just so you can see what i'm doing so then we have shift and grab both of them and go up into a line here we go and we're going to center them with each other horizontally and then we will do it vertically so now i know that the circle on the inside is exactly in the center of the other and then i'm going to go down to slice and now i have i can delete this one and now i have this perfect frame okay that's gonna fit perfectly within the palm frond okay how wonderful is that alright so if i wanted to do this um let's say i wanted to do this green i want it to be the same color as the frond and if that's the case then why cut them both out right i could grab them both and weld them so they're now one piece and then you can go in to text actually i think you can go you can go into text if you just wanted to get a letter but you can also go into images and search monogram one so i want to um grab this one and for sake we're just going to pop that in so you can see what it would look like but basically you can go and get all those different letters and each of the placements are there so then you would be able to do that or you could go in to text and pick a font you liked and then resize each one to somewhat fit so that would work too but you could use this idea of having a shape and then overlaying a frame onto it and using the slice tool to make anything into a monogram shape so you could do this with um if your child's really into butterflies or you know whatever the case may be you can make your own right here in qriket design space okay but today i am not going to use this one i am going to hide these and go back up and we are going to make this one okay so there's nothing really to attach on this so let's go ahead and select make it a weight we're going to use the qriket maker today instead of the joy so i wanted to change that to maker and let's select make it it's going to sort it out to our mat so we have our yellow matte we have our i don't know why that's doing that there it is sometimes when i go to matt um it like only half shows up so if you just um move it around it it'll pop up in the right way i'm not quite sure maybe it's just me i don't know maybe it doesn't do that to anybody else okay and so then we have our yellow we have our green and these are slightly overlapped so see when i hit the there then they're perfect not sure why that happens and then here's my name so now remember we're using iron-on so we want to mirror each and every one of these so i'm going to go ahead and mirror kim we'll go ahead and mirror the palms mirror that one and grab that one okay so let's go ahead and we'll select continue and now we can choose our material so i'm going to be using um an everyday iron-on for these projects and actually i'm going to be using four different colors but each and every one of them is everyday iron on if you have um like if you're using glitter for one and and foil or something for something else just make sure that as you get to that mat you go back here and change your material so we're going to select every day and we don't need anything in clamp a we have our fine point blade in clamp b and we're ready to go okay so here we are on the craft table let me show you what we're working with today so i have my beach towel just a neutral colored beach towel i have four different colors of iron-on really bright choices and these are actually called neon colors these three and then i have my trimmer and i have my weeding tools i have my cricut easy press and i use um today i'm going to use the smallest of the three well not the mini there's a really tiny one right that's the mini but this is the smallest of the three machines and then i have a pair of scissors okay so let's move everything out of the way and i'll show you how we're gonna put the first of the colors on the map actually really quickly before we get started with the mat i want to show you guys something so it's important to measure your towel or to know how large it is before you choose how big you want your design to be because you don't want some tiny little design on this really huge towel unless that's what you want of course right so for me i wanted a 12 inch design and so i think for this particular towel this is going to work really well it's going to be about six about five and a half six inches so it's going to be tall and it's going to be long so it's going to be 12. but this towel is um 7 feet long i think it is it might be 8 feet i measured it before but it's quite large so i think that proportionally that design will work well for this so it depends on what size towel you're using but just make sure that you use something like this i use my clear acrylic ruler for almost everything and you measure your design and make sure that you know how it's going to lay out and it's going to look awesome when you get done okay so we're going to start with our yellow and i need a very small piece of it so i need [Applause] four and three quarters by two and a half and i'm going to be using a standard grip green mat [Applause] so two and three quarters and let's just see so this is six inches long and so that would be four and a half so the nice thing about this is that i can measure it both directions and make sure that i have enough and plus i don't over cut so i can just cut upwards if i want to keep my pieces all together and i do and so then i'm just going to use a pair of scissors and trim that off and then that allows me to keep my pieces together i just find that for me it's easier i do put them in ziploc bags and things like that sometimes to try to keep the colors um together but it's just easier if i can cut it out and keep it together like this okay so let's take that over to matte now this is um iron-on right so we are going to mirror and we want to put it face down okay we can use our scraping tool and kind of put our material into place and now we're ready to go over to the maker maker it's gonna load my mat and go ahead and hit go okay now it's ready to eject and we'll go back to the craft table and do this all over again for each color okay so here we are back on the craft table and i've cut out all four colors and i just wanted to show you i broke out my bright pad because um i actually had to get classes not too long ago reading classes and i find that i really need to use them for my weeding as well but the bright pad really makes the process a lot more simple i'm not sure if you can tell this on camera but with the bright pad i can see all the outlines of the design and i can easily go in and get the elements without messing up um the iron-on or the you know the fragile elements of the pieces that i don't want to peel off so i would recommend if you can't see very well you might want to hop down and check out the bright pad okay so what i'm going to do is go ahead and weed out all the rest of this i've gotten my name already and now i'm working on the palms and we'll get all of that pulled out and then we'll hop over to the easy press and i'll show you how to use that okay so i've just taken my towel laid it out and i measured it again wanted to make sure i found my center point um and i've just laid my ruler here so that you can see right here with the nine is my center point and it lines up with the eye and then i placed around it um all of the elements that i cut out the thing is is we are going to layer this iron on so i cannot just press it all at one time so what i want to do is i want to now that i have it exactly where i want it to be i'm going to take it apart and just do the bottom elements and then we'll layer on top of each other one thing with layering you can layer every day and you can layer glitter on top of everyday you cannot put everyday iron on on top of glitter it just won't stick because of the texture of the glitter or if it does it's going to come off pretty quick so just know when you're layering iron on make sure that the glitter is always on top okay so let's kind of peel this apart and i've got my easy press um heating up we'll hop over and check out the guide to make sure that we have the right temperatures for the neon um and the okay so now the easy press is heated and i've placed the easy press mat underneath my design and i left this element on just to make sure you know that i didn't have to like replace everything okay so let's start with one element light pressure for 30 seconds okay so now we can remove the easy press and we'll flip it over and heat it on the back for 15 seconds just to make sure that it heat sets and then we'll move on to our next pieces okay so now we have two elements in place and we want to put our first element that slightly layers over another the thing is is you want to protect that first piece so you want to make sure that you've you know peeled this and it doesn't have the protective layer on it anymore and that your item is here with its protective layer and you're not allowing this to get under the new design because of course it would adhere to it but you can overlay it onto a design just to protect it so let's make sure that we've got the whole thing covered and my best advice is try not to reheat this if you can help it but if you do you have your protective piece okay so now you can go ahead and peel it off and i do recommend that you allow it to cool just because i think it adheres to the towel a little bit better once you you know let it cool and then slowly peel it away especially when you have something fragile like this you always peel at an angle [Music] and peel slowly okay so now we're going to put on the name same process and then we'll place this final element about right here and we'll be done okay so i hope you thought that was fun and i hope you'll decorate all your beach towels and i'm sure the kids would love for you to make them mermaids or whales or something really cool like that to go on their beach towel and i hope you will hop down below and check out all the supplies that we used today um make sure that you give me that thumbs up if you like what we did and i would love for you to

partners in the Standardbred industry age is not a prerequisite for success experiences and that's where a 24 year old Seth Rosenfeld comes into the picture possessing a maturity which belies his age this whiz kid from New York City is the man who runs the show for beach towel I've been in the business since I was about 12 I started going out to my labelled farms which my father my uncle owned and I used to spend summers there which was you know for a city kid it was a lot of fun just to be out of the city and on a horse farm you know I always loved being out of the farm of the racetracks I worked with the yearlings and I got to meet a lot of people in the in the industry and I was just an inquisitive little kid that was running around asking people questions all the time and I you know buried my nose in in all the books I could find and the racing magazines and I think it's maybe a little bit different for someone in horse racing but I basically did to horse racing what everyone else does for sports like baseball and football it's the first time I noticed beach towel was when I went looked through the catalog when I was at home and I didn't turn the page down like I usually do if I'm interested in the horse and trying to think back to that time I think what it was is that he was a Kentucky bred and I thought that he if he looked good he would bring more money than I would want to spend on a Kentucky bred well we brought him for 22,000 and I would have gone everyone asked well how how much higher would you have gone probably I would have made a couple more bids somewhere around 25,000 that I bought him I wasn't thinking this is a multi-million dollar horse I was just thinking this you know this could be a real good horse and this would be a smart purchase you know but what the way he's turned out is sort of beyond you know your wildest expectations part of beach towel success can be attributed to the remin brothers who have trained at driven horses for Seth and his family for many many years we all work together but we divide the functions up as Larry concentrates on training the racehorses I concentrate on training the yearlings and the young horses and rate supervises this bull when you have that many horses it's important I think to you know sort of divide up into into groups to keep a more careful eye on Seth is not your average odor or your average 24 year old since graduating from Cornell in 1988 he has made this his full-time career I'm typical in many ways that have my my likes and dislikes are pretty similar to a lot of other 24 year olds but there are you know many people who sort of have that lifestyle he has come through a harness racing family and has been around them in his whole life he is probably as much or more than most of the owners in in the industry right now even if he is only 24 you know for me I feel old now I'm 24 everyone else thinks I'm young for me it feels like I've been around forever people have asked me I guess you know the last couple years what would you do if you weren't in harness racing I really don't have the slightest idea I knew that I'd come up with beach towel you know which was just a stroke of luck I think I'd do everything the same again and if beach towel wins tonight he will go over the two million dollar mark for this year we'll head to the beach when we return there's

the stretch force of the year beats down no doubt [Music]", "FSYLUL3Cf54": "so we are going to create a beach towel and I have some reference images already here yeah one important thing that you can see here is that we have a nice sandy beach and then we have our beach towel on top of here with some nice folds in here which we can recreate with blenders cloth simulation and then if you look at here we can see this is gonna be more in the end of the tutorial but we have actually two particle systems which is some higher some longer lengths of hairs and some shorter ones the shorter ones are kind of optional but I like it and that's why we're of course gonna also go over that but let's first is going to blender and we're going to delete this default cube now we can add a plane and we're gonna scale this up by four and create another plane I'm gonna move this plane a little bit up and scale it around the x-axis for two now we can see that we have a little bit of an elongated rectangular shape which is more a kind of the shape which a beach towel would have we can hide this and just focus upon our beach so you can rename this as well Beach or send whatever you want and what I want to do here is I want to make sure we have some displacement in here otherwise the towers will just fall on something flat and will also be flat it just yeah doesn't really look like a beach right so what we're gonna do is go in here and add a displacement modifier and we need to add a texture so you can just click on new now if you go into the texture properties you can open a certain texture right so I'm going to send and I'm going to open the displacement texture so nothing is really displacing here and that's because we only are working with a very limited amount of geometry if we actually are gonna add sulfites a few times now you can see that we actually do have the displacement which we want the displacement in the strength is a little bit too high so I would like to put this down to point zero seven maybe sovereignly this would already work great I'm gonna give this a shade smooth and I do realize that this detail is not very like high-end right so what I would like to do is to create some more detail and that is add a modifier subdivision surface and actually put this above our displacement modifier you can see that if I go up in our few ports that we get yeah way more realistic results and I do not really want to do this in a few ports we can always do it in the render but otherwise it's just gonna yeah be a little bit heavier on our computers and we do not want that so I'm gonna keep the few port at 1 now we can also give this some materials if we would like so go to shading click on new it's gonna be our beach and just grab your image texture color go to the base color and this is going to be our sand we also have specular and of course a roughness and last but for sure not least that's going to be our normal map so normal map and because this color doesn't like mesh up to this color right we have from yellow we go to purple we need to put a normal map node in between here now you can see that this color goes into this and then we go from purple to purple so now it's good you can just put this to non color data and this creates the material that we want and yeah that's kind of it for the beach so now we can start to simulate our towel let's also rename this beach towel just towel whatever you want and we want to give this a cloth simulation the only problem is when we certify this to create a more realistic cloth simulation we have some of these rectangular faces this is not what we want we want a very nice and even geometry all over to make sure our details also be nice and even so what I want to do is just create one edge loop here in the middle and then create our subdivisions right so around here will be okay and now we can go into our modifiers and add a cloth simulation so here we have our physics properties and here you can see all the settings that we have if you go here into your layout we can see that we also have a timeline and you can of course play this so right now it will just fall through here because this Beach does not have any collisions if you should like the beach and go into your physics properties you can actually put on a collision modifier and this also has some options but we're not gonna very with this so if you play it again you can see that now it collides with the beach very very cool the only thing is I want to use a bit of a different preset so if you go to cloth if you look here on the right you have some cloth presets and I want to put this to denim you can see that a lot of these things changed steps went up we also have more tension shearing compression all of that stuff and yet this creates a little bit more of a realistic towel let's say so if you want to render this let's say if you want to bake this go into cash and you want it to bake it right make sure you put the end a little bit lower because there's no need to bake it all the way to 250 frames so I'm gonna put this at 30 and then start my bake as you can see this goes quite fast if you want a better result so let's say this the result that we have right now if you would like a little bit more realistic you can always try to add some more subdivisions in here what I also like to do is if you look at a frame is zero-- by the way if you want to change anything now you need to delete the bake first and then bake again but let's say you're on the beach and you want to put a towel down what do you do normally you do not really stand here if two people pull it straight and then put it down right more the most time you just flap it out so what we do here is just kind of add some randomness in this hair and then I start to bake again I like to do it this way it's it seems a little bit more organic seems a little bit more you know what would happen in real life instead of it just being super flat and just been thrown down so yeah this is just really being thrown down here and it doesn't change a lot but I like to think that it changed a little bit maybe this meant a little bit higher and of course we can also go as I said higher in the subdivisions but let's make sure it has a shade smooth I'm gonna hide the beach right now and I want to look at the materials that we can create for this so go into shading again and we are going to create a new material for our towel so let's rename this towel stripes or stripes and I want to get rid of the principal shader and just create a image texture okay this texture is going to be this stripe texture that we have here and I want to use a diffuse shader and put this color into the scholar and then a B SDF enter here so here we have our texture right I kind of want to select this texture inside the UV editing and then rotate this for 90 degrees now if we go back to shading you can see that we have nice and elongated stripes which yeah that was kind of what I was looking for so what can we do with this well we actually need to make it look a little bit more like a fabric right and you can do this with a velvet shader but if you look now at felf it you can see that we have nothing this has to do with our render engine right now we are in Eevee but if it doesn't really support falfa shading so we go here into cycles and now our node will be just down here if you look for fill fit and we can put it in very very cool so I want to mix these up so mix shader' and right now you can see that the velvet and the diffuse have been mixed but I do not want it just to be you know white all the way around I want it to be just like a normal cloth or fabric would do and that is it being on a certain amount of angle that we look at right so a lot of times when you look at some cloth let's look at a couch maybe couch you will see that more where the light will shine we get some of these brighter values and that has to do with here you can see it very good right so here we can see that yeah all of these hairs like small hairs are like kind of reflecting this light to us and that creates this kind of fulfilling look so that's also what I'm going to do here so if you go to frame now put this into the FAQ and now it works with the index of refraction and you can see that now only at certain amount of like an angle we will get these wire failures you can put this even up let's put it at to to get a little bit more extreme but it already looks more and more soft I do not really like the fact that it's only white right I would like to cease failures of this particular texture that we have here to be a little bit brighter instead of it all just being mixed with white so how we're gonna do that I'm gonna add a mix RGB put this color into the color 1 and then this color is going to be all the way white and then we're gonna put this color into this color so now instead of it just being a white on top it will actually be a mix of white and this texture right now I would also like to add a translucent share oh not transparent and I'm gonna do the same as this one I'm gonna mix it so color goes into here this one is going to be all the way black though and the fat can go a bit up so point 9 something like that this color goes into the color of the translucent and we're gonna add the shader so use add shader instead of mixed shader and this is going to be added okay so there's our material and if we look at our cloth though we could add some extra detail I would like to add a solidify modifier here to make it look a little bit more thick and we can always add a subdivision surface right to make it a bit more smooth and yeah look more realistic let's say so now we kind of want to add a particle system we want to add hair you can see that it doesn't really do what we wanted to do the hair just go everywhere first thing that you can do is you can apply the skill and now I think it's time to apply some of our modifiers so our cloth is the first one but we kind of want to you know apply it then the solidify we can apply and I like to keep the subdivision surface on here and I think that will be fine so now we can go back to our particle properties and actually play around with these settings so I like to put it at advanced already and I want to think about the number so the number should be quite high because we shall want some you know some realistic amount of fabric on top of here so I would already think about around a million maybe 500,000 but we should first go to our viewport display and put this amount like this percentage lower what does this do well now we have a hundred percent so now the few ports will show a thousand of these hairs but you can remember you can imagine if it puts at a million that the million might be a little bit much for our computer to handle so if we actually put this at way low let's say 10 or even 5% now it will only show 5% of the number here inside of a few port when you render it it will show the normal number of course so if you now put this to a million so I add just three zeroes you can see that even now it looks already you know very very full so what you can do here is you can even put this lower if you would like to but if your computer can handle it then just play around with this hair length so point zero zero seven something like that would be way better for this amount of for this kind of towel I would say the particles that we have here these splines are very straight and it doesn't really look soft or anything like that so I would like to go to physics and play a little bit around with this brownian so maybe point zero zero one or two you can see that now we have a little bit of a curve to all of these splines right these hairs and this will yeah make it look very more soft and yeah that's kind of the once you can also put it at zero zero two the one thing that you got to keep in mind that brownian can also change some of the height so sometimes he also needs to change the hair length if you change the brownian as well another less thing we need to go here into the hair shape because how it's normally shaped it's like a normal hair and that would be a little bit thicker at the root and then it goes all the way to a very very thin which is even zero right at the tip and this doesn't really make sense for our towel because we want is just an even thickness so maybe put them both at point three so the diameter root and the tip at point three meter awesome so I think it's time for a test render if you click on zero go here into your view and go look at the view you can zoom a little bit in and start to render so f12 will render it of course and here we can see the end result and it looks okay I think this hairs a little bit too long and that yeah it has to do with the brownian right so you remember when I said I put the brownian a little bit up that's totally fine it creates some you know some randomness but then most of the time we also have to change the hair length to make the look a little bit more like what we want so I'm gonna put this a bit down and right now I would already be happy with you know the hairs right so our particle system and we've talked about different kinds of heights here for our towel and we can do this it's not really hard but it's kind of time-consuming but let's just get into it and what you want to do is you want to just go into your vertex groups go here into edit mode and create a furthest group and then rename it for a stripe stripe stripes whatever fits for you so here we want to assign which ones we want to have the stripes all right so I want to I'm just gonna hide these parts here these ones as well and then of course these here you can assign these Pharisees to this group so now if I deselect them and then click on select you are able to see that now we just select everything that we've just selected let's say so this kind of works the same for the next one that we're gonna make this is going to be let's just do it blue or short hair whatever what we want to do now is we want to select everything click on stripes and deselect it right so now only the parts which we want to have the shorter hair or the blue on top we can assign these vertices too so here we have stripes and we have blue awesome so now what you can essentially do is you can go into your particle properties and for this particle system that we have right here which are the stripes right so stripes we can go to vertex groups and actually assign the density and length here so this is stripes and also the length of these stripes now we want to duplicate this whole particle system so here and this should be blue right so first we're gonna click on plus here to also create a new particle system and one of these should be the stripes 0 so I want to stop one to be just the stripes and then this bottom ones I want to do the stripes 0 0 1 which I'm gonna rename to blue so now when we go back here into this vertex groups this density is actually going to be the blue right blue and blue so what you can also see is that these here are way more dense than this because these hairs hair are just all replaced and this is just a smaller you know part so what I want to do here is I want to make sure this number is a little bit lower so I'm gonna do three hundred thousands instead of a million and this will for sure also help us with you know our memory for a computer this hair length of this blue one right needs to be lower so I'm gonna put it at maybe zero zero two or three and yeah so now we have the short one and the long one the only problem that we have is that the material is still the same and I would like it to be totally blue it's very simple you can just duplicate this material here the total stripes and then I rename this to Tahoe blue go into your material properties and actually create a new material here the first one is going to be the towel stripes and the second one is going to be towel blue now of course the towel blue is still the same material because we didn't change anything here and it's actually super simple to change so I'm just gonna do RGB and I want to color pick just blue color here now instead of this image here I'm gonna put the RGB into all of these colors core color and this one so now we can see that this materials changed and we need to apply it to these FedEx groups right so if we go into our edit mode you can see that you can assign a certain material so if we just select the blue click on select go back to our material and assign it to the towel blue here you can see that they have a nice and blue material there is one thing though that it's not changed and that is the hairs on top so I forgot the edit mode you can see that this is still the same this has nothing to do with this material here this actually has to do with the particle system so if you go to the blue particle system you can go in to render and change the material towel stripes to towel blue and now everything should be fine make sure you also save this of course and one tip if you're a little bit you know more advanced what you want to do is you want kind of want to hide all the hairs here underneath you can of course also do this with the fur decks groups right so if you have a certain amount of Furth like so if you have this vertex group here select you can kind of deselect all this bottom part because those are you know hairs that you're not gonna see and they're just being rendered which is a lot and I didn't really want to say that to everyone that's already you know has quit right now because most of the time those are beginners that just want to do a tutorial and just to learn and it's totally fine but if you're a little bit further you want to think about these kinds of things because having not to render this will really help you in also bigger scenes and all of that so yeah just try to hide all the ones that you cannot see and this should essentially be it the only last thing that I did is I did not really like this lamp so I put this to a Sun also use notes and I wanted to create some extra shadows right because we have some of these you know folds and bumps in here and I wanted to accentuate that with the lighting that we have so I think I put the lining somewhere here it's the Sun so I put it with orange you know a nice of warm color put strength bit up and then of course I also used a environment texture so if you go to world and look for environment texture color goes into the color open you can open this one also you can get this at the download file or you can go to h0 Haven for your own one click on open and then I put this I think a bit lower so point three something like that now you can always move this one a little backwards and start to render your scene I hope you guys learn from this and I'll see you guys in the next one", "fQPFGtIzRqQ": "This is the cool towel, I really like it. This is yours? Can I have it? I'm just going to take it. I just want to take it. This dude on a towel. Do you think I can get the towel? What's up, buddy, can I have that? What?

Yeah, sorry about that. We were just doing some funny videos.", "Uqvdv_RWlbk": "do-do-do-do-do blonde ah hey guys how you doing as you can see today I'm inspired by the summer yes it may be cloudy outside it may be raining but I'm going on holiday soon and today's craft is inspired by summer glorious holidays whoo yes many of you know the kids were breaking up for school soon and it's summer season and even though we've got a big fingers crossed that there's still going to be some hot weather in England many of you will be going on holiday now going on holiday you need to get everything ready like you need to get all of suncream and your bikinis everything like that but there are a few things that you can actually make for your holiday which are really really helpful and look really cool too so today's DIY is inspired by the summer holiday and we're going to be making a towel tote bag now this isn't just any towel it actually has a pillow in it now I don't know about you but when you're lying on the sand sometimes I automatically always put like my bag under my head onto the towel or something like piece of clothing just to prop myself up a bit because I find lying flat completely on the sand really uncomfortable and also just sound getting everywhere everything at that so this DIY is great because actually is a pillow connected to the towel so it props your head up and also it then rolls up into a tote bag so you can keep everything in a little pocket it's absolutely fantastic really beautiful and it's really easy to make I know a lot of people seeing this will be actually quite daunted by it you have to use a sewing machine but it literally is a few straight stitch it's a few straight stitches and that's it if you've used a basic sewing machine at school I know we did it in your nine in textiles or in other thing like that they literally just taught you to put two pieces of material plunk the thing down on the sewing machine and sew straight and that is it so without further ado let's get our sunnies on and get beach ready with this lovely DIY pillow towel tote bag what a mouthful for this DIY you're going to need some pins and a square of matching fabric for a pocket on the front full strips of fabric which are about 40 centimeters long each two summer inspired towels some toy stuffing or a pillow scissors thread ana needle a sewing machine and optional a hot glue gun so first we're going to make the pillow take one towel fold it over in half then over again and this will then make a perfect size for a pillow now for this step you're going to cut away the excess fabric you don't want too much fabric you want to cut the middle two layers away so just left with the outside layers just dispose of the excess fabric in the middle for this next step we need to pin each side now using the sewing machine sew a straight line each side where the pins are one stone you can now fill the middle of your pillow with toy stuffing a pillow or anything soft that you would like to lay your head on once it is filled enough you can now pin the opening shut using the sewing machine now sew along a pinned line now your pillow is comfy and complete for this next section you're going to attach the pillow on to the other towel so match up the length make sure it fits completely and pin along the line now using a needle and thread sew along that line now this is where the fun part starts so roll the towel up and now you're going to velcro the two ends together so my advice is to roll the tip of it over the towel just so it's still on the rough slider not on the nice side and pin the velcro in place now this next bit is completely optional you can either use a sewing machine you can also sew these on or you can use hot glue gun for this video I used a hot glue gun just because I was against the time now add the opposite side of the velcro to the pillow now you can sit them together and make sure they line up now we're going to make the handle so take two of your pre-cut strips and you want to lay them on top of each other nice side in now pin down the sides so they're completely put together now with the sewing machine go along the top and down two sides but make sure you leave the bottom section completely open repeat these steps for the second handle and now you can turn your handles inside out now for this section I'm actually going to show you how the bag is formed so what you want to do is lay it on its side put your arm in the middle then fold it over and twist it round and then that is how your bag is formed and for the last step you need to pimp your handles onto each side of the bag and also pin on your little pocket and there you have it you have a lovely tote bag which turns into a very comfy towel Oh", "HItfMVEALwA": "hi I'm Ashley the monogram mom preneur and we're starting a new series here on my channel embroidering and monogram we all think summer so in today's video it's going to be two parts today's video will be all about embroidering and monogram or name onto a beach town and then in next week's video I'm going to show you how to do an applicative monogram and an application name on the beach towel so stay tuned for this two-part series in our summer embroidery tutorials so today I am just using some beach towels I got from Walmart you can see they had so many great colors and I think they had a pink one and royal blue but we already had those colors so I just got all these great colors in our Walmart they were 488 and you can purchase these online they come in a 2-pack and they're around the same price so I'll link in the description box below all these towels again they had some more colors but these were only 488 and we have gotten these towels before and they're just wonderful they last forever these towels are great chip Porter and monogram applique on and they really could be a great seller in your shop this is our beach season so what we'll need to get started with embroidered on the towel is obviously our towels and again these are from Walmart and I'm sure target wholesale Boutique has them as well but this price point is pretty amazing for the quality of these towels and I think they're versatile for boys and girls you can choose a hoop or a frame I'm gonna use some bigger hoops today just because I'm doing large monograms names appliqu\u00e9d I grow baby but what undersized monogrammed unis use the appropriate I'm gonna be using sticky tearaway and some sort of tearaway as maybe secondary stabilizer I wouldn't recommend using a cutaway tearaway is plenty for these towels and the other thing you're gonna need is something called a water soluble stabilizer I use it all the time when AG you something fluffy or when I do towels or Sherpas or anything fleecy that has a nap always use a water soluble stabilizer and I'll show you how to use that during the tutorial if you're ready to get started give me a thumbs up and make sure you hit subscribe and let's get started on this tutorial okay to get started on monogramming or personalized inner beach towel what we're gonna do is ready get our beach towel prepped and ready so I just folded it in half and found the Center where I wanted to mark it and I use my water-soluble purple marker and I just do the tiniest little dot I don't even know if you can see it right here and it's about 6 and 1/2 inches up from the bottom of the towel use your judgment of how you like to do it but I like to do mine a little not too close to the bottom and give it a little space in between and then I've prepped my first by this is I believe the 14 by 7 pass away my link in the description below and with my sticky stabilizer and I just drew a little centering mark with my marker just to give me a point of reference for when I put the beach towel on my brain alright so I've got my frame my bath frame I've got it where I want to put it so I'm going to take the towel and find the thinner point and I'm just going to kind of line it up to where that point will be the center okay so I'll put it so that this point is in the center I can feel my knots right there and there's a notch here you can kind of feel and then I'll just take my little wonder clips you don't technically need it but just to give it a little extra support I'm just gonna do both sides and maybe one on the bottom all right we're ready to embroider so we're gonna put this side facing the bottom and we're gonna reverse it on our machine let me show you okay as you can see I've loaded my thought I got my color that I want and you can see it's right side up but I hoped my object upside down so I need to rotate so I'm gonna go to rotate it so now it's upside down just like this and I'm gonna put this on and you know just kind of drape that over make sure it's nice and stuck okay so I've got it flipped and got the beach out already I'm gonna take my water-soluble stabilizer and mine comes a little free cup sheets so I just do two sheets and I'm gonna place it over and I just use my loop it's a kind of grip it and we're ready to get started okay sorry just centered it and I'm gonna treat it just because I'm using fast frames you don't want to do [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] alright let's get started today you have the name personalized on the beach towel so what we're gonna do is we're just gonna gently tear off this water-soluble stabilizer you can just use your finger and kind of embed we're gonna you will get off any little extra pieces alright so there we have our personalized beach towel again I just use sticky stabilizer on the back if you have a rough thin towel or a super dense like logo or monogram that were philsed at you might want to use the secondary um tearaway just underneath kind of float it underneath but these are so cute and such a cute personalized gift and a great thing to have in your shop over the summer so now I'm just gonna monogram this one and we'll do that one super fast another little trick of the trade I like to do is I like to reuse my stabilizer you don't need to do a whole new sheet you can just patch it and that helps cut down on cost so if you're not going to use 12 inches you're like six inches stabilizer that's a cop saving I'm gonna patch it nice little patch job [Music] more subtle monogram on this one and we're just gonna rip off the sea water soluable and if you don't like the purple dot it will erase after 72 hours another cool trick if you can put a piece of transparent tape on the spot that you in a mark and then you just rip the piece of tape off so that's a pretty cool um trick as well but there is the finished product the monogram is nice and it's like stuck and you need the NAP of these so there we have how to monogram and embroider a name or a monogram on the towel it's super easy in they're such good sellers in this summer said that was part one and make sure you hit subscribe and hit

love this beach towel so very much so this is a limited edition and as you can see it comes in a little mesh bag that you can cinch which is perfect so this is handy to keep your I love I would say that it is an oversize to town so I'm gonna show you up close what the material is like it's a very smooth suede and it's a very thin thin material with some stitching on the edges how big is that is I can wrap myself up if I'm cold and this is going to protect me really well the benefit of a beach towel made with a suede weave microfiber is that it's not only going to be ultra absorbent also going to dry quickly and the reason why you would want this suede microfiber is because it is not going to hold on to it and that's the best part you pick it and you shake it off and you pick it up and shake it off at the beach you're not gonna have it covered in sand it's not going to just fill the sand right so then you fold it back up and think you put it back in your fish carrying bag and then it's ready for the beach the next time you want to grab this for yourself it is luxurious and worth every penny I'm so so glad I bought one of these for myself last summer when they had them

today we are shooting in Studio B at HGTV headquarters hello hello behind the scenes camera guys I'm so excited about some of the changes we have coming to the channel over the summer we're gonna see some new faces some new projects we are basically gonna set you guys up to and make your whole life oh yeah it's all happening so get excited so guys it's finally summer and if you've been following along on our little channel you know I am unapologetically a summer person I'm here for the pool the beach the hot weather and so when I started seeing these extra large round Beach blankets starting to pop up on retailers I really wanted one but let me tell you I did not want to pay over $100 for one so today I'm gonna show you how to turn this fifteen dollar tropical shower curtain into the oversized beach blanket of your dreams or maybe of my dreams but somebody's dreams at least I mean are we loving this print or what let's get started start by folding your shower curtain into quarters [Music] shower curtains can be kind of slippery material so we're going to use some clothes pins to keep your seams nice and straight next grab an iron can iron these outer folded seams and again this is just going to make sure everything is nice and straight when we start cutting our circle now with the average shower curtain you can make a 66 inch circle so your radius is 33 inches so from your center point where all your folds meet we're going to measure 33 inches and draw in an arc across our folded shower curtain [Music] once you plot out your first row of dots go back and start filling them in so now it's time to grab a pair of scissors and cut along the dotted line [Music] all right now for the moment of truth check my math which was never my strongest subject and to quote my friend Meg we have a perfect huge circle to form the base of our Beach Blanket I think all we need to do is add some pom-pom trim and this bad boy is finished in Iraq all right pom-pom trim you can get this at fabric and craft stores and we saved a lot of money with our $15 shower curtain pom-pom trim can be a little pricier but here is the key use those coupons guys all craft stores have coupons that you can download on your phone you don't even have to carry around the paper with you so if you use a coupon you can usually get this pom-pom trim for about 50% off and it really makes the blanket look so high-end and professional and adorable so let's glue this up okay so we're going to work in about 1 foot sections using a quick dry fabric glue and if you want to make sure it stays in place while you move you can grab a couple of pens we're just going to do that around the entire edge [Music] when you get to the end just neatly glue that seam down okay once you have the glue all complete you're gonna want to let this dry for an hour or two and most fabric glues say you need to wait at least 24 hours before washing well guys everything is all dry and I don't know about you but I love this project $15 shower curtain some pom-pom trim you know you would be ready for like Coachella if you were the kind of person that went to Coachella I mean I'm not but maybe you are personally I'm gonna take this to the beach with my kids here in a few weeks it's the perfect like lightweight material that will dry really easily and sand won't stick to gonna hear from you guys

six and four first quarter and we don't see many horsemen full quarters like that but to take us right through it here when I left that there was lots of horses leaving the outside reading more than I expected I was hoping someone would find a spot back behind a new Campbell he's number three down along the rail and John does what he has to do he always does it makes it kind of tough on him I was lucky to be able to get right back out here which if I hadn't been here I wouldn't let Don go so quick if I wasn't you know I was worried about getting out so it was able right here come back to the front and then after that everything was really in our favor especially with local salt being parked this is indeed the winning move past in the pocket and never you know we saw a group of horses come out of at the three corners but he really was well in hand I think he's better tonight maybe we've done all year I think so too let's see that two million dollar smile there you go let's bring in Sarah", "sxDlKdQk1Ww": "hello today I'm excited to share with you the beach poncho that my mom and I made a few months okay so I've been avoiding other thing that just is we recorded hours of footage both on the camcorder and my camera and I had a lot of matching up to do and getting it ready to release and but I finally go on to that and finished it today so I'm excited to share it with you now it's all edited so basically what happened is I got two large towers on sale about the supermarkets and I knew that my mom wanted a beach towel poncho to put on after I'm going to the beach so I thought this would be the perfect opportunity to try it out I don't have many fabric shops near me so it's quite handy to use towels it's large enough so this was a brilliant opportunity to have the correct fabric for the project so yeah basically what will happen is Oh guide you through what we did so I've sped up all the footage because obviously it took us a few hours to make it so I've tied much the footage but I've done a voice over so you know what's going on and I'll try and add some graphics as well just you have an idea of what I'm doing in case it's not there but we're really happy with the end result so we'll put some pictures up at the end and I hope you enjoy it [Music] so we roughly worked out how long we needed the main body piece to be so these towels are a hundred by a hundred and fifty centimeters say the width is a hundred centimeters the length is 150 we decided that it needed to be just over a square we make the main body length a hundred and five centimetres which meant we cut off 45 centimetres so we laid it out on the table and cut off that amount obviously we kept the that we cut off as well just because we'd use that later on for the hood so as you can see I'm using the fiscals a bit like a fabric guillotine and but it didn't work very well with the toweling fabric so we ended up going to dress making scissors in the end anyway and because we were using striped towels we needed to ensure that the stripes well we kind of decided whether we wanted the stripes to match or not and you do need to think about the knife as well with toweling fabric but it was either going towards one side or we decided that it didn't matter enough and the stripes not matching on the shoulder seam would be more annoying so anyway so we cut the second towel this exactly the same way so they're both now the body pieces are 100 105 so just to check that that fits it okay we pinned down the sides so they'll be the future side seams and then we put quilting clips for the shoulder seams leaving an opening for the neck so this is a beach cover-ups that we were making for my mom so she you can see there she's tried this on and we're just looking at how the neckline should work so we decided that it just needed to be around the collarbone so there's me doing a fabric mark just where we think it should be cut okay so then we fast around an awful lot about the hood and basically I've fast forwarded this really quick we spent ages having a look just judging it by eye pinning it's trying to make a luxurious looking hood really catastrophic leave failing so in the end so yeah we we kept pinning it and yet in the end we decided that it was best copy off simple hits from something we had at home so what we had at home was a nice hoodie of mine okay so what we did was as you can see yeah it's made out of two pieces this hood so it was a really nice one to trace so we got some scrap paper to use and place the hood on top of that and then we drew around the hoods marking all the edges as you can see we did add a seam allowance to the back of the hoods and the front and we hadn't added one to the base so that's what we did that I'm but after measuring it up with the what was on and the opening of the beach dress the neck opening we actually had to add three centimetres just cause it didn't completely match up with the hood would chosen right so you're happy with the template that we've created we then cut out there - hood pieces so we folded it over here we did actually in the ends cut it out again because we didn't pay attention to the stripes so once we'd cut out the two hood pieces there I am using the overlocker and I'm overlooking the curved back seam of the hood [Music] right so we're happy with the hood though that's fill in the background just looking round wondering what's going on we've also nicked his chair though which is why he's kneeling see how we're happy with the hoods so the next thing we decided to do was work out exactly where the hood would gaze [Music] here I'm overlooking the shoulder seams so I'm going from the end of the neck opening to where the armhole openings are and then I repeated it with the other shoulder seam as well [Music] okay so with that done we then went about to attach the hood sooo what we did at the front was we did cut down to where I marked the collarbone so we've got a nice opening there so yeah then we just lined it up in the center and pinned it all the way around [Music] once we pinned it we then tacked it into place and just because the towering fabric does move about quite a lot and so it is quite challenging to work with and it is really thick even on the overlocker which is fairly adaptable to most stuff it was struggling a little bit [Music] so before we attach the hood we did check it on on a do another fitting just to double-check just because it would be a write nightmare to you UMP XA we thought better safe we will say double checks um how the armholes would be [Music] oh you could have a oh say that was the moment we realized that the perfect pocket for it would be a kangaroo pouch pocket so here we are just roughly working out where we want it to go on the beach dress so here I'm just taking some measurements so we've pinned it where my mum thinks it would hang best and I'm scribbling some rough measurements I think we ended up tweaking this as we drive out but just to give us a rough idea of how we were going to do it right with the rough idea of the measurements we then drew out the kangaroo pouch to scale as you can see we were adjusting as we went along we decided that the original measurements weren't narrow enough at the top so we ended up increasing the lower there the base of the pocket and shortening the top edge just to give it more of I guess an angle for the pockets yeah we ended up drawing out in a different pen just so we knew which was the correct line to cut on right so next we cut out the patch pockets [Music] and Here I am overlooking all the edges just so it won't fray I didn't think we bothered with the top one because it was one of the original ends of the towel so now here I am just marking up some prep folding in the seam allowance as its patch pockets say that we don't have any raw edges edges on the outside [Music] and then there's my mom she's just tacking so she's just tacking they pressed and they folded in the edge that we've just created again just so it doesn't move while we're trying to stitch it on to the main piece [Music] with that tact we then went about guessing it's positioned onto the front of the tile cover up so here I am just pinning it all the way around so that we've got it there before you attach it to the front piece you do need to stitch where the pockets open so the two diagonal lines so you just need to do a straight stitch on this I did actually forget to do this so we ended up hand stitching it which I wouldn't recommend I just do it on the machine if you don't forget so once I'd pinned it onto the front piece I then tacked him to position again like I say it I just didn't want to moving around too much and I felt it was a lot safer to spend the time tacking right with it all tacked in place I then used the sewing machine to stitch the top side and the lower side into position as well as the two vertical lines on the sides of the pockets just before the diagonal lines with em which are where their hands go into the pockets [Music] with that in place I then pin the sides together we left a little gap at the bottom and you're using the pin ma pin markers that we've done we then added we ensured that we didn't stitch over the armhole all right so with the side stitched out the final thing we had to do was add bias binding to the front opening where we just cut down to the collarbone we didn't have to do it on the hood if he did cut your heads on a raw edge I'd recommend putting vais binding all the way around the hood as well as the neck opening but as we'd only done it on that lower section and the bit I guess from the neck to the collarbone we just had to do it on that v-shaped bit there again so I hope you enjoyed the footage of the beach towel poncho being made so we have a lot of fun creating it as you notice we have to think about it as we made it up but obviously if you did follow these instructions you could probably make it in a much shorter time with the tumbling fabric you do need to be careful just cuz it's quite thick so if you've got a basic machine you might struggle and that's you either walking first and yeah I found that tucking really helped me get through it and it did struggle on the overlocker events so you just need to make sure that's you know you're feeding the two layers of fabric together and appropriately so yeah we took a couple of photos of mum wearing it more recently and visits the summer at the moment in the UK so we managed to snap a shot of her wearing the beach poncho on the beach which was lovely and that we do obviously have some pictures we took when we first finished making it as well so we're really happy with the result it's a nice comfy it's it's quite a universal size as well so I'm you know I tried it on I'm a slightly different shape and size and I found it really comfortable as well I think the reference if you're making it the different sizes you might want to consider shortening it a bit more if there's someone who's really petits or you might want to move to be the pocket piece a bit higher or lower depending on that person's body length but that's probably the main adjustment I'd recommend to make every still keeps the neck opening pretty much the same and the Middlebury work for most people another thing to consider is the weight of the towels or the thickness of the towels that you're using we used quite a substantial towels so although it's nice and cozy at absorbents if it was a really hot day it might get a bit too hot after a while I think of the opponent the beach income although you're quite chilled off to that soon it probably won't be a problem down here but possibly you know if you were going elsewhere it might be a bit too warm for you it's also obviously it takes up more room if it's a thicker fabric so you know if you were packing it for your holidays you might struggle to get it in your suitcase and always take the weight so you know it's an extra weight on your shoulders so to speak so yeah I hope you enjoyed that I'm considering I'm adapting the past 10 pieces that I did make the forest and roasting it up into and easier to follow pattern so let me know if you're interested in that and if that's it then I want thanks for watching", "2YAZLp0dmZA": "everybody how we

Kimberly Pratt for ten news first", "zlRa0OfoDbQ": "hammers back with a new we try a segment and this time she has a couple of items that will make your trip to the beach or pool more enjoyable by keeping your belongings safe and you sand free take a look yeah hey I am here out on at my son ports trying to bring out the sunshine today it's a little bit cloudy but the sunshine got me thinking of everything I wanted to show you all this morning because we're talking about what they call the perfect beach towel I was a little skeptical and I thought what is what makes this the perfect beach towel well it's from tessellate it's compact absorbent and fast drying and here they are and you're wondering okay what's so special this is a sand free beach towel sand free beach towel I didn't know what that meant I thought wait a minute it doesn't hold sand no it doesn't it said it is made with what's called absorb a light fabric so the sand doesn't stick to the towel how cool is that this is nice it's really lightweight it's very thin if you can tell it has one design on the front one design on the back which I really like because it makes you feel like you're getting two towels and one there's also this floral almost Hawaiian print to and if oh yeah this one has ah this one has another one on the back as well I just like that pick which one you like depending on the mood but sand free I feel like how many times do you go to the beach if you can go to the beach here hopefully soon to where you kind of fling the towel right and it just gets sand everywhere no more with these it says it's available and single and double sizes and then 40 different designs to choose from so I'm thinking if you know somebody who does love the beach or the beach goer this would be a really great gift for them so 40 different designs single and double sizes at tessellate that's tes a late la te com okay let's talk flex ache this is flex safe by aqua Vall and I can't tell you how many times that I am out jogging with the kids in a stroller or perhaps you're biking or maybe you are also at the beach or the pool and you're wondering where do you put your valuables but then where do you put them to where you feel okay with leaving them to where they're not going to get stolen so this says never worry about your stuff being stolen again you can put your your phones your wallet I'd say pretty much any other valuables that you have in this its splash resistant water resistant and it has an RFID blocking layer they say so inside thieves can scan rather your credit cards so that's cool and it has a three-digit resettable combination lock so you can make sure that that is taken care of as well portable safe anti-theft looks like it has a zipper here so you can put stuff inside and then it has these pouches on the side as well I like black too that always works for a lot of different people flex safe the Aqua vault calm aren't you guys some pretty simple products but sometimes I think simple can make all the difference of course in our everyday lives as well so all the information will be on Indy style TV thanks so much for watching and I'll see you back here next time", "zBauv3n_21o": "I've always loved the shibori style of indigo dyeing and I wanted to try my hand at it I chose this indigo kit because it's all-natural and extremely colorfast an important choice when doing something like a beach towel that will be wet against your skin after adding the ingredients to the water it's important to mix it very slowly as to not add oxygen to the dye which will activate it prematurely once you're done mixing set the bucket aside and let the dye settle for at least an hour for the larger towel I chose to do a circular repetitive pattern this is achieved by gathering small sections of the towel and binding them using rubber bands string or zip ties this keeps the dye from penetrating the areas that are bound for the smaller thinner towel I wanted to try a classic shibori folding and board binding technique the crisp edges of the board help create a more geometric pattern less organic than the first towel before you start dyeing it's important to remove what is called the flower of the dye and thoroughly wet your fabric you want to give it a good squeeze before you dip it in to remove as much oxygen as possible slowly lower it into the dye and gently agitate it for 2 to 6 minutes you'll notice when you take your pieces out of the dye that they're a yellow-green color and that's because indigo doesn't turn blue until it's introduced to oxygen set your pieces aside and they'll take about 20 minutes to fully oxidized if you like your piece to be a darker blue after the 20 minutes repeat the dyeing process or if you're like me and discover that the dye didn't make it to the center of your bundle like you thought it would don't be afraid to read diet once you remove the bindings rinse the piece to remove excess dye unfurl the fabric and then wash it in warm water with a mild soap once you've thoroughly hand washed the pieces and they have air dried wash them in your washing machine with dark colors and dry them twice before taking them to the beach", "wvHMxXF9jdw": "(upbeat music) - Today, we've seen\nall the posts out there and we're kind of curious as well how people are doing\nheat transfer on towels. And it's something that we wanted to try, so we're gonna do that today. Come over here, I've\nalready tried a little bit on this towel. And we've got 100% cotton towels, and this one we've just used\nour EasyWeed, the coral. And added the flower over here. So you wanted to see how it works. I tried another one, 'cause these towels, these bright towels at Walmart for three dollars, great buy. They work as well, you just have to be mindful that you're gonna get the texture of the towel underneath, but they do work as well. You can do the heat transfer\non them, make fun designs. This one, he loves sharks, so he wanted to put sharks on his towel. So let's come over here and try one. I'm gonna do another flower on this towel up on the other corner. Got it all ready. And just lay my flower on there. Just do the standard, I'm\njust gonna do 10 seconds 'cause we're gonna do another layer. (clanks) And we'll wait for that. Almost there. (beeping) Okay. (clanks) And go ahead and peel this one off. Now the second layer, I'm only\ndoing one additional layer. What I did is peel the\nglitter off of the other sheet and just put it with this one. So I just have to do it one time. So when you line that one up. (audience member speaks off microphone) Yeah, if you're gonna peel it like this, this was the little piece, I wouldn't recommend it for other ones, but a little piece like this one, go ahead and peel it and you can lay it on there by itself if you don't want to do it three more\ntimes or two more times. And that piece, it won't move much. It's not gonna stretch like the EasyWeed, so I wouldn't recommend\npeeling the EasyWeed off the carrier sheet\nbefore you iron it on, but the glitter, it'll hold up to it. And this one, since I've\ngot exposed EasyWeed, I'm gonna put the carrier sheet on, and then do it for another 10 seconds. We'll see how it works after that. (beeping) (clanks) There we go. So there's a fun way to\npersonalize beach towels this summer as you're heading out for your family vacations. Headin' out to the pool. Whatever you're doing. Right there, just a fun, easy thing. (audience member speaks off microphone) No, we've seen lots of people try it. Yeah. The question was, does the HTV come off in the washer and dryer? And no, it doesn't. As long as you've got\nit set there the way, the time that you should, and this is 100% cotton,\nit won't come off. It'll stay there just\nlike it does on a T-shirt. You do have to be careful,\nlike I said on this one, where it's got the loops and stuff, it may look like it, but\nas long as it's adhered on there it should be great. So, couple ideas you can\nuse with heat transfer on your towels, get it ready for summer. Summer vacations,\neverything you've got going. So let us know if you've\ngot any questions, share this with your friends, and we'll continue to make more. Have a good day, guys.

this as quickly as possible as you can tell there is no title of this video this is a subscriber 6 haul so there are couple of things that I needed and they obviously wanted I also want to protect the quality as I always do I always like to offer the best quality possible on the market to my customers and people who like my art so I just decided to check things out and and yeah if you want to check out my said sixth or it's down in the description it took about two weeks to receive the order which I thought it's really fast consider you coming from the US they have to print it package it and then ship it to me so I thought that's really really good they provide you with a tracking so you can track where the order is and yes I did have to pay a custom juicy or whatever is called the fee but I didn't really mind because I got twenty five percent discount plus the British shipping they had something online so I thought we probably get the discount and it doesn't really matter if I pay disgusted judical do all mean that I kind of made the full price for the atom anyway let's get on with a whole so this is the packaging I'm not going to turn it around so you'll see higher direction the other side oh yeah but it might be practice at all so I am going to open it I'm actually quite excited as I'm going to see is like the quality really good or it is really bad because then I don't never know how your art will look on different things [Music] so as you can probably see which your client but I'll show you I order to beach towels and as if summer I would definitely need it this is actually another thing that I ordered but it's not here yet so I'll probably make a separate video on that but yes I or the two beef salad and the quality of this feels really really nice like the fabric is very very soft so I really like that and they seem to be big so oh my god I'm not going to be able to show you this whoa okay I will see if I can somehow insert the victor making this problem right hopefully you can see that so this is one of the trends that up artwork that I have ordered as you can see it's quite big which I'll like for the beach or for the picnics and stuff and seriously the quality or printing is amazing but I am really really impressed I hope you can see that I love it I actually love it so that's one and I will just show you another what while I'm here hello and so this is the second one I ordered obviously it's also my artwork I'm just amazing so as you can see it's really really good I'm hoping it will see everything I'm kind of really trying but amazing amazing pretty qualitative services like I am really really impressed like look at this butterfly that is amazing so guys if you have been thinking about buying the beach towels from the

because the bigger your beach towel the more comfortable Kennedy anyway [Music] now take it over to your sewing machine and use a standard straight stitch to just sew you're trimming into place now to finish it off you're going to take the insane the ugly raw edge of the terry cloth underneath you're trimming and pin that down be really careful with your pins here because you're not working with a

this big heavy bag with a towel in it everywhere I go so I thought I'd show you a much quicker and less bulkier way to prep for the pool get ready as I show you how to make your own towel tote let's do it girl okay so in order to make your own towel tote you're going to need one beach or bath towel and one hand towel whose length matches the width of your full-sized towel in order to keep things simple I'll be calling this the big towel and then this the small towel for the rest of the tutorial you'll also need a needle and thread scissors and elastic band technically you can use any fabric here but I think using elastic band works best for this tutorial alright let's don't on the tote step one the first step is to create your elastic band handles measure the elastic band around your shoulder so that you know it will fit comfortably as a handle once you carry your tote if you want to follow along with me my band ended up being about two feet long snip off another piece of band the same length so that you have to equal strips step two the next step is to sew your handled onto your towels lay your big towel facedown on your workstation create a semicircle with one of your elastic band strips and then place it right in the middle of the short side of your big towel making sure that the band overlaps the towel a few inches on each end using your needle and thread sew each end of your elastic band to your towel and now you've got the first handle of your toes to create the second handle line up your small towel face down over your big towel position your second elastic band so that it matches perfectly with the placement of the first band keeping it completely centered on the long side of the small towel then sew in both ends of this band as well locking it into place and there you go you're now ready to take your towels to the beach just kidding this looks ridiculous and also just takes a hand towel to the beach step 3 now's the time to sew together the sides of your towels place both of your towels facedown on top of one another with the small towel on top make sure that they're lined up evenly at the handles and then sew down one short side of your small towel so that it connects to the long side of your big towel repeat for the small towels other short side I worked my needle and thread down the original sewing lines of my small towel in order to make it look like I bought my finished tote that way once the small towel sides have been connected all that's left to do is sew the center of both towels together stitch together the bottom long side of your small towel to the middle of your big towel leaving the side with your handles but you've now got yourself a big towel pocket step four the final step is to flip your connected towels inside out and tuck the rest of your big towel into your newly formed pocket and there you go your towel tote is complete when you get to the pool or Beach all you need is to flip it inside out once more in order to roll out your towel plus you've got a convenient pocket to hide your phone from the Sun or stash your snacks then once you've called it a day flip your towel inside out into a tote take it home and hand wash it before your next trip this towel tote took me less than an hour to make and it would take even less time if you had a sewing machine at your disposal so with any extra crafting time that you might have you could add on tiny pockets or decorative patches or something along those lines either way you now have a tote that is totally awesome how did your towel tote turn out tweet me at

calm", "PCwZuUxJsXs": "Welcome to SewVeryEasy, my name is Laura. Let's take a beach towel and turn it into a beach bag. It is a very quick project. The seams are already finished on the towel so this project will go together very quickly. Of course, the first thing we're going to need is the beach towel. After that, some thread and the needle. You need to have an 80/12 or a 90/14. You need a little bit of a heavier needle to get through the terrycloth. And rope. The bag is going to be made by taking that towel and folding it in half. In the top where you have the two short sides we need to do a row of casing. That's where the rope is going to go through. Take the top of the towel and fold it down 1\u00bd\". That rope should be able to go through that 1\u00bd\". Now if you have a very thick rope you might need to make that casing a little bit bigger, but that 1\u00bd\" will hold quite a good size of rope. Measure down 1\u00bd\" and pin. Do that to both the short sides. Once you have that pinned over 1\u00bd\" you need to do a row of stitching. The row of stitching is going to go right along that edge. Put another one right along that edge at about \u00bc\". With that extra row of stitching it's going to help that rope be stronger in that casing. You do not stitch the ends closed. You're going to just come right to the edge, backstitch, and then start again so that you leave all of the sides open. The top two casings have been stitched. Now take this and match it so the right sides are touching. The towel os folded in half, the top edges are matching, the side edges are matching, and you have a fold at the bottom. You will need two pieces of the rope at 10\". Fold one in half, and where the loop is you're going to place it in the bottom of that fold. Place it so that you have a little bit hanging out and pin that in there. Take the other rope and do the same to the other side. Now you're gonna be able to make this into a bag by stitching this side seam. Do a \u00bd\" seam allowance. You don't use a very skinny seam allowance because it'll be stronger if you leave a little bit more space. So do a \u00bd\" seam all the way up. You're going stop right at the bottom where you folded that down, so it will be a flap like this at the top. When the two rope ends are in you can turn the bag rightside-out. What you're looking at right now is the folded end. It has two of these loops. The top has two ends that are open. Now you're going to be able to put rope into those holes. The rope size you're going to need is the side plus the top, times two. That's going to do one side. I have the side, the top, and now I'm going to double that. I'm going to need that amount for \ud835\ude30\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude26 side, and I need the same measurement for the second side\u2014plus a little bit extra so I can knot this together. We need to take that rope and thread it into the top. What you're going to do is come from one side, going in-between the layers of the first casing, go all the way, come out, and then come all the way back in to the other side. A good old-fashioned safety pin will work just fine. I'm going to start with the top piece and work that through, and you're going to come out the other side. Now you have one side done. Just continue by putting it into the hole that is right beside the one that you came out of. Feed that through all the way to the other side. So we have the rope all the way around making a circle, with the two loose ends coming out of the two separate sides. Take one end and place it into the loop. Then match up your two ends and tie the rope into a knot. What we have is a continuous loop that goes around at the top, down the side, and through the loop. It's all joined on one side. Take the next rope, which happens to be the same size, and start from the opposite end. You're going to place it in this end, come all the way around, and loop down. So you'll have two rows of rope in each casing. Once you have both ends out of the other side, you're going to take one end and put it through the loop. Match up the two ends of the rope and tie a knot. The big bag is now done. You have the rope that goes around the top, and it's attached to that little loop in the bottom. When you pull the top strings together it's going to gather it just like any other drawstring bag. You're going to be able to put lots of stuff in this bag. Now the two ropes are still attached to the bag, so you're able to use it like a knapsack. You're going to be able to carry it over your back or you can put both straps together and carry it over your shoulder. And when you're done you're going to be able to throw this in the wash to keep it clean. You can make this with any towel. It doesn't have to be a beach towel. The size of the towel you get will dictate the size of the bag. Thank you for joining me today on SewVeryEasy. Feel free to subscribe and, as always, come on back.

oh my gosh you know sometimes you're just not sure and i was really lucky and received this as a gift and it is just phenomenal and what's really cool about the slow type this is a beach blanket and look how cute the fringe is on the end they do a special weave pattern so sand doesn't get through like i took it to the beach and there wasn't like any sand coming up through the towel to shake it off like none of the sand gets stuck inside either it was so easy it was really amazing and this is such a great size you're able to get three people across this way and let's see if i can do this let's see if there's room for this whoa kind of you get the dress right three people across super cute fringe i love the pattern and they work with artists for all the different colors and patterns and styles and they are just beautifully done i know they search and find all the best factories and pay fair wages and make sure all their employees are happy which is i just find very important in a product that i want to invest in i would definitely get more and i also threw this in the wash and hung dry because when i was at the beach i ended up getting like wet and a little dirty we're like at a a lake so it's just kind of you know like a little muddy area between the water and the sand sometimes and it just cleaned up really perfect it is let me find the little tag with all the information oh okay 100 cotton made in china wash before use wash separately i did not do that a machine cold wash not sure yeah i did i was going with cold i mean dark clothes so cold wash gentle cycle do not bleach tumble dry low oh you can double dry on low i seriously just hung it dry and it it was dry so fast which is amazing and i'm sure that was part of what they were looking for the three guys who made this brand lester corporate jobs and i believe they spent a lot of time in california and hawaii i'm not sure where they're from exactly but they just wanted something better and they made it and so great like really go check out their website a ton of like fun stuff they're a little bit more expensive than what you would buy at target but i mean you're supporting someone's art this is amazing and it takes away a lot of the mess and you're not bringing half the beach home with you in the car or when you're trying to shake your towel off and you get the person next to you and get sand in their eyes that's not happening either and i love that you can fit three people across or you can totally cuddle up with it like around like a bonfire or just i feel like even a throw in your house especially if you have some beachy vibes or you want to bring some color in as well just it's just so cute i'm so so happy i got to try one of these out and i definitely feel like i would purchase more in the future so yeah that's my review on slow tide towels and someday maybe i'll get one of their blankets i think that'd be a lot of fun too yeah so check them out i hope you guys are having a

were nice enough to send us two different styles we have a tropical theme with the bird on it and we also have the elephant theme they come in this nice nylon sack so you have somewhere to stick them when you're all done using them now we've put these through the test out in real life and today we're going to put them through the test and see what what they come up with with holding water as well as how are they sand free are they sent free or not we already know the answer to that but we're gonna do this that's just a little test to show you guys on camera first I'll show you I'm gonna move the bag here I'll show you that the towels have a loop on them so you can hang them and that's that loop is right in the middle it's a beautiful beautiful print on the towels that thin microfiber towels and they're printed on one side and the other side is printed with a geometric design they are quite large I am going to tell you that as a big guy this towel I'm six foot three and this towel will wrap it and I'm a big six foot three and this towel will wrap all the way around me for sure so what we're gonna do is we're gonna go ahead and show you the elephant towel real quick fold that one up and put it over here and we're gonna take the bag out of the way and the elephant print towel is just as nice it's got the nice purple edging all the way around it it's got this wonderful hook which we found to be very handy these wash up absolutely amazing there is no issues with washing these these about both and wash several times and as you can see they haven't moved lost any of their brilliance or their color so the first thing we're going to do is we're going to take this elephant towel which is nice and dry and we're going to do the sand test so Bonnie if you can hand me the sand and what we're going to do is this is supposed to be a sand free towel so we have some sand and we're going to I'm gonna put a lot you know what I'm gonna put it all on there and what we're gonna do is we're gonna spread this sand around and really rub it in good just like if we were sitting on the beach if I had this much sand on my towel at the beach boy oh boy so this is supposed to be sand free which means even with all the sand that's on there now I'm supposed to be able to just pick it up shake it off so I'm gonna do that and I'm gonna put it right back down on the table and we'll take a look one little shake and there you have it I mean the sand was damp I mean there's just a little tiny tiny tiny little bit of residual from the sand this is nothing like your towel would have been if you were if you were just trying to shake it off of a thick thick thick plush towel now the interesting part about this towel is even though it is so thin even though it's very thin feeling towel it is absorbent let me move this out of the way Bonnie if you can give me the green pocket I'm gonna wait that out of the way green bucket and then we're gonna take some water here and we're gonna use the other towel you guys fold that one up put it away we're gonna go ahead and use the tropical towel and what we're gonna do is I'm gonna take it and I'm actually gonna separate it out and ball it up and put it in there is that in the center of the shot there and what we have is I have a gallon of water and I'm gonna pour a gallon of water and we're gonna see how much of that gallon of water it absorbs I look for it a little bit little I want to spill too much of it because what we found is these are definitely amazing at absorbing water I'm gonna fill it all the way up here we're filling outside so apologize for any noise we have going down the road here so a mess so I'm gonna go ahead and take this and dump it a little bit ESS out so now you can see it is dripping however we did get a half of a gallon of water is dripping a little stone I'm gonna give it just a quick squeeze okay that's probably ten times heavier than it was before that's how much water absorbed you could just see the weight of that but the cool part that I found about system it holds the water very well so even if I ball it up and I sit here and I squeeze it it is just loaded and loaded and loaded with water I mean I could squeeze more water out of that even yet the cool part about it is now that it's soaked it is definitely still maintains its shape still super thin and this dries so quick in the Sun if you just hang it up by this hook here again it is really hot out so even even when we tried it out on days that were not as hot it's still dried super quick yeah we're gonna go ahead and end the session here doing the experimenting and we'll finish up in a little bit inside hey guys it's TFC the family's choice and we're back today we're here with Kevin and Bonnie and we've been reviewing the breezy Zen free beach towels you just saw the footage before of us doing the quote unquote scientific part of the review what I will tell you is they were nice enough to send us to different beach towels finding a hold of the backs excuse me for the two prints that they sent us now the reason they sent us two I'm gonna explain because it leads to a bigger a bigger happiness for me as a parent and as an adult we originally ordered the Land of Smiles which is the one with the elephants okay accidentally a sticker was placed over top of the print the tropical print and the one that was placed over top said Land of Smiles so when you look at the packaging coming to you it looked like the right towel when we opened it up we were surprised pleasantly by the vibrant color in the tropical towel however I did contact their customer service their customer service was super fast to respond sent us out the second towel that we did order without asking us to return the first towel which was amazing the other thing I will add with the breezy San free beach towel is it retails for $59 on their website go breezy calm it includes free two-day shipping in the u.s. they are shipping this from California bet that's where their company is I'm not sure if a ship out of California we're in New York I can tell you it was here in two days I mean it was fast it was super fast shipping we took these towels out we've used these towels multiple times at swimming pools with chlorine we've used them at beaches a few times we've checked them out to make sure the sand doesn't stick to them we've tested through how long it takes to drive one out and we've put these through several wash cycles in our washing machine and just to see how the color would hold up and to see how the workmanship and quality would hold up we're gonna go ahead and give you our review on them on a scale of one to ten we rate them on three things the first thing we rate them on is the look and when we say look we mean the packaging and the product itself so Kevin on a scale of one to ten with the breezy sand free beach towels from go breezy calm what is your rating a scale of one to ten you look at this it's like exactly like this one so I'm rated a like a nine and a half we do whole numbers so nine nine okay Bonnie what do you think for the look I think for the looks um because I was like I helped pick out this pattern and it looked more of like a grayish brown color on line and it's actually purple so I would read it like a nine because it's not the way it looks like so you think it was just slightly off on color but remember also on the website we're looking at it on our screen and colors on different screens can be can vary so it may be a correct representation of it on their end but on a user's end like us or somebody else that might be purchasing these that color might have been a little off I will say I agree but I mean it was a shade off it wasn't too horrible yeah mom's not with us today mom's not with us today but I already know that moms rating on this was definitely a ten for the looks she loved the way it looked and my rating also on this was a 10 for the looks I love the way it looked I love the way it's packaged I love that it comes with a with a matching bag to carry it in with a drawstring on it which is awesome makes it super easy for parents to say to the kids hey grab your towel and there's no confusion the bag matches the towel so I don't have arguing over whose towels whose the second thing we're gonna rate this on is the functionality of it it's a sand free beach towel made of microfiber Kevon 1 to 10 do you feel that this product acted and functioned as it is advertised to action to actually action the function so on or scale of 1 to 10 what do you think that that's a good 10 10 Bonnie my only complaint is that when we put this hand on this one our sand was a little damp but it did leave a little bit of like color bright but now like that might wash out so I kept it very good now keep in mind we did use for our experiment we used to play sand which is way different than sand you would find at the beach but it is what we had available here to test it out in a quote-unquote scientific study um as far as the product doing what it says it's supposed to do is it a sand free beach towel absolutely I give it a 10 I would give it an 11 if I could because I am one of the guys that lay on the beach and I sweat and I can't stand having a towel that's covered in sand especially if the kids are building sandcastles next to me I can't stand it when sand gets kicked onto the towel because then it sticks on to me this was super easy to pick up one quick flap and it was gone the sand was gone there was no sand caked in it and there's no sand ingrained in it some thicker towels was used the sand gets ingrained down inside the towel itself so I give it a 10 I know that mom gave it a 10 as well so it's got a perfect score and functionality it's a great functioning product that does exactly what it's supposed to do I love it mom loves it Bonnie loves that Kevin loves it and finally we're going to rate the value the value of the item let's face it guys it's a $59 towel now for a family 59 bucks is a lot of money to layout for a towel I can go to Walmart and get a beach towel for 12 to 15 dollars I can tell you there was 12 to 15 dollar towels that we've purchased before in the past nowhere near the the craftsmanship and quality that these towels are nowhere near the amount of absorbency that these towels have nowhere near the look and the in the style of the South I personally as a value for a $59 towel and I'm cheap I give it a 10 I would buy a go breezy beach towel in a minute because it is definitely worth the $59 I also know mom's opinion on that mom was hovering somewhere around 1/8 on this because mom felt like the $59 price tag was a little bit steep for a Sam free beach towel however I do know that if you watch on go Breezies web on go breezy calm on their website they often run sales and discounts so you can get a few bucks off so that might up the value even more Kevin what was your opinion on the value of the breezy stand free beach towel I would pay like 45 bucks for one so I graded like a seven eight seven Arnie okay and Bonnie what do you think I also read it around like a six or a seven only because Stan it's like it's cool not to have sand like sands annoying but is it worth $60 to not have same time yeah you don't think it's worth 60 summarize your now and that's fine verse out the sand but also like I said keep in mind we've bought cheaper towels and we've replaced sheera towels and it's my opinion I mean you guys are entitled to your own it's my opinion you would certainly go through quite a few of the cheaper version towels too before you got the quality of this and time will tell you know we'll do a follow-up video guys will do a follow-up video at the end of summer and and we'll let you know how these are going are they are they lasting are they you know doing what they're supposed to do for the whole summer did they fade or anything else just so you guys know I'll give a quick thing that came in with the towel is a little pamphlet materials and craftsmanship pamphlet that they sent him with the towel and it's got a picture inside it's got the little couple paragraphs about breezy and let's you know what they use breezy beach towels made from breezy fiber which is a trademarked breezy fiber fabric makes it breathable sand resistant and luxuriously gentle against the skin they utilize micro denier fibers which have the linear density of less than point nine denier per filament making the fibers even finer than silk which is approximately 1 denier so it's about 1/5 of a diameter of a human hair and because it has such stuff like properties including the drape to flow the look to feel the movement the softness and a luxurious it's just like silk guys I'm glad one so after further review I brought up their Instagram and one of the things we have pointed out in our scientific part was that it absorbed so much and that's actually one of the points oh ok good so on their Instagram can't really see that on the screen but on their Instagram they do point out that it absorbs so much I can tell you absorbs loss yeah one of the points is San free super absorbent and rapid dry I am 6 foot 3 and it will dry me completely from head to toe um guys we're so thankful to go breezy calm for sending us out these wonderful towels to try out and to give our review on we are glad that we found them we are super excited that we found a nice beach towel that not only looks good but functions good and you know overall I would say this product is definitely TFC approved it is worth it if your family's looking for a nice beach towel or even for that matter even a nice bathroom towel I mean you could use these for all sorts of things I I could even see people using these as yoga mats that's it also says you know definitely you use them for yoga mats go breezy thank you guys so much we want to thank you guys for

Dave I'm Kevin and I'm Bonnie I'm work TFC the family's choice and we'll catch you the next one [Music] [Music] [Music]", "PQ3WjTbgLZs": "[Music] today we're in San buck Studios in San Francisco our inspiration for this shot was a beautiful seaside beach shot doing our best to recreate that scene by the pool if we can do our best to get everyone to have a great time and feel easy and comfortable the shots will look great and we'll get plenty of options to use I am a writer and editor here at Pottery Barn and today I'm on set with a bunch of my co-workers doing a towels photo shoot it's been a lot of fun getting together with our co-workers and doing something that's a little bit outside of our comfort zone but also really fun a little bit silly these guys are great they're all part of the team a little bit of nerves from being on set really helps because that sort of excitement they're quick to smile they're quick to laugh and my dumb jokes the interesting thing about being on set when you're not used to it is that suddenly everybody's very hilarious so the laughter is very genuine I can't wait to see what the final photo looks like I'm mostly excited to show my parents because they love that I get to come out here and do this kind of stuff I'm really happy with the way it turned out needs to feel like that light is wrapping around them and I think we really really accomplished it [Music] [Applause]", "S-Jt1sxJ6lI": "alright I'm Kat and today I'm showing you how to make those miniature pool floats that actually look to start this project I use craft foam this is just a little block I picked up this is the same type of foam that you foam that you use for florals and make sure that you're getting the type of foam that actually resists when you touch it and you have to use a knife to cut into there is a foam that's also being sold in near in the floral section that pretty much melts when you touch it and you don't want to use that for glue I'm using e6000 and super glue you want to make sure that you're testing your glue on your foam also before using it because some super glues will melt directly through this foam and you'll have just a big slimy mess so I'm also using either my craft blade or a kitchen knife to cut with so to start off I decided to do the personal float first and I just cut in a small rectangle and kind of sketched in some little grooves that I cut into with my knife and then began for deep in with my ball tool and then you can turn your ball tool out of slant or an angle and deepen them a little bit more and also the by turning it on the slant you're kind of building a curved wall as opposed to a straight wall so it looks like they're little rounded tubes once finished I added a small headrest towards the top in which I did nothing to and I just glued that in place with my super glue and then for the ball you can use any shot glass or a cup or small cup or anything of that sort anything with a circular shape you can also buy a circular spherical round ball out of craft foam in the store but I forgot about that so I decided to make one and in order to make it I just drew sketched in trace then a lip of the glass on every single side of the block that I was using and you want to make it so that the edges of the circles meet and then once I have that in place I just started to cut off the excess by continuing the trace along the circular end I'll get that all the way around the block probably about three times before I was able to pop it off and then just begin to cut out all the corners anything outside of the lines just cut it off and then rest of its just standing you can use a nail file or emery board and just basically fanned in all the corners and round out anything that's lab and English sharp and then you have a nearly perfect circle nearly and then for the inner tube or doughnut just trace the inside of a of a cup and then you can use either a larger Cup or free handedly trace a circle on the outside a larger circle and then you want to use your knife and cut out a circle that's actually smaller than the circle you made in the middle it doesn't have to be exactly just approximate and then I just flaked out all the inside and then I reversed it and did the same thing on the other side until I had a hold it neck in the middle and then I cut off my excess we're using my kitchen knife and then I've used my exacto knife at an angle to round out the inside I'll reverse it and do the same thing on the other side once you've cut off the excess and then I just sanded the rest of it to look like an interview and then I'm using a plastic bag as a subsurface and then also a bit of final from a tablecloth this is the type of tablecloth we purchase in Walmart or a dollar store they're literally like a dollar each and they come in a variety of colors and so that's what I'm using as my final covering and this is the only project I use a actual white glue on and I regretted it so take my advice use the e6000 the white glue simply takes more than a day to dry so all the glue that I had in here stayed in here for about two days while I was waiting on this project to finish drying so that I can finish the rest of it and then because that green will continue to poke through your um your plastic just going ahead and paint whatever color you're going to cover it with so for this ball I'm going to make it white and blue so I'm covering it with white paint and now I'm wrapping white vinyl around it I just cut a rectangle of white vinyl and just roll the ball into it you can expect to use probably about two layers of vinyl for each of these items so you think that you do be prepared to do it twice and then I cut in little slits sort of like to fold it in and then using one pedal at a time I just folded it and glued it over and just altered it and glued it over etcetera etcetera I only did this one time on this particular ball because this is going to use a separate layer of blue and white petals on the outside and this is my petal I made a template using red and then I cut out for blue and for white and then I just spaced them evenly around the ball and then I went in with the white if it overlaps don't worry especially at the top I'm using this little white circle to cover everything and then I painted that white of your pop and then I went over and put another white circle on top so the blue would not peek through and here is the float that I painted covered with the plastic bag one layer of vinyl and paint and then putting on my final layer of vinyl and I'm just using a little East 6000 smoothing it in and then just continue on until you have the entire thing covered repeat on the other side we finish and then with the red inner tube I just decided to cut out a long strip of vinyl and to wrap it like a mummy what blocks were polymer clay just cutting a foot pattern and put three points out of little clay on there and then just attach your bones finally I put a little glue on each of the straps and then dip them into glitter lastly where's my beach towel and for this I'm using a baby washcloth these are the best sperm anytime you want to replicate terrycloth and miniature because it does have the fitted still terry cloth for this little tiny loops as you can see so it's very um it's the best way to replicate miniature and in my personal opinion and just the water test now please excuse the messiness of my desk but even when I drop the toys in there's no dropping in and they don't like float to the bottom they stay at the top and you can try the sink them and they still won't sink you can splash water on them and even for the yellow raft I stack several of my tools on there my exacto knife my tweezer several ball tools and it continued to hold the weight so these are functioning toys that you can probably even float your clothes on thanks so much for watching guys bye", "pXA1WzEC4Ys": "[Music] okay guys let's try this we picked up good trash okay so we're gonna I feel like I might need a heavier backpack here we go controller I guess how you feel about the story mom I feel like unless you have some really heavy

guys today i want to talk a little bit about something that i just received and i fell in love with it is the new norwex beach towel it's in the palm print and it's a limited edition this thing is super soft it's made out of a suede like material um a lot like the facial cloths so it'll be super absorbent and super soft so let's open this thing up now the bag is made out of the same material so these things dry super fast a lot quicker than your normal beach towel or bags since it's made out of this material it also has the same uh drying effect it dries super fast the pictures do this no justice look how big this thing is it's enormous so not only can you use it as your beach towel but you can actually you know use it as a picnic blanket you can use it as a little table cover if you need to [Music] so if you go into the water and get out of the water dry yourself off then get back in and get out and dry yourself off again this is probably going to be dry already because of how quick it dries now it's really really thin so it's very very very light to carry around i love the fact that it comes with the wrist wristlet now you can also use the wristlet just as a carrying pouch and actually use this as a sarong so if you tie it up just like so which i thought was super cute and just use a little hair tie to secure it you'll have a little sarong which is completely long enough to care to cover yourself back here and then you're going to have a cute little pouch to carry around your suntan lotion your glasses and maybe um a purse with some money in it um something of that sort but is this adorable i absolutely love this thing so like i said not only is it super absorbent but it's going to dry super fast and then if you don't wear it you fold it back up and it fits right back in that little bag i hope you guys enjoyed this like i said this is a limited edition so you won't be able to get this forever it is available in the mini catalog so if you guys want this go right on to my site in order i hope you enjoyed that have a good day guys", "P5BwFmn2z9U": "Hi, I'm Sophie and welcome to my world. Today we're gonna be making a duct tape towel holder and this is a little thing that\nyou can take around with you. It makes it easy to carry your towel\naround and the best part about it is inside there is a secret pocket. I want to show that to you really quickly here. A secret pocket where you could put oh you know, a key or if you needed to take a little bit of money with you or maybe you're iPod, whatever you want in there. And there it is, a little hidden\npocket. So I'm gonna show you how to make this right now. The first thing about it is you're\ngonna need some duct tape. A ruler always comes in handy I'm gonna be using an X-Acto knife. I've got my fabulous work surface I got some scissors and this is\nimportant some sort measuring device. Now if you don't have a measuring tape which is what I have you can use a piece of string and then\nyou can just measure it with a regular ruler. So one of the things that you want to do is take your towels and I've like rolled two towels together to make\nthis as big as a beach towel would be. And you just want to measure around your towel. So in this case my towel is 19 inches and so what I'm gonna do for my fabric\nis I'm going to make it 16 inches cuz I'm gonna leave a little gap in there\nthat's where the handle comes. I've got a piece of fabric here that is\n16 inches long and its two strips wide which ends up being about three inches three and a half inches depending on how\nmuch you overlap and that's right here i've also given myself a bunch of strips that I have cut. These are my\naccent strips but I've cut the straight down the middle in half and I'm going to be using these at varying lengths to make my straps that go around the\noutside. I've also made myself two tiny tiny straps all I did with this is I just took my duct tape and I folded\nit over unto itself twice and then trimmed and the reason that I'm\ngoing to be using these is to make my my little handle at the top and you\ncould use velcro if you wanted to but I know that\nsometimes people tell me they don't have velcro. I've also got two extra little pieces of\nfabric and these are for my pocket. These again are two strips wide so I've just taken two strips and these are about four inches in length.  So, this is two strips wide, four inches in length. I've got two different colors one's gonna be the flap and one is going to be the pocket. Okay, so\nlet's get started. The first thing I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna start the straps and I'm gonna want my straps to be pretty long. I'm going to peel up a piece of this accent tape. I'm going to start about a third of the way down here and I'm\ndoing a half on, half off technique. So as you can see I'm half on half off. I fold this over. (move this out of the way) Fold this over to seal the tape. I'm gonna do the same thing on the other side. Once again, fold it over and seal. that tape.  Now, I want to make sure that these are nice and strong and I also might wanna make them a\nlittle bit longer so to do that what I'm gonna do is come back with a second piece of tape. This time I'm not going to go down into the fabric\npart I'm actually just going to line it up\nwith the edge here and wrap it on top of my original strap here. (Lay flat please) And fold it over.  And fold this over unto itself so that it makes a longer strap and it also gets rid of any sticky edges. See how I have a sticky edge there? When I lay this down on top of here it gets rid of that sticky edge. Flip it over and do the same thing Now, I'm gonna do this for the other side as well but the thing about the other side is it doesn't need to be as long because let me show you. This is basically just gonna\nbecome these two little loops. Those are going to be the feed through loops so they don't have to be quite so long, they only need to be about six\ninches long. Hanging over the edge there 5, 6 inches I'm just going to fold this over. I'm going to take a small piece of this tape. The tape is very sticky today for some\nreason sometimes tape can be stickier than others. Sometimes it depends on the weather.\nSometimes it depends on the brand of tape and when that happens there really is nothing you can do\nexcept just kinda deal with it. There we go. Flip that over. Now before I secure all these little bits and pieces\nwhat I'm gonna do is add my pocket. Flip this over. Come back with this piece again remember this end only needs to be about 5-6 inches long so don't get too concerned about how long\nthis side is. One side needs to have a good 12 inches the other side needs only about five to\nsix. Snip off this extra. Okay now let's add our pocket. We're gonna put our little pocket right here in the center that's about center and it's a little bigger than it needs to be\nso I'm just gonna trim.  Then using the half on, half off technique All I'm gonna do is seal this pocket in place. What's also kinda fun about this\npocket is you don't have to use velcro because believe it or not, the towel will keep it closed and keep it in place. I'm just putting another strip of tape there. And one more strip of tape on the other side to seal it up. Line it up with the edge here Like that. Fold it over. Okay and then for the little topper I like to make these nice and long and the reason I like to make them nice and long is so that they definitely hold in whatever you're putting in there. Trim\na little bit off the top There we go Line it up and take a fabulous piece of tape now, you can seal it at the top and then flip it up. Get rid of any extra that you need to. And we're gonna seal it from this side\nas well There we go. Now, put your little money or your key or your phone and then flap that down. Now, you're ready to put your towel inside. and see that's gonna keep it in place but if you want to you can add a little piece of velcro. That's up to you. If you want to add a little piece there. All right let's make our strap. What I'm going to first do is to take this and I call it a figure eight but\nit's not really a figure eight I kinda just flip it down onto itself\nlike that and it makes a loop. So take it and you flip it down onto itself so\nyou're twisting this edge to that edge. Twist and then you want to leave it nice and open and tape it off.  This is just to hold\nit in place because we're gonna come back and put a big piece of tape around here to seal the whole end. So one more time twist so it makes like a figure 8 almost. You can see that you\nneed lots and lots of these strips of tape. Okay now to finish this off take your tape, lay it down, flip it over, wrap it around the front. Bring it around this is about a 12 inch piece here. The reason that I made it so long is so that it's nice and sealed. That is really well sealed so\nthese guys aren't gonna pull out. Because these are gonna hold the weight. Alright, so let me\nshow you what's happening here Put your towel in. You can even wrap your water bottle in your towel and now these guys are gonna slide through here. So this one slides through here and this one slides through here. See and this is going to make your handle, now this is where we're gonna add just a tiny little tongue\nclosure. It looks like I may need a little bit more\ntape here guys. I thought I had prepared enough strips and as I should know you never have\nenough strips. Cut this right down the middle and this is just, I'm just going to match this so that it looks pretty. Like that and then this edge over here\nneeds that second piece cuz I didn't get a chance to do that so I'm gonna put a second piece over here that finished it up and matches up that\nstrap and makes it all the same size. Cut the little extra. Do the same to this one. Okay now what I want to do is I wanna make my little slip tabs. Remember I told you we made these little we made this little straps and what I'm gonna do now is add these straps to the end here. So, take a little tiny piece of tape and secure this in place then wrap it around and you want to leave like a pinky\nthere so that you can slide something through there, see that? You need to slide through. Wrap it around to the back.  Tape it with a little bitty piece of tape.  Trim off the extra\nand you're gonna make a second one like this. So it's like a belt loop. Now\ngive yourself a little bit of space in between. doesn't have to be too much but you you're gonna need a little bit space in between. So, you've got your second one that's laying down nice and neat Put a piece of tape up and over So, you've got now a double belt loop Flip it over to the back. Tape this and snip off the extra. What I do\nwanna do is come back and I really wanna make sure that I secure this really well So, I've got a bigger piece of tape and I'm gonna go straight down over those two pieces and I'm gonna wrap it around the end here. That's to make sure that that is nice\nand secure then right below where this strip has sealed it off. I'm gonna add another piece going in the opposite direction and this is all so that I can make sure\nthat the stays nice and secure. Because these are gonna take\na lot of, a lot of pulling. I can trim this little end here and trim this little end here. And that is pretty much it.  Now you can embellish this any way you want to. But. let's test her out. So I put my towel in there, fold it up and around slide one strap through and the other\nstrap through, pull this up so it tightens nicely. Now what I'm gonna do is slide this end of the loose end without the loops through the belt loops and\nthen back through the belt loops. Then it makes a handle. Isn't that fun? And this way your towel when it's wet and maybe expands a bit  you've got plenty of space for it to expand. Or like I said if you put like a water bottle on the inside or something\nlike that or if you happen to fill your pocket up with seashells and things like that\nnow you've got some extra give.

"OsgNYFMmNaw": "hey everybody I know this seems like why even do this video but I mean why not just go out buy new towels when you need them but you know if you're on a budget okay god forbid you lose your job which has happened during depression times it's easier to fix them so that's why I'm making a video all right so these are towels you know these are about five year old towels this is road to these new one there's no praying on end but if you ever noticed they hem the ends okay all the hens are em on the big beach towels their hand on both sides so they don't have on this side this is just a stone but no head so what happens over time is the threads come out so you gotta trim off the threads and then you fold over once and maybe twice to him along the side that's what I'm going to do on the new ones I might just do that to prevent them from coming out now over here this is the hem and the hand got destroyed over here came undone so basically the threads come out so what you need to do is as soon as the threads come out that's when you need to do the repair all right so in this one I'm going to probably cut this off because this is so damaged over here I'm not going to be a folder place as we fold it twice to put go down because where there's a little fold right in there all right so I'm going to just do one of these a probably going to do this guy right here maybe one of these the problem with this is you have to find a pretty darn close to the color of the fabric otherwise you know if you put red on blue or white on blue is really going to stick out like a sore thumb step one you're the person just trim off the excess all the way across all right your next step is go ahead and fold up twice and then pin into place you shouldn't see any fraying come out now during your sewing I prefer a sewing machine okay because to answer this would a pain just going to have to runs let's say of a straight line going across one at the very end and one in the middle so I want to put two of them there yeah make sure your hand is on the same side as the hand this on this one it just looks odd if this is on the other side and while you're doing this snip off any eggs okay before they compromise just take your scissors and cut those things off all right but this thing is a good 20 years old and there are stains on it and a lot of little tags but until holes get too big or it's not useful a little it will be lasting a little bit longer time to go on sumption how many it is I rolled up the towel it's my own little thing as I use clamps to hold them into place so it's not all the way plays I already threaded the way wire I ever said on one at 4.00 on the length of the stitch so you come up here pull the pin holding it into place and what I'm going to do is my second round I'm going to go this way going across for right now I am going to make sure it's underneath it's already came out down here I'm going to make sure that's underneath I'm going to go up and this is a big towel so I have to maneuver and one will pass it and come back alright and I need to make sure to see this is trying to calm down so this takes a lot of patience guys a lot of patience alright so put it in there okay slide it under put that thing down and I want to be out a little bit more a little bit more my left there we go alright and then hit okay it's that so now what I'm going to do is go all the way down it's not reinforced yet but my second one I'm going to reinforce it alright so second one is just going over this stitch and reinforcing it so I'm going to go all the way down I don't want to have you watching me doing this whole thing I'll show it to you after stop but as you go to the next pin you pull out the pins to the side and as you go all the way down you can see all the way down here is trying to come undone so you got to make sure it's stuffed under and then sew it into place now I'm going to do is I finished sewing the first one all the ways about I say an eighth of an inch from the edge so what I'm going to do is I'm going to go over that stitch we reinforcing this ditch it's going to keep this flap down there's flap right here down so it's extended a little bit I am not worried about that so go down there what I'm going to do is go over it and I'm backing up I can go on the fly on this I reinforced it okay I'm going to go in the middle now and turn on the needle rest in the down position on this machine okay I really like I'm going to turn I'm going to go pulling down the center okay it's going to be parallel with the other one as close as I did because you just like with a double kneel needle but I'm going to go all the way down I'll show you when I solve that now there it is okay it's rainforest and you can see the stitch going from here and down over a couple that's the second one that goes over that one so it holds it into place same thing on the other side is double stitch all the way across and looks pretty darn good okay and I have to do to the other side and I think oh very potter right here would even say wow that's a bit of wizardry a little not humour point okay so hey if you're like me and you find depression and if it's rainy outside you have nothing to do you're home alone everybody's at work at school and you have nothing better to do rather and sit on the couch and be in the press I'll be busy and do something now some Xi's are really cheap of Walmart okay if you like if you want to get one there I get a decent one as like 25 years warranty that's what I'm using as a brother and I have to do the other side now so hey subscribe see a whole lot more videos do this with all your stuff that's the principle behind doing this even on the long sides of the towels you want to do the same principle you want to do two runs okay and reinforcing on ads okay subscribe see a lot more videos all right all right", "HGbNd5keqgk": "[Music] and today I'm here with a commune Patriots beach towel

this is very strong terry cloth towel these towels are not meant for the beach they have loops on it they just grab onto the sand and grab onto the dirt like a magnet really bulky it's not very portable like pounds and pounds of cotton to make one of these they just slice off the top layer and all that stuff goes to landfill versus the Turkish towel it's small it's portable it's lightweight and use less cotton it's woven flat so you don't have to worry about sand sticking to it did you say sand free and it's really cute these are a lot more portable lightweight and about half the size we also have our own unique patterns and style that we've woven in these really really cute tassels they're designed to pull moisture out of the towel they also dry really fast so who wants to take this

and today's a super simple easy way to customize and personalize a beach towel for you this technique can actually be used on a variety of different fabrics so you could even apply this to say a t-shirt if you want so let's just get right into it so all you need is a towel and some bleach and a spray bottle I have the exacto knife a pen and a piece of styrofoam board just so I can make my stencil so that's what I'm doing here I took this pineapple image from the internet I'm just using it as a guide and I am free handing it on my piece of styrofoam board so once you are completed with this you can definitely print an image off makes a lot easier instead of having to draw it just grab your exacto knife and you're going to cut out the pieces to create your stencil so I just went ahead and popped out all of those pieces from the styrofoam board and like I said it's a lot easier if you just use a printed image and you can get it big enough keep in mind everything you're popping out is going to be white everything else is going to be the color of whatever material you're working with so that's what mine looked like when I was done pretty happy with how it turned out considering I freehand did it then I just took my towel outside and I thought it was best because some bleach might leak so just in case I brought it outside laid my stencil down these extra pieces of material are just so any of the spray from the spray bottle it doesn't get anywhere else on my towel and that is just straight-up bleach in the spray bottle so spraying my entire design and just trying to make sure it goes straight down so none of it gets underneath the stencil so we can get a nice clean line I did go back and spray some extra in I let this for about 10-15 minutes leaving your desired time so it's really white the longer that you leave it I did go back and I kind of sprayed some splotchy spots around so I love how my talent turned out and honestly the stencil took the longest so if you're already using a stencil that it's pre-made it is going to you 5-10 minutes to do this because it doesn't really take all that long for the bleach to pull out all of the color do you make sure you are working with something that has a lot of color in it and also is like a deep darker color it is going to work best with that and apply this technique to maybe a t-shirt you can design something fun that way as well I'd love to see what you do with this send me some photos if you try out this DIY you could follow me on instagram or on twitter at janelle steeper and then just

you enjoy your day on the beach reading your favorite book and at the end of day you fold your child back we can get the bottom of it the full-size one and I told you Aryan I'm back you fold it up at

are attached together and you're wet and dirty towel is not only not lost but it's in a bag and when you get home you can turn it inside up and throw them in the wash all together and your summer project is ready to go on whatever journey you're ready to take ok so to do this project you will receive with this email this beta course on this Greta the instruction you print it out and in the instructions are here a list of your materials this is what they'll look like you will need a tank of course four yards this happens to be a cotton cord that I used but you know what they make those bracelets and stuff outta that paracord you could use that I just kind of like the idea of using the cotton and I like it that it trades when I tie a knot on it missing so you need four yards of that you need a piece of cotton fabric of your choice so you need one and a third yards some macking threat a coordinating towel of your choice and a safety pin a large one to pull this cord through the casing that you're going to make in to accomplish this you're going to need your scissors some pins and a measuring tool of some kind you're giving you two the yardstick and then of course your sewing machine and and that's when you throw it comes into play so the next time we seek which will be soon I hope we will start making our beach bag towel holder all-in-one you never believe the beach without your towel and your bag all right let's get started all right take three that last one was fast wasn't it let's slow it down a little bit all right done your shopping and this is your designer fabric you're your decorator fabric that you've chosen and you were to get a yard and a third and so you might have found that it was uneven on one end I did mine was uneven on one in and so I put my folded edge down here and got it all nice and and smoothed out and I used my ruler and got it nice and straight and I used my marker and then cut it off my scissors and now I no longer have that rough edge I have a nice straight edge to work with all right so I also needed to cut it down lift wise excuse me with life the length is now 46 per the instructions and so when I got ready to bring it down to 38 inches wide I took my ruler and I found 19 inches which is half of 38 and I laid it up here at the start of my fabric on my straight edge so I could get it square and I put my marks all the way down I just kept moving my ruler down and marking marking marking all the way down so sake of time we're just kind of Candice I haven't done that yet and then I remove that all right now I know that my fabric is 48 46 inches long per the instructions and that's when it opened up is 38 inches wide that's all described for us in Figure 1 on your printout and it will take you along under the words construction and we and will it will refer you to that figure 1 & 2 all right now and that it also tells us that along the 46 inch line so long side of your fabric you need to fold in a half an inch okay so I get I check my half-inch don't worry about being super exact because this is not a suit just be approximate now you can get a gander at my cool iron it's an iTouch iron when I touch it it goes down line it go it raises up and my work surface is covered in muslin and batting so it's safe for me to press on and I find that to be very handy so I've been stalling long enough I know what happened inches okay no I just go down through here and get it all prepped and so that we have a nice clean edge on our beach beach bag hot baths a bit of each bay better towel will be attached to that's yep that's it and so you'll do that on both sides both long edges of your fabric so you get over here yeah check it start with make sure you got a half an inch on your ruler once you get it started it's not too hard there we go and then you make sure and just go down through there pull it tight a little bit it will lay down for you pretty good just have press press pressing is very important in the world of soy because it takes it from homemade to handmade from craft to crafted some nice great this bag you can just make lots and lots of them for this summer cousins are coming to spend the summer with you your grandkids are coming to spend the summer with you you guys are going to the beach of the family all your college kids are going to the beach for their family their friends these make up really fast and only a yard and a third of fabric and towel because you gotta have towel anyway and that prop this project makes sure that it makes it back home with you pretty much mm-hmm okay the bigger tube picture shows turning our pressed edges we're going to fold it up in half with the right side of the fabric together this is the wrong size we pressed it in to the wrong side on both edges and now we're folding it in two and the instructions on step or I should say figure tube want us to sew this together and so you'll see in the next set of sewing videos that disk is been pinned together and we'll be ready to sew together you just put just a few pins don't need too many your edges together pin them up our pans over here on the side even it up at the bottom we do like things to be even turns out better that way you know alright we've got enough pendant and then the next set of videos you will get started on your sewing machine and sew this tube up because that's what it will be will be the first step in your bag alright so in review you have done your shopping and got your fabric and tools and you've got it all cut up all right and then you'll be ready to sew the thing I want you to do for homework before you start sewing is to get your manual out for your sewing machine and make sure you know how to thread it and line the bobbin because we won't go into those details in this class but make sure you can wind your bobbin and thread your machine up all right let's grab out that's so", "Oknuu6AN3R0": "hi I'm Emily from life so savory and today we're going to get ready for fun summer days at the beach or pool with this fun sewing tutorial I'm going to show you today how to make a beach towel that turns into a tote bag so not only can you carry your towel but you can carry all the stuff you need for a fun day at the beach so here's one I've already done you can see that with this strap you can carry not only your towel but you can put all your goodies in this side pocket or in this side pocket so now I can load up my sunscreen and everything I need and then when I get to the beach I can unload my pockets and I can open this up for a huge beach towel layout and enjoy the day so we're going to make one of these today I'm going to show you how to put the zipper together and how to fold this up it's actually quite easy and then we'll get sewing so you can see how with a little folding then you just zip it back up and you're ready to go home alright now you can either use a premade beach towel or you can just use some terry cloth fabric I wanted to make giant towels and so I've gone with the fabric option when you do that you will have a couple of raw edges that you need to finish so the edges of the fabric on two sides are pre finished but where I cut the yardage between this towel and this towel this was a raw edge so I did use a serger to finish the edge of the fabric and then I folded it over for a nice hem so now I have four finished edges like you would have if you pre bought a beach towel so whatever you want works for you and will work for this project now on one of the edges that you have already cut or finished or on one of the short edges of your pre-bought beach towel you want to find the center you will also need a 24 inch separating zipper and by separating I mean that it comes all the way apart and separates which we need for this project you will then take one edge this zipper and place it along the edge of the towel you want the teeth to extend over the empty side and let me just quickly find the center so we can put that on there and then make sure you slide it over so that the teeth do extend out because when we fold it over we want to be able to stitch or we want to be able to zip it up right there and not have it catch on the towel so make sure those teeth do extend a little bit and I'm going to just put a couple of quick pins to hold this in place before we go so it we will also find where the other part of the zipper goes and then pin that in place so that while we're at the sewing machine we can sew both sides okay now let's fold this to determine where the second part of the zipper should lay so I'm going to turn this over so that the zipper is now facedown on this side and I because I have a giant towel I'm going to fold it all the way in half and then I'm going to fold it all the way in half again and that's where I'll place my zipper if you have a smaller towel you may be able to just fold it in thirds or even just in half but it's - it is too big for me to do that I would have like a tote that's six feet long so I don't want that so here is the approximate place that I want my zipper to be and again we have to find the center of that fabric okay so now if I have the zipper here or the center here I can pin the zipper to match so we'll find the center of the zipper and when you're starting to pin this you do want to just make sure that the teeth are facing each other we want to make sure the top of the zipper is together and the bottom of the zipper is lined up so that when you're actually finished this will zip together to create the tote so let's move over to the sewing machine and sew these zippers I have a zipper foot on here and we're going to use that too so kind of right down the middle of the zipper tape the zipper tape is the fabric next to the zipper and I'm just trying to get my zipper foot organized okay so now we will stitch down there make sure you back stitch at the beginning so that your zipper doesn't fall off your bag and I'm just trying to make sure that remember the teeth stay off of the fabric but otherwise it's just quite easy sewing it straight down the towel okay so now we have one side of the zipper on looking great and now we have to navigate and find that other side of the zipper that we pinned in the middle of the fabric this one gets a little or tricky because we have to shove all of the extra fabric into the machine and we're actually sewing kind of in the middle of all this fabric so make sure that the bulk of the weight of your fabric is either on your lap or on the sewing machine because we don't want it pulling on our zipper or on our fabric so I'm just gonna get started and then I'm will try to straighten this out a little bit and again we're just sewing kind of right down the center of that zipper tape using the pins that I put in place before as a guide and attaching the zipper to the center of that beach towel and then again very carefully navigate all this fabric out of your machine so that we can go put the straps on the bag all right now we have a lot of fabric that we're working with here because again I wanted to make this giant towel and so here you can see that I added some pockets and to do that you would put that fabric between these two zippers so how whatever you wanted to make the pocket whether it was zipper or just an open that happens in this spot between those two zippers because when we fold it this is what is the outside of the bag so you would put your pockets on at this point in the project now I'm not going to do a project or do a pocket if you want the full directions there on the website but I am going to show you how I put on the strapping to make it into the actual tote bag so what we will do is we will take our strap and sort of start pinning it on one side of the zipper I'm using this fun cork which is fun and I think it's going to be a great result but it is a little bit tricky to pin so I have to be a little bit careful make sure you leave enough off for your loop so however big you want your shoulder straps to be you would pin those there and then what we simply will do is run this down the edge of the bag if you had a pocket again this would be right on that edge of the pocket if you're doing this at home it's a great floor project or a large table project so that you can really lay it out and make sure that things are going straight and level and you're just really getting everything organized so again when you get to this other zipper you want to leave the same amount that you left on here so I would get a measuring tape and I would measure how long my other strap is and then you will leave that same amount for the strap on this side and then we just pin it up the other side and you'll come back around and this adds a nice design detail as well as function because then you have straps and then you get back here and you'll want to cut it you find my scissors alright so the next step then would be to take this to the machine and sew down both sides of the strapping I've used quark on this one we've used ribbon on this one you can also use webbing or braid or whatever kind of decorative straps that you want let's take a closer look at this one just to see again how this towel folds up and how I've sewed down those straps so you can see on this one I've sewed on both sides of the ribbon this side is to make sure it's caught to the towel and this stitching is to make sure that the pocket is secure so if you do a pocket you will definitely want to make sure that you catch one side of it into the ribbon and again we see how I have both those zipper sides so when you unfold this you probably want to lay it with the pocket side down for your relaxing afternoon but what you simply do is I have folded in both sides to about thirds and then you fold in the bottom half like remember before I folded it in half one time and then you fold it in half again and when you do that it brings up that bottom zipper and then you can kind of just stuff in all the goodies and all the treats that you brought with you get those all packed back up the pockets and then you have this separating zipper that goes back together zip it up put your things inside the pocket and you're ready to head back home [Music]", "IFyfXsISOdg": "in this video we are going to show you the top 10

guys it's me kena and welcome back to my channel so it's officially summer I think the first day of summer was like yesterday and it's definitely getting warmer so I thought the perfect way to kick off the summer season is to give you guys some fun and kind of easy DIYs that you can do this summer while you're out of school or just have some free time and you want to lay by the pool and do a little bit of and you guys haven't already joined at the DIY family and definitely hit the subscribe button below and let's get into this video so the first DIY that we're gonna be doing today is a tie-dyed Beach or poolside towel so tie-dye is definitely making a comeback you've probably seen a lot more clothes and a lot more accessories with tie-dyes designs so we're gonna be doing a fun beach towel that's a guide so what you're going to need is a bath sheet which is actually a larger size towel I got this one at Target for $7.99 so you can pick one of those up you're also going to need some tie dye kits so I picked up the tulip one-step tie dye kids in a couple of colors that I really like so I've got teal yellow and fuchsia inside these kits it actually does come with a few rubber bands and some gloves for your hands so you don't get dye all over your hands but I didn't know if they were gonna be enough rubber bands so I just picked up another pack so let's get started [Music] you can either choose to wet your towel before you put your dye on which will create more of like a blended dye look or you can do it dry I'm gonna do it dry because I want a lot of white to show and I want the dye to be really crisp and have like clean edges and not so blended together like ombre so I'm going for a bull's eye look so I want a lot of white to show so I'm gonna tie my rubber bands really tight around my fabric so I'm just gonna start at one corner and start putting on rubber bands [Music] so for the next DIY we are gonna be making something that if you ever went to summer camp and loved to make things for your friends you probably made these we are gonna be making friendship bracelets I made so many of these I can't even remember I tried all the different patterns so today I'm going to show you some of my favorite pattern designs in fun colors but colors that you actually want to wear so I have all of these like fun colors so let's get started so we're not gonna be doing anything crazy most of my favorite designs are actually really simple so we're gonna start off with four of your favorite colored threads and you're gonna measure them out 40 inches long [Music] start by separating all four of your colors so you're gonna have two strands each I'm going to start with the lightest color first and I'm just gonna cross over making a four shape like the number four go across under and through and again once I've completed about 20 knots give me a pretty good section I'm gonna switch to the second color and continue the same pattern [Music] [Music] so for our next friendship bracelet we're going to be using these really pretty colors so same thing measure out your links of each of your threads and tie a knot at the top and tape it down so you can start working with it for this pattern you want to separate all of your colors one strand of each color on each side so white blue Rose and charcoal we're gonna be making the chevron pattern which is kind of like a half diamond so once you have all of your colors separate it out you're gonna take your far left strand make the number 4 over your second strand go under and through and pull tight all the way to the top you're going to do it twice on each strand until you get to the middle [Music] so we're just doing it opposite on the other side so we're making a backwards number four on each strand and knotting it twice and pulling it all the way up to the top until we get to the center so now that both of our white strands our first strands are in the center we're just going to do that backwards for one more time and pull it over under and through and pull tight twice and that finishes one layer of the Chevron the first one's always gonna look a little weird because you're just getting started and getting all the strands in the right place but just keep going now with your second color all the way down I think the best way to make friendship bracelets kind of modern and look fresh and new is really picking the right colors so pick colors that you love right now that are really trending in fashion that you want to wear either it's neon or anything to match your aesthetic I think you're really gonna like them because I don't think friendships bracelets ever really go out of style it's just on how you pair the colors together and these are like classic patterns so don't be afraid to use a very simple design and making your friendship bracelet like really simply and really fast but you're using really cool colors so it works so for the next DIY I thought it would be fun to make kind of like a beach tote bag or just like a regular tote bag that you can use for school or going to the craft store so I picked up this natural tote from Michaels and they had two different sizes but I thought this kind of like mini size was pretty cute and then what you're gonna need is some fabric paint in the colors that you like and I have been obsessed with fruit print like dresses with bananas on and lemons and peaches and stuff like that so I'm gonna show you guys how to use lemons or different types of fruit as stencils so kinsley really wants my lemons no you can't have my lemons yeah my lemons can't believe it there's a lemon it's not a ball this is not baby so I'm going to show you guys how to make a stencil out of lemons we're gonna make a fun printed design on our tote bag so let's get started so for my overall design I wanted it both use full-size lemon shapes in my pattern and also the stencil of the lemon on the inside and you'll see what that means in a minute but I'm going to first kind of use the shape of the lemon as a guide to paint a couple of lemons on my canvas [Music] so to use your lemon as a stencil what you're gonna do is cut it right in half like so and we're just gonna kind of get off some of the lemon juice cuz we don't want that we just want to use it as a stencil and then brush your paint onto your lemon like so and then find a good spot and press down whoa [Music] [Music] so I hope you guys enjoyed this video and if you did definitely the like button below I think these are really fun and easy but creative DIYs that

green beach towel now this beach towel was released like two weeks back in July and I just got it so I want to show you guys how this thing looks like so I have another cow unboxing in my other previous video which is a first camo yellow version so check that video out in my bio and this version is the ABC camo green colorway and for ABC coloured camos they tend to have the green version pink one and the blue one so as always I went for the iconic cutaway which is the green version so the top part you've got this red soft layer alright which is very nice very soft the color really pops in this towel you can see very very colorful vivid colors I would say check that out it's very nice at the bottom you get a more rougher side if you want to use this for bathing I wouldn't suggest it but not say you can't you can but this is the more absorbent side if you want to play it with it alright this one however does not soak up water very well but in a beach environment this is a very good thing alright you see the fan base very soft very colorful right lengthwise is about five feet in length all right it is pretty long and the height is about maybe about 20 inches I could be wrong but I'll provide the specs in the description so yes you see very very nice and one thing to note is that even though it's called a beach towel but in the description of the item itself you can actually use this as a show that's right you can use this as a shawl you can use this in the car you know what is it call it protect your knees and your arms from the sunlight and things like that and probably can use it as a blanket so that's pretty good so it's not just confined to being a beach towel per se in fact I'm going to use this for my sofa I'm going to put this as the outer layer so just to make my ski so4 a little bit more dope and see here very very nice check that spread out that's amazing that it's beautiful very very very nice so obvious hope you liked the video subscribe comment follow my idea lke to entry catch you guys later bye", "xanbPGZcI_4": "hey everybody justin cener here how's it going got a cool video for you here today about print on demand and i'm going to teach i'm going to teach you how to sell print on demand personalized beach towels with shopify and you see an example on your screen we're actually going to go ahead and create this exact product and the personalization aspect of it as you could imagine the customer will be able to put any name they want any text they want and they'll be able to see that personalization live inside of the website and inside of their shopping cart so this is obviously another print on demand video and if you've been following my training you know i believe that print on demand is by far the best business model on the internet today you get to sell hundreds of different types of products like t-shirts apparel home decor and of course even these customizable beach towels and the best part is you'll never have to touch the product right you could sell 10 000 pieces of this beach towel you'll never have to touch it once you'll never pay for it up front you'll never deal with fulfillment or shipping or tracking information your print on demand partner does that all for you automatically and it's really uh kind of just as the name it describes it print on demand the print part means production right your products will be produced only on demand and with e-commerce that means when they're ordered right when is a product demanded when someone orders it when will a print on demand product be produced only when it's ordered right no cash uh required upfront no risk this should be the light bulb moment in your head thinking okay this is a great business model because you could literally sell product and collect payment right when when an order comes in you get paid you could get paid for a product that doesn't even exist yet and then all the rest of the work happens automatically here's exactly how it looks you're going to have designs and products in your store that will be turned into print on demand products so you'll have designs created or in some cases like the example i'll show you here today you could use pre-made designs you're going to get those designs and add them into different products on your store whether it's a beach towel a t-shirt a wall canvas a personalized doll all these different types of print on demand options you'll add them to store and just like any other product a customer will come over order the product and when they order of course they'll be paying you and that brings us to the end of our job we collect the profit there's nothing else that we can do even if we wanted to let's say do something we couldn't we don't touch the product we don't have it in our warehouse it's not like we can go run out there and rush the order and fulfill it ourselves everything happens automatically our job is done we collect our profits sit back and relax and what happens at the same time is your print on demand partner and i'll show you the one that i use your print on demand partner will automatically receive the customer and order information right what what did they order how many what color what size what customization did they put a name on it right what are the other options where's the shipping information right all of that gets sent directly to your print on demand partner right you don't need to pick up the phone or copy and paste anything this all happens automatically that's why print on demand is so amazing and after that the print-on-demand partner creates the product in this case they'll create the personalized beach towel they'll ship the product to the customer and they'll even provide the tracking information on your behalf via email to the customer and this is the entire process for a print on demand business but you'll see most importantly for you your job ends after the customer orders and all the traditional hard work like actually creating sourcing the product shipping the product warehousing the product all that happens in the background automatically so why would you want to sell personalized beach towels for print on demand well any product that you can do personalization on drastically increases the perceived value of the product right what does that mean well people basically think it's worth more right and that makes common sense right you have a beach towel and then you have a beach towel that you can customize with your wife's name or with your kids name or with your own name or with whatever right you obviously are going to put a higher price tag in your mind as a customer on something that you can personalize and customize yourself you think you think okay well there's a beach towel and it costs 20 or there's a beach towel that sees the same material but it's got customization it should cost 20 plus right plus whatever you value that personalization with and the point that i'm making here is that you're going to be able to sell the same type of product it's still going to be print on demand but your personalized version or your personalized options to the customer will appear to be a lot more valuable than just a traditional beach towel or traditional non-personalized product right they're simply not finding this product in stores they're not going into target into the beach towel section and saying okay i like this one but i want to put my name on it right that's not happening they're not seeing that they might be seeing regular beach towels that they associate with some type of perceived value but the personalization that they get especially the way that the personalization happens through the app and we'll go over the shoulder in a second so you can see exactly what i'm talking about the way that this all happens really contributes to that idea that they're going to have a higher perceived value attached to this product so you get that higher value it sets you apart from the competition and it converts at a higher level because it's a product that they're just not used to seeing so a lot of different reasons why you'd want to sell personalized beach towels and you could probably replace beach towels with anything as long as you're personalizing it so a simple four-step process then we'll go over the shoulder first of all you need to get the tsunami print on demand app you'll find that over there in the app store you can get that asap at podap.justincener.com you see the link on the screen and in the video description here and this is the only print on demand app that offers these super unique products to be personalized and again the actual personalization editor is really powerful you see it in a second four-step process you just install the app you see the link over here number two you're gonna go into the products section of the app number three you're gonna find the pre-designed beach towels you're gonna pick one you're simply gonna add it to your store and you're gonna act like an entrepreneur you're gonna go ahead and promote your product you're gonna go ahead and make sales and there's nothing else that you need to do but that and this will be a lot more clear once we go over the shoulder and we'll be able to create any type of design we want we could enable customization you see a couple of examples here of print-on-demand beach towels where they just entered their name right over here they might choose their state and then enter their name or maybe choose their state enter their name and enter in a text right we could do all these different combinations right of course they could choose the color right so so many different options so many different ways to personalize the product so many different ways to fit this product into your store and your niche so let's go over the shoulder and we're going to take a look at the tsunami app for personalized beach towels you're looking at the tsunami print on demand app and you could just get there by going to pod app.justinscener.com you see the link on your screen and this is a great app it allows customers to design and personalize and live preview the personalizations that they've done and you'll see this in action so make sure you go ahead again to popodapp.justincener.com come over here and then click the add app button and i already have this installed in my store you see the tsunami personalized on-demand app i mean my app section over here and we're going to click into it and we're going to go into the product section because i want to show you these pre-designs and this is the quickest way that you'll be able to get print on demand products in your store this is incredibly powerful there's three different types of print on demand inside of tsunami i'm going to show you what they call pre-design so we're over here under products and then pre-designs and you see we have a couple different beach towels there's actually a a bunch of beach towels and pillowcases and all these different types of things where you could imagine we could add customization options for tons of different things here's a a beach towel where you literally put your face all over it right here is a beach towel where you could put your kid's name or maybe your own name in it if you like mermaids right here's one where you got a nice little crab design and you could put any name in here right we're going to come over here and you could choose from any of these you could also choose an existing design you can create your own design you could add personalization on top of designs like you could put a personalization spot here for people to add their name but we're going to go with this little crab pirate design we'll click on here and i love tsunami because it's only a one-page setup right you have everything that you need right on this one page okay we're going to keep the custom template as is we don't change that we're going to give it a title and i'll say personalize with your name come over here if you are doing my three-part product description make sure you put that in here three-part product description blah blah blah typically we'll remove things in terms of slower delivery time doesn't really help sell there we see our cost we see our shipping costs over here so we're going to take a look at the different costs here and price our product accordingly a lot of different pricing options when you go with personalization typically you get to charge more why is that because again it's a higher perceived value you may be asking okay how do i set up the personalization there's nothing that you need to set up it just works out of the box and i'll show you that so we'll click the publish to store button and in a couple seconds this product will be live inside of our shopify store so we'll come back over here into uh products and we'll be looking for that beach towel here it is beach towel crab pirate personalized with your name we're gonna see our 59.99 price tag on here here's the personalized section okay so now just let's

here and we say this looks great okay i want to customize it okay well there's no add to cart button you'll see that your add to cart button is automatically replaced by a personalize button so i'll say okay i want i want one i'll come over here personalize and now this is going to be the tsunami editor and this is a world class editor no one else has anything like this and you see that we could

right in front of you of course you could fully position this move it around right really powerful we could change the color or maybe i want red or maybe i don't like that font i want something a little crazier i try this font right now maybe i want to add more text or maybe i want to add more lines okay you see this over here is set to this font in white hard to read right we'll change it to black and i'll move it up or maybe i don't like this font okay no problem i'll come here and i'll select uh futura okay and there we go updated there okay and uh we could also add an image if we wanted to add an image it would just simply get uh placed just like this text you could move it around you could change it you could change the size and all these different options the coolest part about this is that the customer is seeing all this live they're saying okay i i'm happy about this i want to add this product to cart right i want this to be my finished product typically with print on demand personalization they're not going to see this product until they get it in their hands here they get to see it in a nice huge high resolution image and when we press add to cart they're also going to see their customization inside of the cart page and this looks a little bit bigger on on mobile but what you see right here is justin cena videos right so inside the cart it's the actual product and it's customized with the text and if i scroll in or zoom in a little bit right you can see it a little bit more all right you could actually see if we open this over here right this thumbnail is the actual product that we created this really drastically increases conversion rate when it comes to personalization the fact that they can see the product through every single process they're not buying blind they're not asking for customizations and then waiting to get a proof or a mock-up they're designing it they're finalizing it they're ordering it all in one place and they're seeing exactly what it does and really the best part for you is that now again this is a print on demand order once this order is placed there's nothing else that you need to do this personal personalized design gets automatically sent to the printer so incredibly powerful it's only possible through tsunami because they have that personalized editor and there's a huge catalog or a huge product catalog inside of tsunami as well i invite you to take a look at all of the different products that are in here they have pre-designs they also have your traditional print on demand products and they have a massive catalog so come back over into the app go into the product section you'll see the pricing over here and you'll be able to scroll through literally all these here's some of the real popular products like wall canvas where it only costs 12 16 but we can sell it for 40 50 60 70 100 depending on the size so some really great products that tsunami has in there you see the link in the video description but uh going back to this again really great example of a personalized product that has a higher perceived value we have a personalized beach towel from tsunami",
