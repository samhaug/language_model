menu here that took home a Wellness Center it is a very nice heavy indica I primarily use this strain to help me sleep at night I have gastrointestinal issues and it definitely helps me relax and de-stress when I get home from work after a long day of going to put cardio stuff like that it is definitely the strain of choice for me that has a very nice earthy and pungent flavor and smell to it not too earthy like the name Salmon River would say but it's definitely got a nice flavor to it also THC content it's always very nice and I would recommend this for patients who need help distressing I read minutes for patients who need help sleeping at night distressing relaxing anytime at the family when you need to stop thinking as much and stuff like that it's definite good for that same River is definitely not super heavy when it comes to th see feel or vibe but definitely is heavy in the sleeping time section of indica so yet again if you're trying to sleep Sam River is definitely a great choice for you to get but it's not something that's going to be super psychoactive if I play something you would smoke when you're trying to go out and be too social [Music]", "6ym-BTdfQM0": "YouTube

United States Marines are landing to take possession of the California's the day is one of both great rejoicing and deep sadness for the people some of our most prominent American citizens having married Californians and found life Pleasant are sympathetic to the old rule whereas other Americans particularly in the Sacramento Valley have always felt a resentment toward the Mexican government the proclamation bringing this vast western territory into the Union is now being read to the people and assurances given all that they will be treated as Americans unless their actions demand other treatment this is not the first time the United States flag has been raised over Monterey as you no doubt remember it was in 1842 at Commodore Jones heard reports that Mexico had declared war on the United States and were giving the Californians to the British for safekeeping on October 19th he entered the harbor and demanded the surrender of Monterey and raised the flag only to learn that the reports had been ill founded and now it is Fiesta time gaiety and dancing must always follow a celebration and this is no exception the American servicemen have expressed the willingness to stay and settle the California's for the United States after glancing over the Spanish beauties you can't blame them and they still insist that it is patriotism the famed half dome of Yosemite forms a backdrop

with Atlas plan trainer we're here on day number 31 so right in the middle of weeks four and five kind of at the end of week four if you give it a couple of days transition time when you flip your plants in the flowering mode the plants are looking great they're all fully formed bud sites and they're really starting to pack on the size and when you walk in there that smell is so so sweet we really wish we could give you the smell over a video that would be amazing but we spend some time in the rooms yesterday staking up the plants so we got some fresh looks at them all propped up and healthy like so before we bring you in to the grow room this morning we're going to recap what we've done over the last week there's been a feeding we've done the staking and really just kind of rearranged the plants around the room because that's what you got to do keep them healthy get them all getting the best light so before we bring you into the room today let's recap what's been going on for the last week and then we'll bring you into the lights and give you a glimpse of what the plants are looking like right now hey buds so we're here getting ready to do a flush of our plants and just wanted to pop in and give you an update so we're day number 24 and only our advance nutrients plants need watering today so we have 55 gallons of water all pH out to a 6.4 we did a 6.4 pH today because we put a 6.1 in on our last feeding and we want to bring that pH of the soil back up just a little bit you want your pH of the soil right around six point three so six point four we'll bring it back up let all those nutrients absorb but we're gonna give them eight gallons of water per plant really flush that root zone out the reason that we're only doing advanced nutrients today is because those pots are the ones that are dry in need water it's important to let your plant pots dry out most of the way to dry your plant pots should be light when you pick them up before adding water to your plant this allows your root zones to really aerate stretch out and really soak up that moisture as soon as you hit it with some fresh water so we'll do advance nutrients today and then we'll hit the success nutrients plants tomorrow so we'll catch you that hey buds so we're here on day number 26 doing our success nutrients flush they are nice and dry and ready to soak up some nutrients and some water and flush all the salts right out of the plant pot so we're doing 55 gallons over our seven plants just like we've done with every other flush we're day number 26 our target is 550 to 650 ppm s and a 6.5 pH so we just added six hundred and sixty of their sugar 250 blast off and four hundred and seventy of the balance which came out to 660 ppm s very close and a six point four pH when we were throwing it on the plants so things are looking great we got to spend some time in there and stake them up so that they don't droop over it so over all the plants are starting to grow bigger it's starting to look amazing really pop some trichomes all the way out on the leaves and we're excited for you to follow along so stay tuned hey buds Rob with Atlas plant trainer we're here at the tail end of day number 34 our ladies and we don't get in the rooms with the lights on and off a lot at least with the camera going so this is gonna be our first attempt at a little self recording I hope it works out well but there's been a lot of things that are going on in here so we wanted to make sure that we brought you in showed you what's been happening and all the progress we've made so our ladies are looking wonderful again we're just over four weeks in here we have massive bug formations the Salmon River og doesn't grow Hugh but it grows solid and covered in trichomes and you can see that that's what's happening right now we also did a lot of staking you can see the bamboo stakes in all of our plant pots they all of these states make for some difficult watering we also have all of our soft wire that we previously had used to train the plants that is still kind of entangled so we didn't pull them all out you can see here we kind of cut the bamboo stakes to the right size that we needed if not they'd be poking up here and when you get a bamboo stake going on a sideways trajectory the extra tall pieces can be kind of eye poking and kind of be painful so we we just kept the tops off about a foot 14 inches on some pieces right where they needed to be we have lots of bamboo stakes around so it's okay that we went through a couple extras just by cutting them off one thing that you can do while you're going in flower is you know every one so I'll pull pull these lower leaves off some people pull a little bit more than the lower leaves off I'll pull one that's covering a bud side or particularly big and kind of hanging out there it's okay if you toss these on the floor just make sure you clean them up when you're done you never want to leave decaying leaves around that's what attracts bugs so we clean up after pretty much every day that we're in here shedding leaves so besides the states one thing to look out for is the trenching that can happen so trenching is when you're watering if you're hand watering you kind of focus the water by pouring it in the center but then that pushes the soil to the outside edge I'll do all unstretched during the watering process so I have so I have this plastic spoon and I can just reach in here and pull the soil away from the edges so that the next time I water I pruning shears for cutting the tops with bamboo Stakes off so this is so that when you water the you're actually flushing all over the water in the nutrients out we always feed when the lights are off and preferably right before they come on so the concept behind that is that when your lights are on it's drawing water and nutrients up from the soil into your plant and then when the lights are off it is relaxing and letting all that water and nutrients go back down the soil so if you water or feed right before the lights come on that allows the most nutrients to work their way back out of the plant and into the soil so that you can flush them out give your plant fresh stuff to feed on and then allow it to soak back up that fresh stuff as soon as the lights are on this prevents in my opinion the nutrient leftover taste if you don't do the greatest job flushing because this is kind of that intermediate flushing so if you do a good job with the flushing that happens during the growing maybe shorten that two-week flush at the end of the flowering period of 10 days and still be left with a great tasting but at the end so buds that's it for our week number four recap I hope you have enjoyed what you've seen so far with our Salmon River algae comparison with our advanced nutrients up against success nutrients so far I think plants are pretty close but I do have to give the edge to our advanced nutrients mixture so far but we're not even halfway through the flowering period so these plants do have a good amount of time left to pack on some size and we really can't wait to see how they they finish out so we hope that you subscribe so that you can see how they finish you can follow along on YouTube Facebook Instagram or Twitter or just subscribe to our mailing list atlas plan trainer comm and hopefully we'll see you soon", "_fnIWDmaWHA": "I would up y'all there's a little bit of controversy on the field of lyrics from my song top down off the lg bomb let me break it down for y'all cookie fan provided the

happy if not I hope it makes you laugh a tiny bit something stupid that I did and then again all my stories are something stupid that I did I used to do stupid [ __ ] like for instance one time I crashed my motor scooter into my garage cuz like I didn't know how to stop it my god I used to be stupid guys but that has nothing to do with anything yeah yeah like this video guys it's just pretty much just a video um it's just a little video about Hawaii you know when I was there I did get weed and I'm gonna explain how I did it well you know so like all you guys can like go and do it you know like exactly but no I'm kidding guys don't go out and do this like this is just a story it was funny it was shitty weed it was very expensive not worth it guys I think they rip off the tourists because they know they cannot charge but other than that let's get right into the story this beautiful day starts off you know Hawaii Honolulu I we were sitting in the hotel and I believe that day we had a massage coming up and so I I hopped on this app and like this is just like an app by college students use they can like post stuff and like everyone sees it and then they can like like it or dislike it and stuff it's pretty cool and they can comment everything it's so pretty cool yeah so I use I was like looking for bud in Honolulu you know I had a post a few times I think the first two we got taken down and I got on I got in trouble for it I don't know it was weird but the third time this girl hates me yeah gotcha once and bug now pretty sure pretty sure the price that I paid was outrageous things like dirty or I don't know it was pretty pricey for a gram and so I meet up with this girl right and we're at this hotel where this Lagoon was so it's super cool like it was chill as hell and I'm out there like you're I'm meeting some random person that I've never met in my life and she's like I'm gonna come up on the moped well I didn't know it was a girl until she got there so I'm the person who that you turned out to be a girl you know I'm saying she rolled up on a moped she looks savages [ __ ] she was fine as hell like I know you're not watching this but girl in Honolulu you have to watch this and you sold weed on a moped to a guy on that hotel where that colorful thing is you're fine [ __ ] like so and so she she sells me some weed you know it's its own Reggie so corn well I wasn't really corn we're just like Hawaiian like Hawaiian we don't know it's very different from American not American but a US grown wheat because like I don't know the dankness of it is a little off yeah sure it did that's Wayne - swag from the girl which was pretty cool it's fun time you know I'm saying super super duper fun so I get this swag no Shane how many grand old time and I go back to the hotel I couldn't use it right away cuz like of course my parents are there I don't have a piece of nothing and so it's coming up time for these our massages so we go to the massage you know we have a great time you know get that full body massage you know I'm saying get a rubdown you know pretty fun like hours go by really fast when you get a massage pretty sure I fell asleep after that no I'm saying we um my parents and my sister they went off to do something and I don't know what I was well I mean I know what I was doing but like I don't know what they were doing I think they're at pool or something basically in the lobby of this hotel there was a few stores there's like a couple designer stores there was an ABC store which is basically just like a Walgreens so I just went there you know I'm saying I'd grab the I I stole guys seriously I'm I'm a bad influence don't do what I did I stole a lighter stole an apple too and I went back to my hotel room if you know I'm saying we made the signs of the Apple and then pack the little weed and then wider I had was a torch less lighter if you know what those are so they look like a little torch no I'm saying and I try smoking it right and like it's like weird how you hold it and I wind up burning my thumb with that torch I don't [ __ ] I heard guys like it's a torch lighter but it hurt my thumb but um eventually I figured out how to properly smoke this zone marijuana from the Apple and uh it's pretty cool I wish I start pictures of it I was literally on like I don't know it was one of the higher floors of the hotel like it was probably one of the top three highest floors I was just overlooking the balcony like overlooking the ocean like we saw that the one mountain on Honolulu I'm not sure what it's called it's [ __ ] beautiful though Hawaii is breathtaking I remember I was on my skype with my friend like out here to smoke and I was like bra like check out this view like the ocean like getting so stoned like where that was it was awesome like I had a blast it was it was cruddy week but like it it's kind of it's just the experience like it was a great time I loved it go back one day I've been there three times when does it blonde in there and so I'm basically just joking on the UH the balcony and once I got to all I was left with was this ample you know one with two holes in it one had ash you know the other was just like a hole and so I didn't know what to do with it and so my good old friend mark you guys all know him he was a young Nick you should throw it off your balcony you know since you live like so high up like who's gonna notice like me being the smart guy my guys like obviously I'm gonna say yes duh don't do this guys obviously it could it could have hit song and could've done something stupid don't do what I do don't know it guys don't know it so I take this sample right chuck it over the [ __ ] edge I just ran back inside and that's pretty much the end of the story like no joke like I was just too scared to like look and see like link where it went I just like I had mark like I had him on my laptop face in it and I just chunked it so he saw it and ran back inside and that was it and now it should a smoke sesh and I was only high for about 20 minutes that's how shitty the weed was but it was in Honolulu it was beautiful I had a great time it's a pretty overall good

] man i had not been sober for like almost two years now i need to take a little break so i was trying to like go on tolerance breaks and these tolerance breaks would last like two days three days a week maximum right it would never surpass a week so me and my homie b boy right just decide i [ __ ] it let's try to go for two weeks without smoking right we're gonna motivate each other not to smoke so one week passes we're toughing it out almost another six days passes we're feeding right we're literally feeding we were talking on the phone right the day before the tolerance break was supposed to end feeding like crazy talking about we're gonna buy an ounce smoke that whole thing up we're gonna get extra high we're gonna get extra big right i'll wait for him to finish school right because he was still like technically in like high school and like i was in college so i had finished my day earlier so i go to his school i wait up for him he comes out and he's got two other homies that i know right so like i bet let's go have a nice smoke session so we're walking we go to an apartment building and i know some of you guys can relate to this right we're trying to find a door that's unlocked so we can smoke inside and it was about like the same type of time a year right it was pretty [ __ ] cold it was snowing outside you don't want to be outside so we're trying to open doors and finally this one door unlocks we hop inside we go in the staircase and we're starting to roll up we're rolling blunts after blood so there's like about three blunts right rolled up of like mixed of like the mids and the zaza on top of that let's not forget there's this like uh quebec dude that likes to smoke wax but he does it with the bottle talk way right with cigarettes so you got that extra nicotine buzz so we got everything rolled up and we start puffing right we're like cheers we light everything up we start puffing everything's passing in rotation i'm thinking i'm okay right and i only had eight like one type of meal that date i can't remember what it is but i think it was just fries right so i'm puffing and puffing that shit's getting to me right i'm like holy [ __ ] i'm getting high and like as the blunts are passing and as i'm hitting those bottle talks of wax i'm feeling as if my body has left the [ __ ] universe right my body has left the universe but it's like my soul was stuck in limbo up in here right my like my blunt i finished i wanted to finish it the fastest i could when you're the one who rolled the blunt it looks kind of [ __ ] weird to pass the blunt and not take it back right because you're the one who rolled the blunt so literally i'm finished my blood the fastest the quickest i'm the best [ __ ] blunt smoker i finished that [ __ ] real quick but mind you i'm [ __ ] high right now i take one too many bottle talks that's where everything goes [ __ ] wrong bro my vision turns gray like gray as [ __ ] like i couldn't see anything it kind of felt like those times where you're sitting down and you get up way too quick and when you get up super quick okay you're like lightheaded you got that lack of iron you know what i mean but like this time i didn't stand up bro i just didn't stand up i was literally already standing up but my vision turned [ __ ] gray and at this point i'm tweaking as [ __ ] right i'm paranoid i'm like what the [ __ ] happened did they like give me like xanax or like give me something [ __ ] up inside of the swede i don't know they laced it did they do something [ __ ] up like i wasn't sure bro i was literally not sure i was like yo what the [ __ ] happened bro i was blind and everybody was talking i don't think anybody noticed except my friend right the boy but i was just dead staring right i couldn't see [ __ ] i was fighting the urge to just pass out because i really felt like i needed to pass out i was fighting that [ __ ] urge right i didn't want to risk it right looked like a [ __ ] weirdo passing out so i was like like this right i was all wobbly and [ __ ] as i'm tripping balls there's this ringing sound okay and this ringing sound comes into play a little later on that ringing i'm like that ringing sound is the result of me being way too [ __ ] high so i'm like forget it that has nothing to do so i'm just trying to figure out what the [ __ ] did i just literally turn blind so i'm tripping i'm wondering how the [ __ ] i'm gonna tell my mom like i'm literally that's literally a thought process that i had i'm tripping balls like i'm really tripping balls and i'm like how the [ __ ] i'm gonna tell mom how the [ __ ] am i gonna tell my mom that i turned blind because i smoked though how the [ __ ] am i gonna do that how how how the [ __ ] am i gonna get home like i was tripping you know and literally my homie b-boy pulls out water out of his backpack i hear that like water bottle sound i could i recognized it it was like a hunter's instinct right i was like water bro as he's about to [ __ ] take a sip bro i just snatched that [ __ ] out of his [ __ ] hands right i started drinking that water it was like a fortnight chug jug right it was like a fortnight chug jug that i just sipped and that had gave me [ __ ] energy i wasn't worried about 9 anymore well remember that ringing sound it was still going on you know the fire alarm had been on for like maybe the past like maybe five minutes okay and i had been hearing it since the beginning but i disregarded it and what the [ __ ] would i look like a blind ass [ __ ] telling everybody that there's a alarm ringing right so we take a moment we literally hear the [ __ ] doors upstairs busting down people are walking outside like everybody has to evacuate the [ __ ] apartment building we're running out we hear the [ __ ] fire trucks come and yeah probably because we smoked so much i didn't turn off the fire alarms bro like it's crazy and like that's the first time i greened out but i didn't puke right i absolutely hated the taste and i hate vomiting like i vomited maybe like three times in my life but like four times i don't know but like you know i hate vomiting it just tastes [ __ ] disgusting bro it ain't chill but yeah that was pretty much like the story time like the two stories that i got hopefully you guys can see this beautiful lake right behind me i'm holding it like a [ __ ] tourist [Music] but hold up um yeah i think i found a nice little spot where i'm gonna just post stuff and smoke the rest of this blunt um i'm gonna film it but i don't think it's gonna end up in the final cut of the whole video right just because you know just me lighting up so i'll still stick it on the [ __ ] tree and smoke up but i doubt it's going to be in the final cut of the video because i guess this is going to last another like 10 minutes and i don't have anything else to say for this story time hot box wake and bake backwoods video this is a nice [ __ ] view bruh i love [Music] yeah i'm going to stay over here that's going to be a little bit better [Music] damn that's crazy i'm glad i came here it was a nice little spot i hope you guys enjoyed this video because if you did please drop a like and hit that subscribe button and i really appreciate it um i would probably not be outside right now smoking this blizzy i'd be like right next to my house i wouldn't be taking this nice little walk experiencing nature taking in deep breaths and fresh air and better oxygen than inside of the apartment and like close to my house so thank you guys for being there and watching my videos i'll see you next time this is tony robb you guys know the drill um out", "cS2WedwqxfU": "what up guys welcome to ccc i'm shane i'm danny and we're back for another strain review we got four different phenos lined up here in front of us today so we get to do a little bit more uh testing little pheno hunting we got a nice nice strain here in front of us today we're looking at the bubba diagonal crossed with docido feminize [Music] [Music] these are some nice jars i can see there's definitely some frost poking through there good smell i think i checked these out right before we we started this video and there's a pretty wide spread as far as variety goes here this one down here on the end has a crazy smell a lot smaller buds this is the number three i'm getting kind of these three jars here i'm getting a lot of the smells that i would be expecting out of this but this one here is really throwing me off so this is actually the one i'm gonna try first i gotta say the first jar of pop reminded me more of a bubba type of bud and this is like straight kush which i'm guessing the one on the far end is coming from the diagonal i guess i remember seeing the diagonal back in colorado i know it has some type of triangle kush hybrid in it or that's what i think somebody out in colorado made the diagonal by using the triangle and that's why they made it down third i think yeah down with dirt or something like that i don't know i'm not too positive but that is where the diagonal came from i'm pretty sure it's out in colorado somewhere and then good old bubba influence in there the original ccc episodes maybe episode 20 or something like that we reviewed a really nice bubba and we've had it on the show a couple of times since above is a throwback that i like to go back to every now and then you know when you want that real it's always really pretty weed you know always very densely covered you know and strikes and it looks nice it also has just like a really nice earthy meatiness to it it's kind of got like a little bit of a i'm a coffee drinker so i kind of get like a little bit of like a ground vibe yeah like when you're [ __ ] grinding up the coffee at costco that's what it smells like this one i'm going in on here like i said this smaller one did you smell this one i got the little buds this is that's whoa yeah i knew you would pause at that one that's not the profile you're expecting at all huh it's almost like a [ __ ] fruity [ __ ] fruit vine i don't know it's that's weird because you know from bubba and that and the diagonal and the dosi dough this isn't something you would expect but yeah this the smell on this one's really throwing me off so uh i'm gonna actually take a hit of it here now the only problem is uh we set this whole video up and forgot about the source of fire so in order to ignite this bowl in front of me i'm actually going to need a lighter so if you guys want to just sit tight i'll go grab one i'll grab one for you too because i'm that type of guy oh incoming we got one bam all right fire the hole iron the hole but yeah i'm liking this one this is the [ __ ] uh the winner for me so far just because it's got that [ __ ] dankiness to it um something that bubba i feel like lacks sometimes it's kind of that dankiness that you get with some of the more ogs and i don't know if that's due to the dry resin boom another ladder yeah that's not again not the type of thing i'm looking for out of a bubba club has always been like a nice switch up for me i feel like there's some bubba that uh i wouldn't call it pretendo but if you were to show it to somebody who wasn't that who's kind of just starting to smoke weed they would look at it and be like oh my god this looks insane then you smoke it and sometimes it it gives you that real heavy indica type buzz that nice couch block uh you know just a stoned effect you know and then sometimes it doesn't right i always thought there's like two bubba cuts out there they tend to look pretty similar one is a little bit more of a dud and one really packs the punch you know which one i really liked back in the day was the katsu boba yeah that one seemed to be really sticky and kind of more wet not wet but you know greasy i feel like grease is what bubba's like this right here honest that's a perfect to me that resembles bubba a lot that's more on the bubba end i would say more dry this is the number four yeah yeah from the smell and the look of this one it definitely seems to be leaning uh you know heavier towards the bubba diagonal thing as far as it as opposed to the dosey i'm gonna go ahead and try this one next this one i would say is my second favorite so far because it's kind of resembling the dose a little bit but it has some of the bubba characteristics with a little bit of that gas undertone from the diagonal which one is this this is the nine yeah when i was just going through them before we started this one to me uh kind of incorporates some traits from all the different parents that went into this um this one may be the most well-rounded just off look and smell starting off right here you won't know until you smoke it right that's why that's why we gotta get in here and do this research and find out definitively yeah i'm gonna try this one next right here the nine just because like shane said it resembles all the parents that are involved i think that has traits from all of them and i like the way it looks and smells so let's get in here and try it got the m p glass on the table today dan's got the double bub over there see this almost smells like cookies almost i feel like a good bubba i mean obviously dosie dough has og kb in it so there's cookies in here but i think jkb is a different funk to me than i think than most people probably think when you say cookies right you know what i mean yeah oh gee or ogkb to me has always been like a cookies with dank to it right you know like typical cookies like all the almost all the other cookie cuts you know especially the the first ones that appear on the scene you know the forum and all the whatever the [ __ ] you want to call them all these cookies that we've all been inundated with the last few years there's some things about it that i like but it's always lacking that major dankiness that i feel like some of the other lesser-known uh cookie type cuts tend to happen ogkb has always been my favorite for that specific reason yeah i mean og kb just washes so well too that too you know and i [ __ ] love your michael but back to the flower here i think i've tried every single one except for the one that you were raving about this uh really you tried that many already no i tried two out of the four you're right yeah i'm just going in on myself those two i've done i've tried two though the one that we said is the most bubba definitely i think as far as looks and jar smell i think stands up but now that i'm breaking into it here definitely i'm smelling a lot more of that triangle influence a lot of dankier notes a little bit more reminiscent of an og not quite so no it's not the lemon pine salt earth thing but there's definitely something going on there this one's interesting over here the one that's the one with the small buds it's really frosty kind of colorful almost looks like a box of tricks when you pop it open look at that silver color yeah and that one has the smallest nugs you know where if you were to just like i said very floral the jar field test if you were to see these four standing next to each other on a shelf you probably wouldn't grab that one first right but you know if you only had a chance to look at two just going off looks you may not even open that jar and you'd probably be missing out on the most unique smell of the bunch i think right and for these taste tester videos i feel like we should pack up little taster size hits you know i have a bad habit of like packing a full bowl and then realizing okay i got the taste but i got more to move on to here yeah it's tough either way fire and hole i don't know okay so the one i just hit that's got the most sticky flavor to me i was just gonna say that this one the flavor stuck on this one a lot more than this one so one i've been raving about had the most unique smell uh didn't last as long as on the palate as this one right here that i was saying looks a lot more uh bubba dumb okay i think it's just depends on which one you hit last right i mean these things all have dank flavor it's so hard to judge me i could tell just by this last rip though same piece fresh bowl you know but i'm getting out of the same bong yeah hit it the same way this one is still on my palate whereas the last one was gone after a few seconds well i'm gonna try this bubba dominant one over here and then uh i will have tried all four i am [ __ ] stoned i don't even know if i can remember which one i tried first i gotta catch up with you so we'll put that one over there for later let me pack up this dry shirley here go in on number 10. oh man okay this one definitely has um seeing the most diagonal influence on this one for sure that's the one i tried first much more honestly that might be my favorite looks wise much more uh you know typical more cushy yeah style buds definitely lime green with like the orangey hairs kind of sharp calyxes definitely on this nose too this one's got kind of a an added bump to it it's got that fueliness for sure perfect like for my preference perfect uh structure like density wise it's really like nice tight compact it's not too dense it's not like dripping down yeah oh sticky but not like insanely sticky to where it's gonna gunk up all your instruments whether it be your fingers or your scissors or whatever i was a big fan of the diagonal when i did try it out in colorado um it was definitely [ __ ] if you're a cush head you know i definitely had all the right characteristics of a good [ __ ] triangle hybrid so yeah i would say throughout our personal weed smoking experience um the time period that we spent in colorado i'm not gonna say it just applies to colorado as a whole but the time period that we spent there i've smoked a lot of the most underwhelming genetics that i have in a long time i i just maybe it's because like i moved out there from cali with my biases and my previous taste but i felt like people were growing less [ __ ] that i actually wanted to smoke out there forget about quality and how it's grown right just the genetic pool that people seem to be picking from and the strains that seem to be popular there versus other areas while we were there from like that 2014 to 2017 time period or whatever i just found to be really underwhelming you know but diagonal like you said is one of those ones that does i tried it for the first time in colorado and it is one of the ones that sticks out with me from the time period totally i mean living out there made it so that when you did find something that was like the kind of bomb you know like something cushy something that actually stuck on your palate it was like a holiday you know and he went and bought all of it so i i i'm in the same boat as you to where it's like when i lived out there like we definitely took a step down but when he did find that fire [ __ ] it was nice you know like there was the coal creek kush oh that was gonna be the second one you found it when it was like before it got all dried out like if you caught it within like that perfect time period you know and it was still sticky and [ __ ] that was rare though but how much of that too is just our bias of always liking a bunch of you know cushy fuelly gas extremes to begin with yeah and then we move out to colorado and what's our favorite [ __ ] out there the closest [ __ ] they had from what we were smoking back home so as much as we ran and rave about how you know we always want to try new flavors and try new things yeah there's a lot of personal preference and personal bias that plays into there's so much flow and [ __ ] out there though there's just a lot of production strains out there you know like the first time one of the first things i smoked when i got out there is you know i tried a few different strains like what was supposed to be locally popping in colorado or whatever but it was a lot of like no offense but like a lot of tga stuff type stuff you know like the jelly beans yeah even if i'm gonna not that i don't like jack but if i'm going to smoke jack like jtr is not really up that high on the list of jacks that i've tried that i want to smoke you know right but i remember i was like yo where are the like cushy og type terps like i want something like that you know you need a little taste of home and everybody's like yo try the bruce banner yeah i tried bruce banner i'm like this is not what is this this is not what i'm talking about this is not what i'm looking for right you know but those those two that we listed earlier kind of probably came the closest yeah i don't even know which one i'm smoking over here anymore oh yeah i'm smoking the 10. the one that we uh both probably liked the most just based on bag of food all right i'm gonna go with the 10 for sure the uh the cushionist just seems to get me every time and that's probably a bias that i need to kind of get rid of but i mean i don't know if you know i think a lot of people would probably choose that one just does taste really good through the drive it sticks the most you know and then i would say closely and second as this one the bubba dominant one actually stuck a lot on my palette so yeah i'm gonna go with the triangle dominant one or the diagonal dominant one excuse me followed by the bubba dominant one it could surprise you with the flavor though yeah maybe then that guy finds out that he's not an athlete he's a magician yeah kills it with the magic tricks yeah yeah fire and i'll find our calling here oh yeah yeah i'm not that impressive yeah i think there's only two that really stick out to me definitely going uh 10 number one for me and then probably the three just because it's the most unique out of the bunch that's the one i just did not to [ __ ] fall on your footsteps but you know i think i'm gonna have to say the same and then this this one was pretty small it would be third and then this one would probably be that maybe if i had if i had to smoke them all on a regular basis maybe i would choose these two if i just had to try two of them as a one-time thing i would probably go with this one because this i knew right when i cracked this jar that i was just gonna like it yeah you know yeah so and it lived up to its expectations so i'd go with this one and then i'd want to try something that was kind of different so i'd go with this one one of those definitely got me baked for sure that's that's the fact one of them down i don't know which one but one of them definitely got the guy we're still alive one of our cameras is dead yeah that one's still rocking all i want to say is thank you for watching the video we appreciate all you guys out there that watch yes um if you want to watch more videos that resembled the style of this video we have more of them a lot um you can find them if you just click on our channel down there just go down there check it out you know spend some time browse around a little bit see if you find something that tickles your fancy if you do put it on it's great if not you know thanks for looking and thanks for watching yeah we love you guys yeah until next time toodaloo bye [Music] you", "lvrvXkDctnM": "what is up Kenna Pham and welcome back so check it out for this video right here I have some different flour for you guys I'm going to show you guys now all this flour right here is different price points this is all different levels of prices some of them actually might be around the same level of pricing but we have you know the more budgeted stuff down here going all the way up to the more expensive stuff and I'm gonna show you guys this as a comparison video so you guys can't compare the really cheap stuff to the really really dank bom top-shelf stuff and then that way you guys kind of got a good overview of what the flour scene is like here in a state of Oregon okay so if you're coming to Oregon if you already live in Oregon this is a great video to kind of give you a good layout of what to expect you know what I mean if you're coming here and you're like hey how much money do I set aside that what do I want to get blah blah blah blah this video can help you so without further ado let's just get into it okay guys so first up let me set some of these ones aside because we're gonna get to those those are not where we're going to start off we're gonna start off with the lowest the cheapest ones and work our way up so the cheapest one I have right now here is this misty mountain days coming in at 16 percent THC this is an indica and this is by green source Gardens okay now this right here runs about four dollars and fifty and over 4.4 dollars and 20 cents sorry so this is a four dollar 20 cents a gram so just imagine what you could get for like a quarter or even an ounce of this stuff because you can't pick up ounces here in Oregon so but anyway that is what it looks like okay [Music] that's what that's what we're dealing with for the $4 20 cent section really cheap really really budgeted I didn't want to go really lower than this even though they do have stuff that is lower than this they do have stuff that's like three dollars a gram two dollars a gram stuff like that but you know this is just I figured you know this is pretty good budget like four dollars come on so anyway I'm gonna open this up so that's what you're dealing with okay [Music] okay not too bad I personally wouldn't smoke this just because that's my personal preference if you are somebody that's on a budget or you don't really give a [ __ ] you just want whatever you know you can get the most of most bang for your buck this is something that you should try out then okay if that's your preference if that's gonna work for you then more power to you however my personal preference I would not waste my money on something like this okay I don't smoke this kind of butter this is really really low grade Bud really really low grade but okay however it's not the worst I have had like nasty green bud that was just awful anyway up next this is at the seven dollar price range so seven dollars a gram so we jumped from four dollars to seven and this is Sookie's by Alta crest and this is a 50-50 hybrid which I kind of doubt that I don't believe that it's a solid 50/50 hybrid it's probably more like 60/40 or something like that anyway 23 percent THC with pretty much no CBD I mean it's going got a point one percent CBD so there you go that is that there's test date let's open it up and take a look at it alright alright so we're just gonna show this big nugget here or vamo it's really dry oh I just lost some of it I just lost a little chunk over here oh shut those right there anyway there's really dry guys this one's really I mean you guys could probably hear it it's just snapping dry and it's not bad I guess it's all I definitely stepped up from the $4 gram you know at least it's more of a dense nug let you know but that is the $7 section so that is what you're going to kind of expect if you're you know looking for that $7 budget-friendly strain you're gonna get stuff like that majority you might you might you might get lucky and find you know something here in Oregon from a certain dispensary that is really bomb at that price point but most of what you're gonna find at the $7 price point is going to be something along those lines okay now we're going to move up one more to the next tier which is I believe here this $10 yeah so we're gonna bring in the $10 ones alright so first up for the $10 actually you know what I'll do this one first actually since this one's opened here at the top we'll do this one first alright so $10 a gram this is probably let me just say this before I get into this $10 and up is probably as far as quality goes as far as good quality this is probably the best bang for your buck $10 now these $10 strains right here I'm about to show you would go like I've seen firsthand in places like California and Nevada I've seen strains just as dank as this if not a little less dank go for like 15 18 dollars a gram in those states so being able to get what I'm least three right here on a buck show you 410 that's phenomenal within itself okay can't beat Oregon prices telling you anyway so look at that this is the hypnotoad 20% THC headrush hills is the farm this is one gram and just look at that purpleness man look at that purple old [ __ ] I dropped it anyway let's do it pull these bad boys out of here oh look at that just beautiful nuts frosty as hell man yeah look at that frost on those nugs beautiful purple in there nice tints of green just what you want when you're looking for nugs and the smell I know you guys can't smell none of this but holy [ __ ] guys this smells great the terpenes are on point with this okay this is some really really good quality for ten dollars a grand okay same with this one this is a 10 gram one two when we open it here so this is the Donnie burger 13 okay you green no-till [Music] and again $10 a gram for this one and I mean just look at that Oh smells phenomenal it's very pungent guys as soon as you take it right out of the bag I mean just phenomenal smell just nice dense nuggets break up nice like if you're rollin blunts or something with this you'd give me you'd be the joint lovers and blunt lovers would love that flower right there it breaks up really nice all right so again Donnie burger 1325 percent THC and then here we go this is the garlic breath now this is probably one of my favorite strains out right now with the GMO if you ask me hey what are your favourite strains right now what what do you recommend uh it would either be the GMO or these garlic breath sorry this garlic breath or the garlic mince uh really I mean I just love stinky strains okay I really do I love that gasps that pungent nest that smell through the bag that's what I like that's what I look for now look at this is a big note look at that Oh beautiful how does one want you to know you're my favorite girl I didn't look at that nice big nug fire ten to ten dollars a gram again I'm telling you that's what to expect here in the state of Oregon okay now so those are the ten dollars set those over here now we're gonna move on to the 12 to $14 arrange now I have a twelve dollar one and then these other two or fourteen so I'm going to show you guys the twelve dollar one so this is the m4 twenty nine percent THC this is super dense that's like a rock I mean that is super dense guys smells great though smells really really good but super dense and just very nice lime bringing some bright orange hairs very nice bug like listen to that listen that listen sit yeah it's dense but so twelve dollars a gram twenty nine percent THC top shelf now we're moving to the last two which are these two $14 a gram and if you ask me my opinion right now they're not that much better than like these are like when I showed you guys these ones that are ten I mean they're almost there they're really not better okay they're kind of the same these just happen to be more expensive I don't know why oh I really don't maybe it's just the flour company or whatever but this is voyager number one from seven points oregon twenty nine percent THC with pretty much no CBD and i'm going to show you guys this 14 dollars a gram for this [Music] or get that nice snug again dents really dental if you you're liking those hard den snugs then you know you want to go for the 12 to $14 sections because that's where you're gonna get a lot of these dents nuggets the smells great phenomenal smell very chirpy very very chirpy I guess maybe that's why it varies in price why this is more expensive than the other stuff is probably because maybe it's more chirpy I don't know but then here we go another $14 gram one strawberry cream 25 percent THC again by seven points Oregon which is a good farm they make good product wash look at that beauty look at that beauty it's the cutie with the bootie I mean seriously though like just nice dense little little tents little very very little tents of purple in there you know just frost it as [ __ ] I mean it looks like somebody took like a salt shaker of tri Chrome's and just shook it all over this bud I mean just drenched it I mean it's super trike City here and I really like that I enjoy that again smells super good it's got like a fruity strawberry smell so that that's really good so there you guys go this has been a comparison video of the cheap budgeted stuff versus the more expensive stuff here in the state of Oregon now let me just end the video by saying this okay guys here in the state of Oregon this is kind of the norm of what you're gonna find at most dispensaries now there are gonna be some premier dispensaries I like to come from your dispensaries because they're more high-end so you will find stuff at those kind of dispensaries that are maybe like you know 16 to 18 dollars a grams stuff like that however this is what you're going to find add just your average basic dispensary that you're going to be visiting in your local town or wherever you're visiting a hatch or anything like that this is majority what you're gonna find and you're gonna find dank bud like this at good prices okay here in Oregon we have the cheapest weed in the United States okay I know there might be some people in the comment section that would like to argue that point maybe they're from Colorado and stuff where they also have cheap weed there as well but Oregon is the cheapest in the United States we have the cheapest and the best bang for your buck okay as you guys can see these $10 grand ones you can't like that's phenomenal that's phenomenal okay so I like I said I just want to do a comparison video show you guys comparing the budgeted stuff the cheaper stuff the the B stirs the whatever you want to call it the low end low grade cannabis versus the high grade you know top-shelf stuff you know that way you guys can get a good idea of kind of what it is you're dealing with here in the Oregon cannabis market okay now I've done a lot of videos on the flower here in Oregon I've done videos if you guys check my channel out I've done videos where you know it's the budgeted but a bunch of different cheap stuff I've done stuff what top shelf looks like here in Oregon I've done this video now that you know kind of compares the two so I'm going to be moving on to dams I got a bunch of dabs here we're going to be moving on to a bunch of different products and stuff like that that we're gonna be moving on to and I'm gonna go show you guys in the next video kind of a comparison of cheap dabs what are expensive dabs and then kind of doing the same thing where I'll show you guys comparison of both cheap and expensive dams alright so I hope this video has been somewhat informational for you guys if you love Bud if you love cannabis if you're STONER like me then remember please hit that like button drop a like on this video show that love hit that subscribe button at what as well so you can stay updated with the channel and stay

youtube it's bindu buds here for day 60 update in the flower tent for the gmos and supremes so everything's been looking pretty good man um right here now i'm on day 60 uh for the supremes and the gmos but uh gmos are probably gonna take to week 11 week 12. um i don't think they're going to be done and on day 70. no i just don't think so they still have a ways to go but they're still chunking up you know they're looking good they're looking good but i just i don't see them being done in 10 days um so wait and see but as far as the uh the supremes go i think i'm going to pull them off friday i'm going to give them another five days taking the day 65 um according to jen according to nerf genetics they finish around anytime between day 60 and day 65 so yeah i'll take them a little longer i think but they're looking really good i'm really happy with the way they the way they've chunked out you can see them there in the back the three in the back that's my supremes which are larry's bananas where the mother and then the father was a mix between uh gmo and miracle alien cookies so yeah they're they're looking pretty done but again i'm gonna take them to day 65 for sure then as far as my gmos go man they're looking good i mean they're chunking up they smell wonderful everything in here just smells so good and i mean i i'm sorry for the poor quality you guys of my uh my videos you know i don't have a good camera and uh i apologize for just the poor footage but as you can see yeah and the gmos they're uh they're definitely chunking up and again you guys all i've been using is living soil organic soil um i put amendments in there um down to earth i put some oyster shell early on for calcium um i have the humic acids you know which just help break things down help the plants absorb everything i use some insect frass i use bokashi obviously i use i use my own worm castings and yeah i use a little insect frass i use a little seabird guano [Music] a little azomite [Music] and uh there's a few other things too man um gypsum or potassium uh i mean gypsum for calcium i'm sorry not potassium calcium i mean in a sense that's kind of my my secret sauce that calcium and calcium is so important and i mean if you guys want those tasty organic but make sure they get a lot of calcium a lot of sulfur and that potassium sulfur as well i feel like sulfur is neglected but sulfur brings out the flavor you guys if you want some terpe buds make sure that your buds are getting some good sulfur especially towards the end of flower you know not too much but just just the right amount you know and uh these are the first time that i've run gmo and supreme so i was filling them out you know with this first grow so i didn't grow them out you know too big just kind of filling them out and uh i'm really enjoying the way they're growing and so as you can see this next run my supremes are a lot larger i have a they're a lot lot bigger and this beautiful girl right here supreme it's got a lot of tops and i got this girl right here and my other supreme oh actually no this is a gmo right here dark heart nursery shout out here's my other supreme right here she looks good then i don't know if you guys can see this gmo back here dark card nursing man but she is just looking beautiful look at all those tops i mean just top after top at the top and i mean she is a healthy looking plant healthy i got my dosie dough right here she's looking good as well then we got nepali pink right here [Music] she's looking good so i just gave these girls the top dressing um gave them some back guano gave them some gypsum for calcium put on some bokashi i gave them a little insect frass that chitin and um a little alfalfa and uh yeah they're they're growing you know they're in about three days until or no they're about yeah three days into week two so they're getting their stretch on and i'm sure they're gonna be doing a lot more stretching really soon so as these girls leave these girls will be filling up the tent so and then yeah i'll give you guys an update later on what's going on in my veg tent um what's happening in there and uh yeah just thought i'd give you guys an update i hope everyone's doing well everyone's blessed and uh i'll give you guys an update probably harvest time probably on friday when i heart take down the supremes in the back so until then i wish you many blessings and a wonderful night i'll see you guys soon peace out and blessings you too", "VSj3JMwq5U0": "hello frosty is in yeah Miska Terios up these tourism

of rustic with a modern twist\ntype deal two problems though first I don't have any big beams to work with\nand second I don't have any experience with burning wood for an aesthetic\neffect so to make up for my lack of a beam situation I decided that I'd used\nsome much thinner pieces of red oak to make a couple of faux beams and then to\nmake up for the fact that I never done this before I brought in a teacher well\nsort of a faux teacher you'll see what I mean when you watch his video\njust kidding Johnny we love you all right so Johnny and I are making two\npretty different projects on our respective channels and I'll link to his\nin my description and in the endcard at the end of this video so that you can\ncheck it out but the thing that they have in common is both employ a\ntechnique called sha tsui bong or at least a technique that we've adopted\nfrom what actual show sue Ibanez and also both are made from red oak a lot of\nred oak in fact and all i've been doing and am doing in these shots is getting\nthe pieces that I could use for my beam so I'm cutting them to rough length\ncleaning up one edge on the jointer and then ripping the other edge on my table\nsaw that way I have some nice clean boards that I could start working with here I'm gluing up my sub assemblies and\nwhat I'm going for our beams that are 12 inches wide and thick and four feet long\nso I needed to glue up eight panels that consisted of two boards each and this\nwill take care of the top bottom and sides and then we'll get to the end caps\na little later since that part was a little bit more tricky the next morning after everything was\ndry I used my sliding crosscut table to cut a bevel onto the end of each of the\npieces and then after that I could use my fence to put a bevel along the edge\nof each of the pieces so after you've made the four cuts on\neach piece you'll have eight pieces that look like this and each beam is made of\nfour of them and here's a little animation so you can see how they come\ntogether and again here you'll notice that we still haven't tackled those end\ncaps but let's glue up these guys for now and then we can get to that for the\nglue up I decided to go with the painters tape method this is a\nrelatively big piece but I've done it on larger pieces before so I felt pretty\nconfident and you'll notice here that I'm only folding up two joints instead\nof all four at once I thought I might just get a cleaner result doing it this\nway anyhow so after the first two were dry I could move on to the remaining to\ncomplete the box again except for those end caps okay let's get to those now so\nthe reason I've kind of been delaying the end caps is because it's the hardest\npart of the faux beam to well fake a real beam would basically have three\ndifferent types of grain edge grain face grain and end grain to fake the end\ngrain there's a few different ways you could go one option would be to get a\nslice of a log sometimes called a cookie because the face of this is gonna be all\nend grain so you could basically just cut out a little square and use that as\nyour cap and pop it in but I don't have any cookies so let's talk about other\noptions another would be to get a bunch of boards lop off the ends and then glue\nthem back up to make kind of like an end grain cutting board and this should work\nbut I didn't do that either and I'm glad that I didn't because I think the burn\ntechnique would have wreak havoc on it and you'll see what I'm talking about\nwhen you watch Johnny's video after this one another option still is to just\nrotate some face grain around one of the ends so you'd end up with a beam that\neither flows like this or like this neither would look real which is fine\nbut one would look more aesthetically nice than the other one at least in my\neyes I didn't want to do that either so my first thought was to just kind of\nlean into the fact that it's a faux beam and do something decorative and fun on\nthe ends my idea was to make an end cap of four pieces either like this or like\nthis I went with that first now one of the\nproblems with this idea is that every joint here is gonna be end grain to edge\ngrain so edge grain to edge grain joints are very strong and end grain to end\ngrain joints are very weak I'm gonna guess the edge grain to end grain joints\nare probably somewhere in the middle but I would say leaning towards the side of\nweak so I glued him up tested him out and well obviously that wasn't gonna\nwork so the next option should have been to do the four pieces on a diagonal but\nbefore I did that I had one other thought why not just do one long\ndiagonal it kind of takes away the problem where you're favoring one of the\nsides of the beam and because I'm making two I could have it where the grain kind\nof converges into a V now I don't know if I just talked to you into liking that\nidea but I definitely sold myself so that's what I went with okay now let's get to the fun stuff\nfirst of which was power carving these guys basically I just wanted to give\nthem a little character by distressing and weathering them the way that an\nactual beam would be and this was my first time doing anything like this but\nit was honestly a ton of fun and I can't wait to do more patterning and texturing\nand some other pieces moving forward and while I'm working on that let me just\ntake a second to think Squarespace for sponsoring this video\nbuilding the website with Squarespace is easier than building a fake log quite a\nbit easier in fact and they usually look nicer too I've been using Squarespace\nfor almost two years now and I've recommended it to a ton of people both\nhere and in my personal life and I haven't heard one person complain yet\nand I think the reason for that is because it's just super simple and the\noutcomes look awesome they've a variety of templates that are perfect for any\nkind of website you might be tuning up be it a personal portfolio an online\nstore or something for a brick-and-mortar like a restaurant and\nif you ever need assistance they have great customer service which I can\npersonally vouch for so basically whatever it is you're looking to do\nthey'll be there to help you do it and best of all right now you can start a\nfree trial by visiting squarespace.com slash for eyes and save 10% off your\nfirst purchase when you use the offer code for eyes at checkout so if you're\nthinking about starting a website or even if you have an existing one you owe\nit to yourself to at least give them a look all right thanks Squarespace\nokay so power carving was fun but now things are about to get funner or more\nfun you know what I don't know which ones right so I'll just say enjoy a blur\nso I guess while I burn these I'm just gonna shut my mouth for a second and let\nyou enjoyable okay so that was fun but there's still\none last thing that we have to do and that's build a base and since these\nbeams are pretty rustic looking at this point I wanted something that was kind\nof minimalist industrial modern whimsical that's how I'll describe it so\nhere's the drawing to show you what I was going for it kind of plays on the\nidea that this could be something like a rack that keeps the beams off the ground\nso that a forklift could get them that's where the industrial adjective comes\nfrom and then I think I'm gonna paint them some bright pop of color that's\nwhere the minimal modern whimsical aesthetic comes in so in order to make\nthis I cut off a small chunk of a quarter oak that I could get all of my\npieces from these were already in pretty good condition so I just used my table\nsaw to cut each piece rotate it 90 degrees and then cut it again so that\nthey'd be consistently one and a half inches wide and thick across their links\nspeaking of length next I use my crosscut sled to cut all the pieces to\nlength in total I'm gonna need three long\npieces and three shorter pieces easy enough but with the shorter pieces I'm\ngonna put a 45-degree cut on top of each to give the base a little bit more\ndetail and after that we could move on to sanding and finishing so the burnt wood is gonna be pretty\nthirsty and you can see here it just pretty much drank up whatever I put it\non but that's okay cuz you don't really have to be neat with this kind of a\nfinished job just sort of slap it on and let it drink it up basically you just\nwant something that's gonna solidify all the sit so that it doesn't come off on\nyour hands every time that you touch it and finally after a bit of sanding on\nthe base we could throw on a few coats of this pinkish orange ish salmon ish\ncolor and put it all together so in the end I don't think this came off as\nlooking real like I don't think it's gonna fool anybody who knows anything\nabout wood or anybody who's asked point-blank if anything I think it\nhasn't almost sort of cartoony quality to it like if you were to draw this idea\ninto a cartoon and then try to capture that aesthetic in the real world I think\nthat that's what this is to me all right that's all folks special thanks to Benjamin

between ken-doll of 91 and the forum cut Girl Scout cookies you'll notice a lot of purpling in the bud and in that purpling you'll see it because that is a reflection of the Girl Scout cookies this plan has been flowering for 72 days that are still white at the top but experience has shown me it's best to take it down no later than 72 days let's pan around this way you'll notice that I had to go to great effort to fit it under the light meantime it's a very big producer it's a tremendous indica it has tested as high as 38 percent and we enjoyed it very much it grows straight up it's a very difficult plant to try to bend and screen of green but you see we managed to do something similar right here so this is once again GMO cookies coming down to the a 72 days a lot of purple and a big-time indica", "m-FudPnpoH4": "[Music] welcome to wheat entertainment and i never get tired of doing these reviews and it's really entertainment for me my hobby is weed and i would watch weed movies all day if i could i would smoke weed all day if i could i would love i i took it to excuse me i took a trip to amsterdam one time and i went to museum smoke weed went to food went to museum smoke weed went to food for three straight days and it was awesome and we're looking for the very best weed and what's great about weed entertainment videos is people leave me tips i try and hunt down these flowers especially for the ones that i think that they're good and we check it out and then we all compare notes and we all run for the fire strains and today we're going to talk about a strain called cotton candy now i've tried cotton candy a lot of times over my long life and what makes this one notable and the reason i bought it first it was a tip flower and then second it's from the marathon cultivation and marathon cultivation uh did marathon og and marathon og is a top flower here in l.a and so with a tip and people want to try more marathon cultivation flowers i grabbed it i ran down there and i grabbed it and so today we're going to check it out and look at this beautiful but this flower has an unbelievable cure on it it's like meat falls off the bones the cure is unbelievably fantastic so i've already got my two scoops in vapor cup we're gonna add the third of ground flours you have to use ground flours to use vapor cup it doesn't work unless you're grinding the flowers you need more surface area to get the heat so i tamper and then i'm gonna stick this down into the vapor cup i've got this cup set to 3 30 and about a minute and a half it's going to give off the terpenes the cannabinoids the oil vapor and the natural water vapor in the plant and you'll see it all condenses right here and then we're going to check it out and we're going gonna tell you what we think so everyone who watches these videos can buy better there's so many strains how do you know what to buy even i don't know what to buy but i would say these days the average flour coming through here is good and it's definitely better thanks to those tips so you can see it says the marathon cultivation cotton candy and it's got a cotton candy on it and this flower has 22 percent thc and that's really on the low side these days and i'm an old timer so i really understand 22 flour can be really good i would say that's the bottom of really good and so for me i'm usually looking for 22 minimum if it's lower than that i really have to have a tip to buy it i know people think that thc is not the key and i don't think it's the key either but i what i will say is there's very few flowers under 20 that can stow me to the bone but there are some so it's not just about that but usually the thc the prime area is 22 to i was going to say 29 or 30. but these days they're pushing those thc levels all the way up i think my highest one i got was lion's mane i think was 42 crazy i mean you've got lemonade it's got 40 couple 40 strains absolutely crazy but anyway today we're talking about cotton candy by marathon and you can see the vapor is in the straw and ready to go and so let's check it out cotton candy by the marathon cultivation out of vapor cup wow so this flower has an earthy taste with just a light undertone of gassiness or og with vapor cup you can really taste the flowers i mean you can taste them no one can fool you and tell you it's not og or it's og you know you can't not know just so enjoyable so what do we think of the marathon cultivation cotton candy this flower was medium heavy for me it gave me a hazy head it had a little bit of focus and mainly it was an even feeling meaning it wasn't super euphoric and it wasn't too heavy so even is good but with that said we're looking for the best and the best is heavy flowers with focus that can grin us out and was cotton candy that i don't think so this flower gets an 8.5 from the doctor this is a good average top shelf flower 8.5 is my baseline so you go up from there it's better you go down from there it's not better right but for the doctor cotton candy is an 8.5 if you want to try it it's out in the market right now and if you like the marathon cultivation because they have good flowers i would try cotton candy it's not that it's not good just for me you know i'm looking for you for flowers this one had a more of an even feeling with hazy focus and maybe some people like that but for the doctor it's an 8.5 if you want to get a vapor cup if you want to taste your flours if you want your flour to go such a long way i'm telling you some people report back that they use just half the flour they used to because of this thing i don't really use it for the weed savings i just like the feeling of not ever getting a burn throat and it's just so flavorful i would say it tastes more like a hookah i don't know how to explain it but you could see the draw is good and you can get one at vaporcup.com if you want to see my favorite strains the doctor's favorite they're all on weed entertainment.com there's no anything other than real reviews there this is my journey this is my hobby i don't make any money from doing this i do it for fun and it is fun thanks for joining in thanks for all the tips it's so appreciated i'm back every day but sunday sunday's my day off join in give me some tips let's find the best flower party on my friends [Music] you", "NwzT7t0Ummc": "let's take a closer look at these [ __ ] so yeah you can see these [ __ ] plants here they're on the general hydro you know these plants are now at 1,000 thousand a thousand watts they still got 200 more watts to go pushing these [ __ ] up to just slowly I'm creasing the lamps just to study what they're doing yeah so if you check all that information I just [ __ ] blurted and probably confused a bunch you with and we look at some actual footage here you can see how the edges of the leaves of that lime green color which you know indicate you know a form of magnesium to where the plants not being able to facilitate the nutrient all the way to chips those leaves the same thing there and it's almost like a weathered look and on the leaves which aren't as bad anymore you know had that twisted they had a twisted leopard you see in other videos look at this man this looks like some [ __ ] some [ __ ] has just been tanning for like [ __ ] 30 years and [ __ ] you know it's just her skin just all-weather too [ __ ] up you know I mean that's the best [ __ ] looks like same thing here you know then when you go down a little bit lower you know the leaves get a little bit prettier you can see the you know sanction over here it's like the [ __ ] just been Tannen and you see how curled up and these leaves are I mean these boats will finish fine you know they always do but the way these plants look they're just not desirable I mean I hate looking at this [ __ ] sometimes so I asked when they get in here and [ __ ] get the [ __ ] out but I mean the bud formation is history they'll push you out you know they got ready to get all the leaves stripped off what is it like seems like day 19 I think so this week all these leaves are getting but then so then we'll go to this year you guys remember this plan and you remember that look there well then you know I started feeding at the dry salt waste center then I started feeding these because this is just more of an experiment that I'm and you can see the new growth this it's just completely changed surrounding plants over here health here then you know we have this plan here this subject up on a higher bucket you know you can see the leaves here a little bit weather you know and the plant here that's a little bit lower you know just looks really and now now we have this light right here right which is pounding straight on these two flats here okay these are on the general life trail you can see the line here splits goes in the general hydro about of England then we going to try sauce wow that's a [ __ ] difference so how the [ __ ] does that and I mean these plants are just absolutely love I can I'll go all back here we can see the same thing you know all these are up there's just the same amount of wattage [ __ ] palms herkie happy I'm gonna get back here and sure look at this or look at the growth on those leaves it's not well I spoke too soon but I looks like a [ __ ] believe a person in tomato cage I mean you feel happy they are the leaves are just a nice beautiful green new growth coming out it's just exceptional I got prettiness and that [ __ ] there she's like model material the growth of these is man looks like a totally different [ __ ] garden and our flower these plants pretty small and I mean they still have one more week left a lot of them are are in the third ring you know you can see the aisles here aren't killed and that's made some most of them are but I mean you have some here I don't want any addition these plants are a lot smaller than those those [ __ ] over there this one I hear this is the that's a Sour Diesel then she literally just somewhere there's a snow and was just the right amount and then you know the oh [ __ ] you can literally see the ones that are that [ __ ] is not even I mean ice not even that far that's less than four feet right right there she's a sucker that [ __ ] you look at these ones these [ __ ] are almost crack and did the [ __ ] time and that light is right there she's just loving him look at these ones to recommend any or me just tumble into the garden look at these cause I was doing you know a lot of this is damage back here [ __ ] happens Plus models of yeah guys you guys you know up close and personal between the two a mandala it looks like two different orders like nine day you know I'll be ditching the rock to also - there's a these rocks actually absorb more of an ammonium - a night raid it'll actually the plants also appear kind of what these but nowheres near as what those on we'll be using those besides many more just use enough pure rock wall like at the other locations or easier here and you can see that [ __ ] is this saturated get back to lucky it's been a lot I mean the perkiness of the plants that's what you want to see I mean that's you want to see that with any plant in your garden you know you don't want to see a bunch of sad Sally's like that that's just just not fun to look at when they're offered they're smiling they're like yeah [ __ ] you know so within the next I'll say by week four all these lights here will be on I do about 48 hour intervals I turn them up a percentage then I see if there's any issues or anything so far really good next time I'll have a way bigger bigger plants so I didn't expect to add you know all these other plants right here so these were way behind all those over there yeah [ __ ] videos getting long you guys get what the hell I'm talking about so do your research all right how to mix it from drying salts save yourself a ton of [ __ ] money go on a cruise [ __ ] some [ __ ] throw some [ __ ] dank for pennies on the dollar your research", "GHvaluOmwIE": "youtube what up your boy cushy here and today we are gonna open the bubba diagonal cartridge live just so you can see we're gonna see together how much was actually in that last one um it was the pele roja very powerful it was super strong um great

1937 and it's still lasting but we're gonna rip this one this is a great card um but it's great oil but i just don't like how the cards aren't that full so whack this one then we will bust into the

the percentage right on the front yeah they are like terrapin but they're a lot more stronger than therap and they'll like swear they are i don't know it seems like to me but it does remind me of a

what you got to do that's pretty cool what does that say place label on cartridge along the bottom oh that's pretty dope i just found that out is that why i want you to cover up though so you don't see all the headroom or what all right split that like that it's got the little push button on the side and you push out what's she looking like ah let's see see what it is i mean it ain't i don't know maybe they got different cards i don't know if i had the regular select cards i don't know if i had the regular select cards i only had these i just had i just had these select live cards but there is a little look it is fuller than the last one i got the oil um looks about the same color consistency everything this one's a little darker from probably me smoking it uh they use a jupiter c

__ ] that's why i said that that's the teal one how is the flavor on the select cards they're awesome the flavor is phenomenal it tastes like a strain so strain related i had the flour above a diagonal i don't know if i had the wax um but yeah that's a pretty cool thing there's stickers on the bottom all these um peel off put on the cart whatever you want to do with it which is pretty cool i mean that is pretty much the coolest thing about it no the oil is phenomenal i can't even lie it's great oil this one ain't as bad but if you go look at the other video i'll try to pop it up um it

on throw but it's a little bit got that great live resin tastes like a strain ass taste i would i mean i'm sure they're weighing them i'm sure the cartridge is like maybe bigger um or the bar might be different you know i don't know yeah it's got a skinnier bar in it already i can tell these have a fat bar remember i like in the beginning of the dank cartridges like some people would have liked the say they were a gram but the bar in the middle was this wide so it was really only a half gram back in them days like seven months ago but i believe it's a half gram i guess i'm not that mad but it seems to burn up fast it doesn't really last that long like i said open that other one um friday it's sunday and there's still i mean you know some left in it but it is what it is i don't know man i i

alera you just can't beat that and i'm not a big flower person i actually been smoking more flour yeah it was like 38 but then you know i mean they put the thc a on there 38 so it really only brings it down to i'm going to say that's what that's what i mean when it says thca like if it's 99 thca i want to say like it's actually like 83 or 87 yeah something like that it's yeah it's it's stupid it doesn't make no sense it's pretty much a gimmick to sell to make it look like oh my god it's [ __ ] you know i mean that's why um sunny side is actually yeah something like that and nobody even i don't really even know the whole true answer but i know it's you know something like that it's some kind of percentage but it's like a sales tactic i got this yeah when you start eating that um rso

knows", "LjENDvPseVQ": "welcome to 420 Ohio's medical marijuana strain reviews orange 43 by song cultivated by calyx peak is a cross of white fire OG and orange and a tier 2 higher THC strain generally this strain is listed as an indica leaning hybrid but my dispensary listed orange 43 as a sativa for what it's worth the buds are more sativa like in appearance and also seem to function like a sativa when waved orange 43 is presented in a clear bottle test results are easy to read on the back of the bottle and the twist off cap shouldn't be too much of a struggle for patients with pain in their hands or fingers my 2.83 gram dosage largely consisted of two large buds with a few smaller ducts the buds grind a bit sticky so be sure to break up the nugs a little before grinding appearance is a bit frosty as cannabis trichomes bathe every inch of the bud colas it's almost as if the two buds were made up of smaller pieces constructed and painstakingly glued back together by the sticky trichomes in terms of aroma orange 43 he lives up to its reputation this strain will hit you as soon as you open the bottle and that initial burst of aromas will lean heavily on citrus specifically oranges or orange peel from a flavor perspective this drain tastes like a rustic barrel aged orange juice cocktail the terpenes mix in some rather unique ways providing a gentle relaxing vape with a lovely current of sweetness the first rush of flavors lean a bit earthy with pine notes and just a hint of ginger and mint this is followed by a refreshing zing of citrus zest and a smooth aftertaste like orange sherbert or creamsicle the bouquet was absolutely delightful start-to-finish medicinally this strain didn't provide any substantial pain relief I did however note a significant increase in energy and creativity as well as a soothing headband effect that eased anxiety and tension euphoria with this strain is pretty significant due to the higher THC percentage in combination with the two dominating terpenes limonene and Turpin allene if you are sensitive to higher concentrations of THC you may want to take it slow with this strain for those who find that euphoria helps with their headspace or mental health this strain should deliver in spades for you because orange 43 does a great job delivering euphoria this strain isn't exactly the best for rest or sleep rather orange 43 would be best used in the mornings or midday and complemented by an indica like ghost OG at night overall orange 43 is one fascinating strain featuring a dazzling orange zest aroma a refreshingly minty sweet taste and a wonderful sense of euphoria energy and mental relief check this one out if you see it at your dispensary final rating 4.8 out of 5 be sure to LIKE and subscribe

know is it true you turned down eight hundred million dollars to buy your company yeah did you hold on the same because I got to think about this for a second how the [ __ ] did you just say no or you said let me think about it and get back because how do you make a decision of saying yeah I mean look it still [ __ ] with me I mean I had to think about it for a while but I'll give you I'll give you guys some game because this is such a good interview I never really talked about business like this but I want people out there to be motivated and I want people out there to know that like the first deal is not the best deal I cannot wait to wait to write my book about it I want to write you should I'm writing a book called the best deal and so alright I get offered 800 million dollars for cookies in general the whole thing but a lot of it's stuck from a Canadian LP a private Canadian company that's on the stock market I looked at like this if the first deal I got was 800 million bucks and it's mostly stock and the stock game could be like great and then drop and everyone's going public right now what would happen if I turned it down that data makes me pretty pretty much a boss to do that so instead of taking 800 million I took ten million dollars in cash for 10% of my company as a friends and family around to invest into infrastructure and the next round we're doing were evaluated at four hundred million and I'll probably take a small investment at that and we'll build it up and while everyone else is getting bought out right now with Canadian stock they may win but I'm in it to get cashed out for real because I don't want some stock I don't have to learn how to sell stock or waiting and play that game I want one of the big alcohol companies was time to come catch me the [ __ ] out as they should I want Heineken to come cash me out I want a Southern Wine to come cash me out I want them to come with that check cuz they got it constellation just put four hundred million dollars into canopy up there in Canada they put a check well they could have came about me for for no I'm sorry I'm high as [ __ ] four billion mmm canopy it has got four billion dollars we're talking about a publicly traded company in Canada that doesn't have the most revenue I think the revenue was negative a lot or whatever it was they don't have hell of money they just have the brands mmm so I'm building a house of brands it's gonna be like Facebook and when they come they're gonna have to buy us and they're gonna I would much rather a constellation come give me four billion dollars I'll look at that eight hundred million dollars like thank God I didn't do it or maybe I won't but that's that's the risk I was willing to take", "u8rauN0b1U0": "man ain't nothing wrong with smoking weed weed is from the earth god put this here for me and you take advantage man take advantage she's my main [Music] purposes strength have a license card open if you're not gone all right guys first and foremost happy thanksgiving it's thanksgiving even [ __ ] to my midnight medication session so it's probably almost thanksgiving and uh it is thanksgiving i guess whatever [ __ ] it is but anyways uh we got a brand new strain here from care relief um i'm excited about it's a brand new strain to the ctmp i've never heard of my [ __ ] life before until i saw it on the menu truly today healing corner so holy [ __ ] i jumped right on it grabbed it and uh here it is it's called bittersweet bittersweet so bittersweet is apparently gmo and i'm assuming it's the gmo cookies might not be so i don't know i'll say that it's just the gmo if you want to see across the mai tai number four i can't find out which other information online so we're gonna experience ourselves right now let's see i think it's already off the menu unfortunately but if you happen to get it uh that's awesome it's called sapaya sapaya it's like 33 bucks for the eighth it seems like the standard price for cara leaf flower and uh it's 25 thc it's a hybrid and uh let's just see what's going on with this okay so it is frosty as [ __ ] looking there's some purple in there too okay so that's got a real crazy smile there's trichomes all over the bottle this is it kind of definitely like some girl scout cookies for sure um it's got some definitely some kind of cookie energy in there you can see that they kind of look like it it's got this weird like wow that's hard to describe like like a stale spice like a stale flat spice real mild but like stale it's like it's a weird smell like that's kind of a way to describe it i guess all right so not fruity or anything like that by any means and again the buds you know like i said there's so much key from the bottom of that bullet jar right there they're uh they're dense and uh look let's check it out so there's the eighth that's smaller because they said dense buds um i don't know if i can zoom in right here just guys popping out from the screen okay look at me all right so again this is called bittersweet i've never heard of this it looks nice cure leaf always seems to have a real nice looking product i do 100 almost every time and this year's purple ish more purple it's still covered in super controlled but real thick looking dense and there's this guy right here i like this guy he's green sometimes when you get those buds that are like purples and greens the green ones are the actually the better ones i personally think sometimes case-by-case scenario i guess and here's more of the purple side one the darker of the berries sweeter the juice though how that goes nice all right so now the trick is to find out which one i'm going to medicate on i guess i'm going to have to go with i'll go with the bottom sides and we'll do that we'll grab a yeah let's see if i don't need all that yeah [ __ ] it i like these two here yeah like a green one and a purple one one each and i'll do them separately too i won't combine the two so there's the purple there's one on the right and the green one on the left and that's cool wow look at those look at those tracks holy [ __ ] little cluster on my channel see that wow yeah oh yeah it's oops super nice though yeah all right looks like some of the genetics let's see what's going on i'm excited all right let's bottle this [ __ ] up nice all right all right all right so what should we do first uh green or purp let's go green first now and break that up you get this almost like cushy smell we're offensive holy [ __ ] um yeah that [ __ ] just got a lot louder started screaming at me not gonna lie really did like i said tons of trichomes this [ __ ] just pours out of it it literally just breaks apart and then like inside it just keeps crumbling like the inside just fold them too it's not just in the outside layers that's nice so bittersweet so far chalk up would be pretty [ __ ] badass straight let's see what's going on with us bittersweet real thick smoke like real big oh it's got this like weird crazy fruity taste this thing's all over the [ __ ] map with smiles and flavors oh my god that [ __ ] too fast wow oh my god that was pretty bad [ __ ] man all right so definitely feels like some girl's got cookies because that [ __ ] always hits me hard get your wicked [ __ ] this real stoney like a super stoney strain this shit's good wow extremely bone i mean i i don't really know what kind of symptoms this would be good for unless you just want to get [ __ ] medicated like to the point where you know what's going on because it's just [ __ ] some [ __ ] public [ __ ] like yeah all right so if you want to strain this is gonna [ __ ] make your whole [ __ ] just change up just completely changes [ __ ] it's laughing wow i'm super impressed this is a mighty fine piece of marijuana all right bittersweet is [ __ ] honestly at the top of my list i'm not gonna even [ __ ] right now this just jumped right the top and list restraints i've tried in a long time i'm so blown away about how medicated i am how i feel right now i feel great i feel happy i'm just so [ __ ] stoned right now to be honest with you like there's one little ball all right okay so yeah all right we're oh oh my god okay yeah i guess when you break it up these try come just put i wish i want more of this [ __ ] oh my god okay so that was the green one they said oh it's just most [ __ ] tank those little buds break up wow that's nice so okay all right hole number two not needed bone force um ugh i don't there but this is probably honestly that's going the top three strains i'd say for like like a hybrid strain for potency and it's not even that high in thc so this is incredible for me at least i'm [ __ ] off the rocker right now all right guys well i'm not going to smoke this in the beginning of my thanksgiving tomorrow because it'll just [ __ ] my holiday i'm going to save this towards the end but other than that however it is awesome and happy and safe and healthy

what's good patience g ct weed reviews uh medical marijuana purposes only i'm a license caught only from that gotta go all right guys medication time for gregory i'm fresh out of work it's like five o'clock pretty much on the money can't wait to get up here getting out and get medicated um not a strain what the [ __ ] was that jesus christ man anyways uh yeah you got a strain um so pick up this train it's one of the airplanes original sativas um which i'm excited about because i always kind of sleep on the stream i got it once a while ago i thought i was fired got to get a pen a vape form back and then actually it must just caught me off day and it gave me kind of like a headache and i kind of backed off of it for like a minute for years now i get my dan from fair plant like the man dan and i'm like hey would you think of my knee but i think i actually told him for something like i didn't really like it so i kind of felt like a dick and i'm gonna give this round two just gotta redeem myself sorry dad i know this is [ __ ] an awesome strain you really love this and i got a shitload of this strain and like it's a good [ __ ] strain so i'm gonna give this shot again i'm in a steve mood honestly just tell your work to me i can't always smoke sativas i have to be in like this kind of i had a good day i had a good day the ctv is one i'm not having a day you know like my normal ptsd days those nights tv's not really the best thing for me i don't know why they don't work i'm having a good day which i had a good day all day today i had a great family day work day everything was fine sativa seemed to work well me keep me going in a good mood so i think now is a good opportunity to actually sample a neva which is the colorado flow and check it out now a colorado flow strain is a very rare strain like i think like we're one of the few that still have left it's a cut of the flow which is the the purple afghan or purple tie across with the afghan land race you've got that right purple tie african land right purple type of race or purple afternoon with the tidal universe no purple tie definitely race but this is a special kind of it it came from like i'm assuming colorado by the name and i think this is just a good cut of the strain that it's from what research i found it's it's hard to get all of them if anybody has their [ __ ] name so i'm excited about it um i know it's got like a sweet taste to it it's got some purple hues to it everything like that from previously remember and uh let's just get medicated on the [ __ ] shut the [ __ ] up so uh besides that i found the healing corner today truly and uh i mean obviously if you're a patient down there you know what's set up like so i'm at true lady you know i got the car war snack store which they own the property park the car tractor car wash is knocked down they officially wipe that [ __ ] the [ __ ] out smacked it down because they're putting up their new recreational matter around the center obviously we don't have recreational workshop but when the ship pops off they're going to have it right there i think the way they're setting up and i don't know anything in cinematics i'm just talking about my ass in this so i don't have any official statistics but i'm assuming i'm gonna do is have the healing the truly medicinal dispensary that they have currently now justices and leave it up and running and then they're gonna have that be the recreational center or they might put a brand new [ __ ] building and it's not just move over there i'm not sure how it's gonna work but the point is balls of motion i'm always supportive about the program getting bigger yay all right so where excuse me again kind of chocolate to myself when i think about some patience but not chuckled myself at all not in a bad way but that's actually not horrible so i take that back but i wonder to myself like because i get frustrated so that's over these bottles like some or all the old older patients kind of some issues with this [ __ ] and be like [ __ ] time they get that bottle open they need the medication but granted it is marijuana it has to be sealed it's a good seal but that shit's [ __ ] it works good all right so here it is the aniva sativa t26 okay so let's just check this out okay that's nice see now it's got a nice smell to it it's got a spicy earthy musty smell spicier than musty that's the way i would categorize these it smells good though all right so oh and this shit's cheap as [ __ ] by the way you get like the whole ounce right 200 bucks don't lie like this is like i think it's like 30 bucks an eighth they break down a little bit for sure as it goes down and then the whole oh it's like 214 which is straight and these this this but actually looks pretty fire it's definitely caked up and frosty um so if you're looking for a cut of the neva colorado flow this is a good one so far from what i'm seeing all right let's check this out so here's what we got well i mean it's it's a big eighth especially for the price where you're paying and these buds are nice let's i don't know let's just go to the left for like starting purposes i guess but look see how they're frosty just stop right there you can already see them things are cakey it's getting closer like wow wait and then look up that's almost like a wait right there if you ran the sound it's almost like a huge frosty trichome see you right here in the center crazy right so definitely some frosty goodness on this aniva here like everything you see is kind of coated in white trikes um don't think for a minute that because their plant has lower price trans they're not as good that's not true at all they're the biggest producer um they grow more weed in connecticut than anybody else and they happen to be like my neighbor which is [ __ ] awesome so i'm excited about the fact that i'm right around the corner for them look at the [ __ ] tracks on that [ __ ] um cool nice all right we're this [ __ ] byzan hometown grown um i do take a lot of pride in that big time i mean look at this [ __ ] who wouldn't take a lot of pride in that part of our whole medical program oh oopsies and uh i love everything about their plant and the way they run their business they they're uh they're doing quantity but they're not sacrificing quality and they're also passing along the savings to their patients that piece looks nice all right so i'm going to grab a couple pieces which i think i'm going to go with these two at the end here like she was just looking good i'm going to grab this whole little pile right here make two bowls out of that so here's my little mid session break that up in two balls that guy right there a couple stragglers right there those look good that looks good all right so colorado flow um this is on the menu right now i'm truly healing corner um probably a lot of the other dispensers in connecticut right now too so if you want to grab it you can stack it right now obviously this is a good cut of it as you can see and yeah okay okay and then oh when you break these up it's real fuelly fuely smell this shit's fresh it's got that nice crisp you know break up sound crisp and sticky at the same time it's not sticking your fingers triceps are staying right on the butts but the brisk crisps on oh this [ __ ] really smells good okay maybe i'll sleep on this for way too long this this [ __ ] smells like some fire very weird so i got two nice good balls here and uh oh yeah let me give a shout out to big shout out to the dashboard that's what's up but he's been around for a minute we've been doing [ __ ] videos like off and on like watching each other and talking drift for like years now and uh he's hooked up with third place i won't give a shout out to him dancer but um that's cool i hope you hope you do good with him and uh sarah that's a great company to be hooked up with so congratulations really proud of you man that's

extremely smooth and nice all right so steve all day didn't feel thing in my body right to the head it actually like made the lights in the room feel like they're brighter um super clear-headed super clear-headed focused like honestly this big great daytime strain if you want to do pretty much anything i would assume like this will pretty much get you writing the ball it'd be [ __ ] motivated good work strain good school strain good [ __ ] video game stream [ __ ] artist training i've seen all this [ __ ] that creative crap take creative crap sorry about that i don't know um yeah and it makes you happy yeah i'm smiling yeah now i'm feeling squished up my eyes big time and it's definitely going right behind my eyes feels like it's creeping up on you a little bit um definitely uh definitely nice uh kind of uh once it settles in for a second there kind of puts you into a real idea real real serious haze yeah like you wanted to start the wall or something yeah all right so definitely kind of kind of like dumb you down real fast and kind of just slow down your mental state it was all like good for a second but now i'm like yeah just kind of stunning um but in a good way in a medicinal way i'm saying all right so roll number two i feel good i'll be honest this train's nice it [ __ ] kind of slows you down rolls rolls over on you like kind of like a train like a train wreck but the train rolled over real slow it just kept rolling over [Music] [Music] [Music] okay burns of grape with that one well it's nice hold on for dear life right now just hold on for the ride man holy [ __ ]

going to journey cap on the colorado florida yeah all right see you here please", "_QtZ0u9IBi4": "what if I told you that you could create a grow tent for just two dollars and a few other items from around your house would you believe me what if that grow tent could dramatically increase your lights efficiency sound too good to be true well why don't you stick around and I'll show you how it's done [Music] firstly if you've come to this video thinking we're gonna make something like this you're wrong grow tents like this can cost you upwards of $200 and aren't really an option for a lot of us fortunately Cody over at new ket's comm is on Facebook and YouTube as well showed a way to make a grow tent with some really promising results that I want to share with you for this build there's only two components that you need and both of these you can get at your local dollar store first thing is you're gonna need some mylar this is space-age stuff developed by NASA highly reflective and lightweight and you can pick it up for a dollar in the camping section next head over to the kids aisle and we're gonna find a hula-hoop try to find a hula-hoop that's gonna be big enough to fit around your light because this is what we're gonna use to hang the mylar off of that's going to surround your light and help make your light that much more efficient so that's it those are the only two items we're going to need the rest of the items we can get from our home but before we get started we're gonna want to test out our light without a grow tent and to do that I'm going to use a power meter now power meter is used to measure of various wavelengths of light between a specific range the range that this power meter will measure is between the 400 to 700 nanometer range now for the sake of this video we're just going to say that a higher rating our higher power means more available light to the plant than a lower rating so let's get started on getting some measurements so this is the light we're gonna be using for our test it's an HL G 65 by a horticultural lighting group and we're going to do measurements from 12 inches 18 inches and 24 inches away and then we're gonna put the tent on and see how different the light is or how much more like there is with a grow tent so let's get started the rig I'm using is built into the slat wall and I can't get exactly 12 inches but I'll get pretty and that means that before and after tests will be the same height so right now we're probably just about eleven and a half inches for the first test and we're getting about 450 on the power meter so we'll go ahead and move this up and we'll take your other two measurements and then we move it further back to around 18 and there's our reading there and finally we move to the 24 inch interval and we get our reading there as expected the further away we move our light the less effective it becomes so now I get to find out if our big $2.00 investment is going to help us out if you haven't figured it out already the hula hoop is going to go around the grow light and then we're gonna hang the mylar off the hoop so let's get figure out a way to hang this hoop around our light and then we'll get the mylar around the loop so once you've figured a way to hang your hoop either with string or rope or cables whatever you got you might have something that looks like this and then from here we're gonna just tape the mylar on around the light we just attach the mylar to the hoop now a bit of tape that's all that's needed for this process just work your way around attaching a mylar to the hoop if you have a bigger hoop or maybe you've built yourself a rectangle shape out of PVC fittings you might need another blanket depending on how big of a grow light you're trying to cover ok so the next step here is well I think I think that's actually it four steps you get the hoop and you put the mylar around it and you put it around your lights it's just really that easy but as they say the proof is in the pudding or in our case the proof is in the quantum parmi term I Chrome all digital readout we'll just take some readings now let's take a look at our readings and compare that 12 inches without the mylar we were getting a reading of 451 part and with the mylar we were getting the reading of 620 that's a 37% increase that's pretty good that 18 inches we were seeing without around 230 and with 405 that's a 76% increase and at 24 inches we were reading 134 without and with we were reading 298 a hundred and twenty two percent increase something is wrong here something's wrong I'm gonna set this up and do it again let's let's try this again here let's take a look I have it set up here at the 24 inch mark and I'm getting a reading of 304 so I'm going to try not to move anything and just take the hoop off and see what our reading is but take a look it's 304 okay so let's take this hoop off and then see what we get okay I'll plug the light back in and see what we're reading let's do that first [Music] 135 take a look 140 okay that is a ridiculous increase so 120 2 percent increase I'm sure maybe there's somebody out there that can tell me why why this worked so well or what I'm doing wrong because that seems like a lot like how could you not afford 122 percent increase for two dollars seems odd seems like a really good deal it seems like a great deal and I want to thank Cody over at new ket's comm for sharing this idea and inspiring this project thanks for watching and we'll see you on the next one [Music]", "89BV6rVYOBI": "and what's gonna

some but somewhere else maybe another smoke shop and maybe go home because I'm feeling [ __ ] - hi I don't like being out of my house when I'm this I I don't know about you guys but that's just me I'm probably at the our point right now you guys I'm just not feeling good I'm almost really kind of nauseous right now I shouldn't drink that much it was better when I just sipped on it throughout my day definitely do not take all that at one time I would say like what I'm feeling right now you guys is more of a body high more than anything you guys love the most intense crazy body high right now

know about you guys the edibles to me feels like absolute [ __ ] tap I don't know why anybody takes them definitely not for fun I mean if I was feeling sick and I couldn't smoke or if I was an edible type of person I probably was just do it in moderation I would never do anything to it what I took today was 44 doses so pretty much one bottle is 22 servings when I ended up taking less 44 servings
