{"BhOM39nn0Wk": "dude this is me by the flames were a candy company this is the same people that made the toast eight minutes this could be super happy [Music] you're like my resident candy guy thank you I like candy I know you do that's why you're here yeah so today we're going to be trying some ghost pepper heart candies I know absolutely nothing about them at all okay that could be incredibly underwhelming they could be incredibly spicy who are the really go means go ahead go you know look like I I think it's the same candy oh dude this is me by the flamethrower candy company this is the same people that made the toe of Satan made this this could be super hot Shh yeah let's give you really hot I don't know God used I swear you trick me to get into this seat myself into this boy it's actually a very good extract two more on that later oh so this is me both playing freakin a company that's a field event Oh Satan which is incredibly incredibly crabby spicy um sea greens ingredients are quiet by the way we have two flavors is blue raspberry and wild cherry they're both ghost pepper I don't know like the red might be hotter because it's red I don't know um okay sugar corn syrup water artificial flavors citric acid ghost pepper blue number one in sodium benzoate so it's just a ghost pepper this goes it's the exact same ingredients on both of those they should be equally hot which one do you want to try first you want the raspberry it's oddly shaped to like I'm like picking up with the leg I feel like it just it was like one piece both bags feel like that oh that's adorable and they're all stuck together smells like  one off oh you can see like the peppers yeah yeah look it look it I see oh there we go you hold up the light I can see he right through it I feel like a man like a Jurassic butt yeah okay judging by the inside of this I don't think it's gonna be that hot it's stuck to your lip oh yeah you ready you're doing it this candy a little heat all right I'm just sucking on mine me too but do you get a little low heat action there's something very slightly I don't trust my mouth anymore though your mouth is probably broken Mike really is do you have taste buds still I mean I do I say the whole time my mouth is very leveled up my stomach holy schnikeys was it good there's like a juice or some of them really you bit it uh-huh it just like came out the side of it argues yeah like huh gelatin gelatinous going in it was just some weird chunk hanging it's got some spice um I feel like Emma could handle this mm-hmm I feel like rod you could handle this we should warn people uh-oh warning choking hazard yeah um not a heat hazard choking hazard so the more that I'm like I'm Michael by the way so I'm gonna I'm gonna get into the wallet area I don't buy this let's see if it's gonna be any different great hotter why those these are holy either truck the other that was scary dude I got to bite into it kept absorbing into my teeth and not breaking and then I try to release this duck I will say okay the wild cherry one are made better so like you can actually see like the pepper you know a shape of a pepper mm you know I'm working on this - this one has got like I'm not seeing it I mean the pepper is red generally speaking so you might not be able to see it as much in here all right do these are good good flavor mmm good flavor and I'm actually trying to think what this compares to like candy wash so behind on like eating candies we do this is like it's a jolly rancher there you go it's a jolly rancher it's a spicy joy hmm it's exactly what it is it's okay so talking about the heat is it an enjoyable money heat is not enough is it too much no it's not it's not to my level like I'm completely cool like I'm not on fire but it's like you do sense the heat mm-hmm what's enjoyable I agree um I mean for you on my scale it's like a 1 right n about point 5 out of 10 or anything like that I give it oh there's absolutely detectable heat mmm and I like it like most candies when you're to see like a spicy can hear something like that one you're probably talking about cinnamon and - you're talking about this like super artificial flavor but he comes from right this is not that no like I believe there's actually goes pepper in this and I truly believe that what I represent the heat that I'm getting from this although it's mild it's a it's a quality that makes me I always forget this do you like those pepper other idea that's the one yeah the point the one super hot I like scrappy flavors a little bit too but ghosts numbers like the one super hot that I actually do enjoy the flavor okay um so that's why this works well yeah that's good so um super into these um I mean I don't need a lot of candy but this would be I wouldn't say that this is like a challenge like this is definitely like appropriate for like the look it up like Emma your daughter could have it right and could probably have the easily but yeah this look good want to eat you're like 10 of them what um maybe a little overkill there I'm starting to get a little sweat I don't know you got sweat building up oh yeah I'm like your nose and there's Samson your cheeks right there who's that accumulative yeah is it definitely definitely working where do you get a rack me next video tune in for Alex getting erect in the next video because I will I'm going to ruin him now that he's asked for it I need to get the best hold back on here it just all boy video with him he's good alright anyways in the description below be a link to

don't know I was checking checking earlier like 40 we've been under 45 percent all day so huh pretty toasty the past couple of days on with me that had something to do with it yeah first couple armed agents number heard you guys were scared yesterday tornado warning yeah actually I got an alert on my phone oh yeah first I thought that it was saying I was gonna be I was approaching like my data limit and I was like just for NATO warning oh I was like I don't know I was like I'm not really gonna take it very seriously just because is weird like in this we're pretty close to the city like winds have a very hard time looking up you know next to the city right and also it's Syracuse yeah and I live the Kansas yeah still you get a message it's like there's tornado heading your way but you know there is not there wasn't an actual tornado there's any potential nobody seemed that the rotation on the radar so that's why they were like oh nobody has seen it touchdown but yeah yeah it was like I was like 15 minutes the winds weren't even like super high it was mostly just raining yeah oh man that rain came down yeah that's crazy but I guess if I started hearing like the walls creaking and stuff okay I'll go downstairs but I didn't hear like any wind really I mean I I was like worried about it like that but I was like glued to the window like I wanted for a phone o clock yeah well it said that it was coming from the east so I was like [Music] we didn't go to the basement but then we went down there and we were like why do we come down the basement yeah well our basement was not as fun hopefully the Simpsons are taking yeah oh yeah I played that and wasn't really that fun we got over it pretty quick because they basically you just move and then you jump and then you attack and those are the only buttons and then like I played the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle game that Karen I grew up playing did you play - oh yeah no we didn't have you oh you didn't have you oh well basically what the want Athiya at the laundromat oh oh well when I went to Milwaukee it was a hat I played some Simpsons game and then I also played the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle game and wasn't as fun as I remember yeah I guess when when you're little and you're just used to the NES and you haven't had the Xbox one yet you're like wow this is great look at the graphics look at all eight of the pixels this is 16-bit we said this Looney tune for the NES at daycare like we never had one the blouse and I don't know why but I could think about that game so much recently I'm ready to drop like 50 bucks I wish game it was like a Looney Tunes basketball game we used to love project raisin no I remember it was like the airplane game there's like a 2d airplane game Oh oh man yeah and that was awesome and the plates of like great you could like match them up or something yeah do you remember the one the car won and like you'd be wait you're like driving down the highway I think you were trying to like get away from the police or something and there's like a certain the police would catch up to you or something and then there would be like a semi or a semi you know truck and you drive into the bed change your color and you come back out oh no that's like the only part of that game that I've ever taken oh yeah you don't member what game that was oh okay all right so is that kind of all put together then just to walk okay yeah that's candy right there so three and four three and three-quarters just uh first I never make anything one another we did it once before but dreams are hard and pillows wow look at that that looks so cool on the fruit even gonna be able to do like a green green piece like if it's all just talk well it smells so good yeah it does not really good it's got strawberry what's most on the Jolly Rancher like watermelon Jolly Rancher yes always have a work to do great we need someone videotaping me videotaping you guys [Laughter] here yeah chance possible help it maybe we'll just do a green stripe watch your hand oh maybe we did paint body because it's already things okay so it seems it pink by the green stripe can you still make it green though like with mini make green and pink stay really practicing with best bachelor just really try to scrape it yeah virtually invisible are yes spatula you got it Oh like so my glove that's right so we're gonna do green body pick strength right there dude peace that's what we did before hey I know I know I know I know Green Valley thinks it's a modern elements like remember you don't remember how you did it I know we did it that came out good yeah and I think I have I think I wrote down there I think Friday 3:00 and strike what if I put green in here what's gonna happen with this color we want to turn it well you turn this train probably turning brown brown yeah we don't wanna yeah but we still have to have two colors here yeah we'll just leave this color pull it under them take release I know we'd that'd be so controlling crazy doesn't water long before yeah he did green by who did do it and I got my notes if you add green it's gonna overpower well go ahead look at any old snaps and I will do this you know actually I think I do remember reading that flavor yeah I know we did you do that an extra hand here can I make up the next petal we're gonna go ahead make a petal in our life I'll do something here speaking as Steve I'm envisioning it and we did a green body right bones aren't good with their custom well I want thinking green however we do it okay we'll get ready what if you guys just broke off the little tiny piece and then just put in like one drop of food coloring to see what color it changes it to remember being like we only did it one time mix is destined to watermelon this is a brand-new bottle or no we only have the one all right smells good watermelon ewwww yeah no smell really good and you no matter the color it's gonna taste great listen I can turn shop yeah okay so you want to do pink body green stripe I still want to add like a little drop of red so it's a little bit more vibrant a pink because watermelon is more vibrant pink thing did you pull this it's gonna be pale pink we want to take our piece off yes we do Green yep we'll just agree of course this is the part where I wanted max to do it but uh this is this is the part the learning part that I wanted to match is just how much to add yeah and handling the small you've done that before have you sorry you have you've done have you colored small stripes yeah okay I guess back in the basement hmm can you can have that that big blob see you kept custody in a big blob I'll take a little bit more for my straight would you think that us discussing the stripes and get cheers over on your side more drama yeah he's also develop flavor it is great no keep Gary strawberry know like required yes i'm the cut-open and put it my backseat the darker color is just going yes not here won't know the whole thing deployment yeah well no I was wondering if that yeah is it just food coloring yeah this way Brenda right we flavor the whole batch I was just wondering if it's gonna go to Jersey - mind blowing flavor it like two separate dogs like partner flavor that sense they were that sided yeah you know now that you've said that I'm not saying I'll never do that favor what's your flavors would be complimentary no I mean lemon lime a big one right we're in the future now and you can see that they are packaging up peanut butter fill driven candy well I just wanted to let you guys know that we now have whole yeah shirts available because a lot of people in the last video left relieving comments saying that they wanted those shirts and what I was thinking is in the future if you guys really like a certain saying or really want a certain thing on a t-shirt just leave it in the comment section we got enough people requesting it then I can make it on t spring and I will let you guys know in the next video when it's available so what I'm thinking is would be like a limited time only and then once you guys decide you want another shirt then we'll make that and now just like replace those shirts so if you want the whole yeah shirt check out in the description before it goes away back to the rest of the video you do like yellow and green Dan then you might be on something and if we get sick of making the same old flavors over and over we'll get into the two-tone what else could we do too bad this wasn't a live stream huh we access an American classic and then the next one I am breaking bread trying hot dogs fantastic oh that actually didn't ring yeah because I did it before yeah and dad doesn't remember or believe me so I'm just let him have his way I'm surprised like I don't know cuz it was like so pink and you would think good heavens way when you've been married for 35 years which we just celebrated 35 years of bliss yesterday [Music] by number two the first year can be a little awkward like who takes out the garbage who knows of that yeah oh honey I already watched this it was you wouldn't like it was though I wasn't in either so Mac says how you do it oh very good thing well no I was wondering why yours keeps just like flattening out and hers doesn't but I think yours does too well mines getting - remix and quickly cuz it's smaller so it'll get cool off faster he's got more leeway because he's got bigger blob so pretty soon she's gonna start mixing it up pretty well because what but also what he's throwing it on the vocal it mix it a little bit but he does want to be sure not to get on his gloves that's the color on is on most puffs because tired to get out of both of us yeah SoDo with colors sweet are done with colors so next we've got raspberry and grape so we're just in the purples after this okay so where you guys come from Batavia oh did you go in there yeah we were gonna stop and we went up to our friend pallet palaces in the McKinley mouth it's a sponge candy we were we when we bought a few things from him kind of odd to stop it I love it on the way back over here just two tires home get unloaded no so words like oh I'm relieved next Oliver okay can you take over yeah I'm in oil shipping so I feel like I should finish FedEx DPS are coming whether I'm ready or not yeah how do you know when you had to put it probably

everything smaller you know oh yeah all the equipment and stuff that you had down there - yeah yeah I love that cable yep yeah it was funny when we got everything in here is like I don't know how we fit it all in a little but we did it suppose this couple decides or something and then the first two weeks were robbers and we thought oh this is far bigger than we really need but that's okay we'll grow into it and then by the third or fourth week now why do you have to keep mixing it I'm just looking at and stuff because I want to see how it is flowing wise put it on the Hulk I gotta be able to handle this load slowing down a little bit each time almost ready oh that's when I graduated from yeah I was I was a super senior I supposed to graduate until the 14 but I'll be here so I should wait a while I think by my senior year I was looking at the crossings no the crossings are just on the other side of like corner and like Harrison that's cool new big exercise physiology and kinesiology

yeah okay this is good no see we're going to get going to back in November apparently is from like tungee youtubers right now they you too big yeah and I saw just from the YouTube comments there's some people there's a lot of people saying like hey I stopped by yesterday wow really Wow ya think because like obviously I think the viewers realized that online sales increased whenever there's a video but there's also a lot of people coming in to the stores from out of town from the YouTube videos oh yeah so people just forget to consider that there well I don't think that like videos necessarily have to do that but basically from the YouTube channel goodness has increased in walk you don't want to know when you get to yes I mean you don't want to squish it up and stuff because then you'll never I'll mess up the stripe so just try to keep it at this one size as if it keeps squishing that yeah I was thinking about that but I'm like well I can't have it be three feet long either how do you keep it and just keep with the same size you just can't really formula moving a lot on me the extra hot now you're getting in my way now you know what it's like want to be in your way worry about that dance around each other all day we start the next batch right now are you alright remember that time literally the first time all day you guys done watermelon root beer orange lemon lime one of their flavors you guys doing today guys great great some people have asked why we call fruit friendly not all the flavors are very quick birth sorry root beer run player new putter Scott yeah I've done photos got before that was really good you got another very hard candy first the first time I tried the blueberry and oh we had the boys yeah I think the mango one needed more laborers I think that's why I didn't like as much as the blueberry just wasn't as strong let's try that again and we made the peanut butter yeah holy cow and that is some good stuff yeah really good yeah I think it would be good to have the mango again and just like another another shot a flavour about you really good yeah this just seemed extra soft yeah maybe way I can just kind of watch you do it a little bit across the whole thing crossed all the way sliding across kind of losing it shine up here that's kind of what was happening we're shining what I was doing it fine you know I think it's when you chop it it dulls it like watch see on now it's not shiny up here I haven't tried it yet Capri shiny it's very sight haven't tried it yeah well I tried the whole like you know when you get it a couple weeks or months ago I try the back then it was really good I my favorite one in the back that's right we'll have to get a review for this video ends and I know sweets not your favorite but

get out of here yep all right well let's get out of here [Music]", "dNZfj05JpLs": "hello and welcome to lofty pursuits and public displays of confection where candy store in a soda fountain in a toy store in Tallahassee Florida thanks for coming by today we're going to make some hard candy and we call it image candy because each piece will contain an image in the middle of each one and the artwork we're going to do today is going to match the flavor we're going to do an image of a cross-section of a watermelon into the sugar we've poured that's about 310 degrees Fahrenheit we're adding food coloring and we're going to stir rapidly and it's going to boil out all the excess water and the food coloring to keep the candy from getting sticky today we're using three colors for our candy black pink and green [Music] our candy cooling table has done its job and dropped the temperature of the candy tremendously but the edges are cool to the point we can handle them but the center's are still blistering hot and liquid we gotta cut the candy apart into its colors that we're going to use and then fold it back and forth to even the temperature out so we can work with [Music] candy without food coloring is an amber not a white and we need a white for this pattern so we put it on our candy making hook and Juran pulls it again again folding and millions of air bubbles each one of these air bubbles reflect light and when she pulls enough of the man that several million in fact she will have a candy that is a nice white that we can use [Music] for this design we also pull the red to make it pink we wrap the cool rod that we made out of the black candy with warm pink pulled candy and this is going to become the seeds but we need more than one seat in a watermelon and we're going to do that by duplicating it I've always loved watermelon I used to grow them in Brooklyn when I was a kid yes farming in Brooklyn at the Brooklyn Botanic Gardens they had a children's garden there and one of the fascinating things I learned about watermelon as they started as a bitter almost inedible fruit in ancient Egypt but they started cultivating them because they could store water in them for months during the dry season and break them open and crush them for water they really do live up to their names and then they bred them to be tasty and of course this candy is the tasty version of the water problem [Music] you know you can try this candy for yourself we sell it over at www.pdfsupply.com to scale it down we do that gently so we don't distort the image and we pull the log into rods and eventually we roll the logs to cool down we stop at any point the candy will go flatten the design will be destroyed so we keep it moving almost all the time [Music] [Music] if you enjoyed this video there are lots of others on our candy-making channel here at lofty pursuits if you want to see new ones we come out with them every week or two and you can subscribe to us we'd appreciate that we also are on Facebook and Twitter and we're at WWE Network an buy this candy and try it for yourself and see how good it tastes the candy is more than just a pretty looker if you're interested also follow our feeds and you'll find out what we're doing next week we're going out to visit a couple of other old candy stores and soda fountains and we're going to be blogging about them online thank you for watching [Music]", "2QMXLRUbvkU": "[Music] welcome back to free Mike here we are making watermelon infused it well cannabis infused watermelon candies today hard candies so let's do this so I got everything ready here is one and a half cups of infused light corn syrup how you doing today Russell what are you guys smoking on anything good hey guys doing some watermelon infused candy today because I don't know how it happened but I got a phone call this morning saying that we are completely out of edibles at the dispensary which is crazy we should not be out of it this is a third different cup of infused butter so I use infused whipped butter and infused corn syrup and we infused this with a pretty even dose of indica and sativa this is three 1/2 cups of sugar plain water it has a little little watermelon flavoring in it hey guys I'm going to do is I'm just going to kind of stir this up so we can look in the pot so I have infused corn syrup and infused butter in here as well as sugar water I'm the only thing I have left to add is the flavoring so what I'm gonna do is mix this really good and start bringing it to a boil and infuse but tired yeah this this will give you a kind of a head high as well as a body high you will get the euphoria with these candies I use I use an actual indica and sativa so it is a broke up trim of actual sativa and indica it's not hybrids so these are 2 together a pure indica and eight peer sativa put together to give us a pretty even body head high pain medicine this should calm your body down from any of the anxiety shakes tremors things like that do it yeah you know I think we all have stronger moments at times I call the chemo fog because I think chemo did more to my memory than anything so now that I have all of this really good and mixed up I can actually put Meister away and just go ahead and let it boil so right now you can really smell the cannabis you can smell the sweetness you can smell that but you don't really smell the watermelon yet because in to the mix this is super concentrated watermelon concentrate that I will put it that I'll be putting in here so basically I'm gonna put this on the stove I have my candy thermometer in here I want this to reach about 320 degrees and I don't want it to reach that fast I want to do it kind of slow because as it's working its way up what'll end up happening is it'll boil the water off that I added into the mixture boiling that water off allows for the mixture to activate itself and in fully infuse without burning it and that's very important so we want to keep this a butter between 250 and 300 but I do want it to hit 300 once and then I'm gonna bring it back down hey Kevin how you doing today you smell you actually spelled my name the way Nikola Tesla spells his name so that's the male version of Nicola the female version of Nicola is a C instead of a cane so it's Nico LA instead of n I K so you actually spelled Nicola like Nikola Tesla so just so you know and if you ever really have a problem remembering you how does how to pronounce my name just think of Nikola Tesla because we do we both pronounce it the same way well he did pronounce it anyway when he was what sorry I believe in a big Tesla fan Nikola Tesla fan nut car I like cars that go fast so today when we're doing our candies everybody has asked me how I make my candies the smaller sizes because finding some of the candy molds are kind of difficult so for those of us that are using cannabis that we dab quite often I'm sure all of us have seen the little containers so these goes straight into the plastic containers it's just a little silicone thing then you have your little silicone containers like this I use these particular ones I take and I wash them all up really good and then I use them as my candy molds so it's easier all I have to do is line a cookie sheet with them and then I can put them in each one oh it's no problem Kevin don't worry about it I just find it interesting most people spell my name like Nikola Tesla because he's he's famous but it's no worries no worries at all pretty much from this point on you really don't need to stir to too much you're gonna let this roll into a boil and you're gonna also keep a very close eye on your thermometer so I have this set where I don't want it to go over three hundred and fourteen degrees right now it is at two hundred and fifty-five degrees as the steam goes up you'll see all the water evaporating out of here and that's when you'll see the temperatures start to rise which is really nice it gives you a good clean infusion without burning your cannabis all it smells great can we do eat it the smell will be really really good when I add the watermelon flavoring in on this now for those of you that are kind of watching this they're like okay most people have everything in and cook it and do it the way that they just do it all at one time the reason why I separate my flavoring away from the rest of my candy mixture when I'm cooking it it's because I don't want to burn the flavoring because you can the flavoring is very very easy to burn and to singe and it doesn't taste very good once you've done that so you have to be careful hi um english-only sorry I know a little bit of other languages but not enough to really do much so but one of the things that you'll start noticing with your candy mixture is you're letting it go ahead and boil you don't need to constantly stir but you'll see that the mixture inside the bubbles will start getting a very clear Brown clean look to it and that's when you're gonna start noticing that the water is pretty much going away the earth evaporating out like it's supposed to you're gonna start noticing that your temperature is gonna keep going up a little bit more quickly so you're gonna want to keep an eye on that but again you do want the mixture to hit 300 degrees once and by once it doesn't mean it needs to be in the 300 degrees for a long period of time a short period of time is fine so today I'm gonna do this a little differently I'm gonna use it if you different types of molds I'm gonna use my dad containers as a mold and show you how I do it with that I'm gonna make some bunny butts for Easter with the watermelon candies and then I'm gonna make some squares so that's basically what I do is I just get silicon containers it's easy I don't have to worry about anything I don't worry about melting my pot or melting anything into it it works it works good so as you can see I am nicely putting it in there you can see that the bubbles are it's a full boil very clear we are evaporating that water out of there we are sitting at about 241 degrees so at this point you can just let it sit here and let it cook off while you're doing that you can set up your molds and it cookie sheet especially if you're using your your dad containers it's easier if you set them all out on a cookie sheet first now I always recommended you it with the plastic or silicone containers and the reasoning for that is because it's harder to break if they don't melt with glass trying to get the candy out you will break the glass I've seen it done a million times so stick with more of a silicone type of a mold I just do this basically what happens is you can just take and pop the candy right out so it works really really well so I just pretty much get my mold ready to go and set them up on the counter because once this process gets going and setting look at taking those candy off the heat it's going to cool very quickly so I need to have my sandy area ready to go so as you can see I have my area set here I have these all set out I have a silicon tray here in case I want to make shatter shatter candy I'll lay them in here let it harden and then break it that's how you make shatter candy so that's how I have all of this set up I don't know if I'll use them all yet but at least they're there okay we're sitting at two hundred and fifty-two degrees so we want to hit this to at least three hundreds one time so I need to just keep letting it go I don't need to stir it beyond this point until it put my flavor in with this I used I'm using super concentrated watermelon flavoring all of the recipes will be up on the website too so that we you can refer back to the website anytime you need to look at it with this I do most of my candy says a is a heavier infusion slowly I can eat them throughout the day and use them as pain medication so I use both and infused corn syrup and infuse butter in my candies so I'm looking at about 70 milligrams per piece of candy to make it safe so it's it's a decent milligram there you can eat one you can eat two even meet three depending on how bad the pain is or how uncomfortable you are they're gonna be amazing cuz wait till I send you some because I'm definitely sending near some or we'll get you over here we need to get you over here and so we do a video with you sweetie yeah guys let her know there are Miranda Lynn you tell her she needs to get over here and we gotta cook cuz get your butt over here we got some infusions to do because I got new pot art I got a new book new stuffs to play with check this one out haha we're gonna be doing some serious brownie infusions yep so I'm just gonna keep the boil boil boil so you'll see it the color becomes richer and darker and clearer it's not a hazy coloring here at all so I'm just gonna let that go ahead and you really don't need to stir it at this point I'm trying to make sure that I get as much of it off of the sides of the pan as possible because I didn't use my little wet sweat my wet flap to clean off the side so I'm trying to make sure I don't have any crystallization so that's the only reason why I'm stirring is to keep my candy from crystallizing but here you can see how pretty it is see the color in there so these won't be a real red they'll be kind of a brownish red color but they will tasty yummy okay so we are up to 264 degrees as you will notice the less as the steam starts evaporating is we have less and less steam you're gonna notice that my temperature gauge is going to go up significantly quicker and that's a good thing because it's letting me know that I've got most the water out of my candy and that I will be moving to the next step here soon I just want to get all of that back in there so I am not even going to think about putting my watermelon flavoring into this until I've hit the 300 degrees possibly 320 and that's when I'm gonna put my water on flavoring in here because then I'm just gonna let it cook a little while longer and take it off the heat it'll be ready to be put into it it's mulch so we are up to 270 so as you see the whit as the water keeps evaporating out the temperature the Blessed water the quicker that temperature is gonna rise so once you hit about 250 degrees and you start noticing that it's going to rise you're gonna state this pot don't walk away from it because I've watched people walk away from these pots at this point and within three minutes they've burnt it because it's gone well over 320 degrees we do not want this to ever reach over 320 degrees if that happens you will have burned your cannabis in here and it has it will have a burnt taste to it it is not yummy so be careful here we are less than a minute later and we're at we're at 282 degrees so you'll see 284 degrees now so it does jump pretty significantly quick once we get to this point yeah I believe they ran out of edibles shame shame shame I mean I'm glad there's enough I'm glad people like the animals but tell me before we run out so you'll see how it stays rich and dark right now you get you really get more of the sweets cannabis buttery scent to it so it has a very sweet smell you can definitely smell a smell the butter and and the cannabis in there kind of a fruity flavor kinda or scent to it oh I wish you could bottle the scent and send it off to you guys what we're also going to be doing the root beer of candies again - we have just reached our mark that's why that a beeper went off on us so now it's time to get this in there ready oh yeah lovely so this is oh wow you can smell the watermelon Wow Wow oh my god guys you can smell this watermelon something fierce oh and it is red look at this love love love love now I have this off the heat at this point I can add it back to the heat oh wow Oh YUM so young a little warm but really good so I'm gonna throw this back on the heat for just a couple of minutes that you take a look at what it looks like in there now I want the fire off simply because I just want to keep this warm enough okay so now I'm just wanting to kind of take a Scooby and I'm just gonna let it drip into the little molds and yes it does make a mess and then really all I'm doing is just filling them up one of the fun things about doing it this way however is that I make a whole bunch of little drips on to the pan and then I'm going to use those little drips as as decorators decoration on other stuff so these ones are all filled [Music] we can redo it sweetie you can also take these and put them in a bottle to make it a little bit easier I'm trying to do this quickly so because they can be little hardened in the pot sorry I'll look up here in a second so here's this tricky now we're going to move to a beat next ready oh my god they smell so good this is the first time I've used the strawberry or the watermelon recipe on this my bunny boots so I'll probably give a few bunny bucks away for Easter this year just because bunny butts are fun so those are the bunny butts well I have good flavor to it too it has a really good watermelon cannabis flavor to it so not only can you taste the watermelon but you can taste the cannabis Oh yummy yummy yummy oh I don't probably spin any sweetie you don't waste cannabis no no actually all of the hairs and stuff that you see that I pull off I will be using those in another type of candy so all of this leftover stuff fits in here I will still be using see all the little strings I love making candy I just love cooking I don't eat but I like to cook go figure however I'll tell you what as far as eating and stuff when it with my eating disorder hard candy really helps me for some reason it doesn't bother me to use hard candy I don't feel like it's doing an evening I don't feel like it's hurting me but I still use hard candy all the time I've known several people with eating disorders that can't because their eating disorder doesn't allow them to and by that is really simple they just it's a it's a mind over matter thing that it will actually make them throw up when they need something like that so it kind of sucks so hard candies like this help a lot so if you'll see when you make stuff like this what I can do is since it's still pliable and movable I can actually take this and turn it into like a flower like a rosebud and kind of and I'll show you it later but what you do is you take your candy you get it warm make like a little rosebud put a hole in here and then you can smoke through it and still get the flavor of your candy oh my god that's good Wow oh yeah I'm using this recipe again oh that's really good flavor too so that's just as easy as it is then you just pick all of this up so would you see that's all of the fun stuff that I'll play with with my candy and that'll be for what I'm doing my Easter candies and stuff I'll take some of these to decorate the Easter eggs and things like that for when we give it mmm so yummy so it's really that simple to do these candies um they're done I'm just gonna put in the refrigerator let them cool off then I'll pop them out and show you guys what they look like so thanks guys I will be back later have a great day [Music]", "htlG9-jQyso": "hello and welcome to another episode of totally not Nigel I'm totally not Nigel your host [Music] today we're going to be looking at the fourth in our series of eight reviews of clays old-fashioned hard candies we looked at the horehound the anise and the green apple flavors now we're going to focus our attention like a laser OB mo on watermelon flavor that's right watermelon flavor hard candies now fair disclaimer I am NOT a fan of watermelon flavored candies because the artificial watermelon flavoring that they use in most cases is terrible and it is not very tasty whatsoever and no matter how they try to gussy it up it just never ever seems to be good but who knows occasionally you find an exception and perhaps today's review will prove my general theory about watermelon flavored candies incorrect there other flavors have been very good surprisingly even the anise flavor one which I didn't care for licorice flavors whatsoever even it was kind of fine probably be really awesome if you like that flavor so let's give this a try fans of watermelon flavored candies let me know in the comments below have you tried this do you like it I like it you wish it would go away let's give it a chef shall we now that we've opened it we'll give it a smell that artificial watermelon smell is not good not if another fan of that but it does smell a little like watermelon so if that's your thing yeah they got you they got you covered dense here we go we've got a little bit of a sugary coating on the outside of all of these probably helps them to keep from sticking to each other in the bag and it adds an extra little flavor component that being said this is one of the best artificial watermelon flavors I've ever tried it's actually quite pleasant which is amazing so I'm going to give this a very high recommendation actually even if you don't like watermelon flavored things your hosts include it's good it's refreshing it tastes kind of like watermelon which is shocked because a lot of times artificial watermelon flavor is know as bueno it's kind of like get by so close to Sandia not Guinea wait some more with this one yeah I like it yellow tartness to it a little body a little heft it reminds me very much of watermelon which is excellent a lot of watermelon candies don't like here's some passing tones of watermelon flavor and now onto the chemical portion of our program enjoy it suckers that this well done well done clays made a convert here I will reach for the Clay's watermelon whenever it's put out in that fancy little dish that people set around at the holiday time or any time of year so maybe in the summer watermelon candy would be really good then - so only if it's this though now we'll continue to try others and see if there are other additions that are worthy bit this one highly recommended well that's it for

some interesting territory to be sure starting with peppermint Cheers [Music]", "0DR3s3E1VwM": "first pass of the day first batch this morning what is tiny bit more look at that you'll be a professional one day you gotta just think in this turn you know yeah they're just having had the bigger bag I don't know why but you take sugar sugar right [Music] fewer forgotten ahead that no don't think so it's just a habit so i'ma start today I've never really looked it up to see exactly the properties of it to what it really knows what my father and my uncle's always said it was just to stop cracking it's for the hood if this for the sort of cheese a fan on the go outside Karen which I get other people yeah most smell outside like you when you said you were a kid becoming on getting off the bus right yeah I'd smell the candy and you knew what we were doing hey I can smell on the park console packs the old days was following the publication small not yeah [Music] [Music] regular [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so every lemonade was going to be the first batch but I I messed up with it like that because I didn't do that all right with them we're supposed to be 24 Compaq for you - 21 are you it's just because you most of the time to do 21 pounds yeah I'm just not to have it I put it together and that was that yeah yeah I realized later worse things have happened to it oh yeah like what crack mean one so for this condom good part that's the other day you guys burned that didn't happen so we're gonna just pour half yep that's good you'll have to scrape the kettle yellow they might want to get the last chick a mini letter then we're gonna add strawberry in the kettle some actually go ahead and do the lemon oh no I've got one 3/4 I believe you you crunched the numbers I wrote down what was she putting they're pretty stronger remember we just did this driver this one oh wait you did write it down yeah you said to take point here two and three quarters it's one of the worst it's I got it written down I'm telling you three quarters it's two or three quarters for lemonade one three quarters for card remember we were just talking about how strawberry gets three shots here double batch and lemonade gets the five shots yep that makes sense next doesn't think this he'll be very awkward but he does I'm just his heels they were dug in okay okay I guess worst-case scenario just isn't growing strawberry well do you put too much strawberry and it takes chemically don't want that this good I just want to make sure it was like a compass it's so cool over there if you like it does smell a little bit chemically but also like Captain Crunch and over here there's no men women hands huh well just look lemon oh my god yeah this smokes just like oh yeah it calls just like hold yeah well it was calling off a little bit you want to stay in there bring it back to the basement we have to pour this bench Craig yeah so you need me recycling me out right here okay let's not burn that to you it's so annoyed so I was thinking some crazy candy related thoughts I mean some off-the-hook stuff I'm almost afraid to say it but I miss it because I forget it but don't forget it I'll remind me know the savour would know nothing not to see every line of every candy I was thinking of what if we put something crunchy and like what if we got crushed up Oreos and added into peanut butter peanut butter full mandatory all just murdered us for reals yeah and peanut butter and then maybe a free chocolate cover yes yeah so I have an idea that I am pretty certain would work be and I know that because one of our viewers actually did it and sent us pictures and it came out really great they did caramel filled ribbon candy well we totally want to do that don't try that our example yeah they didn't yeah well we had apple pie so should we do that which go for our plans the summary only it's a public experiment but SMERSH Mona seems to change this all up yeah it's over I'd still like to try that out because I'm gonna be me but yeah that would be pretty cool but then I had another one we're talking about I came here what flavor ribbon candy we were talking about the other day Cara was there she's saying well what could we fill that flavor with cuz you don't feel things with they ask you how you are you just have to say that you're fine when you're not really fine but you just can't get into it marshmallow fluff chocolate I was thinking what if we took actual cream max actually cream some crushed Oreos in the back into cream request Orioles in the cream and then we put that in urban candy justic Crisco and confectioner sugar make our own Oriole fill and fill it with that we could make like oh my god because we could take the the chocolate liqueur uh-huh like a chocolate flavored ribbon candy and then really ribbon we did anyways yeah and then just fill it with Oreo filling oh okay if you put it in just cream I think that they would get like Siamese huh I really like well I was also thinking wouldn't it be interesting if we crushed Oreo into creamy feta green Oreo cream green I'm talking to treatment we make for our starters I know crazy but I think yeah I'm saying just take some cream you've you know and you'll drop it don't don't starts facets that in the middle of ribbon candy and then you can have a flavor whether it be Oreo or whatever that you're like fruit flavored oils we could do anything if we did if we put out your ice cream oh we have people are want maple maple pecan and there's my crunches I just asked for fresh pecan and oh wait crushed up Oreos to cover the whole thing okay yes Oh ain't you glad well if you wanna you can make him 24 cuz the watermelon all the watermelon we need maybe should make it 24 we I mean we need so much watermelon orange you glad this is probably so wait you something take it down put in the hook yeah oh yeah you see that's way too soft it's just sticking to the table so let's talk about strawberry lemon-aid so I don't know if you picked up all that wasn't we flavored lemonade this one we played strawberry I was dropping here no we figured instead it's like pouring both in there we thought we'd keep himself at the trial that's how that worked out and we we might get some point inside football flavors in one pedal and see how that works so today is May 30 and this strawberry lemonade is going into our fruit and friendly bash but by the time you guys see this video I'm friendly badger probably sold out yeah and the strawberry lemonade assuming it tastes good cuz this is an experiment we're just trying it out but hey let me taste great Oh strawberry tastes great alone why would the taste great together me so that time you see this video we'll probably be doing separate flavors women in is a separate flavor to buy as a standalone flavor yeah because we we just tried that out with watermelon and put that video up one yesterday can't start out with 120 bags of it it's gone and that's where we're making more today kind of on the fly we're gonna make another 48 pockets today but there's just so much to candy makers can do out yeah they're giant they're trying valiantly but it's kind of like trying to push a boulder a really big one up a hill and sometimes it rolls back with crushes this is what Mitch fossil wants to make up strawberry-banana hmm right I think we should do a bunch of bananas in a bag blueberry banana mmm banana Irish cream Oh banana anise banana peanut butter banana peanut butter would be killer good the Elvis heart candy you certainly feel tired just watch me yes I mean do you wish you were me I'm not tired I just thought the water table should be much more bringing it over warm seems like a good idea until you realize that like you can't trap the air in felt school that just means that you're no longer just doing this for fun just do more work for longer yep yeah your mom kicked in my side you see I like its second form the strands in it and stuff like that's usually like you know when it's super cold it's not it's very pretty quick get that nice silvery look though that'll be cool yeah if you pull it can you call it too much like was it was like I'm a lot of it way more because it kind of stopped oh no it'll it'll keep trying Baltimore white yeah yeah we've never thrown into like it like right now on rough you just saw but like it just got a lot paler yeah kind of go on for that like silvery can I make it a hammer please hammered telling the cameras that's a beautiful collar hey how did you do this it actually feels fluffy hey I think you pulled it you really did this is puffy feeling are you calling me yelling Oh yellow yellow belly how'd you make all right we talked about like the Old Yeller esque movies like what was up with that what you're like let's make kids really sad Shiloh Old Yeller what's the other one Bambi there's that one between two ferns do you remember occur between red fern where the red friends grow that's what I never saw it though wait what the book yes I've never seen that car hmm yeah classic motif boy s dog boy doesn't have dogs yeah the brave doesn't have dog in sad way talks to the hound lady in the all right think so I think there has any okay let's don't bring that up yeah I'm sorry come on I'm gonna cry right into the strawberry I was just gonna say is this a good pink or should I keep lighting it up I need your strawberry you're awesome he knows you can do a strawberry but don't do a raspberry I can't wait to taste this I wonder if it's okay if everybody before lunch I gotta call my mom I want you to trust him right now no I said I call my mom okay I guess I guess that going now hmm how close did you come I guess AR purple or I mean this one this color here this light right here there's a little bit larger there you go do it do it you well yeah this one's really soft a college dealer plates I can tell this is 24 pounds I didn't realize he was gonna be together the old days we've done this before but we put him back to the back what flavors we gotta do that way to do two flavors in one yeah [Music] I guess Lord or twenty pound batches pete'll it would it would save us a whole 45 minutes of cook time you know what is it your arm zone would you be able to pull it oh you'd pull it in two different two halves you know they'd be two separate flavors I mean one flavour ran into the next warm funny this way we used to do it to save time especially if you're doing half batches you don't want to cook up like 10 pounds of time does Oh I forgot to bring moving or [Applause] yeah I saw that because they're talking about you have a second favorite SNL star you know first or second favorite you have the ranking in your head I mean Will Ferrell's probably but I really like John Belushi is Santa present shiny all right so what do we have to do for the water bug and we're going to throw the green is that what we did last night yeah yeah everybody knows watermelons are pink in black and brown looks like a whale you is that belong [Applause] [Music] [Music] Wow that's good just come back one more piece of candy laughs you know [Music] I'm telling you this batch and the last won't like by the end of it I can feel it I make your flooring it's mostly like in my shoulder looks like you two right guys what can't you break eye contact let me say that I was just met with you [Applause] nobody I'm telling you ever gotten a good okay ID in a while extra dump will conquer the world okay well I think it's just because it's cold it's it's softer than old Hawaii just watch stuff we do it man [Applause] probably just device and Ida scrutineers lie no me Craig [Applause] all right so like after this point it's just gonna be strawberry we control that yeah we keep that separate no no no I mean it touched the lemonade and got kind of a fix right here voila sent my line kids [Music] if you right now oh they let it get cold then once it's called [Music] these pants that's well okay but a month this week's yeah Fellman right nari all right oh hey I gotta say three chilling down the hatch but alright charity putting her mouth Dadar traveling off camera I got strawberry immediately I got lemonade immediately yeah so no hands aside I had it done yeah I got Captain Crunch and free loops immediately look at the crunch berries yeah I'm getting crack one open there's a cereal yeah baby I will say this I like it's good it is good just try it with some milk in a bowl mm-hmm eating basically so let me name you take over the strawberry bud doesn't like a real heavy I like how you can twirl in your mouth and it's like all different plated like sweet yeah we can't call it sweet though I do they're not taken lightly really good don't folks how many thumbs are gonna give this man we always give it to Oh and putting comes up my toes get your pinkies okay just the correct right legs up we can put Karen's and reward comes in here all that technology doesn't exist yet because the thought watermelons crush your old box something good yeah and I know life will be changed you know really dank but not by the part like where you choke on it yeah you're gonna have to meditate over that damn I don't know what that's all you have to try anymore just gonna have to make pieces you can become okay Terry okay panting adjourn it is meeting adjourned is [Music]", "vpd8uzCalC8": "before we started the watermelon I would just like show you guys how beautiful this tight eye candy is and you can kind of tell where this batch ends right here is just like very like almost orange heavy and over here I think the Blues are really coming out never here like the green and purples really I think this is the most beautiful batch so far they go I think so yeah yeah something about the crayons over there so anyway that's the secret you know who use crayons no refunds oh yeah and I work on the water okay next dan yeah yes it didn't sound exactly like a question well I said we're working on the hard water melon heart can you next row I think you thought ice is just a statement oh yeah I realize that I said it watermelons next yeah two of them and then lemonade oh yeah this attorney a bit more when you patent they're gonna try to get that yeah wouldn't pieces yeah sometimes the corn syrup must be getting a little bit warm so that's a little stickier than usual so usually I don't have anything let's go you do anything other than prevent linking your though that's all pulley at home from cracking and flaking but I get that cold gonna crack some flakes just wait you learn this thing recipe so that's what I do yeah I want change the recipe and he's gotta wait for the other one to come off your burger that one on yep it's only a one kettle text oh yeah that's it show the last truly no but you're right the King has watching yes it is and now it's not now it's tough it's going down good what the heck you can do that thermometer you can do it yeah did you tell me that if I cheered for my kite it would stay up well it worked still up there yeah we're listen everyone got some windows do that makes totally well thing well the thing is they mix too well they want to stay together hmm it was on the inside regs or death row stored and then it just got stuck to the window it was there for a couple years yeah we got to own it good it wasn't a window emergency wasn't a window nobody looked out to well really stands the glass really Jolly Ranchers watermelon dollar interest like human butter one thing apples smells great I don't know max thanks man yeah this is my like raspberries MIPS smells like purple pink okay oh I put some stuff away yeah I didn't thought was the old colors yes every here know what I used to say when a little too huh over here now okay tear you out all right group eyes on the Bloods yeah eyes up here yeah and like that huh what's she talking about we are closer this one it is nuts in insulin that won't translate maybe just me but you see much you're getting more better at that I feel like a bit more gooder at it pretty soon he's gonna be the goodest one dad you better watch out it's except for that I almost burned your dad like pretty much every time I do this snow did you hear the chip the genuinity it is boy yeah oh yes this one happier they get heavier as the day goes down I don't even have to run do you think that like when this first gets into the shots are like oh yeah what's gonna happen all right see if we do a way we're doing the green strife and then we put a little bit of red in the body anyway right green stripe and then we do we put a little bit of red in the body even though it's pink right yeah first timer to light up but on my own flip back with the colors yeah it's like you remember the first time you drove after you got your license yeah really yeah hello I think I went to the Ross's house I went to school I didn't get I didn't even take my license test until after I hear it was like that was pretty gung-ho huh to get my license and then I was working with that that's way too big of a strike what happens it was too big it was right we have two weeks trips also just like too much collar like I should I probably should only made it like this big that's right either [Music] the key for anybody making cart canes at home when you mix the colors and don't push it all the way down to the bottom and you also want to make sure that you get all the old little pockets on top too because if you have like a little pocket or color on top you flip it over you need color on your table and likewise when you push it all the way to the bottom yeah like this one this is gonna be messy the one who said you made this type too big you should you have like put it more to the side yeah I should have done like this much or something and said all that I'll do it over on this side next time too because that's kind of the cold side first time in a while yeah so can you chop off some of this over here and put it over there I could but it's such a if this is like this thinnest part too so good deal yeah we've had really big stripes there's something that they're just not I'm smaller farts weird stuff hahaha blueberry banana yeah I think it's just a little cooler down here either side we get the air above it it's no sir does that have anything to do with like the the water comes in I'm missing we think maybe it does because it definitely it comes in from this side you know zigzags all the way down and then there's a pipe in the middle that transfers it to the other side and then the side so I mean I guess really should heat up from this side over that way not like from one maybe anymore do an event then it's just nice that you guys even have more control over the temperature that's what I was thinking about I didn't want to like I was like I want to keep bringing up the table but yeah I mean the fact that we can just heat it up and love if we were on the marble table this might be a rock right now yeah like it's pretty cool yeah and the temperature would have more to do with what number batch it was rather than yeah yeah you guys don't really know nearly as when he's sticking issues is used to just understanding the temperature of the table butter I don't know cuz when it gets too hot that's why it starts sticking yeah so it's so easy yeah that was a very porous I mean remember in there on really know what this that's the weird part is like the height of the marble table got the secure it was you know if the hook gets hot that could stick keep the table as hat that's when the candy sticks is Atiya but we get this up to a hundred point yeah so must be maybe the novel table got hotter oh you know I remember to hit dinner well that was like right after we were done with the candy you know you put the temperature gun on it you were like 165 whoo but it's like right after the candy yeah yeah it seems like this thing's really good at getting hot and then like dispersing all the marble I cannot get the green to stop coming off of this thing hmm I'll think I have it tryna cool down yeah nice cold muddle check the other seven pillow for your candy that was like the first thing somebody else said it no you do that to Robert oh this one since he did last night Oh which one yes if you want to go bad you've been throwing all morning so it feels bad yes dear I'm getting kind of old and frail can you go camping anymore yeah hey max 28 now so yeah not the only olden trail on here okay my one of my daughters called last night told my wife your mom said if you forgot I'm going really I'm going camping with her oh yeah no I didn't say I don't know where she can walk with that so if you're watching wait what about mom going camping there why don't you volunteer yeah that's it yeah yeah you wouldn't want to go camping yeah I mean you know what camping means cut up vegan hot dogs and home fries and relish ketchup and up above and don't forget the pokies for you get Smokies in your teeth [Music] and that's a whole sports he's like you just put the spores in between I kind of want to try one it doesn't sound like much how did you ever knock it's obviously no there's like a little kid thought well that's the genius of all of it is it like he's like 17 years old he sounds like he's five yeah but in the best way we love you Lani I think he's even older than that we don't seem like he's in his 20s yes all right yeah honey pepper bottom not a name I hear one of the great talking about this little Club nature well it was interlocks nature was it's not nature but it's me true because he's neat today how neat is that bready need are you guys really need to cool this down on its I mean the green is it's kind of cold right yeah this is really hard over here if you do this you'll you just stick to a man you'll make it well cuz you've been doing it longer so you're better at it yeah yeah that's why is that a bubble or is it just like Oh analyze papa you know there's no popping sound Oh get a good one grab your last one yeah I had to stir with your nose doing my go pans go dead and where did you get that hookans it bare hands Oh that's just like look they're like dripping out of the mountain like well I feel like if they just always had hands it'd be like normal like raccoon it's like it's not it's not weird that wreck yeah and but it'd be so weird about it hands like tigers or something I was gonna be even crazier if like animals that right now have folks I'm imagining birds with hands now do you know how advanced we are compared to other animals how much do you think has to do with hands because like sure if a dog has an idea you can't really do much with paws he's Griffith so then I caused him to pause wolf mm-hm you know we watched a lot of like the space stuff and all that and like they say when they're looking like when SETI is looking for like you know extraterrestrial basic messages or something that I need the more complex language is more intelligent the people who invented it were and they say that like killer whales have a language it's like way more complex than than English huh so I'm like man what if what if they just had hands and conquer the waters the SeaWorld yeah it's pretty neat they say dolphins are super smart right but then look at like like orangutans and gorillas and chimps they can all learn like sign language they all in hands yeah and they're not building any supercomputers from there they're rainforests that we know of users really gonna hide again it just looks like a tree because idiot humans are coming again we got to hide everything put some leaves on it they'll never know no because the orangutans still want the secret of answereth but ah shoot that's it man's red flower something power jungle book dude you're giving me that look like I don't know you're talking oh yeah your mama's just saying she couldn't watch Disney movies when you guys are groaning oh why no because she just falls right to sleep oh no she can watch any movies gonna have to call right sleep please if we watch any movies it was usually with our dad cuz you didn't fall asleep never ever he never loved you know I've never seen him sleep oh yeah you're walking my elbows get crackin I wonder if I'm getting old food just just you're a real guys back here two old guys and one young guy you didn't yeah yeah I know it where's the $5 than that well if you don't have five bucks I don't think you're that young anyway mousses come on Steve respect you probably has everything those last matches really really sticky like carnage it I know yeah I feel like you used the word interchangeably with the smell but yeah it was a stink I think of like it smells strongly like I had my face over and I'm like I smell water that stinks so good yeah yeah barbecue stews but it stinks great let's restart listen when your side we think so yeah three strips and one side whatever you want to have checks out sir whatever I want I want a motorcycle and a pony the party tree is not Christmas he said whatever I want crack Gilda in December I want Saturdays and Sundays off hey you got that it worked this year dreams fall and you never let down well usually never let down I want to work and work and work oh then you'll never be let down yes yeah whatever what else are you doing or that's nice yeah the perfect size to have wow race off but you just store this yeah like really is that people on YouTube can like go back to the old video check out that yeah secret what's the last pose oh yeah they worked great yeah those horse beds are you looking for your brush pens sandpaper its head it's done it's like why are they so wrong so I know at least Tigers their tongues are barbed so they can lick flesh off of bones I don't know if I don't know if that's the same reason that's like house cats you find that always like really the cats cows the kids said oh I know why and eat their young two layers dark when they're there sit at the bottom of the staircase and like somebody knocks into the butler and drops like a whole vanity and the lady's like oh the tea must be ready let's go yeah supposed to be green zag really dark really just lies flat now you guys need to get your tracks it is technically green but it's really darker so we need to straight to bed and I put too much color it all right as it dries it gets lighter in color and then it just turned brown yeah it's all really sweet your eyes kind of tilt your head and imagine it being green it's basically yeah everybody watching this is water this is green but you know the camera adds ten shades yeah it's true it's so cool just like watching but you think so [Music] you can see it melted before your eyes before what do you think school are watching this mountain or I can paint dry oh that's right why this day that's good jazz is a very dark green right already [Music] I've said it before and I'll say it again it doesn't sound like helpful advice but really if you really tell yourself just go faster you will go fast you loser now Larry that's not a tease ding attorneys mm-hmm worth every watch I do it anyway brunch head of literacy what that was like in theaters continuously laughing captain Michael or famous it's about art or something captain Michaels art supplies it's about George Michael Batgirl [Applause] [Music] five while somebody's not goats the scary part kind of look like - yeah well that's all right we don't really need to keep the table right it's not be still like 105 to be perfect for lemonade okay so I guess we should probably do that this time don't tell me what I'm asking don't ask me to tell you what to do Oh what film a know-it-all yes a kid said no continent and he looks at the little kid and said let the boss I gotta tell ya I don't know what this says about me I watched all the tears I didn't think cliff was that bad now whatever norm is always there to be like yeah shut up sorry Frank let's watch although we probably only have three subscribers in play I've never met a cleft okay I feel like I've asked you this out you guys never watch read between the Lions right they have a segment I wonder if that's one of the ones because like Teletubby said come on Americans they're in like middle school that's up 50 knots right here you know it's not aware that there are like gradients ticket you know I feel like it's older you got the older a kid convenes that we call the kid yeah like I was just talking to Eric about that last night we're like man cuz he's talking about be 21 or whatever and I'm like you might think like to you this is the most advanced forever Ben yeah one of you one dude you're a baby you're a baby that's on them you know once I'm 35 I look back myself 428 be like man I was a kid yeah who's my mom and daddys kids once you become an adult you realize that nobody really it's not like you get to a certain point and boom you're grown up yeah you're just kids struggling to pretend like you're an adult once you become an adult you realize that adults don't really know what's going on and they're just trying to get through life but you should so listen to him if you're a kid yes they know more than you people listen to their parents most parents are just trying to save you from making the same mistakes that they made yeah but I find that with me and pretty much everyone else they learn a lot better from your own mistakes like you can tell someone not to do something but then they're really not gonna know until they experience I think I feel you have to experience the emotions of like loss and grief and like even it's like matter that I've rail that something and like you lost the game like Tom you can something I don't know I guess there's two different levels of understanding to we're yeah we have the knowledge of that where you did like truly understand thank you the boat yeah you have the practical knowledge it's like either knowledge or knowing it versus like experience yeah yeah I guess it's kind of like the candy to like I knew exactly the debt so I hid it like the people on YouTube who wants to be like they understand a lot of like what you guys are doing but unless they were to actually do it yeah it's a lot yeah yeah like so I think we were talking about when this all ends and Dylan isn't coming here yeah and he didn't record me doing this I think the data would show people how like yeah I've seen this downtown and then you see how hard it actually is because you guys have done this for so long now you guys actually make everything look so easy well that's it always brings me back to when your dad was showing me candy canes he's like yeah all you got to do is kind of move your hands like this and I'm like well your hands aren't moving I'm watching your hands now look at the simians yes remember my motto is kitchens where the hard way it's good nice and shiny at the end here he's gonna breathe is a little green barely getting greedy down Tammi like phagocytes prior such a change if we're at 250 already around 2:30 and the two-threes are like the time right really gets hung up or a bottle feel okay yeah yeah well squeeze it up almost done I'm not dumb yeah yeah right dad come on okay so maybe I've done fine one beer out of your paycheck oh no back good idea the last one look at that there it is around one you get a round one that's the last piece so this is the first time in the history of Hercules candies that we've ever made watermelon hard candy to sell separately I even more watermelon colored colored shirt today not happen yeah they left off the seeds but yeah you folks loved the watermelon so much did we just had to make it in a hard candy we made candy canes this year for the local folks we don't want that so yeah yeah it's coming soon to a near you yeah candy in the wintertime watermelon huh mm-hmm yes isn't the first time that we've ever done just a watermelon yes it's definitely cool I don't remember we did watermelon candy canes this good yeah remember you're the one that told me no I remember telling you about it oh okay no we did it okay and they sold out very well because I hope yeah making me make a flavor there would be likes even maybe oh no when we used to have open house I would ask the kids like no what's your favorite flavor of candy cane that I'll say water going like almost unanimously I said why okay well I guess I better call my mom kids want watermelon candy King there's something I learned a long time ago listen to your customers Wow I think you asking for something do it if you can [Applause] selling really fast I think by the time this video goes up because well maybe next week yeah this batch will be sold out we'll have to have made another one cuz I didn't even put on the front page of the right place and then I'm like kandi page bug golly gee Gompers it's going trash oh I guess people did wanna and some people just get like if we have all these single flavors they just get one bag of each cuz they're gonna we have cotton candy lemonade watermelon butterscotch no those things are often all mixed together and the fruit and friendly but apparently they their favorite flavors so well cotton candy we never got the fruit and friendly that ones always separate opens yesterday we did the tropical fruit punch this high tide yeah that's a really beautiful it's almost like we're getting now we're almost like we know what we're doing so we don't really so this created of you your most recently created a big rush cutting our orders you know how when you're driving down say James Street there's all those traffic lights mm-hmm do you ever hear them all green oh do you yeah it's a it's like wow it's still your Nirvana so today I'm no bottlenecks and then across the bottleneck I slowed down people and you can help me you can help me not have you can help me have all green lights read the shipping stuff at the top of the shopping cart page and if you're in a warm area and a lot of you are now because summer is coming pay attention to the cold pack and the expedited shipping information because it's really important because if I come if I'm print and print and printing and I'm handing off to Karen and Sam and they're getting them ready and then I crust come across Florida taxes Arizona oh they didn't know our Kolpak gotta set him aside figure it out so if you would like me to be able to speed down James Street and hit all the green lights in my mind it would so help me if you would read the shipping guidelines at the top of the page I know it's like 10 to 12 sentences and I'm sorry but hey you're home what and you know what it would help you go to sleep read it cuz you know it's probably boring so go ahead read it go to sleep and then wake up and order your cold packs in expedited shipping if you're in a hot place but if you're in Alaska we're still doing okay without having to have cold packs in Alaska because Alaska is a cold pack mmm in some cases Oh buddy believe they have mosquitoes the size of helicopters I've heard of that yeah they can be small children and animals mm-hmm yeah bummer yeah where's Craig mosquito got him mmm again malaria I guess you wanna see me staple up a couple of these my technique okay so I guess Oh mom I know that's like an older hoodie but you it's got that new hoodie look to it okay you snag you snag a new one when corporate wasn't looking it's pilots for advertising I don't know how long I'm not really ordering any new merch right now because I don't know what they kind of me is gonna do so I don't wanna get thousands of dollars for the stuff in that's not gonna sell so I'm just kind of selling when I have seeing how things go with the economy in people's lives and so we're just kind of in a holding pattern and I think a lot of companies are in a holding pattern anyway so yeah we're just waiting to see what happens so I'm not ordering a new merch right now so yeah if you want something of this nature get it now well it's off yeah or you could get the we do have some things on teespring to the people get and I'm pretty sure teespring still going so and they're just printing it as they get order right yeah it's good for people in like Europe Australia places like that because they don't have to pay crazy shipping prices right so because shipping from here to foreign country is not inexpensive mm-hmm can you tell me what you do with my watermelon labels put on the home under this or over here why did you do that I was just using the last night oh you made that yeah in print shop yeah yeah I remember it like greeting cards hmm before they fill them with I can't say the irises with a V no I don't think you want to say that word right yeah so computer irises SHM irises okay so here's the technique Wow I know tada take a picture of that panel oh that was some an angel singing in case you know mm-hmm take Crick that's all I have to say about that all right I always get back to work thank you you know all right all right right now I'm assembled the a team for a taste test can you guess the biggest all right a small yeah the best part of the taste is when you put it in your mouth you talk mother man I'll tell your mom tastes like summer oh it's seamless yeah the new seedless watermelon flavor yeah GD flavor mm-hmm you always were a bad seed thank you very good yeah must be those two months true to the flavor good mm-my stupidest thing to say to yourself it's really good you can't take my line that's a stone darkness good yeah it kind of ruins it yeah so taste like watermelon now I'm ready to fight yeah make something long-lasting as soon as I put it on my tongue was like slightly like you know faded away and then like that to Venus where the shirt comes over all right [Music]", "rvn0xep-EsY": "hey guys Shayna here so today I'm a bit of a different video I'm going to teach you how to make homemade hard candy I'm gonna making watermelon flavored umm I've tried this recipe or a similar recipe once before and I accidentally burnt it so I'm hoping this is going to turn out a bit better I got a candy thermometer for Christmas I love candy so I'm gonna try to make some and I'll show you how to do it for your ingredients you will need two cups of granulated sugar 1 cup of water 2/3 of a cup of light corn syrup you'll need one teaspoon or just one small container of candy oil I am using watermelon flavor you can use whatever you'd like and if you'd like I'm going to put a touch of red food coloring in it you're also going to need a saucepan a cookie sheet with parchment paper on it and a candy thermometer so we're going to start off by mixing in the water the sugar and the corn syrup you are going to put it on a medium heat in the saucepan once the sugar is completely stirred in and dissolve into the water then you're just going to let it sit no stirring and boil until it hits between 300 and 310 degrees Fahrenheit also make sure that you can zoom over to does not touch the bottom of the pan it has to be taking the temperature of the candy not the pan the mixture is just starting to boil but about 100 degrees to go make sure that you don't have it on too high of a temperature because you don't want to burn the sugar one thing with candy making is that you have to be quite patient it takes a while to boil if you have a gas stove that is better it's best to have constant heat on it it works on your ways but it does take a bit longer be patient we're now getting quite close to 300 degrees if your guys can do oil to make it flavored when you put it in be sure to keep your head away from the pan because it will send up some steam and it is a very very strong okay you have to be quite quick when you stir it together and make sure you take it off heat first that smells delicious drops are red that looks so good once everything is all mixed in you're going to have to pour it very carefully onto here you want it to be fairly thin you can also use lollipop molds if you have them I'm just going to make hard candy that we can snap later let's hope this works crazy color okay we are just going to let this sit now make sure it sits at room temperature you don't want put it in your fridge and afterwards we are going to break it apart and taste it looks like it looks so good and smells delicious well cuz stringy it is I don't know if you can see that what's quite hot still I've got such a nice flavor can't wait till that's hard one quick tip while this is cooling make sure your candy thermometer you clean it off completely so there's no like little chunks left because otherwise next time you make candy there's chunks you're going to get stuck and the candy will get stuck to the chunks it just it won't work properly so make sure you clean this very well hot water works good okay so the candy is hard now so you're going to peel it off and just break it to pieces and make sure you put it in a continuous a good seal on it comes off so nicely there you have it this is a very simple recipe maybe a bit finicky and it takes a while but how to make just an old-fashioned kind of standard hard candy uh I will leave the link down below where I found this recipe if you'd like to try to make it and yeah I will see you guys sometime soon thanks for watching watermelon I love candy you can replace sleep with exercise so his suggestion was sleep for six hours instead of eight and use those two hours to go for a run or bike ride get some exercise", "KAycqbqNaes": "[Music] thanks for

[Music]", "zLbZIv_cumE": "- Welcome to Bless Your Rank. My name is Matt and today we are ranking grandma's hard candies. We got them from a real grandma. She wasn't looking and\nwe raided her pantry and stole all of her hard candies. We did not do that. If there's a grandma out\nthere that's missing candy right now I'm sorry it wasn't us. I was just joking. (upbeat country music) Matt's gonna wrap. Not in a R-A-P way a W-R-A-P way. This is gonna get noisy in here. (wood taps) Here's how it works. So things we're looking for. Obviously taste cause it's candy. Appearance that's kind of important. You don't wanna put anything\ngross in your mouth. Also like how long does it last? It's hard candy. It should last a long time. So this Bless Your Rank is all about of course grandma's candy, but really more specifically\nthis is the kind of stuff that grandma might sneak you a piece of while you were in church. Or if you had a grandma like I did she probably would just quietly unwrap it and hand it you cause she\nknew you would manage to make that wrapper louder than the pastor. I wasn't trusted with a\nlot things as a child. But now I can just be as loud as I want to with these wrappers. How about that? Number one. The I don't know what you call these. These are just the little\nstrawberry candies. I don't think they have an official name. The get a bad rep. People like to trash\nthese strawberry things and say they're not really\ngood and they're cheap candy, but they have this like soft gush strawberry gel on the inside. It's like a bonus candy. It's like candy inception. Candy within a candy. This isn't as sweet as I\nremember it being as a kid. Also double wrapper for some reason. They just really out\nto get the environment. Taste right now like\nsome weird piece of candy that barely has any sugar in it and absolutely no\nstrawberry favor whatsoever. This is a huge let down. I remember these as a kid just like killing it with some strawberry flavor. I'm not getting any of that. I'm gone bite into it now. There's the strawberry flavor. It was hiding inside of it the whole time. Now we're finishing off pretty well. It was a really good ride. Exiting to the gift shop now. I like it. Grandma hand me one of these at church I'd probably be like\ngrandma what else you got? I think you can probably\ndo better than that. Do you have like a tootsie\npop in there somewhere. Even a dum dum that you got from the bank. They're OK. They're good once you bite into them, outside not that great. Grandma maybe keep these in your purse just in case you're craving mediocrity. Gonna put in on the doily here currently in first place. Our next competitor. Peppermints. The original hard candy. It's stuck. (wood taps) Alright there we go. These are the hard peppermints. These are not soft peppermints. Grandma wouldn't have those. You never know when she's\ngonna have her teeth in or not. These are good peppermints. Strong on the pepper mint. I mean I know what a peppermint was like, but see there's a lot of different types of peppermint out there. You don't really know what\nyou're getting sometimes. Maybe that's something that\npresidential candidates should look at becoming\npart of their platform is that you correctly label peppermints. Is it soft or hard peppermints\nto avoid confusion. If you agree with me, then you use the hashtag\nregulate peppermint industry now. This is a traditional peppermint. This is what you think of\ngetting is a hard peppermint. It's really good. It tastes like a candy\ncane which is exactly what a peppermint should be. This is more like a paw paw\nwould have these in his pocket though I think. Beware though. They may come from his last trip he took to Sonic Drive In in 1997. Alright so I'm looking at taste. Peppermint was good all the way through. Appearance? I mean what do you not love\nabout the strawberry thing? I'm a take a gamble and I'm\ngonna go for the strawberry cause I know what the potential is then. The potential is very high. Peppermint's a good\nstandby, it's a classic, it will never let you down,\nyou know what you're getting. But I know that we can do better. Contestant number three is oh no. This is black liquorice. What are y'all trying to do to me? Don't make me do this. (groans) I've got news for you. If this is your grandma's hard candy, you're grandma is the devil. I'm sorry. This isn't even candy. Isn't like, legit liquorice, like a root that you found in the dirt? Candy is not from the dirt. Candy comes from heaven\nor the Wonka factory. Aw man. Can we just fake it? Like mmm but not very good. Blah blah blah last place. Ew. This is what I imagine like taking a bite out of a dog turd is like. So many flavors and none of them are good. It's like it's punching me in the throat. Like karate kicking me to death. It's like it's effecting\nthe way I breathe. Like I can taste it in my breath now. (groans) I have absolutely nothing\ngood to say about this. This is a waste of space. I'm sure it came in a wrapper\nand it's a waste of that. This is terrible. If you are in church you're\nlike grandma what do you got, you got any candy, and she hands you a\nhandful of black liquorice go to the alter immediately\nand pray for grandma's soul cause it's gone. Where do I wanna rate this? This is without a doubt the worst thing that I'll have today. Not just today but ever,\never, on Bless Your Rank. Dead last. Contestant number four\nis cinnamon hard candies. Of course obviously cause you can read it right here on the wrapper. So to our three fans in Japan, and I'm probably off by\nthree meaning we have none, there you go. This is a little tribute to you with the cinnamon hard candies. My least favorite chewing gum is Big Red and this is I imagine is\ngonna be right up that alley. That's not candy. That's not fun. I like spicy things. Hot food, spicy food, I love cajun food when\nit's like super spicy, but I don't want my candy like that. There's a line. For the love of me I can't\neven open this wrapper! Alright so much for that. It's like a peppermint that's\njust gone just all red. This is a communist peppermint. That's not overwhelmingly cinnamony. It's not bad. I'm kind of a fan. Lot's of flavors. It's getting a little\nspicy, coming back down, getting a little spicy, coming back down. (upbeat music) Not as much cinnamon as like Big Red Gum. This is not bad. Whoa! Can't talk a lot with it in your mouth. You got a grandma that\nhands you these in church you got a spicy grandma. That was grandma that had\na little bit too much fun at the bingo hall on Saturday night and she's in church Sunday morning kinda nursing a hangover\nand is also like here and she will hand you one of these after she accidentally\nhanded you one of her pills. Where do they rank? They're still not better\nthan strawberry candies and I don't think that\nthey're really better than peppermints either so I'm\ngonna go ahead and just say third place cause as I've said before nothing is worse than black liquorice. Contestant number five. Werther's Originals. I love these. Maybe I'm a grandma. I don't know. They are delicious and\nthis is something that I definitely had at my\ngreat grandparents house. I feel like there was an old man at church when I was at church that had these too. I may have just been imagining things. Mr. Werther, can I have\none of your originals? And then he's like yes you can son and he pulls out like a handful of them. Take as many as you want. Thanks Mr. Werther. Here we go. (laughs) A little difficult to get\nout the wrapper there. This taste like grandma\nand grandpa's house. Like distant banjo going\non, you hear birds chirping, and you're just kinda\nrocking back and forth. That's what this tastes like right now. It's like a caramely cream. These are so good. This is gold standard. Pun intended. I mean this is like if you ask\ngrandma for a piece of candy and she pulls out one of these originals, your grandma has a good\ntaste in candy number one, number two grandma just got\nher social security check so she's affording the good candy, and three just grandma loves you. That's what that means. This is as good as grandma\nhard candy gets maybe. I don't know. There's more to rank so we'll see. This is so much better\nthan strawberry candy. It's not even close. Contestant number six. Oh Tootsie Rolls! Cotton candy, sweeties, go. Let me see the Tootsie Rolls. Fun fact about Tootsie Rolls. They haven't made any sine 1978, but I believe there might be\nsomething to the fact that grandmas are given a certain\namount of Tootsie Rolls and they can't go on to heaven until they've handed out all the Tootsie Rolls. Here we go. Now that looks like chocolate. That looks like a hunk\nof chocolate right there. This is good candy and\nthis is candy's evil twin. Grandma hands you one of these at church grandma's playing a prank on you. You're definitely gone get\nthis stuck all in your teeth. This is my teeth isn't it? I feel like it's in my teeth. I'm quite the butter finger. (laughs) Holy crap! Do you ever finish chewing this? I love Tootsie Roll but this\nis not good for my teeth. In conclusion, Tootsie Rolls are delicious but they are really going\nto mess up your smile in a heartbeat. Also why are there so many of them? We as humans are outnumbered\non Earth right now three to one by Tootsie Rolls. Contestant number one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. It is unmarked yellow candy. What are these? - [Producer] Butterscotch. - Butterscotch candies. I don't know what to expect with these. I don't even know what they look like. If I saw a bowl of these sitting out, I would think that's like\na medicine for a dog. They spend all their money\non protective packaging for this candy and not the candy at all. Yeah this is like a\nyellow peppermint kind of. I like this. And there goes the flavor. Didn't last long. Short little visit. Yeah this was like at first I\nthought this was pretty good, but I could do with\nnever having one again. This is like showing a red pill blue pill. Like you don't know if you want the red candy or yellow candy. Both will be very mediocre. At first little bit I was\nlike it's not terrible. I kinda like it. And then it's like it's\ndoing nothing for me anymore. It's like a terrible relationship. It was really fun at the start and now it's just like it's a chore. I don't see these definitely not better that Werther's Originals, not\nbetter than the strawberries, I am gonna say that they're\nbetter than the Tootsie Rolls. I'm gonna say that currently\nthese are in fourth place. Let's move the devil's candy down and then make some room here for unnamed butterscotch candies. Our final competitor\ncontestant number eight is Andes Mints. This is the chocolate and the mint. This is like a mint sandwich\nwith chocolate and then mint and more chocolate. I love the smell, I love\neverything about these. These are so good. Here we go. Aw man. These are a treat. I don't ever have these. Can you buy these? Granny stole some of the Andes Mints from the Olive Garden again. That's exactly what she did. Man these are good and these are all mine. I got a whole bowl of them now. I've never had this happen in my life. I don't know where these come from. Can you get these at Wal Mart? I'm a have another. I'm a do it. I'm a do it. It's the last one of the day. I'm a do it. Shout out to the Andes wherever that is. If you are a place, if you\nwere just a guy named Andy, I don't know, but keep\nup the good work Andy. And if you're grandma hands out these, congratulations you've got the greatest grandma in the world.

and it's really easy all you got to do is boil some water mix it really hard and you're good the main idea of my gummies and probably everybody else's but I use a little bit more just to be a little safer is a lot of gelatin so usually for a recipe for gummy bears and anything anything like that it usually calls for one box for tax which is fun you know that really will work if you made some gummies with one box of jell-o and four packs of it will work it's it's I'm not saying it's not gonna work but but now during a hot day or even just a little bit of moisture in the air your gummies are going to stick together and they're going to melt and you're gonna be pretty pissed off so take my advice and follow my recipe and I'm sure that your gummies are gonna hold up in your pocket you're gonna be able to go to work and go on with your day without any worry that something's gonna happen to basically the money you spent making these guns so let's get started so this is really simple like I said all you're gonna do is boil some water and that's it so we're gonna add 1 cup of water now that we had our water will crank go on so this isn't gonna take too long to get hot it's one cup of water so it's literally about two minutes it will probably be there so we got to think fast to move this so what we're gonna do is usually now you can do two full boxes of gelatin and that's only gonna make your gummies last longer they're gonna be a little harder a little more firm but they will last and that's the main idea but I usually like to do seven packs just because it's a perfect amount of like thickness in there so so now we're about to start boiling so I'm gonna add my gelatin sooo some cold water so it does AHS a little bit so when we actually do mix it doesn't get love you not sure if you guys know it's the Spanish shirt I'm wearing I believe design and he's out of Philadelphia PA and you guys like these shirt so I'm gonna be wearing check out his website I'll have a link down at the top lots of hats lots of shirts who's got lots of stuff ok so now that our gelatin is dissolved I'm gonna add our gelatin to the water after I have my gelatin I'm gonna have my gelatin pack then I'll add our additive and we're done so what's that era now it's at our gelatin give this a good a good old stir because you want to break up anything that's happened to not dissolve John says it's fish so this mix that we're making now I have three volts here this one box recipe should almost perfectly cover all three moles so now that our gelatin is combined and there's no more lumps now get out our gelatin so I'll do let's still line add your whole pack you really don't gotta rush this that's the best part about gummies and jello you don't it's not hard candy it's not like the minutes it's done you got the rush and it's gonna solidify on you if it does solidify you can just reheat it it's good again all right so now our jello has a gelatin and it's ready but does it have any good stuff so so it's outer additive and then we'll take the next step all right so now do you added your additive to this thing's ready to go you're ready to have a really fun day so the hard parts done we have it ready now the biggest problem is filling your molds I see people using turkey basters don't use surrogate of turkey basters think about when you suck it in just the two go over here you're gonna lose by the time you're done here you probably lost about seven to eight gummy bears worth of drop so don't use the turkey baster it's a mess and you're gonna lose stuff what I like to use is a squeeze bottle a squeeze bottle you can pour it in perfectly and boom boom boom boom no mess and no loss so let's do this so if you have a big squeeze bottle you can burp the bottle like that so when you tilt it it doesn't shoot out at somebody sitting across the room and you kind of control it a little bit better so you just go over each one how easy was that using a squeeze bottle way better than using a turkey bass boom all I got to do is wait for these is wait for these things are cool and I can be poppin these things all night long feelin really good so we'll check back in a couple of minutes when they're ready we'll see what they look like so we are all solidified see what we got the fact we used a lot of gelatin these things are gonna come out nice and hold your shape and it's gonna be nice so yeah boom just like you went to the store got some gummy bears this time they're gonna get you baked it'll look way cooler they won't melt in your pocket none of it okay go on your daily business don't worry about these but I just got these little molds I got from Michaels and they see more there's so many cool molds that you can do I really want to try the Lego molds you can build Legos with those things just so so cool but that was easy boil some water add your jello add your gelatin add your additive mix it up mold done I hope you guys can tell but I'm freaking freezing it's cold so what I like most about these is you know hard candies they're great when they take too long and you know sometimes you just want to eat some candy really fast and these are really good for it so you could be boom-boom-boom and be on your way instead of sitting there having to suck on some hard candy for a while these are these are great and you guys like what

"I'm not really an edible person but I have to tell you whatever they put in this thing they've done a good job I [Music] bought a couple of quarters at a dispensary the other day and they offered you know a freebie and so I decided to go with the edible that they were offering and it happened to be a kirova Saturday morning cookie sample and took it home tried it out and I got to tell you I really really like this brand I really like this I mean I'm not familiar with edibles you might have a particular brand you like I came across these and whatever they're putting inside this thing I got to tell you it works really well for me I think these things are awesome you might have other brands that you particularly care for but I highly highly recommend you try the kirova I am not affiliated with them in any ways and just you know came across them at random and I really really like this cookie plus it's only 150 milligrams so I would maybe recommend to kind of start with these if you're just getting into edibles as far as dosing goes it's a good idea to start small now like I said this is 150 milligrams and you know other cookies and other things in other bars and other products they have you know 250 500 I've seen it even a thousand milligrams which is for me is it's too much you know I can't quite do that type of a thing but this packaging here says that it's got 15 servings per package so if you do the math it's like 10 milligrams per serving so if you're able to divide the cookie up as evenly as possible you can kind of figure out your dosage from there and I would probably you know I would say start with 20 milligrams these things can you know come across you anywhere from 10 minutes to you know 45 minutes to an hour depending on your metabolism and kind of like what's going on with your body and stuff like that so I always like to pass along the information which is kind of the thing with edibles because you know dosing is such a it's such a gray area definitely be careful with this don't eat a whole one for the first time if you're just starting out because you probably would have not such a great experience and you might not you know you might not come back to pick up some more this is about the size of a dose that I would do probably if you're just starting out I might do something around that size but since I've tried this a few times I'm adding this much more but I would try about that much in size even if you're a beginner start with twenty milligrams you know and see see where you go give yourself a little bit of time wait for about half an hour or so and see how you're feeling you know if you go on to maybe an hour hour and a half and you're still you know you're feeling good but maybe you want to feel a little bit better maybe try another ten twenty milligrams and then just call it good and see where you end up there some people will just you know eat something go I don't feel anything and eat some more I don't feel anything and all of a sudden they're just they're just blitzed it's the first time for them that would be that would be a shame because they wouldn't receive the benefits of the Saturday morning cookie so you know if you're just starting out that's what I would recommend for you to do dosing wise hopefully you found the information in this video useful if you did please comment like and subscribe I'm Enzo truffle with bud symbol calm and the kirova Saturday morning cookie thanks for watching [Music]", "90GlUQQXfMM": "mommy's so round two of neutrons muggles same night I've already taken her milligrams THC and have milligrams of CBD and I'm gonna vote to try this brownie which I'm really excited about it is supposed to have any I want to check for you 200 milligrams of THC this is the Bernie and this is the Bernie I'm really excited either there's more like fudge then a brownie but I'm sure this bomb I was really really good like dangerous good Mike never got apples before this could kind of be a little dangerous because I definitely don't really taste the weed in this which is really surprising I think it's because it's brownie but yeah it's definitely like a fudge more than anything it was like really moist it was really easy - mm-hmm so hopefully the potency is as good as it tastes it was to go to hand in hand then this would definitely be a reprieve for me because I love chocolate and I am a huge fan of fudge and this is [ __ ] delicious like this could be very dangerous mmm dose it's the name of the company I can't double yeah definitely definitely really good I'd say I would like this over the watermelon because I'm going to eat this whole thing in one sitting which as I said if you are somebody that does not have a high tolerance I don't really recommend doing something like this because some people don't react well to edibles and you just save which is cool like it really doesn't matter but definitely if you're like just getting into the edibles world like please please please take things slow we do not want to hear stories of mom not being able to really function in the morning because she's still very very very high which sometimes does happen or absolute worst case scenario you completely trip oh and you ever the hospital like that is something we do not want to see and we do not advocate for here we want to see good slow medicating especially if you do not have that tolerance if you are somebody that is just getting into this please do not do what I am doing and please do not sit here and eat the entire brownie because if you do you might get a little bit too high and for some people they don't really like that I mean personally I'm like yeah let's do it like let's get popped out but some people are like no not my forte I don't want to sit there and like zone out and not be able to move or personally like I move which whom I actually I wasn't sitting here my foot is like literally bouncing I don't sit still so for me mm-hmm definitely win I don't say packaging there isn't a lot of it I'm going to only hang with this this and this piece so there's a lot of time in time packaging which is good I love and if my kid tried to grab this you probably wouldn't even know how to open it like I actually took me if you mess be like okay how does this open because besides don't open just like literally rip it open from the bottom which is good because sure happens sometimes we live things and our children's reach which accidents happen nobody's perfect that's why I always say like there's never allowed any judgement because accidents happen [ __ ] happens in the obvious", "IIqB1wlfboE": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today i'm going to be showing you guys how to infuse any type of candy that you buy from the store well at least any candy that has a sugar coating on it for example um we're going to be using sour patch kids and sour patch kids watermelons but any other type of candies that have that sugar type coating will work i've also done this with just like generic gummies that you get from the bulk section or anything yeah anything like that will work and this is what they will look like so essentially they will look exactly like they did in the bag and this is what a lot of the time people are selling so like they put them i don't know what they have like there's a different name for it but the logo and everything looks very similar to this and you're you're buying these and they look exactly the same as a store block gummy and the reason why is because it is a store-bought gummy and it's just been um sprayed or um in this case dropped on um tincture um this method is not going to get you exact dosing so please don't do this with intentions to be um like having a perfect dose because it's not really possible to do that but you can get it pretty close but for most people who are just using these for themselves like i am it doesn't really matter in the end so yeah let me show you guys how to make these and i just want to say a huge thank you i just hit 10 000 subscribers this weekend that was absolutely amazing it is my birthday in a couple of days and i feel like that was kind of like an early birthday present to me if you haven't subscribed already please do now i would appreciate it so much here's what you're gonna need some store-bought candy um the sour kind with the sugar on the outside some tincture and a syringe okay so we're just gonna start by getting our surface ready i'm just using a baking sheet with some wax paper you could use parchment paper a plate whatever it doesn't matter and then i'm taking my candy that i have here um i chose sour patch kids the kids and then the watermelons but you can use any candy that has a sugar coating on it it doesn't need to be a sour sugar or not sour it doesn't matter as long as it has that um sugary coating so i've done this before and just gone to like bulk barn and just chose whatever candies i like um you need to have that sour sugar on the outside because that is what is absorbing the tincture so yeah once i have the candies i want to infuse i just lay them out on my baking sheet and then here is my tincture so now i'm going to get my little syringe thingy and pull up some tincture so i'm not measuring how much i'm really using because it's just for me to use by myself but if you want to know how strong they're going to be you could like keep track of how many syringes you use per x amount of candies but anyway so you're going to take your little syringe and you're going to press it on to the candy and not too hard but hard enough that it's not going to go flying everywhere um here we get a little bit closer so you can kind of see what i'm doing so yeah so i have i fill up my syringe and then i set it on top and push down with a steady hand that's why i'm using two hands so i can be really steady with it and then i just push enough that um fills the cat the sugar coating with the tincture but not enough that it goes onto the tray if you add too much it will leak off of the candy and go onto the tray and then you're wasting stuff um so just use less at first to see how much it can kind of hold and just a reminder here this when you're doing this is not the candy itself like the gummy candy the chewy part is not absorbing the tincture it's only the outside that absorbing it so then now i'm just doing the exact same thing but with my sour patch kids now this is what they look like after i did the first round so that means i've only added tincture to one side of the candy and there's those watermelons you can see they've already started to dry um and you're just gonna leave these out with um air circulating so i just have a fan facing them um to help dry them off um but i have kept on having to move the tray because it kept on sitting in the sun so you don't want to be in the sun or it's going to melt as i put them into the sun here but you know that's for the visual effects so has that good lighting but yeah so in the fan leave these to dry until they're dry ish and then you're going to repeat the process of adding more tincture okay now that they've dried which i think that took like 20 minutes not even i'm just flipping them all over and then i'm going to repeat the process so with these watermelons i could flip them over repeat the process and then turn them on their like other side i feel like they kind of have a couple sides they could sit on whereas with the sour patches i can only kind of turn them over one way or another but you can keep repeating this process over and over again so i only put tincture on or i only put one layer or one serving i don't know what you want to call it i only did each side once i guess is what i should say just because i wanted to be able to eat a lot of these in one serving so if i kept on layering the tincture on it would limit how many i could eat at once um but yeah so you're just gonna let them dry after this and then you could flip them over once again and keep on adding and you can keep on doing this over and over again until it no longer absorbs any tincture and i think you could probably do about four or five rounds on each side so keep in mind when they are drying it's evaporating all the alcohol from your tincture which is why you're able to add so much to it but um i think you could also add some more sugar coating to this to allow for more tincture on the outside but i didn't want to mess around with it too much i just wanted to kind of show you guys the simple way to do this um and you know it's kind of guaranteed that this is gonna work um you could also do this with your already infused gummies so if you actually make some gummies with your tincture and then put a sour coating on them you could do this again and that would make them like extremely extremely sour non-sour extremely extremely strong because in this case these ones are only having tincture on the outside whereas if you had a gummy that was already having tincture on the inside you could also add on the outside and that would just be super strong and lovely now i'm just gonna zoom in here so that you guys can see a little bit better about how i am actually adding the tincture without it splashing so i'm taking this little syringe and i'm pushing it lightly on top while still having control of the syringe and once you do a couple of these you get really used to it and you kind of know exactly how much you can use [Music] so they were all done but i guess i decided i was gonna add a little bit more which i shouldn't have done because i got kind of sloppy about it and you guys are gonna see what happens when you get sloppy about it or when you put too much tincture on your gummy and it's not able to absorb it so let's just take a little look closer up so you can see that tincture on the bottom of my waxed paper those little greenish brownish splatters there so that is tincture that is wasted i mean obviously you can lick the parchment but if you don't be so quick and lazy when you apply it it shouldn't happen so if you see my sour patch kids here there is pretty much no tincture that leads off just a couple of little specks and that's what happens when you're patient instead of when i went overboard with the watermelons without letting them dry in between okay now let's just take a look at some of the finished ones versus the original one so here is a finished watermelon um and then yeah that looks good and let's grab a un tincturized un infused i guess uninfused watermelon and that's how it looks so you can see that sugar chunked up and then it gives it that it also have that little bit of the brown and greenish after the um alcohol evaporates so it kind of looks like grubby i guess i don't know i just feel like it kind of looks like dirty but um it's only if you look kind of close up and then let's compare it with some sour patch kids on the left there that's a uninfused sour patch kid and on the right that is a infused sour patch kit so it looks a little bit like wetter kind of it's not wet though um but yeah the sugar kind of clumps i don't know i don't even really know how to explain it but i guess you guys can kind of see on screen there yeah then there's our little watermelons um and our sour patch kids um i guess now that i'm closer with my camera here i can show you a little bit better kind of the tincture that is still on the pan um it's not too bad but i was doing this with one hand part of the way because of the camera and stuff so i was a little bit sloppier but if you guys are careful there shouldn't really be any waste now they are all dry and i'm just packaging them up um they dried like i said for like i don't know 20 minutes half an hour if you want to be super sure they're really dry i would just leave them out overnight and if you want to you can always add more tincture there is nothing stopping you from adding more a day later two days later a week later whatever it's all gonna work now you have a bunch of delicious infused candy that was super simple to make and i hope you guys enjoy this little trick as much as i do okay so now these are finished let's taste them and see how they are i'm going to start with the sour patch kids here so immediately when i open it has a very strong smell and these are going to taste stronger than gummies usually would because the tincture is all on the outside of the gummy so when it touches your tongue the first thing you taste is the tincture whereas if you're making your gummies homemade the tincture is mixed in with the gelatin with the sugar and everything else and it's less of a like direct flavor as soon as you eat it um but once you start chewing it kind of all blends in so it literally just tastes like a sour patch kid with tincture i didn't make mine super super strong so like i would eat this whole bag probably but you can make them so that they're really strong yeah oops very good very strong tasting but that'll be depending on how your tincture tastes so it's just going to taste like sour patch with a touch of tincture okay now the watermelons they're just so cute i love these bags so much i reuse them to be honest they're super super cheap but i'm cheaper um so whenever i use them and they're just like for gummies like this i'll just like reuse it after but i wouldn't reuse it if i was giving it to someone anyways [Applause] um these ones are better not just because i like the watermelons better and surprisingly they like you think they'd be all sticky and stuff but they're not i literally put these in the bag like right after i made them instead let them dry because i'm lazy um yeah they're not sticky at all they're very good strong you can definitely tell that they have tincture on them but yeah thank you guys so much for watching this video i hope you enjoyed it if you did please leave a comment subscribe and give us a thumbs up thank you guys so much for watching and have a wonderful day", "ka3YlQ4t5Ds": "i have a question for y'all so somebody said in a comment on an order when she was ordering the watermelon hard candy she said when she was a little kid she used to get a transparent watermelon hard candy they called it candy glass my question is is anybody interested in us making like a whole batch of transparent candy because all we have to do is really not pull it on the hook yeah or is it just one person that wants clear watermelon it looks like everyone's just saying yes be careful what you wish for because you just might get it transparent watermelon hard candy the movie double double trouble trouble doing bubble there you go trouble trouble doyle rules did he come up with that thought i mean he was yeah i just said rhyming we're coming back your way oh well you know what we oh there's still some green there that's all right okay just do the stripe on that side again yeah man your hair must have gotten hot i'll guess i'm in the camera i'll get inside your camera i am your camera yeah i'm back from down yeah i can definitely feel the heat coming off while i'm holding the camera camera's heating up that much huh what the heck man i'm trying to work here sorry i got these extra long elbows here what kind of elbow exercises you've been doing oh i mean you really want me to show off or elbow press elbow curls elbow ups elbow downs curls some knees in there too these knuckles no no i'm not that strong elbow day today really focusing in on the muscle groups very clear-looking terry approved the one very small string so one very small string we could probably just make it like even just but that'll be super cold yeah i'll do it he's a brave man that's a small one maybe let's go a little bit more just a tiny bit there we go i've still got some color to add to that we did the extra color on the butterscotch over here what do you guys thought yellow and green green is it too green when we adjusted the green it would come out like brown oh that makes sense because it's starting off pink yeah oh interesting so the yellow just kind of brightened it up a little bit i'm glad that wasn't your camera lens i'm glad it's caro payne for it oh boy she's paying for the camera mistakes too oh yeah man she's got some deep pockets any mistakes that happen at 720 west mainland kara's hair is covering it it's a good thing she won the lottery yeah that's a lot of green right there not for carol wait any mistakes that happened where craig 720 was manliest oh is that okay yeah that's the address like west demon in my head and i was like do you say he-man or human what you ever talking to people you i can't hear anything what he-man yeah where'd you get the r from i i don't know if people are just they look at it and they're like that's not [Applause] oh it's so much easier with my right hand yeah do you ever do stuff with like your left hand and like see if you can pull it off i used to try to take notes on my left hand um i would yeah they're very smooth yeah and i never saw any improvement oh that was when i was in college it wasn't when i was like a little kid i feel i probably wouldn't improvement if i was a little kid but i tried to play basketball you know like shoot lefty and stuff yeah that you can do better yeah yeah i feel like with sports like because i remember i would uh throw left in lacrosse yeah and i'd be fine but then for whatever reason when it came time to game game time i was like i can't do it i can't do it for real but in practice i'll be fine and then uh yeah just like i think i just didn't have the confidence to yeah yeah that's what it sounds like to you know tell your truth like sometimes when i'm throwing the candy on the hook i'm thinking maybe i could drop it with my left hand oh instead yeah instead of dropping the mic i don't know you might drop it wrong yeah you know i mean maybe maybe you practice that on the fruit by the foot okay yeah try it for next week yeah yeah like he takes them home yeah yep yep so can you sign my slip no no um and because you were saying before the last match you guys just pulled it too soon it's it's that soft that's pretty soft patch maybe we should throw some sunglasses on it or something yeah so it looks cooler i thought maybe bringing it down here we'll pull it off a little bit but what about over there maybe wow i paid for those sound effects did you did you do that in one video what like we would like touch something and it was like drum sounds or something oh uh i think dylan did something like that one time yeah i think it's probably getting a little warm there turn the fan on yeah oh that'd be smart wow we're coming up with so many good ideas today um you guys got an ice cube if you had an ice cube you could hold it on this side of the fan and it would suck the cold through the pan basically air conditioning just the cold just the cold yeah okay if you have water on your ice cube they're a little on your bench you're not supposed to season them until after you're right i used to put the salt on first it took forever to freeze what's your mom's uh ice cube recipe her ice cube recipe yeah i can't tell you that you just i just let i just say that i can't make ice cubes anymore it was the recipe dream might think alike great mom's great right here there's good all right look it's a heart huh anybody going to say spoons live every time i'm like look it's a heart he goes no it's a butt all right not really any need to knead this but sometimes it like makes it a little bit more oh it sounds like you need solid uh yeah if i don't i have to ball it all up inside because i'm a softie i'm just going to agree with you i don't want you to get volatile with me uh did you see that mercurial is in retrograde you wanted to walk away did you but i can't yeah i got him cornered you know i think this is still a little too warm yeah yeah but whatever i'm gonna play yeah it does look really right now that's good yep great so do you think it's because are you used to pulling it off the table that early when you're putting it on the hook yeah while the hook pulls it off yeah you're beating the air into it and stuff i just don't think that it's ever gonna be as rigid without before make an extra green yes so you guys want to explain why we're just doing the one strike because i think the first thing we've ever done is one little strike jerry said yeah well yeah because we got told too yeah that was our theory and then she came into the same theory yeah uh so when you don't throw the stripes or you know when you don't throw the candy it's translucent so you can see right to the other side so if you have too much green on the outside kind of see it on this side that it's like darker over here than it is over here yeah so if you have too much green it turns the whole thing dark we want that nice light translucent tank so you can't have that in translucent well i guess you can't really have a translucent color yeah yeah because there's so much dye that goes into it yeah i guess yeah maybe we could try that though it's uh less green instead of yeah because we always had to do like the green with the yellow to brighten it up like when you throw the pink but since we're not throwing the pink maybe we can just put a little bit of green on so so this is what we're looking like so far it's still like relatively see-through because this is what we had before and this is when we had a lot of green stripes as you guys saw it was the the batch we made before was actually the slo-mo one you saw in the beginning um but yeah this is how not see-through is just because of how much green there was so i already i think it's looking better although the beginning of the first match looks really good it looks good yeah this is this looks good like the body looks good uh joey's just saying he made it right you guys know your greens right yes yeah kale spinach green was my minor in college oh was it yeah green was my major in high school [Music] what's that there's that meme going around it's like a guy pulls a cop pulls a guy over it's like so whose car is this what do you do for a living where are you going he says mine i've seen the meme before when uh just it's like too flat now it's just it has no body it has no body without the air in it oh yeah but have you seen the beam where the the person's buying a car and then they ask the car dealers okay all right you have any more questions before you go like oh yeah what about cargo space he's like no cargo road yeah you know go to space arnold goes chuck you're fired you are now fired as a customer you are javen i think i like that one better than promoted because yeah oh i meant like the customer got fired the batch seems to be going fast are you guys just like ripping through it because uh yeah and it's the softer ones just pull out faster like you kind of have to keep up with how fast it gets pulled out that's what it's starting to say and then you lose a train of thought while you're trying to shoot a video because you're focusing on something to watch is that one and then i'm not even shooting videos at all you're there to finish the sentences for me you know how when you get really close to somebody you can finish each other's sandwiches sandwiches yeah that's exactly what i was gonna say what's charlie say when he's trying to avoid the cheese when he's on the fancy date which chase is too much i can just see him there like sweating looking at the cheese splatter that's one of my favorite episodes so all of ours i feel like all of our celebrity crush is on that pretty much yeah yeah so alexander zadario if you're watching feel free to come by we'll show you how to make oh she's in that one that's what i'm talking about oh i was talking about charlie day oh right yeah yeah or where'd they need to be [Music] if real we'll share i don't want to get too fixated on that show somebody said charlie the other day and like this this certain tone and all i could see in my head was frank with the mannequin come on charlie i took it out last time i did it this is yeah i think this batch is definitely looking a lot better huh this batch is definitely looking a lot better i think the one small green stripe that was a good idea good idea kids how uh how is it looking now that like the green stripe is no longer on the outside of the candy it's now on the inside yeah yeah it's still okay yeah i mean i think it looks good yeah because there's only the ones yeah sometimes it's on top sometimes it looks like it's kind of underneath i guess like on the other side yeah this definitely looks a lot better it's like backwards watermelon watermelon butter water whatever i feel like there's there's certain things you're not supposed to talk about like politics religion and pronunciation that's that's the three things right you know i've never heard it but that should definitely be added to the list i'm sorry what was the third one uh pronunciation oh you pronounced it music pronunciation i say pronunciation one of us is wrong tomato tomato i've never like it's so weird that's like a vocalism oh yeah like in australia i think it just hits a motto well here like it was like an old school like new york thing tomorrow you know but like i've literally never heard anybody say tomato so like here's a super common expression that you know describes this word that nobody even says like that australians australians be like am i a joke to you oh come on what's tomatter yeah we're literally just talking about earlier australians probably my favorite accent [Music] kid that like was on the news for like having a party so big that oh i destroyed his town yeah can you take your sunglasses off no i don't think i will no i'm i like them the end of a badge they grow up so fast yeah i guess it makes sense it's like a lot warmer right yeah i guess yeah the stripe was the cold part but usually the the end of it is like rock hard so how'd you get down before me again every time every time even now that you're doing four five six yeah i don't want to wow look at that it's me mister hard candy piece finder i think that one right there yeah that one kind of looks like a jolly rancher yeah it might taste different the color's in my finger okay yeah is that blasphemous to say that yeah you're gonna have to bleep that out huh i got a stripe me too i think joe's probably gonna shrink yeah i know what that meant yeah that's watermelon right away there's a lottery and melody how do you get those seeds though one by one i know exactly what you're talking about though it's like way smoother right there's like no striations that's weird yeah i think it would be that present you know yeah it's a lot like a jolly rancher it's kind of each other yeah is that blasphemous to say that though like i said earlier is that legal hope not we didn't mean anything please forgive us we're very poor", "oONRHdBHFfY": "hey love Sistani here and today I'm going to be talking to you guys about a new company that I was recently introduced to and all about how it helped me relax more so this company is called diamond CBD and you know a CBD is and you already know what I'm about to talk about my basically CBD is a what is it it's a component that's found in green and that's the component that makes you actually relax and feel better that's than what's actually helping a lot of people with their illnesses and pains and all that stuff so this company actually just done the work to actually take the CBD out of lead and separate it and put it into different products and all of that so you can actually they have a variety of products so depending on what you prefer you can get whatever so I got this candy cuz I'm obsessed with it means like I don't know why lately I'm in love with these rainbow gummy so not even gonna lie to you guys when I first saw this company I thought it was leave like we'd have just food food and I was like don't do drugs I don't know how that's gonna work but but that company like they explained it to me and then they have a video on the front of their site that actually explains all of this so you do not make you high they don't get you high at all you're not going to be like tripping or anything like that they literally just make you relax and feel more I don't know like say you have back pain like I normally no back pain it helped with that if you have issues sleeping if you have just a problem like with anxiety whatever and you just need to be relaxed this is for you it also helps with a bunch of other things okay so you do need to be 21 to use this or to purchase this and so on the front when I got this package I actually did not review this bottom part here I just saw this and then I went straight to the back because I started reading you know the serving size and it said four pieces so I'm like eating eating and I ate three pieces right to eat my fourth and then I see on the front and it says do not exceed more than one to two pieces every six hours so I took three like I said and I'm a small person I'm only buckling and I don't weigh that much like I'm pretty small so I took that and I promise you like the rest of the day and then it was just around around like maybe four or five o'clock for the rest of the day like all the way through the night I was like I don't know I felt so tired and I don't think these are supposed to make me feel sleepy but that's just how I react to a lot of things in general like whether it's alcohol and I've never really I've never done weed so I didn't know that this is how I would react but I just got really sleepy you know supposed to get sleepy per say but and it's got really sleepy like it helps you sleep better but that means that like your body will relax it doesn't make you like sleepy it's not a sleep aid so you're supposed to be able to take these any time of day so I got really really sleepy I wanted took a nap and then just the rest of the night I was like really tired and drowsy but the next day I took the regular dose I just took one piece of candy it's like just to help me relax before bed or whatever and I didn't really feel any more tired because of it but it definitely did help with my back pain and it helped me relax so I will definitely say these work like these are like probably one of my new favorite things because it's natural one and it's just it's just a good alternative to taking pain medication all the time and all of that now I do wish the serving size is a bit more because I like eating candy but I just I just probably need to get it in another form other than candy so they told me they have it they have drops that you can put in stuff they have well so they have they have it in other foods they have they have a bunch of options you just have to go to their website and see and then you can use that to make whatever you want and put it in whatever food or you can take it directly under your tongue whatever you wanna do now these in here it says the serving like if we're going based on what the back says it says serving it's four pieces so there's about two servings in here so if we're going based on the front and there's about four to five start rings in here so I think it's that's great these cost 15 dollars that's before shipping and these cost 15 dollars this back and they have variety of products all different prices if I if you're saying like I can get like maybe five pieces out of this that's pretty good that's actually pretty good and I would definitely get this again I'm probably going to get this again because like I said I do have back issues like I'm spine and stuff and so it did actually help with that a lot I recently got a desktop computer so the flora would often work off my laptop and so I got my desktop and so a lot of times I have to use it because a storage is better and all of that I have to use it sitting at my desk and that is always been an issue for me for years and years and years because I've you know even in high school I was home-schooled and so working at home you know doing my schoolwork I'd have to sit up and then at my desk and all of that it just always been an issue because my back hurts so I prefer to work from my bed if I have to do like you know stuff on my laptop or whatever because it's more comfortable and I can prop up a pillow and all that but yeah so sitting at my desk often time really hurts my back and I don't enjoy it at all like I will do everything I can so that I don't have to work at my desk because it's not the most enjoyable for me but this definitely helps I don't know if I should be taking it every day so I'm not gonna do that but I think it's safe like to you know do it every day it's not gonna be addictive or anything like that but yeah I'm probably gonna use it again and I would suggest that you guys check them out gonna link your website in my description box this is like a really cool product that very happy I was introduced to so make sure you check it out if you have not already make sure you subscribe to my channel and also in the comments let me know have you ever tried CBD not weed not just not weed if you've smoked weed that's great for you but like if you've ever tried CBD by itself let me know and let me know if it works for you and do not forget to check them out alright I will see you guys in my next video bye [Music]", "3V4wLZjxwY8": "what's going on you too so I made a video last night and I had some technical difficulties so be sure to hang out you can see it you guys really didn't miss too much but all you really missed is me talking about my ingredients and watching me putting it in and all that stuff but other than that you guys are good and check it out additive you're gonna add to your base very very strong you don't want to kind of make do all this and have it just you know you have to eat 10 candies to do whatever you're trying to do you want to make it worth it spend the money put the effort in and I assure you it'll be well worth it in the end so it's been about four and a half five minutes now and we are just crossing 240 degrees so I like I said this doesn't happen super fast it but once we hit around 270 degrees it will start moving a little bit a little bit faster so when you're flavoring with this recipe you want to use one of these kind of bottles you can get them at a Seymour Michaels any arts of crest or you can get them at Walmart when I went to Walmart they only have peppermint cinnamon and that's not my thing but right here I have cherry and I have an orange oil that I like to add so usually if you're going to say if you're going for lollipops or like life savers or anything like that flavor to get that exact flavor like they come out like it comes out of their factory you want it for this recipe when you use a half of one of these bottles and a half of orange oil bottle and it'll taste just like you bought some lifesavers what the orange oil does adds a little citrus and it just gives a little brightness to it but you don't need that I did a batch with just watermelon and you know I loved them they tasted great it wasn't super watermelon flavored and to be quite honest with you I hate the flavor of water now so these these oils then they they taste great but I know you're probably wondering why you don't add it now so you have it all incorporated it's all said and done well this is a different kind of liquid than what we got going on here obviously so if you added this to a 320 degree sugar base and this will probably burn out see they want you to wait till 250 degrees to add your additives if your flavoring but I feel like that is just way too late of a weight I like to do at almost 275 degrees you're gonna deal a little more heat when you gives you a little bit more time because once you add this stuff this is going to cool down drastically and fast so and one thing you don't want to do with this is mix it around a bunch because if you think if you live in New Jersey you walk along the boardwalk what do they make in salt water taffy so you keep stretching the sugar adding air adding air what's it gonna turn into a taffy it's not going to be as much of a hard candy it's gonna keep out again it's gonna it could turn into a candy corn which is honestly not a bad texture in itself either but it just now we're done for right now well what I like about doing these little candies and gummies and stuff like that is these molds there's so many damn cool molds that you can pick up like a robot dude here it got lollipops dinosaurs and it's like pixelated dinosaurs are pretty cool I seen Super Mario Batman ones like Legos you can actually take the Lego ones and build with them so there's like really cool stuff you could be doing with candy and if you get really good at it you know pull your kids aside and you can do a day with the kids and show them how to make the favorite candies and kids blown away that you can actually make this yourself it'll definitely be way more impressed with this than a batch of cookies that Pillsbury makes just don't have any funny business to it so we're crossing about nine minutes now it's a nine 10 minutes and we are hitting 250 degrees so in about four minutes we only went about ten degrees so once we're all mixed up and our basis set we add our additives we add our flavoring the name of the game is speed and just I don't want to say steady hand because if if you know me I am the last guy to ever have a steady hand you can people will hand me a 2 ounce ladle got a 2 ounce souffle cup and say fill up some butters just the laughs at me because I shake but for some reason I can do this pretty well but you want to almost come down and just go in a line 1 1 1 1 1 if you're just all over the place you're going to lose quite a bit of what you're doing here and nobody wants that but I would say 1 to 2 ounces for this batch usually I do a 2 cup of sugar 1 cup of corn syrup and a half a cup of water and so I'll do it it's basically a double batch of this that I would do 2 to 4 ounces but this I think 1 1 2 2 maybe 2.5 ounces will be good all right it's been about 4 4 minutes later and we are just hitting 290 degrees so I'll check back up at the end a couple of minutes all right it's about 3 minutes later and now we just hit hard crack we're at 300 degrees so most people will want to go to 310 but we're going to 320 so I'll check back when we get there well it's about 30 seconds later we're at 310 so we're almost there so get ready all right so we hit 320 degrees so now what we're gonna do is so now this is a so now this is a hard Canyon and it's going to be very hard it's not going to be questionably hard and it's not going to be and it's not gonna lose its hardness from what we had so now we wait until about 270 degrees and we're gonna add about one to two ounces of whatever additive you're gonna add and your flavor so we'll check back in about five minutes when we get there so what I like to use to make my my tinctures or if whatever I'm going to make the most is I'd like to use either a leave o or a magical butter machine the the two of them it's it's perfect the you can perfectly adjust the temperatures and you could really make it long and really strong or you can make it really fast and get you get it done fast so if you're looking for a way to do it without having to you know use mason jars and stuff like that look into buying a leave out or a magical butter machine those two things makes the process so much easier and not just easier but it makes it stronger and enough of talking we're there so now that we're at 270 degrees we got to move fast so speed and accuracy is the name of the game now do not let any sugar touch you so first get all your stuff ready because you're gonna add at one shot so I'm gonna add my flavoring to my additive half I want of the cherry I'm gonna do and I'm gonna do half of the orange oil now people like to do food coloring and all that you don't have to I don't like it because I just don't like the I like the natural color that you get so this part you don't mix too much the more air you're gonna add the worse off it's gonna look so you got to be fast go okay so we're all mixed up don't know what to do let's go and then we pour accuracy now look guys I have super shaky hands and I'm go it's all about accuracy if you tried to reheat this it would still work but it's not gonna be as clear its goal is is clarity and just like I said if you reheat it you're gonna be mixing it again so you're going to add more air the more air you add the different the texture is gonna get try some of these but a nice steady pour and you could if and when we look you're going to tell that we didn't even have that much waste so this a little bit I got here and the rest I got here I can reheat and I can make other candies so what we'll do now is we're gonna is we'll wait and I'll give it about it don't take long about three minutes five minutes and these things will be rock-hard and check them out so check back in a minute all right everybody we're all done so let's take a look at what we got just like that all you gotta do is pop them out and move and look these things they're rock-hard they don't stick together nothing and you're really that worried you can get some powdered sugar and you're good look at that perfect so I got these little robot guys so many cool things you could do and I got these little dinosaurs so what I like to do is I like to have little ones and I like to have full-size ones because a lot of ones honestly where you're gonna find yourself like in these little small ones the best at least the parquet knees but like I said guys super easy super fast and anybody can do this you've got to get yourself two simple ingredients throw it all together and you're home free you can take these out in the lake with you and your fish and boom you're good but if you guys like what you saw today leaving a like subscribe don't forget to check me on instagram at the edge a chef and a lot of big things happening this week with medical edibles calm which I will be announcing later in the week so definitely be on the lookout for that

"- I feel like CBD is for people who do not have a weed plug, and can't afford a psychiatrist. (upbeat music) - I want to try CBD because a health food store near my apartment sells it for so much money, and I don't want to buy it. So I pitched a story on trying it for Jezebel. (laughing) - Cool. - I'm generally very angry, and filled with hate. And, I also like to get wavy, and weed makes me paranoid. So hopefully this will be a good remedy for all of those things. (laughs) - I was picturing like a Monopoly piece size. - The thimble, yeah! - Yeah like the thimble. - These are like, I don't know, the size of like, a large thumb, like the tip of a large thumb. - I really thought of CBD gummies as something that rich people who love Goop and The Wing are into, however, it comes in this sort of fancy cigar box, which makes me think that they're french. (chill beat) - It's like slime, kind of. (techno beat) - You get that sort of undertaste of weed, like when you eat a regular edible marijuana. - It's more flavorful than my antidepressant. - Okay - Which I don't chew. (all laughing) - I feel pretty much the same as I did before eating the gummy, but I also just ate a lot grits and pork, I think, so I feel a little tired from that. - I feel like my normal self. My normal self I think is like, everything is fine because it has to be. - I also can't tell if it's like, oh am I just feeling the effects of something, and feel more relaxed and having a good time, or like, maybe I'm just having a good time being around all of you. - [In Unison] Aww, yeah. - But it could just be like the gummy I ate, yeah. - Oh, interesting. Cool. - I kind of felt a little light outside the studio, I had a bagel before this, so, the results might be skewed, I don't know. My results might be different, 'cuz I didn't eat it on an empty stomach. I wonder if that's better or worse? - I think that this is gonna be a video that's partially about Jezebel understanding how we react to food, because I think that some of it coincided with the lunch that we just ate. - On a daily basis, I usually feel very anxious. Constant anxiety every second of the day. I'm not feeling anything right now. - I do feel something that sounds like descriptions of people, almost when you're like, coming up or something. Almost like something's mounting, just like, very subtly or something, there's like a slight tingliness in my feet. - Sometimes with edibles, I can't really tell if I'm high, either, but then some of them I feel it like, 10 minutes after, and I can like really tell. This is more like, I can't really tell. - It's subtle. I mean I feel like, slightly different maybe, but I can't tell if that's just because I want this thing to work. - It doesn't compare to most of the other drugs that I've done, in any way shape or form. However I would actually, like, I do feel very relaxed, and I would say that it is akin to my SSRI. I did feel like actually pretty tightly wound, and quite angry, I do not feel that way anymore. So maybe it is working. My arms feel slightly weird. They kind of feel like... - Like jigglish, like kind of loose? - Kind of just loose, yeah, and it's not like when, don't do this at home, kids, it's not like when you take like MDMA or whatever, and you're like, \"Ah, I have to put my arms over my head!\" - This works more than I thought it would. I think. For sure. - Yeah. Yeah, like I wanna take the leftover box. - Yeah yeah, like, we would split the, yeah sure. - Yeah I'm not sure yet, I might just like, stick to my SSRI, but I mean, again, obviously I took my SSRI this morning and felt rage, and now I don't, so maybe I should. - Maybe you could supplement your SSRI with this. - With CBD, yeah. It just seems like, a little bit, like it's more expensive than my SSRI. It seems like a little pricey, and so perhaps the CBD industry should think about making it where it's more egalitarian, so that more people can use them. - I think these gummies might be good for people who don't want to go full-on into weed, or they maybe don't feel like vaping, or having an edible. And they just want to like, feel something nice, or calming. - I definitely think that it works, and I feel like whereas before I was very Daenerys Targaryen with my rage, now I feel more Cersei with it, where I'm very like, sort of removed from the rage, and then therefore I can use it more as a weapon, which is exciting to me. - I think it reduced my anxiety, in combination with lunch and friendship, and I think that the pain of being alive is a permanent condition. - I must agree with Katie, actually. (chill beat)", "_ye7_mXKUuk": "[Music] the marijuana edible review show where we help you guys make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are talking high five chuckles again high five chocalate this is their dark chocolate bar 200 milligrams of THC I've already reviewed one of their products liked it quite a bit I reviewed their milk chocolate this time we're looking at the dark and I gotta say I'm pretty I got good expectations high expectations for this one because the first one was such a success so we're out here at the beautiful dog beach you can look behind you and see all these wonderful ships maybe maybe not long the beach I believe the second largest port in the United States may be the first largest by dollar amount it's even a little larger spy dollar amount or byte the total tonnage I care I have smashed my finger making this very difficult to open guys oh wait wait I see something here ah I got it but I'm dealing a thumb so here we go we've got our high five bar here you can see it with its little logo embossed on it let's give a bite of the dark chocolate again this is 200 milligrams oh and it cost me I believe 15 dollars at my dispensary so a pretty good deal for a 200 milligram chocalate bar oh no tastes pretty good good dark chocolate nice quality almost zero cannabis taste - uh - speak up almost none whatsoever just a good quality chocolate alright guys whoop I'm gonna finish this off and I will come back to you in two hours or through the magic of editing just in a couple of seconds and we'll let you know how I'm feeling because that's the most important part of the edible review thanks for watching guys and I'll see you in just a bit peace [Music] two two hours later alright guys we are two hours in the future um and I am talking about high by dark chocolate 200 milligrams of THC and curiously at least curiously to me I am less high than I was for the milk chocolate I definitely am less high than I was that the less high five bar not dramatically so not the golf isn't extreme but I am noticeably less high I'd say I'm maybe four right now which is not as high as I was hoping to be I was hoping I was gonna be as high as the last one but that's just not the case so maybe their chocolate isn't super consistent I don't know yet we will experiment some more with high five but I I would say for sure I definitely feel less high than I did the first time just look at my eyeballs why does snow not that's a perfect metric by any measure but you know in a pinch it'll work so this time it was a little bit of a disappointment for hi-fi uh yeah I was I was expecting more so they got pinged a little bit for that I'm sure just four diminished or four reduced expectations but I'm human so I'm fallible I still don't hate it I still like the way it tasted and it's still and I'm still kind of high so you know it's not a complete loss and it was it was 15 bucks so it's not the most expensive chocolate bar edible it's just this is no longer in the same ballpark as like a Akiva bar this is this is out of that contention out of that conversation now well guys that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds I appreciate you watching as always and we will check you out on a later of you piece spec pack through our why is my tongue blue Oh brisk that's why bye guys", "ufr2SU18_WE": "[Music] the cbd

just never done uh it's root beer so there are 30 milligrams each and I still have this really bad cold like it's it's horrible I don't have the the muscle pains or anything but everything's just kind of here and you just feel like [ __ ] so I'm hoping that this will this will feel better this will feel better this will make me feel better okay so let's let's see I'll do okay all of it why not it's Saturday I have nothing to do I've been like this since Thursday maybe you know oops make me feel better I'll put these two in at first um they taste like the root beer surprisingly because I haven't been able to taste [ __ ] and then you could taste like it tastes a bit of that that we'd taste or whatever it is but I will say the the root beer ones here you can taste the root beer I've done a big fan of root beer but at least least I'm not tasting like the weed because it wasn't usually when I do it really sticks in your mouth so what I'll do is let these dissolve and when I come back I'll let you know how long it took for them to kick in and also what I'm feeling and all kinds of stuff like that so it'll be doctor probably usually takes about an hour yeah it's like around 12:30 now so probably it'll be a little bit it doesn't work if art used to work really quick and notes that's real roughly about an hour you know what sometimes I wake to I've been waiting I'll go a little bit over when I first start feeling it because usually it what I'm done telling you guys it's you know if I would have waited the extra 15 minutes or whatever to do it or even half an hour sometimes cuz it just keeps getting stronger for me anyways and anyways we'll be back I'll be back to tell you what I'm feeling and everything else ok so it's been like um like an hour and a half I would say and at first like I started like when I first started to filling in feeling feeling this it was like roughly about it like an hour in ten minutes and then hang on I'm gonna I'm gonna light a joint so that one's looking around in an hour and ten minutes and then um I was like well like I started to feel better right I was like oh my sickness it's finally going away so I you know I went out and [Music] it's nice but it's like really windy here you know and then I put some like I had like these little um glass pumpkins you know whatever so those are going inside and [ __ ] this [ __ ] joint so then you know then a I had some other things I had to do like ahead of this list Lola this list that um but I you know whenever I thought of something that like had to be it has to be done before the snow comes and then I went back in the house cuz I was in and out doing stuff and it was like so nice and cozy in there but i was like no we can't feel okay like I feel better than I did yesterday way better there's the bus we better than the first day I'd say smoke this when when you're gonna cold still feel like that congestion and [ __ ] but you if you need to get some stuff done let's stand in here in the cubby [Music] somebody's mowing the grass and I don't know why anyways I'm dumb so the medicated hard candies you get them at Canada smell the root beer is actually pretty not like it's it's not that bad like you can taste a lot of the root beer taste some I find that you don't taste like you know I don't know I say strawberry Kiwi I think that was one of them but you taste like a lot of the THC the root beer I tasted the root beer I'll stay stay on stuff but the root beer was I need to just keep puffing on this [Music] thank you Charlie likes this kind of weather I know what I want to give this [Music] I'm gonna give it a 9 in the oh my [ __ ] category just because like this this feels better than when you take like cold pills you know like cool pills gets rid of like say this stuff you know is for a couple hours and but sometimes this kind of cute nut cures but it makes it better than the cold pills not too sure how it would work on the COFF maybe because I reek like if it's a indica and it was a really one of the things and it was feeling relaxed maybe you would kind of slow down your cough ever think anyways that's my gig at night because you know you're sick but it feels so much better like it's the only thing to is okay so this is we're still spoken the new Caen before I got sick I like the munchies like crazy since I've been sick I have like and cuz that's part of the cold they think that you have no one no appetite you can just you eat but it's like it's not a big deal and maybe it's because like you can't taste either I don't did you hear the bang fire a Charlie wait Charlie's right there he didn't even alert me what's wrong with you there's mr. Berg [ __ ] I was okay and now like I'm really maybe they don't like the smell but it's really windy oh maybe not just slam the door what the [ __ ] this review went from like being grade and it's still great but there's just a little paranoia anyways I was gonna say maybe gonna rake the yard but I'm not really sure I want to do that anymore this [ __ ] joint that's not even me that's rolling it's like a little machine so dr. everywhere there's one year that's one over there just keep smoking it and they won't know if maybe I'm having us like it just that cigarette cigarette come on this I'm just a little nervous I was all talkative Oh forgotten I'm coffee I [Music] don't think you all forget it's a little close I don't think you want to watch me rake the yard like that's a little bit boring so I'll just keep talking um yeah this stuff is pretty good I could move or they'd probably be so much better if you weren't second did it but and and you'd probably you know like when you're sick and you don't sleep as well this stuff here would probably you would probably get a good night's sleep yeah I would have thought a like if you [Music] stop charlie you take like cold medicine and whatever for how many years and like you don't even there is stuff that is and it lasts longer too like cold medicine is it doesn't last that long like four hours like maybe two hours this stuff lasts way longer than two hours and you feel way better there yeah there's Charlie he wants to play hey Charlie want to play um okay so um my hands are starting to get a little bit cold and I think maybe I should go inside so um I'll meet you guys back inside in like a minute or two okay so um it's been like it's just about been like two hours and then still I'm feeling uh still pretty good I'm a little bit hungry not like um not like you just you just need to like chew on something like a couple chips or I don't know whatever it is right and bettan you're good like you just um the only thing that I noticed that's different is my nose is really stopped right now but tomorrow I still feel good and get it at can abysmal and I was also just thinking like maybe it's not mad for everybody but I should take this before you know taking the cold medication and you're still like um you feel like when you do when you're high except if you have a cold then you feel the cold part too but it's like you know it's there but like the symptoms aren't really bugging you overclock the the type of day it is today like gum it's I don't know it's ten or eleven or out and sunny and there's like a wind and there's like there's not much there's not like a lot of leave while the trees most of them are pretty bare just the type of day it is it's like a you know it reminds me when I was a kid just like though you know like you can smell Thal it's like one of those days these hard candies you know pretty good and if you want to maybe experience um [Music] now that he said that okay so yesterday there was like a little bit of snowflakes here not like a lot but there was so many like there was not like enough and I remembered when I was a kid that we had a deck and there was me and my brother and my my friend and her brother so I was friends with her and my brother was friends with her brother I don't remember we're outside playing and and we were on the deck and for whatever reason I don't know what worden I remember when it started to snow and it was like around like 4:30 ish so it was it was um like night I think it wasn't a sunny day so it was my not dark but you know it was like kind of like dark anyways remember we started jumping up and down saying they was snowing and like how we were gonna go sliding from this little bit of snow and I was like I forgot all about bad yeah I find like other than like the the the being sick part it's good like I just I wish I wasn't feeling like this so it would feel better but it still feels good um and I think that's everything said nine get them from I can't abismo the medicated hard candies there thirty milligrams each and and oh my god no this is just getting really bad Hey oh yeah there's like a lots of different flavors they have on there I enjoy them [Music] and I think that's that's everything so that's it that's all bye", "OnmUvQFoJWE": "hi everyone so I'm going to be doing a review of the green apple medicated hard candies from cannabis no I'll just take the whole it's a hundred milligrams of THC it's just a different flavor than the other ones but I have to try it out there it is a whole bunch of little squares all stuck together Wow for for not a whole bunch each 25 milligrams of THC I'm tasting THC um I'm not tasting green apple at all there a little bit of sweetness but not not green apple I would say just like taste like maybe like a corn syrup or Oh like little sugary you may have some people I would say just ignore it so well this has been here because it takes usually like an hourish you start to feel it but I have another right and I'm gonna smoke now wait for this to kick it by the time this takes in this will be all do you like doing its job I should have maybe broke these up because it's like cuz they're in the way like a look right there anyways let's get this lit [Music] still under under the tree where nobody could see so I'm gonna smoke this but time I'm done this those will be dissolved go jump in the shower because I probably won't want to feel like taking one later and come back and let you guys know what how I'm feeling now so with a package again you get them at can abysmal what we back up this kicks in probably not out here but I'll be back okay so it's been an hour and a half and as you can tell these have kicked in my eyes feel so heavy and like I just feel really relaxed and you don't feel like doing too much like you know thank God I did everything earlier cuz I would not do anything like that on this I your whole body like it just makes you feel relaxed I like this is like an oh my [ __ ] like that's my rating of it it's it's very good um yeah you get like a little bit thirsty but you also get like hungry so I got try them these are my favorite um like for a licorice I like I like this one I don't like the one that it's all twisty it's like a little bit tough and it has like a weird taste to it I don't really like that one I like the nibs or the you know how you can get the licorice that's all Brown you could probably watch a movie on this um more like hmm more like like those action suspense drama ones my son is bright um yeah it's uh just like the Owens is good I didn't taste the green apple though but it doesn't matter because it feels good like you feel good you don't feel like doing much but you feel good like read watching TV movie not cleaning or laundry or anything like that this is the stuff that makes you feel like you know after you shower and like you know everything's done so and you're you feel like like sleep is gonna be really good but it even feels better when you have like wash sheets and stuff on the bed well I checked that this is what that makes you feel like like we wanted to get into a nice clean bed and just ah watch TV here just lay there and think I wouldn't recommend reading a book because I don't think you would get very far well that Sun is bright yes good eye you know what Lola's hard candies from campus know they're really good like they like I've tried other ones from a different dispensary and they weren't good at all the ones I can abysmal there uh mm-hmm you just go there and get them like it's it's good stuff [Music] and by like can I do that Sun is really bothering it's really bothering me down d'arnot all okay there I don't know that'll have to do um was I talking about them mmm I don't remember well with the can of the Canada's no like they never let me down they just a face cell is it was very good so you should go there I don't understand why like people are so against feeling like this you don't there's nothing wrong with what you're feeling you don't you know what's going on and stuff I mean I don't understand that so like what you know think it's Saturday why I like smoke a joint and do edibles like what's wrong with that it gives you like you know time just to relax that's what I think it just you know that's what it does for me and if you didn't want to do the animals and you know there's the other there's other ways of doing it but I feel really well like I feel like you want to get comfy I'm in the chair with the I watched all the the what do they called the throw blankets today and like we have quite a bit so but those are like there's always soft and stuffed you know and you hang them outside and they have that outside smell and I just I think that's what I will be doing after is getting one in or two of those blankets and just watching something TV or something and covering up with the pie cake I'm just just chilling I should have brought something else other than these nibs I can't get the munchies do I feel paranoid yes yes as in I wouldn't answer the door at all continue doing whatever it was I was doing stuff feels really good good like [Music] I don't know how to describe it I really don't I feel like um I'm just really good like um not like good like yeah I'm not be but good like as in relaxed and I guess at peace like just really like you're enjoying stuff like you have time to enjoy stuff that's how I felt also any aches and pains and it helps with that it helps Brooke like everything I can can't think of a thing that it wouldn't help with subjects we were sad you'd be happy after if you were when I was a kid okay so the way I'm sitting on the bed I'm one legs just dangling down and I'm ever like when I was a kid I used to always think there was something something under the bed that hurt you know I grabbed my knees my feet probably for my ankle I remember him I remember like I go I got so bad that at my parents house the hallway and off to the right there was the bathroom and then there was my room at the very end of the hallway was a closet and on the left side was my parents room and my brother's room and everybody it you know had to go get a drink of water or something and my bed was never close to the light switch so I don't have to shop the light go like at the beginning of the hallway run as fast as I can and just get like step into my room and you'll leap across onto my bed because I thought there was something under that was gonna grab my feet and then I get that I you know it's probably like I know it's nothing but I still get that feeling sometimes and it happened while I was doing that so that's why I told you I don't remember I was talking about before this and it's probably not gonna come back to me either but hate when that happens [Music] that's good I would like I highly recommend it it was like I took it I 530 so he's hired at 5:30 I kicked in like seven ish maybe a little bit after not much and it's oh I can't hang on okay and it's going on 7:30 right now so like you're gonna feel like this for a while so which is good that's what you want you don't want to like this just to go away cuz I would kind of sock right now it just uh makes you enjoy stuff like TV I'm getting comfy and you can get come because you're not a lot you're not even like pain if you have pain my eyelids feel so bad over my eyelids feel so heavy like they just you just feel my eyelids feel tired and even when they look tired right I think that they look happy you're loving they're loving it my eyes are loving this if they're tired and they're just I think people did this like if you really look at yourself I think you can maybe like and some people see what kind of person they are when they were work to be on this maybe not though I don't know I'm just I'm just thinking of stuff and say you know to you guys [Music] I'm not very comfortable sitting the way I am but I don't want to put my foot down there yet so the marinated hard candies cannabis bomb well worth it highly recommend it I didn't taste green apple but um you taste like I tasted the THC and like something a little bit sweet here and there really just makes you feel relaxed and a little bit thirsty and like a little bit hungry but not bad like you don't know you're not gonna like eat meat eat just like something here and there my rating of this is an oh my [ __ ] um you just feel like relax and you don't feel like um doing anything like like physically you don't feel like doing anything watching a movie yeah things like that yep that's what you feel like doing um and your eyelids may feel okay I can't sit like that any longer your eyelids may feel heavy but it does not matter cuz you still feel happy and I think that's everything I don't I don't know what else to talk about so that's it that's all bye", "DKyoJGC4krs": "what's going on

be making a small batch of hard candy using Lauren's super strength oils if you're new to our channel would like to see more recipes please like subscribe and don't forget to click the notification button [Music] I'm specifically highlighting Loran oils because I tend to get the most compliments when I use their flavors it's very important to set everything up in advance on the stovetop I keep a cup with warm or hot water to keep my brush in and it'll be where I place my thermometer when I remove it you'll need a brush or a tool to remove sugar crystals from your pot we purchase these cute silicone bear molds which will provide a link to in the description however if you don't have a mold you can use a small lightly oiled sheet pan for your candy on medium heat add your sugar corn syrup and water and stir until it comes to a small boil [Music] periodically you want to take your brush and remove the crystals that form around your pot now that your mixture is boiling stop stirring but continue to brush the sugar crystals that form around your pot your candy will be ready when it reaches the hard crack line on your candy thermometer as you get closer to 300 you want to make sure that your oil and food coloring if you're using it are ready because once you reach hard crack stage your candy mixture becomes time sensitive now that your mixture is reached hard crack stage remove your thermometer add your food coloring if you're using it and your one dream of Lorien oils stirring continuously some oils because they're super strength have strong scents so be sure to keep your oven or your stove fan on after you remove your mixture from the heat quickly but carefully because it's very hot transfer into your molds or onto a sheet pan my husband isn't a professional videographer and I'm not a professional candy maker so this shot is a little shaky and a little sloppy however this little tool I'm using is perfect to fix my mistake so we'll be sure to add a link to this silicone spatula below whether using molds or a sheet pan let your candy cool completely before removing once your candy is cooled if you're using a sheet pan gently break your candy into bite-sized pieces and you can also sift powdered sugar over them I personally prefer molds because they don't have as many sharp edges and as you can see even with arthritic hands they easily pop out [Music] sometimes I accidentally have fill some of the molds and we end up with a bowl full of accidents which my husband is happy to dispose of there are many recipes for hard candy as you can see I have a variation including rock candy but for more candy ideas we'll put a link to Lauren's website in the description this is a great homemade gift for any occasion or any season please share your candy ideas with me in the comments below and maybe I'll make them in a future video if you enjoyed this video and would like to see more please like subscribe and hit the bell for notifications of

pebbles they're definitely very magical the reason they're magical is because they are infused with 100 milligrams of THC so you know they're definitely magic anyways today I got you guys this video review of the pebbles because I love these these are these just jumped to the top of my list of edibles that's up there with spot suits drink legal drink there's there's a bunch of other books that I haven't made complete videos for but this is I'm glad I'm doing this now because this is definitely one of the top 5 I would say at least for edibles these are amazing I picked these up yesterday on our daily walk with our dog me and my fiance walk our dog to our pot store and because they love her there so she's kind of famous anyways we've been getting these pre-rolls there and I just haven't had a chance to even buy any other type of like even flour or especially in our edibles so I'm glad I picked these up picked them up for 25 bucks so we got ten pieces of ten milligrams equaling a hundred milligrams of THC so each individual serving is Timnath two milligrams and I gotta say these work fast like stupid fast like it took us it takes us half an hour to walk to and from the pot store so hat we ate one outside you know we're not supposed to obviously but we ate one each outside while we were walking here before we start walking here from the pot store tip to our home and it took us I want to say like 25 to 30 minutes to get home and by the time we were home we were just [ __ ] the lid like we were ready to just have a good time and we ended up actually going to the pool afterwards our apartments which was actually pretty nice because I took another another one of these magic pebbles and while I was at the pool and we were just gone just terribly gone we're just there this I couldn't believe how fast and how hard these actually hit me don't get me wrong they're not gonna knock you on your ass it's not strong like that but it was strong to where I felt it immediately after like 30 minutes which for me is good because I mean for anybody is good why would you want to wait any longer for your high right but I feel like with me it'll both usually take up to like an hour something like that from what I noticed forty minutes to like an hour but never as fast as these and these were amazing they taste these I got these blue raspberry ones that actually taste like the little lollipops you get from you know your your doctor or your barber or whatever you know just have like a bow out of out there and the front by the desk and you just like take one at the bank you know those little lollipops little dum-dums it tastes just like that this blue raspberry but I have I'll show this right quick so if you wanna if you feel like you're reading through all through all this you can just pause it actually have I will read part of this they actually describe how they do the cannabis extraction for the edibles on here I says the cannabis extract is uh I can't even talk right now I'm so high about to eat another one by the way but anyways it says right here it's extracted using BHO i winterize with ethanol and then it's distilled leaving no residual solvents so they say they grow with passion and extract with position so it's just a magical experience and it really is I really do enjoy these and these taste so amazing and they look I mean they just looked like candy you know I had to open one because it is trouble with the wrapper I do have trouble with the wrapper I do have to use two hands and since I am recording this I need one hand so I just had to pre open it man these are these are amazing they and let me just show them the light here of the Sun my baby like and you can see the blue where these don't taste don't have an overwhelming taste of THC it tastes just it there's like small hints or whatever but it's not actual it isn't it doesn't over overwhelm and that's what that's what I really like about this and edible because I love weed but I do not love though we taste and it and most of the most like there's some dry like brownies out there that just tastes like straight up ass I'm not for that these are so much better so I would definitely recommend getting these blue raspberry good flavor just go ahead and start eating that but yeah my review are you afraid oh sorry I'm just trying to the flavor I can't describe it's just like a small hint of like marijuana but the rest is just blueberry just straight-up and they're pretty good so yeah I love these definitely gonna be picking up some more 2010 425 it's not a bad deal yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this video because I'm about to enjoy this candy Almighty really another one I check these guys out man magic kitchen they were in the Southeast Washington area I Northwest Washington area I don't know I said southeast give these guys to try magic kitchen they got pebbles I think they carry there's different types of flavors for sure they got like pineapple strawberry stuff like that but I think they also have line for there's a different it's not just candy they have other stuff so I definitely give them a check check out see what's up with them but yeah that's it for this video man I'm gonna go roller joint finish this edible and then get high some more alright guys see you guys later stay lifted lift it is for", "rMUYiFrH_54":

will be joining the lineup i do know they are working on protein rtds to replicate some of their delicious protein flavors let's talk a little bit about ghost energy and why it separates itself from the pack and other energy drinks on the market so we have sour watermelon warhead we have sour patch kid um again the collaborations with the companies love how ghost does that i think this is what orange mango tropical mango sorry and then we have citrus feedback has been phenomenal on these and another thing you really have to appreciate with ghost is the transparency they put on the formulas so if that is hard to see i will also put it in the comment box and i'll give you a quick rundown on what we are getting in ghost energy right now so per can you get 200 milligrams of natural caffeine you get one gram of taurine which is an endurance booster one gram of all car which is right here acetyl l-carnitine so that's basically a cognitive enhancer and you're also going to see that with the other aspects that are in the formula with you get the 150 milligrams of alpha gpc again that and the neuro factor at 100 milligrams are all there for your brain health brain function and focus so it's not only just giving you clean natural caffeine there's also those enhancers in there to really smooth out the caffeine half-life and make it a really really long lasting you know amount of energy not something that's just going to spike your energy and make you crash totally different here the kicker here which i really like is the 25 milligrams of estrogen at the bottom that basically enhances everything that's in the beverage as far as uptake of the ingredients truly appreciate ghost putting that in an energy drink to make those ingredients a little bit more effective so now that we know a little bit more about ghost energy uh if you haven't really followed ghost youtube at all they have hinted at maybe 10 to 12 more flavors in the future and based off what we're seeing here with the sour patch kids warheads i'm going to guess that whatever's coming to their gamer line is going to carry over to the energy line because i know they are working on a collaboration with uh i think it's like expel or whatever that uh gaming corporation is for a limited edition flavor so we're going to go right down the line here and i'm going to start with citrus i'm going to guess this is going to be something similar to sprite i'm uncertain but let's give it a go cheers legends yeah i wasn't too far off with that one i think this is a really safe flavor um that people will really enjoy kind of get a little bit of lemon in the back end there a little bit of zest from the citrus pretty standard flavor to me it's not something that's going to knock your socks off and make me want to go out and you know just buy a 12 pack of you know citrus but good change of pace yeah i would say so but definitely not something that's uh you know off the top of my head that's a must get flavor just trying it so let's move here tropical mango chocolate mango right yep tropical mango that orange can throws me off thinking it's something orange so i love mango flavored things uh this one probably is definitely peaking my interest let's give it a whirl oh yeah that mango hits you hard in the back end in the aftertaste so the tropical is kind of like your initial fruit punch you know that array of flavors that really hits your taste buds that mangoes the density of the mango really kicks in in the back end you have to let this one kind of sit on your taste buds for a little bit but you will pick up that mango and it does hit hard so this is another good one um let's see how these other two are before i kind of make my consensus here so i have not had the sour patch red berry in legend or any of the other flavors this is my first experience with it i've heard nothing but great things so going into this one with an open mind hopefully it's a home run cheers damn wow i'll tell you what you guys that love your sour patch kids love that sweetness love that red berry home run this is wow this is up there when it comes to all-time energy drink flavors just off that initial taste dan ghost ryan adam rest of the team this right here phenomenal i can kind of see why for ghost gamer it's such a very popular flavor so let's get to the last one here sour watermelon warheads i have had this in pump really really like this flavor so super pumped to try it in the energy as well cheers yeah that's ooh wow the density of that watermelon oh so unique it's like the og extend like in the black labels that jolly rancher flavor but enhanced with the sweetness of the warhead now this one is definitely for those that got a nice sweet tooth and the carbonation really kicks up the amount of flavor in it between these two i could buy a 12 pack of those in a heartbeat and i would have no problem drinking them day in and day out these two flavors lights out now citrus i would say maybe a six out of ten seven out of ten i mean it's a good change of pace definitely not something top tier that i think is a must go get but if you want to try it out i would highly suggest it and i would say the tropical mango would be around like a seven seven and a half it's good i think it needs a little bit more on the initial taste the mango's really good in the back end but the tropical flavor is a little lackluster but overall i would kind of rank them very similar to this you know one and two right here very hard between that and then i would say three and four but overall really excited about these guys when you can get your hands on them right away i would go with these two um you can roll the dice with these but again they're not my preference they may be yours but whenever i buy ghost products i'm not associated with the brand all my pennies go to price plow i always support ben mike and heather you can always use their coupon code price plow at ghostlifestyle.com save 20 off your order they should be coming out really soon in multiple locations so keep your eyes out if you give them a try let me know what you think", "yQlPMFGdOHw": "[Music] hello everyone well via weights the net one edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today we are talking about carrot candies I know in the past I have warned you about taking the candy version of gummies instead of the confectionery version I myself have found them to be laughing but I have a lot of people asking me to review candies a lot so here we are with can of candies 240 milligrams of THC spread out over for candy so I assume that means 60 what's the math sixty THC per candy right that's correct yeah it's gotta be okay they've got four different flavors we've got great we've got watermelon we've got lemon we've got cherry they are hard candy so I'm gonna have to suck on these bad boys these are from SC labs I believe is the company that makes them and without further ado let's open them up and give them a taste so if this is your first time tuning in two weeks the way I reviews work guys is I'm going to take these candies because they are all individually wrapped oh here we are they are all individually wrapped four different little candies you can actually see maybe little bits of fruit I don't know something on the inside of those gummies four different gummies because I don't want to break my teeth I'm going to suck on one finish it off camera and finish the rest off camera and then I will be back in two hours to let you know how these things are feeling because that's the most important part of any edible review okay so let's see we've got four to choose from any meaning not a watermelon is up first so canna candies on the back actually has its nutrition information which I like to see 27 calories / gummy has the ingredients as well as you know the distribute the sort of standard don't take this while driving blah blah blah blah blah yadda yadda yadda I am going to have to gear up some scissors I should have had these with me already or maybe I can just do it with my teeth let's find out Oh God um so that's something good to know I don't just take these into a movie theater or something with you expecting this good opened cuz there is no easy way to do so almost got it here there we go in the mouth this is the watermelon flavor huh taste okay you can definitely taste some marijuana the we taste it um not overpowering you can also taste the watermelon it's like a less intense it's like a less intense Jolly Rancher with a little bit of weed taste to it that's about the best way I can describe it it's not good it's not terrible I'm not dreading having to eat all four of these not looking forward to it you know come seeking side so with that guys I'm gonna finish these here for guddi's not coming sorry hard candies I'll finish them and I'll come back to you guys in about two hours to let you know how they are feeling and with that guys I will thank you for watching whitson on we will see you into a horse piece two hours welcome back two weeks we are talking canna candies today and I guess a so I want it right them very highly but this is my favorite candy I've had so far in terms of like non convection airy non like baked good so like gummies hard candies straws all those kind of things sour straws these are my favorite I'm not incredibly baked I've certainly had more potent 240 myelogram edibles before but for a candy something that you know you pop in your mouth and suck on for a while I'm pretty high so I'm pleasantly surprised with the potency on these I still want to did still want to be my first choice I really in most or any context to go with the candies because they don't taste that good and they don't get you that high although this was pretty cheap I think this cost me $8 so it wasn't outrageously expensive so you know I liked it for for a non confectionary edible but again not going to be my first choice at the dispensary but if you're looking for a candy and if you see can of candies these are not a bad one to go with and with that guys that's going to do it for this review here on weeds thank you so much for watching and we will check you out on the next episode peace hello and thank you so much for watching weeds if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below and I'll be more than happy to try to find the product to review it again thanks for watching and we'll check you guys out on the next video", "ZDbyBPkJ_h4": "quick disclaimer if you are under the age of 18 or 21 or whatever it is in your state or you are not legally allowed to consume cannabis I have to ask you to not watch my things hi everyone because she kept me here with either of you I am the illegal medical cannabis patient in the state of Pennsylvania looking to make reviews to help patients like me find medicine that can help them so let's get started today I'll be doing a review of cotton candy hiya Liberty it's also called a tranquility from them I really like the smell and the consistency and everything of this product I thought I was gonna be running with how liquidy it was but it wasn't it was still like butter so I was really interesting to to see the only thing that was a little odd it was the shade of green it had to it I'm assuming that's from too much plant matter getting in I don't know I don't make concentrates that's just my assumption from what I've learned but for me it smells almost like what are they called I think there were honey bites my friend and I were discussing this the other day honey bit honey bit something like that but those little I'll put a picture in here somewhere those little candies so as you can tell they liked it there's not much left this is my fourth attempt at making a review because every time that I have made one for some reason there was something there wrong with the video or it just didn't come out right it's anyway I learned a little bit more about lighting and I'm trying to hone my skills instead of pushing out videos so I'm hoping to have a video out once every other week is my plan so far I might go more often but every other week is is a good assumption for a video for me so back to the review this strain was unfortunately $50 for a half grand which i think is those are not medical prices Pennsylvania that's not medical pricing that's like top shelf rec prices it really helped me out a lot but it's just too expensive in my opinion to continue supporting that price point and I also feel the same way about moxie I think that wall moxie makes very good products they are outrageously priced $80 $90 a gram $100 a gram all those things are ridiculous and Cresco reserves that's also ridiculous but anyway now I will take my job after my complaints about prices I really love my doctor diver switch as well I saw in the comments that someone had asked me to make a video specifically about it so I don't know if that'll be my next video I'm not sure and as I say every time thanks for a birdie heat up speed tastes so good so I'm gonna sit for a second and then I'll talk about it back the string is so relaxing this one is not as immediate say my last strain review by oh Jesus links up there if you want to see it it's very very very relaxing I feel so much so onto the effects I feel like this stream would be really really fantastic if you were feeling down I'm so for depression I for me personally I found it really helped with my Yasha I was feeling really sick that one morning and I took a dab of cotton candy and it really really helped so nausea pain I also feel like it could help with and it does help with for me not as much as some other strean so that's right it's not at the top but maybe insomnia as well I feel a little sleepy but not as bad as other strains of me so for the negatives I just feel like dry mouth and dry eyes the usual culprits are the worst make it is even when I took a larger dose of this I had no anxiety but that gun was me personally so yeah so I don't really know what else to say about this strain so now that my review is done anybody who's still here I have some announcements I will be doing a giveaway on my Instagram so if you want to head over to my Instagram account link I believe is in the description or I can put a thing in the description cuz I never remember to use the description properly sorry everyone Oh Dan deeds what how many days now 24 days or something ridiculous until the Pennsylvania cannabis festival so I hope I thought had a card in here however I hope that I get to see you all there orally so view there be really cool I was also asked to speak so oh and I have like a hundred and twenty something subscribers what thank you that's incredible I really really appreciate it so that's why I'm also doing the giveaway to show my appreciation so feel like when it's announced it will be announced on my Instagram I am also way more active on Instagram that I am on YouTube or the weed tube or Facebook thing but yeah cool thanks for listening thanks for watching thanks for everything thank you for your support thank you for enjoying spending your time watching me talk I appreciate every single solitary minute that you guys stick around and watch and yeah thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you I hope that you have a wonderful wonderful day or night or whatever it is where you are right now and stay medicated I you", "dqiPVgOSLJY": "[Music] hello everyone and welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of your dispensary traditional ass review here on wheats today which means good old-fashioned edible we're taking a look at a brand new to us edible and one that has some real curiosities going on here as i look at this package and uh who is that or what is that that is the strangely named fruit slabs the og mango so this is as far as i can tell the name is fruit slabs i guess that is both the product and brand name uh and the flavor is the og mango this is an edible purchased in a legal dispensary in long beach california uh my traditional place for 18 bucks which puts it on the more expensive and for um sort of gummy fruit snacky kind of edibles uh in this market but not outrageously so uh you but a slight premium over uh comparable products out there although uh this one does seem to be of a higher quality they are um happy to tell you that it is real fruit it is vegan it is also infused uh no sugar added and gluten free uh and like all california edibles this is a 10 milligram or 100 excuse me 100 milligrammer in 10 10 milligram servings um the ingredients just like their uh sort of instructions there uh are pretty simple organic mango puree concentrate and thc extract that concentrate on different level there threw me off um this product is made in a facility that processes coconut so be aware um so yes uh as i said there's some curious things going on here in this packaging uh as i noticed as i was getting ready to grab it for the review curiously uh i'm not sure how well it shows up there the original uh distributor manufacturer yeah manufacturer has been blacked out in sharpie for some reason uh and now there is another sticker with a different creator name on it who knows um not that worried about it and there's this big wks which i guess is probably the you know group that produces these things and with what looks to be hebrew underneath also curious um but cool so uh let's go ahead and open these 18 edibles uh fruit slabs and give them a try uh like all of our awaits reviews we're gonna do it the same way which is i'm gonna review uh this whole product here gonna do the entire 100 milligram dose uh probably it's going to take me about an hour or so to get through them all but we'll do some of them here on camera for you guys get you an impression of how they taste and here we go i was kind of curious to see what a fruit slab was going to be and this was not exactly what i was uh expecting um so here are our servings two four six eight ten as said mango puree they are fruit slabs as uh as advertised at a hundred excuse me 10 milligrams each uh and 7.2 calories so not not too high uh all right well here is our looks like somebody just got home hello dogs hello everyone hello hello um excuse me just a second sorry about that dogs excited they're excited about fruit slabs just like me let's give this first fruit slab a try there comes the weed so these um just kind of like i thought they might be we're like those um fruit roll-ups but uh that the healthy the rich kids parents gave them uh the fruit roll-ups that were like vaguely healthy for you that's what these pretty much are um there are yeah mango puree uh is exactly what this tastes like it's good it's actually pretty tasty uh there is a hefty cannabis aftertaste to that last one let's give this one a try not bad not bad at all and then again comes in the cannabis aspartase but nothing too potent and doesn't stick around too too long either um overall not bad um i would be wary it has been quite warm here in southern california so they may be a little bit stickier than they normally would be um but these are quite melty already and they are coming off without too much trouble but i can imagine on just a couple of degrees warmer and these things becoming a mess so you may want to take that into account um you want to eat these when it's not super hot out uh but you know seems to be working okay for now even if they are sticky and with that term sticky guys we'll determine if these fruit slabs are as sticky as the icky implies all right i'm gonna finish off the remaining seven as i said probably over the next hour so uh and then about two hours or so after that last one i'll come right back to you guys and let you know exactly if these fruit slabs are as good as we uh are hoping they are right now until then stay high stay healthy we'll see you soon [Music] welcome back to weeks guys it has been two and a half ish hours since i started our fruit slabs uh from wks whatever that sticker says and they're pretty good um they score higher on the novelty chart than they do on the getting you high chart but they'll still get you pretty high um i'm not as high as i've ever been on a 100 milligram edible but you know i'm certainly feeling something uh in terms of taste pretty good i actually thought um uh pretty quality stuff and the taste wasn't bad until you get to the aftertaste when there is a not insubstantial weed taste but it's survivable um these are nominally more healthy than other edibles out there so you might want to take that into account but they are also slightly or pricier at that 18 bucks so all in all a pretty i'm gonna give it a a a qualified thumbs up for the fruit slabs uh one that i don't think i'm gonna necessarily reach for every time we do a review or anytime i do a um an edible for pleasure but one that you know if it's offered to me i certainly won't turn down uh and thinking speaking of things i'm not gonna turn down i'm gonna share with you a little cherry on top normally we only do these when we really love something but you know i was feeling generous fruit slabs i was thinking you know let's stick a thumb in the eye of the healthy options i don't know how often i've ever done food for cherry on tops how apropos is that so i'm gonna give you the most unhealthy food of all candy a candy recommendation who loves you me also who loves you nerds big bumpy beans probably my favorite candy on planet earth uh what is that it's like nerds but they're like nerds and jelly beans crossed together they're amazing i'm a jelly bean lover but then you add texture of nerds it's great nerds aren't good nerds big bumpy beans amazing fruit slabs by wks pretty good and with that guys that's going to do it for this cherry on top that's then going to do it for this review here on wheats it's going to do it for this whole shebang boo until our next review be sure to stay high more importantly stay healthy and we'll see you then goodbye", "1-tYudrj3Oc": "[Music] this is sandy Krakowski and welcome to a real change hey everybody I'm so excited I can't even tell you how excited I am I have a guest today with me Nadim al-haj son the CMO of bangbros we're gonna have fun and just jump into it and just have a conversation here and see where it goes but you are my cannabis expert who converted me to using more edibles and different things without even knowing it amazing good so you know I was typically using what most people would with cannabis and that is inhalation and all that so my first question for you why did you choose watermelon okay so that's my favorite candy yeah okay yeah there are absolutely my favorite candy I mean it's already a gummy in the market that people love yeah yeah let's make it better with THC we did yeah but what's so amazing is I've used other gummies and like I've been using cannabis for three years weaned off of all kinds of medication and it's just changed my life but I've had other gummies where you know like two and a half hours later somebody needed to peel me off the floor you know I was like okay I'm fine I'm waiting for it to kick in goodbye lips right I don't get that with that it's real smooth and I go to sleep one of our core values is consistency and that is that is true to its core and and and so you know it's the infusion method in which we do this is the small batch method that ensures the consistency also the vigorous testing that we do so if you're following the initiative right now testing is something that's going to be coming into the market by next year right very very important think about that testing has not been required the entire 10 years that medical cannabis has been in Arizona I hope that is very that is very concerning yeah very concerning concerning and we were testing long before there were even facilities you know there was one group that was doing it a lot of ambiguity if it was you know even accurate or not but sometimes the expression that any data is better than no data you know and so so through different trial and error methods different mixing methods different implementations you know we would test this batch test this batch and fast forward to here we are today we're testing you know hundreds of batches every single month Wow so I don't I'm not sure if you know but this little green tag right here or on the back of the package there's a white label you can skin or you can enter that batch ID on our website and they don't pull up the test results oh wow yeah so we call that on-demand testing yeah and it's you mean your fitness yeah so just like with supplements transparency is key yes you know if I want to know what I'm consuming the hello from food to supplements to anything ya know and that's something that Thomas and I share him even more so you know sometimes I might dude you're such a geek so check it out though this does this and I'm like well that makes sense you know okay let me check that out so we've wanted to apply that same motto or model and to our products and it should be transparent you should get exactly what is in it you should know that there are no microbe eels in here you should know that the potency is accurate and that leads to your original question the potency right so we have a plus or minus and it is always going to be within two to three milligrams rather - yeah and and if it's not we don't put it out there yeah we district we pour bleach over the batch and throw it away Wow you know and it's we've learned a couple lessons but by doing that because you can't do that too many times no no and we've got a very very meticulous method and that ensures our consistency and that way you can go into any of the 85 dispensaries that we're in in the state get the same product anywhere you go congrat thank you thank you that's incredible I'm not even 30 yet almost my mom\u00eds hearts just like that kind of accountability is what gave me the confidence cause like when kovat hittin that and being used to inhalation and even micro dosing with inhalation throughout the day with a pen I wanted to make sure my lungs were stronger I knew my liver is okay for you know the edibles but you know I don't think people pay attention to if you run a company I don't have time to wake up right and have a cannabis hangover right you know I mean I don't have four hours in the morning to wake up at the dose was wrong absolutely you know and you were in the medical realm of all of this even when they had like medical marijuana farmers market I just moved here three years ago I was like what [Laughter] yeah tell me about it so early on so it became legal in 2010 I had moved here from Oklahoma went to school in Missouri with school in Oklahoma yeah came out here because it it helped a new and dear friend of mine a coach and my mom lived out here and so I was like I gotta go somewhere where I can learn about this and my intention was not to come out here and start an edible company not buy anyway no it was i-i've always been in love with the plant itself ya know yeah it was definitely you know using cannabis at recreationally back in school it wasn't you know wasn't Mike I'm gonna be a you know cannabis you know animal owner some day it was my mom bless her heart I love her she's a total hippie you know so she always just cultivated this this healthy relationship you know was never like it was never very strict mom you know but it was never like there was always an explanation with why it was wrong yeah you know or how to approach the relationship with whatever it be yeah so I'm thankful for that you know it and particularly with with in particular with cannabis you know like there were some times I kind of caught on where she found out I had cannabis and she was like you're gonna have to give that to me and I was like I hit like you know seven sixteen seventeen I was like aha you know and so that opened up and we became very just communicative with each other and I always had this I don't want say hippie but just healthy relationship with cannabis it wasn't ever like seen as a drug you know in my eyes were used as a drug you know and I I grew up wrestling so cannabis is really big and martial arts it's it's it means are up a really wrestling yeah we're going there in a bit yeah but eight or nine I about eight years old I started wrestling and got into it at an early state and there's a lot of story behind that too as to why you know my parents divorced and you know was on ritalin for a long time and it just a sport like that just really kind of you know hold me down and humbled me they say you know when you get put on your ass a couple of times you get humbled let's just say that and so I came to came to Arizona in 2000 into 2008 and I started growing right away you know I had a little closet grow yeah nothing big then just getting familiar with the plant and yeah there was no information out there in the early days nothing not like today like today where you go to like bake grows a column and you're like I'm making tasty drinks yeah and and there there were only forums available online so you dig yeah yeah you know and how to make cannabis butters and how to grow cannabis what medium to use to grow in and all this information a lot of it a lot of it out there and so had an early start into growing it passed in 2010 yeah and so that's when the ball started rolling right I you know got in with some friends that you know helped me financially get into a little bit of a bigger grow and yeah here's the thing though from 2010 to 2011 2011 there were no dispensaries so you've got almost two years that this has been legal but there's no dispensaries but so where do people get their medicine exactly so do you show your card - exactly so there I had friends that were caregivers and I myself as a patient would row I could cultivate and so I would be a cultivator and I could give you your allotment you're two and a half ounces every two weeks right so you would give me your grow right so you would give a caregiver your grow rights and then they could then their grow your play okay now I got two right so you weren't just my deal or I could exit right and it was and that was how it worked right now is a donation base you know I'm donating my grow rights to you and you can cultivate for me well what do you do with the excess you know and so I wasn't a big proponent on dealing and some I didn't yeah a very great area yeah yeah so you have these farmers markets right it's exactly what it sounds like if you go to the uptown farmers market over off like 26th Street in Bethany the biggest farmers market here it's yeah beautiful and lots of food all kinds and stuff it was just like that except indoors you've got 40 vendors that are been in all kinds of cannabis products I'm talking anything you can think of from capsules the cookies to cake pops to popsicles - we made it all we made it no you know and this is still around the time when we're trying to figure out dosing yeah and and that was a that was a real propeller in in Thomas and i's journey which which is about three years later because I'd gone to Washington and come back which maybe we'll get to and so those farmers markets allowed an opportunity to really start building a network you know like the other vendors and the other people that had these the caregivers and stuff like where some of us are still friends you know a small small group there's a lot of them weeded out but some of us are so contented [Laughter] no it's good some are now managers within dispensaries and so it's it's cool to see how everybody's evolved you know and Thomas and I we had met at the end of 2008 became friends we had no idea we're gonna be doing an edible business we connected over the similar interest yeah yeah right you know he had he'd recently lost his mother was you know kind of finding his life you know he went yeah did a five-year term in the Navy um it awesome you know he was a submariner so now yeah that can you know so we stayed connected the whole time and when he had come back from the Navy I had just left for Washington and then I had returned not too long after okay and that's when we were like hey cuz he you know he just got back he was taking a break he wanted to go to school to be a doctor still does and still will actually yeah very very very again he's just that mindset so be amazing yeah he's he's fun to talk to and so that's when we really connected because I came back and and while I was in Washington the Denver High Times Cannabis Cup in 2013 that was the first year it had ever come to America it all had been in Amsterdam oh wow right I had no idea yes so that and it was in Denver Colorado mmm was a big deal because Denver had just passed Connor creational that's it so you've got this event that has 50,000 people because it's recreational right and it's the first recreational cannabis event bigger than what stock saying it is it is it is contact hi - oh my gosh the whole city of Denver was lit let's just say and so and so I went as a just as a participation I was like I'm not this is history like I'm going yeah yeah the following year is when I'd come to Thomas and I was like let's enter the High Times Cannabis Cup it was like you're high yeah let's enter the High Times campus we can do this yeah and you know he you know crack jokes on me he was like no dude you're crazy he was going to school at the time and I was like listen dude we can do this and he was like all right find out the information let's at least Leslie see what's up you know I somehow got ahold of Rick oosik which was the editor at High Times during that time yeah contacted him phone call phone call phone call and he basic said Nadeem listen cuz I'm like well how much do we bring how many edibles does it how much do we make he's like it's gonna be the biggest cannabis farmers market you've ever been apart harbor's but I was like got it so make as much as I can like anything that I can write and so then we got the booth okay yeah so now I'm like hey yeah we can do this and I was like hey we should enter our products to join win he was like dude you're just pushing the limits and I'm like yeah let's try and do this and so we were making gummies at the time we were making brownies at the time which we don't make um hey you know baked bros 2 2 2 2 different directions either we make baked goods or we're baked right right so we're making cookies brownies gummy cereal bars all that stuff the gummies were really they've always been our niche and we get to there before we leave III said hey let's let's enter the cup and hmm you know he gave me some smack for it and then he said I tell you what and I believe he was joking at the time yeah he said if we win the Cup I'll drop out of school and I'll go full-blown bake oh my god I didn't hear this story yeah he goes I'll commit full-blown bake gross oh my god definitely so I said okay deal and you're the first contest oh yeah oh yeah oh yes and this is 2014 so I'm like okay cool man like I didn't really take it that I could use the help well fast forward we won the cop so our sour kick-ass which are still on the market today they had won the cup they won People's Choice so that means the people voted for our products we didn't even enter that product we entered a medicated baklava yeah yes yes when my mom comes to town I'll have her make some I would absolutely deliver something because it's a 45 year old recipe only the women in my family habit and she just so happened to infuse it oh my word it is fantastic it is fantastic and so we wanted to enter that into the medical cup and we're like yeah let's another medicated baklava it's a unique product like yeah yeah but he's got any didn't even make that make the charts you know yeah so again sour cush kids got voted by the People's Choice so we're at the award ceremony and we're like hoping to hear you know we didn't get it and then the following award was the sour kush kids and we're like taking my surprise yeah so it's like all of a sudden something just set in to us and were like oh [ __ ] like what does this mean I think we just broke through oh so that's what that was the beginning of what really brought us married yeah you know so I came back to Arizona with that under our belt started writing proposal letters of dispensaries got picked up by a dispensary and up north we were working there fast forward a little bit and you know we've been with true med dispensary now for going on about a little over three years yeah now we're in 83 dispensaries and rocking and and to close the loop on on Thomas he did he show me that I was going off to Denver yeah and the day of the cup he had a final so he finished the final okay the final yeah and then he had come out they come out to either finish the final or he had gotten approval from the professor to do the final when he got back and he told his professor like what he was doing and she was totally supportive like which is really cool because I could have gone any way could have gone any way of that happening super cool won the award I looked at him and like you know he said he finished out the semester and now going strong it's been really cool that story's just so incredible and in since then we've now got upward of 40 employees Wow we've got a strong leadership team a strong team marketing team production team packaging team distribution team and let me take a breath because let me say it has been a challenge oh oh while it has been wild yeah building I never thought that building people along with building myself would be something that I was doing ya know leading people and leading people as a group you know like I'm I'm finally finally after five years of actually being baked grows me in a business settling into my role you know which is a CMO which let's talk about labels right yeah we talked about like see chief ma officer it's like no man yeah I don't know like I'm not I don't know it's a it's a it's weird hierarchy it's yeah it's weird goofy it really is it's like it's you have to have this title so yeah you can get certain speaking engagements right it's it's because people see that yeah and then they're like oh oh my goodness you know it's like I should take you're serious I'm just yeah right right like I'm just a person just like you you know what I mean and this is what I happen to be really good at yeah and and want and impassionate about so I want to continue to be good at it and get her and I guess this is the label that I have to take on you know so Thomas and I always joke with each other we're like we're not CEOs weirdoes you know but you know from the outside looking in from other people we are and we have to own it you know it's a part of our ego my ego at least yeah yeah well aren't you play the role something you know says says you know yeah you want that title you want that title and then the other part of me like my soul self is like I agree yeah we care about titles no but it's it's got me to where its it's a part of what's got me to where I am today and and like I said finally settling into the role of who I am and what I'm to do now you know we've if we want to talk about the organization we can and so we brought on a director of business development a year ago right we recruited him well he worked at Apple for a very long time about 10 plus years and he built sales teams that's what he did he built sales teams good fine so an apple is a culture everyone admires I'm going to say we're a lot of people it's obviously absolutes right Amazon Costco Apple you know Nordstrom's like model yeah yeah yeah right these these these cultures that they have and so he really brought that you know for us right in the right time because Thomas and I were maxing out you know it's right we can't be the smartest people at the table anymore I'm not a CMO I don't have these answers yeah yeah you know right and so we needed somebody to to come in not necessarily to teach us how to be a CEO or teach us how to be CMO or CFO or any of that it was just the competencies yes on how to level up right coachup coach up coach out you know and and those competencies are what you know Dell is his name brought to the table for us so um some of the company's been like communicating effectively right what does that mean you hear it yeah right yeah yeah skilled version of communicating effectively look like yeah it is an unskilled version yeah yeah kidding effectively look like right and so in the moment you know he would call it out if we're talking or arguing or which we don't argue anymore we just know we could you know each other's love languages and an apology languages we've got to talk about absolutely absolutely a big component yeah you know and everybody needs everybody has to anybody that comes onto our leadership team they have to do their languages because to prevent arguments yeah to allow to communicate effectively like talking to different languages yes yeah you're talking Italian and I Chinese totally I don't hear you I'm just waiting I really like you I'm just waiting to give myself that's it you know and we need to actively listen to each other you know so having somebody that came onto the team like Dell was able to bring a component of radical candor and just man it hurts when somebody calls you out on your [ __ ] [Music] that component of radical candor and being able to receive that type of me vacuum in the moment you know runs congruently with you know learning these different competencies of just how to be a better person yeah yeah it's and it's not that it levels just our communication up in the business but life yeah like my relationships are better for sure my family relationships are better my friendships are better I mean you sign me up someday someday yeah I look forward to that that's um that's really my goal with one of my goals within the company is to you know be a thought leader and a thought speaker for this information because I know how impactful it's been again for our organization myself yes you you know yeah to be able to communicate here today with you yeah like it is wouldn't it happened before cannabis no way no not not where I was huh and you said you came from from now I'm interviewing right you say no best format you said you were from Kansas City I was there for a couple years okay Kauai I grew up from Detroit area that's right okay got it so Midwest area yeah yeah I grew up in Branson Missouri right yeah Branson Missouri is where I was in Leawood oh cool yeah yeah my babies live in downtown Kansas City buzzer awesome like my family's there right now my parents were there there my stepfather does like he builds businesses we'll just say that and so he's over there building out of business right now yeah and so she's like come on we're at the casino I'm like no get out of the casino what do you do it out man I don't know what's going on right now she's like nobody's here it's great yeah first time the casino didn't have smoke [Laughter] so just having having somebody come onto our team at the right time this is a little over a year ago again call it call it divine if you will you know I will and I was like I had met del from from the cannabis industry he built a dispensary here and then let's just say we recruited him right the best people already have jobs yes most people already have jobs absolutely you know they really do go get them yeah I'm learning this the hard way so you know he was making a transition and we were able to get him onto the team right at the right time and he brought a couple other people from Apple and it was just like did we manifest this happen we're doing submit my resume yeah it is every single day every single day it is his growth yeah it is it is seriously growth and I I don't portray it a lot I don't think on my own my social you know and and it's it's because people only see what you want to be like we only show people what we want to see yeah you know yeah I guess it's figuring out how to put it into a format you know and yeah with that I guess why I'm sharing that is because again someday I hope to teach people this these things you know and and and and it started from a drug yeah yeah started all because of an illegal drug Wow a beautiful plant I know that is our mission to eliminate the negative stigma associated with this beautiful alternative that is so good right which is why I'm super excited to be with you because like you know me I'm just a radical out-of-the-box spiritual girl who loves God and and I really feel like God asked me to break shame off that plan amen you know and the cool thing is is just where we connect because I'm the same way if I got to put on my CEO hat that's where my inner [ __ ] comes out way too much you know okay I gotta be bossy you know but you really a label I'd love to put on you as you are such a prophet and you are so apostolic in activating things in the realm and those are churchy words and we don't typically hear in business but that's the realm where I live right because God didn't call me to the church realm but I see so much healing in what you did I want to backtrack to when you were like in wrestling in that because you can see going from a tough childhood into a sport having such empathy and even awareness and being exposed to this concept of cannabis for pain because of your coach yeah and look but it's but that should be the new normal right that as you chased that it opens that up so tell me like you were not just playing around with wrestling I mean you were at okay I've got notes here but Oklahoma State cuz I didn't know there's like that's when you go when you're like the Olympic level make me blush so so I I went I got a scholarship to a school called to a college in Tulsa Oklahoma called bacon college and that's where I wrestled okay for a year and then I had gone to Oklahoma not Oklahoma State but Norman Oklahoma University and I had spent about a semester there okay I didn't actually go to school there I didn't like you know spend a whole I didn't go to school I ended up dropping out I'm an I'm um call a dropout but me too I spent a semester there and then I had moved to Missouri to to Arizona because I had met my coach and the assistant coach Matt and in Oklahoma and he had Crohn's disease right nobody knew what it was however he would smoke a joint yeah and cannabis helping him is again what led me to come to Arizona and I was fortunate to have my mom living here California was course an option right it's so sad it was so saturated yeah already been legal for I think almost 20 years yeah so there's like I'm just a I'm just a pee going there yeah Arizona's pushing to go legal for the third time that led me so immediately when I came to Arizona though I I got into just the wrestling crowd you know I got a job at Applebee's some lady saw my tears and she was like oh you have cauliflower ear and I was like yeah she's like do you fight cause like no I wrestled and she's like my husband teaches jiu-jitsu and I was like I've never done jiu-jitsu she's like we'll come over he trains out of the house garage and they ended up living a mile away from me and and this man has been a mentor of mine for 10 years now Wow yeah and and his name's Bobby's I love the men you know and we talked a little bit you and I offline about your story a little bit on you know being on 140 milligrams of was an oxy cotton 140 milligrams oxycontin and 90 milligrams prednisone every day yeah and so a very similar story with him his health took a decline so I started training jiu-jitsu and got an MMA in cage fighting and his health started to take a decline and my family had a restaurant we're you know so I was working at the restaurant and that closed just a series of events and we lost connection Bob and I and that's how it just really started taking a bad decline and we reconnected about three years ago he reached out to me I had reached out to him a few times I have this I'm leaning into this more now than ever is like when you think of somebody it's not by coincidence no it's you should reach out to him okay so I would I would unknowingly I would just you know unknowingly of that thought I would just reach out to my came in Miss you hope everything's well you haven't seen you for a long long long long time right and finally I think it got to him and and and he had reached out and he said I'm done like I'm hanging in the coat like I'm done I'm done with these opiates and tell me about this yeah you know tell me about he's familiar with cannabis smoking and stuff but I think he'd just been watching and seeing what we're doing and he came over and Thomas came over and I think Nick came over to is another you know one of our buddies yeah we all talk cannabis you know in three four hours later he ate one of these watermelon slices after 3-4 hours of me explaining the processes he ate the watermelon cuz he's like this is [ __ ] delicious yeah that you should start yeah yeah and you know from there I mean he was on I think 90 milligrams of oxycontin and I think like upward of like 60 milligrams of morphine yeah yeah together yeah and he was doing those you know simultaneously hmm put together and troubles with insurance yeah travels with the doctor is trying to travel yeah he said he said I'm done yeah no yeah and he made the hard switch and this is what breaks my heart though is that the regimen that we were able to provide for him I don't want to say it's impossible to scale it's very difficult to scale yeah because everyone's gonna be a little different everyone's different and yes the amount of milligrams that he needed yes is not affordable in the dispensaries yeah no no I get it yeah I mean we're talking to 300 milligram bottle of our syrup a day yeah a day right you know and yeah you're talking like $1,000 a month absolutely yeah absolutely you know and so I was very fortunate you know in our situation to be able to it got to the point where like we can't do a 300 milligram bottle every single day like this man needs like a hundred milligrams you know periodically stretched out throughout the day right know upwards of 500 milligrams so that's one distillate came into the picture correct distillate hash oil right it's a refined process it's a distal ated process of hash oil right and a whole other conversation yeah yeah because there's so many different hash oils yeah yeah but what that did distillate is it gave us a it gave us a base for accurate dosing karere and so you're taking something that is in a flour form right which may be 10 to 15 milligrams per gram right and you are taking this bulk cannabis flower you are concentrating it you know through using certain solvents that can extract the THC correct other components of it Reds and then you can clean it up there's many different ways of cleaning it up you can filter it you can distill it so distillation again removes primarily all the lipids and strips primarily the the the the profile of cannabis but leaves behind the THC right okay so now you have something that is upward of 900 milligrams per gram yeah okay huge difference is that similar to like I used RSO quite a bit when I was winning yes yeah yeah RSO is a little different yeah that was that's a horror so changed the world changed my life changed a lot of people's worlds yeah so RSO preserves that full spectrum profile of the cannabis plant yeah so distillate you remove a lot of that except for the primary cannabinoids of THC and a couple others right there's like trace you know yeah amounts however that is what gave us the the foundation to be able to help him you know so we would make capsules right you know I would make capsules for him now he makes them himself yeah yeah you know and this is again years ago so now we can make whatever we want we make 50 milligram capsules we make 100 milligram capsules 200 milligrams yeah however I do believe and Derick our former director of education now our creative director has found some information out there that like your receptors can only take so much THC pressure for it's just it's like taking too much vitamin C for sure yeah yeah so there is an optimal yeah right and so he was using this hundred milligrams periodically throughout the day and you know it's he's completely pharmaceutical free now you know I think he's yeah he just came out of surgery so he's had to use you know some steroids and South but that's all right beyond that I mean it is it's changed his life again absolutely and people don't get to hear these stories no you know or they don't understand that this is not side of the road Cheech and Chong right okay I didn't want AXI so now I just want to be high as hell and I'm getting out my medicines and that's it's fascinating too it's fascinating that it heals yes you yes mine and body yeah and body yeah it provides the amount of alleviation that you need yes to feel yeah and you feel how to feel what feeling good feels like right people have forgot what feeling good feels like so then when you have a little taste of it again you're like this is what feels like you know same with food you know yeah let's get what it feels like to feel good eating food you know and it's something especially like right now we're living in what I will call the group single greatest love a trauma to hit globally then that I've ever experienced you have so many people now walking around who've been literally traumatized by kovat and all the other different things and my journey started because of awareness of trauma crazy thing I don't know how many stories you hear about this I had no interesting cannabis like using cannabis when I was in high school was the drug I didn't want you know what I mean I didn't enjoy the munchies I didn't enjoy the cottonmouth I couldn't stand the paranoia why do I want to sit around like a vegetable going hmm and and yet I began to study what happens with the endocannabinoid system and the plasticity of the brain by using the full plan yes to help the brain release trauma to restore plasticity how the endocannabinoid system can you speak into that because I think a lot of people who are hesitant are just like no I don't wanna be high but I was higher on opiates right do you get what I'm saying I was nor out of it well yeah the dissociation that happens in the numbing I believe that's the word right there's a disassociation that yeah and that's what I was I guess trying to say with cannabis is like you you you all of a sudden get to feel what it feels like to feel again yeah right you are not disassociated from your mind and body alright and and and that is a concern of people they're like I don't want to get high well yeah of course a lot of people don't want to get high no and and it's I find it fascinating I would love to hear your your story or experience with the to the patients that we've worked with that require high milligrams more that are winging off or transitioning right they don't often get high yeah and I'm talking they're using high milligram doses yeah I take 50 milligrams I'm speaking cursive yes now I am with which is so wild that I could use super high dose right and now it's five telegrams maybe 1020 in a day or just 120 milligram coming at night and when I have my Remicade I might use some plant or something because of the pain in that but after a day or two I'm iron and so and so that could be associated to the enou cannabinoid system yes right because is a system in place that is its its primary purpose is to help us meet homeostasis right right right so if we're on all kinds of these pharmaceuticals we are way out of whack way right we're requiring high doses and effort transitioning we're requiring high doses of cannabinoids right to fill these holes right yeah homeostasis and then as we begin to heal that lessens right yeah that lessens and so that's that's how we did it with Bob - I mean we titrated him up we titrated him down yeah staggered his dose that's a tie in and that way it wasn't just like 300 milligrams all at once so it was you know every four hours yeah a little to prolong that experience or that that relief that he would get from it and you know we've had success with it's been a roller coaster ride yeah but we've had success with it well and the other thing is people are so used to just okay my doctor said I'm supposed to take my pill at this time mmm that you're not paying attention to what's going on with your pain like first thing I did is broke the percocet that was used for breakthrough pain so instead of a full percocet I took a half a percocet and a little bit of RSO under my tongue and what's fascinating though is I remember when it began to really heal and I had been off all the opiates for about a month or so and I'm now really micro dosing way down because I'm not using as much because my big high dose was to prevent I had no side effects that's also when I wound off everything that's that that's I had to work with that but I felt like I took a limitless pill like a Baba sudden it was like 30 days in and I would be just like whoa I haven't felt that part of my brain since I was two that's not why that was actually a level of clear yeah endocannabinoid system do that like what is so I'm not scientist my body so healed I don't get that anymore I would I would encourage it's because the endo cannabinoid system is meeting homeostasis more optimally right and so that could very well be it and that that feeling or a moment of clarity is against something that you have not had an experience for the however long you know you were on the pharmaceuticals and so now your body is like whoa yeah I see color I taste I see I smell I can't cry and feel and get a relief right it's crazy how much cannabis heals and this is where you know some of my fellow Christians are like oh you're treading on dangerous land but who created it there's a there's a funny opens you there's a funny meme out there that said God created gave us cannabis and then man made it illegal yeah hello yeah and yeah I grew up I grew up with the Muslim father yeah and a Christian mother yeah how's that work yeah well they divorced yeah and I moved to Missouri they from Texas redneckville oh yeah I'd y'all smoking oh my god you bringing it out of me if you've ever seen the movie or the show Ozarks yeah I lived in Ozarks yeah pretty damn accurate you know and so careful who you choose to be friends with you know and and yeah exactly and so my father remained in Texas and he's still there today remarried lots of siblings beautiful wife all that and my mom got remarried as well and however when we moved to Missouri so I was seven we moved in with my uncle which was I don't know if this is a politically correct term but bible-thumper I'm talking I'm talking Baptist alcohol can hand on the table this is how it goes yeah you know and I spent the next three years living with him and it's I put a lot of I put a lot of thought into this and and over the years because it shaped me um it shaped me it traumatized me it scared me it also established a lot of morals mm-hmm and values I'm so grateful for yeah you know I was having this conversation not too long ago I mean it was his house that I learned the proper manners you know yeah just manners are for other people that's what it's for yeah and in structure right I I learned a lot of structure from this from this man and I mean it was church every Sunday every Wednesday sometimes even Saturday's my Bible studies and all that jazz and and I just remember you know I so vividly the the pastor just smacking the the podium like you're gonna go to hell if you do not believe Jesus as the Son of God yeah and that put that put the fear of God in just a little bit so I'm thinking I'm like doesn't lead you to a great relationship yeah just a fear and I'm like wait a minute my dad's Muslim and so I'm bawling my eyes out you know and he took the opportunity to it was my opportunity to be saved you know and right I'm glad that's the reaction I got I didn't know the difference my eyes out and he's like you know read this verse and you know you've been saved by Christ and you get baptized and all the stuff and I didn't know what it meant you know I mean like okay yeah well I mean I went back and forth I went to Texas I went to Missouri because that always was my dad I went overseas many many many times they'd always joke hey what's your religion you know do a half and a half and I'm like well you get it I'm milkshake yes and so it was always kind of a joke in when I got into college I took a world religions class yeah that's when I'd open the door was I started I learned about different religions and yeah I have a very passionate interest about the answer and and learned that Christ is arguably one of the most influential people of our time that what he did he was and there's so much to talk about right Christ Muhammad Krishna Buddha Native American wisdom there's no are all religions are they all against cannabis no whoa devil's lettuce the devil's lettuce right I remember I got my grandma to try a sour cush kid once and she tried it and and and and then the following day she was crying and she was praying to God to ask for forgiveness but but she has no problem taking or xanax every night so I was just like gosh dang it grandma are like oh you know what's something though is that like I want to open up the conversation of self-control mmm because like is it the tequila is it the cannabis is that that this is that the better is it self-control that when our spirits are not governed by all these rules but we operate with that understanding that power that we have to just moderate how do you have self-control if you've if if your surrounding doesn't really encourage it you know like yeah like growing up in Missouri right I mean this is what you did this is how it worked there was no outlier that was like no that's actually not right yeah you know that's not true about cannabis all right that's not true about medicine or religion or whatever there was none of the I think it was from hell right right right I smell a skunk that must be a demon my mom when we would because you know Missouri and she would smell a skunk I never understood yeah yeah she's like oh she likes love that smell like you're weird mom now I totally get it yeah I'll loop back to self control but you would ask is cannabis you know wrong in all religions and so that brings up an interesting interesting points because it's encouraged me to learn about this and so cannabis originated in China okay that's where that's the beginning of time that we that we know of fine they weren't using it to get high now they were using it for medicinal purposes and they would use the roots okay and they would they would boil the roots and they would make tea out of it okay not gonna get high from that but there are vital cannabinoid and you know other other components EBD know so the cannabinoid to my understanding cannabinoids will not be in the root okay of the cannabis plant and it's more vital cannabinoids components right and they would use that they would make topicals out of it they make teas out of it Wow okay so this is we're talking almost three thousand years ago a long time it transitioned into India that's when I started getting a little okay gotcha psychedelic yeah yeah they started using the flower in the plant right and so we were yeah and so we were talking about this yesterday actually so it's really fresh right now that's when cannabis was used for started began to be used for you for purposes and spiritual purposes and India has a festival called Holi festival and during this time they would sell preparation called bong or Bank DHA ng okay and this is a drink it's it's a it's a it's a drink it has different forms like a yogurt form and different forms and they would sell it during this this festival and it had you know you would get high from it right and they're still out there today like if you were to ask if you would be in India and ask them about cannabis they would kind of look at you funny right if you said bong leave it go yeah you know yeah and it's interesting it is and so that's when like the food preparation of cannabis you know came and it transitioned to Middle East which is still so crazy that there's very few plants you can actually bake and put in something and it maintains its structure totally that's just so freakin miraculous that that took yes God to create that yes can't do that with other players plant is an alien plan resistant and from there it made its way into the Middle East and that's when it that's when it started getting really strong yeah you know in a lot well a lot of people will say because of the growing conditions yeah right that influences how the plant grows rain you know altitude and soil and conditions all of that has a big role to play in it but I wanted to close the loop on on do all religion see it as as wrong but some religions or some cultures such as the Indian culture and new culture they they see it as a spiritual practice you know and it can be there there are there are people today who have cannabis ceremonies yeah you know and that is a high dose experience yeah yeah and I've been there you like like yeah unintentionally yeah no oh yeah like when I ate when I had a sucker yeah last week that you I did ask you then oh dear God that's when I was praying I can't god help me come this way what happened right and you can have a borderline out-of-body experience you know I wanted to always being your an out-of-body witnessing what is happening and it's like what is going on it's crazy lemon juice just put lemon juice in water and it was okay that's awesome for my listeners I I didn't intend to get that high I for some reason there's not thinking and I didn't know the suckers were just for licking for medicinal i literally chewed the dang thing in a minute and a half and then in about 20 minutes couldn't feel my lips and was i live by myself was laying over my counter and i got some lemon it's wild though how you can use lemon or you tell me even pepper hmm so there's I'm sure there's a terpene within the lemon juice yeah Dee limonene or or somewhere probably one of those that helps same thing with pepper so beta carry off a lien is another Fein that is a common terpene in cannabis but just smelling it you obviously don't want to you know inhale no no it's kind of smell it a little bit and that can help reduce the nausea right associated to being high right beyond that I mean buckle up so many people like like when I talk about cannabis I've been building business obviously I talk about God openly and I love all people so they thought I went off the deep end and yet I'm gonna make a radical statement if I had to have surgery I'm not against opiates mmm that was never any work well here's the deal I was never addicted I was tolerant my body was tolerant I did not you know thank God because of all different kinds of thing was not psychologically dependent but physiologically now in retrospect we're talking 2004 to 2017 I was on opiates Wow so I find it more demonic what the opiates did to my mind my inability to heal my inability to process when I say cannabis opened me you know I don't know how many stories you've heard on that that's what I wanted to ask you where it was now time to feel and I felt like as it healed and for me it's just physiology at science I didn't get high and then I felt my body was healing and my brain and my heart and my soul could operate together men and I cuts they're driven yes and I could process and some of the feelings were so much that the cannabis actually helped it not get too overwhelming right when you're healing and and that that that healing that being able to feel is really what I think the the root of it is is because these opiates or pharmaceuticals can condole you down and and I want to be clear because you had said you're not against or I'm not against opiates and the proper usage thank God if I have to have surgery you ain't touching me without a so just for the audience listening right now I'm not saying that pharmaceuticals are all bad no work for some it's just that the long-term use yeah and the side effects that can that accompany it are are detrimental to your health like your bad is what I mean like they can hurt you you could use half the dose even after surgery by using your gummies and whatever pain medicine they give you and you'll use that yeah I mean I have friends that have had surgeries and use none yeah absolutely I had all four wisdom teeth pulled out and they gave me a bottle of them and I was like I'm good I got syrup Yeah right I didn't touch it awesome no you know and and have quite a few friends that are like that and them just again being able to feel again is what is the healing come is one of the healing components of what cannabis does right cannabis Jason Silva talks about this a lot and I love it because it couldn't be more true is that canvas has this innate way of moving our mind from the past removing our mind from the future and just allowing us to focus right here and now and some people experience that and and unintentionally and they don't even understand and when you can be here and now you can feel you can process you can rationalize you can think logically you know that's why you know you use cannabis or smoked cannabis eat it whatever and you start wondering how things work ya know right right it didn't it instills one curiosity and you're wondering yes yes yeah yeah it instills wonder back into your life right I think wander is is is maybe something that a lot of people lack now you know because wander could be correlated to perspective yeah you know it's like to be to have a proper communication I have to be able to objectively commute perceive objectively you know like yeah if I disagree with something that's okay yeah yeah you fishing that absolutely right I still need to wonder where your perception is coming from yes right yeah and and try at least to see that at versus being so close-minded to it okay you know and I'm just like no that's not how this is how it works you know and so little tools like cannabis being one of those right we there are there are plant induced modalities or plant modalities there are non plant modalities right meditation right and absolutely competencies and that can again instill wander right and that wander again is what can lead to healing right because I truly truly feel of all the practices I have done I've used cannabis for 15 years okay I've done other plant medicines I've dabbled with psychedelics we're going to talk about that yeah and and and very all are very powerful tools I do not think any single one is the answer not only they are all tools toolbox right if I have a screw I can't hammer it in maybe the proper tool exactly right so good and and so of all of those what I believe they boiled down to is awareness and love so combine those you have love you know right I cannot love you if I'm not aware and I cannot be aware if I do not have love for the other person and so what all of that compiles into is integration right conversation conversation is the integration of all of this work because when we can talk about it when we can rationalize and see each other's perspective that's where a lot of healing can come and yeah yeah we're not I mean I read a statistic recently that married couples I don't know how many people was done but like they talk to their spouse on average 28 minutes a week and I'm like what no that's insane you know right yeah and so it just that one statistic just goes to show how disconnected we are yeah in a time where we are where's my phone more connected than ever yeah right yeah they're so disconnected yeah you know that that human interaction and and again being able to comprehend the communication that's happening that in itself it's it's talk therapy you know that in itself is extremely powerful which leads to cannabis use or psychedelic use because there are if I may open the door on using psychedelics yeah yeah so and we're talking micro dosing Vitamix which is something I mean well let's back up for just one quick sec because one of the things we were talking about is that the number one thing that changed my life as I started sleeping hmm so like I'm 56 today 52 and a half years old and I'm now sleeping through the night okay that's why sometimes I'm like okay was it the sleep and the cannabis healing the endocannabinoid system that actually gives you the awareness to go deeper even in your own life to go into the stuff that might have been scary because like two weeks of I felt like all I wanted to do is sleep for a month initially and then you wake up and you have the exhilaration like you used to when you were a kid when you wake up because you wake up rested yes and then you're open to different things now going in is psychedelics go ahead into that on sleep there's a book called why we sleep by Matthew Walker he's a sleep expert and K is fantastic okay it will dynamically change your priority list for sleep you can add anything you want of mine oh my don't touch my yeah and there's a large there's a large contribution to healing health healing to sleep ya know when we sleep we heal right we have to and so what what's happening when we use cannabis is and there's there's there's some articles out there on this that talk about this we skip the REM State yes okay we skip um rapid eye movement that's where that's largely associated to where we dream right okay right and we skip this rim sleep also during if you have a lot of rim your sleep isn't always the best because people who suffer from PTSD yeah it may fall in that that that ever stay deep right that stage of sleep there's four stages I believe there are awake light rim and deep right and so when when we in like you said we go in cycles those cycles repeat itself three or four times a night light REM deep light REM d you wake up feeling exhausted yes if you don't get enough sleep or if you wake up in the wrong sleep state yeah wrong stage of sleep by skipping rim a lot of people who use cannabis don't dream often and if anybody who has used cannabis for quite a while and then stops using cannabis yeah if there are listeners right now you may be shaking your heads about to know what I'm gonna say you have very vivid dreams very married yes and and they can be bad they can be good I mean I had dreams of riding a motorcycle through the Amazon with Joe Rogan once I was like wow yeah so it's a sign what's up Joe very very vivid very real make you feel exhausted when you wake up you know and so you using cannabis you skip that and you go you go into deep sleep and that's why sometimes we feel a little bit more rested yeah you know however you know Matthews Walker Matthew Walker's book really highlights the importance of all the stages and rim in deep sleep and and and I may have this wrong or backwards but rim is more of a hormonal healing sleep state right our deep sleep is a physical yeah in sleep right yeah you may have that backwards but I believe that's correct and so there's this Acadian the circadian rhythm so there's there's a there's a there's a you have to go through all the cycles right and so that's why people who use cannabis will get really deep rested state and they feel better and yeah and and but we still want to shine light on that on that REM state and so going back to the endocannabinoid system we have endo cannabinoids right and then there are exogenous cannabinoids can I have annoyed czar in many things not just cannabis right food really Whole Foods and so there are two primary endocannabinoids there's two AG and an and amide okay Amanda might Ananda in Greek means bliss so they coined it as the Bliss molecule hmm really really we're alive and so if you've ever been working out yeah I had that runner tires oh yeah yeah that's an animai yeah I'm gonna run for president so working out or like that runner's high or entering flow state Remo with Marshall larger yeah we talked riding even riding even getting into that flow State yeah that's an and amide and that'n and amide you're literally getting high on your own supply so for people listening that have ever experienced that it I've never used cannabis yeah you've experienced the euphoria that comes with cannabis yeah that is it exactly one of the billing is the out-of-body experience but your body was still doing everything listen yeah you know that that runner's high yeah that I know a lot of people can relate to that is a component of what's happening so when when we use cannabis were we're if we aren't sleeping well or there's something in our body that we're just not healing for mind or body we're lacking a certain cannabinoid that's one component of it yeah yeah we're lacking some type of cannabinoids so we either need to change our diet or we can use other modalities like cannabis right that we are now bringing in exogamous cannabinoids right and so when we bring those in or in no cannabinoid systems like yeah and so or energy that laughs yes it doesn't go up and be like oh my god I'm gonna die consistent yeah right you're giving your body what it wants know what it needs you know and and that will then contribute to better sleep as way you know and that's that's a component of it and so from there we'll we were talking about psychedelics but sleep is so so so so important well and you know what's crazy too is they talk about the health of the gut and sleep and you know I battle Crohn's and I'm grateful for Remicade but even using like the gummies and stuff like that from baked grouse I'm excited to use the syrups because you can really titrate down to small amount of milligrams but my last Remicade I didn't even use any inhalation I've had two Remicade since all this cop\u00e1n nonsense and craziness has started but what was amazing is I actually felt better two days in because my number one objective with Remicade which is a lot of people with like chemo and stuff is to sleep mm-hmm I need to sleep for the night you know the doctor says I need you to sleep as much as possible when you feel like crap you're like oh yeah thank you very much for that because I haven't been sleeping for six weeks you know but you use that and you literally can feel your body the only thing I can say pharmaceutical wise is like when you feel horrible you have pneumonia you take an antibiotic and a week or so later also do you feel like quote-unquote yourself again but what that what the cannabis does with the deep sleep and with restoring the in the endocannabinoid system restoring itself right that is self healing right there gosh there are I feel we're gonna have to do another episode to talk about self healing and self-love yeah because there's a lot of healing that comes from that self-love and and and the cannabinoids that you get from products like these right so yeah yeah let's talk about the syrups okay so the syrups I can't wait to try them it's a great product and these are indica so these are indica do they come in both yes they do okay come in indica and sativa these are so there's a green tag on them and they'll tell you so this is granddaddy purple okay this is the unflavored syrup what's unique about the the syrups is that they are they it's a very health conscious product yeah okay we're talking primarily organic brown rice syrup no flea are no colors no artificials at all Wow real fruit extracts you know how in our flavored ones diabetics safe sugar free I mean it's that we made this product for that reason for sure yeah and micro dosing it is is how I encourage people to begin with it yeah if you do not know your dose yes so also on this tag there's a couple dosing I think we do one milliliter five milligrams teaspoon is 25 milligrams per tablespoon is 75 milligrams and they act fast because the first thing I can put it under my tongue correct they act fast and and and and so because of primarily because of the oral administration right so we're not chewing this we're not ingesting it right it is a oral application we have the buccal and mucosal lining of the mouth and the arterial glands of the tongue right help get it into the system much more quicker so in short the bioavailability is superior no no is that the same reason why inhalation works because of going through the mucosal in you know obviously it goes into the lungs I believe I've heard Derek speak about this and and I think that is one of the reasons why cuz right that's why a lot of people use smoking because it's quick yeah five minutes you know and you if you if you don't have enough in your pains bad you can actually just take a little bit more and and we'll help right but then you run the risk of getting like raspy voice and coughing I'm in the gym five six days a week and I can tell when I'm inhaling totally I don't have the resistance as much totally and so that's something that the products like edibles will help mitigate right right and so when you smoke it on sets fast and only lasts about an hour and a half to two hours right you so the the the conversion is different how long does the syrup last so anywhere from four to six hours depends amazes yeah this is because of the conversion so when we eat inedible or let's say the syrup for this for this purpose it it it it the liver converts THC to something to an active metabolite called eleven hydroxy THC right and this is arguably three to four times stronger than THC right so take that into consideration and eating that so yeah and so with the syrup what we always recommend is to use a oral milliliter syringe okay right a lot of people have them you can get at Walgreens yeah yeah I'll give them to you a little baby right one milligram or one milliliter is five milligrams okay gotcha now the psychoactive threshold of THC is two point five milligrams anything below two point five milligrams that's a CBD but likelihood is you're not you're not gonna have a psychoactive effect no so for the people that are concerned about getting high right start low for sure you can take two point five milligrams of this syrup wait I would say 15 to 25 minutes right assess how you feel yeah take another two point five milligrams you know and that's the glory of the restrictions being lifted and us being able to provide products like this for sure right so yeah now we can we can get into micro dosing right not just psychedelics but micro dosing cannabis absolutely you know and yeah and that's how I use it now other than like I go to bed it's just one gummy but if I need it during the day I'm micro dosing that's awesome yeah I think that's absolutely fantastic I feel a true micro dose of THC would be 2.5 to 5 milligrams okay and and and and we're seeing 10 milligrams as the common ground for a single dose of THC across the nation right and I I would I would beckon that that should and will change as it becomes federally legal because in the recreation states were seeing restrictions like yet that edibles cannot be more than 100 milligrams and they have to be able to be dosed in 10 milligram increments right okay all recreational right exactly I've seen five milligrams put somebody over the edge period and I accidentally got a hundred milligram attaboy showed you that I was that I was at getting my order which I do have to tell you guys this bake bros converted me from mostly I mean I'm I haven't even don't use inhalation as much as I use the syrups and the gummies in that but I accidentally I thought I had because no no Kofi do you have to order it online and then you go to the curb and you throw the dude your money and he throws you your bag kidding kind of answer you gotta go up there and then they've got a pre ready and I'm looking in my bag when I got home and I thought it's 100 milligram gummies yeah and how am I supposed to slice right you don't know you're making me nervous looking at it it's still in my bathroom I felt I felt a little bit of the past I mean I'm like okay so how long does this last is it gonna go bad no look well no I mean if I have this at home let's and I thought well at least I can cut it in fours or something how long would a gummy last how long do gummies last for efficacy I guess is the word like is this gonna last for six months so they're gonna start to do rating so we have a year on our product okay products which is amazing plant turns into like totally CBD after a while and so that's one conversion yes THC particularly converts to something called CBN okay I am over time I'm talking a long time yeah I'm talking a long time a long time for it to convert unless it takes a long time for it to convert unless heat is being applied okay so let's let's use the analogy of example of smoking a joint Blount okay we're smoking this joint and we're smoking it and they you know it's getting shorter and shorter right order and then we get to the the last half right the roach right right yeah yeah yeah and let's say we put it out halfway okay we come back to it the next day and we smoke it again well we are just ripped now okay yeah it's like what on earth happened with us yeah this is this is not the same feeling I had yesterday I'm like way more sedated more hi what's happening is that THC because of the heat is converting to CBN and and that is that's acts more of a sedative and it makes you more tired and it makes you more stony and so no wonder I only needed a hit just one little I had to sleep all night there's I'm coughing in my sleep yes yes yeah yeah and to that point though there's there's so much that we're still going to be learning about this plant and there are so many restrictions that we have that prevent us from being able to do control trials right you know or double-blind trials I know like we just can't do it like they can't be done you know I think sue Sisley is doing some of them for cannabis and PTSD but the restrictions are very like it's very limited to what we can do and how we can study this and so a lot of this has been trial and error and people's testimonials and people sharing their stories of yourself that have a large reach like this what we have to do is provide this type of information and so going back to the to the syrups you know being able to microdose it that and it that that is arguably anybody that is new to cannabis is the number one way I would recommend using cannabis is if it's not the syrups if you're in a state where we're not you know I would I would highly encourage using something that is a oral base right and dry yeah it has a test result yeah you know that way you have some type of base that you're starting with yes many milliliters equals this many milligrams right and I need to start with two point five milligrams and assess how I feel yes everybody will feel different to known this when I first started I was like you know well I remember thinking okay I'm really not fond of that not a drug I even wanted in high school and blah blah blah blah and so here I am the other side I'm a grandma you know I haven't I hadn't driven in three years when they put me on the higher doses when I was on lower doses okay but out of respect for myself and everybody else I hadn't wasn't driving and as I weaned I started to drive and nobody you know I studied a lot I had a couple coaching calls with a few people who knew and my advice to people is what happened to me was I didn't realize how much a potentiated the opiates yeah so I was literally high for two weeks three yes and I remember thinking okay I'm supposed to be a social-media influencer and most of my fellows are Christians and I'm upping up my phone going no how do people do this certainly they're not high all the time and I'm wondering if this sometimes this is what people think when I say I use cannabis they just think I'm high all the time I remember saying to somebody when's the last time you met a high on who runs a company works out six days a week and hello I can't even do that when I'm tired let alone what was I totally but the body begins to adapt which is amazing mm-hmm cuz like you can hit your tolerance and I've done that in learning how to use it and weaning but then you just wait a day or so you use lemon waterway today this is not like oh my god now I got a wean for six months to get back to my dose No right how incredible that the body would readjust it like sixty it really sixty out you know hours it's like two three days you're fine totally yeah that that's and you can go back to your small dose again that is that is something that is really unique about all psychedelics yeah right is that we some have some you can build a tolerance you some you don't really build a tolerance who's gonna hit you how right it's you you know and though there's there are so many plant medicines that that we don't even know about III I mean there are so many cacao ayahuasca ibogaine yeah cannabis you know mushrooms my favorite psilocybin you know like there are and I speak of all of those psilocybin well let me start with LSD okay that's not a plant medicine it comes from a it's it's synthetically created in a lab typically as how LSD in the controlled trials but it comes from a fungus called ergot it grows in which your God grows in rye correct kay and Albert Hoffman is one who discovered this brand and it Elysee has more white paper studies than any other medicine yeah any other medicine we have today besides caffeine wait until I open that topic with you we I really want to do another episode because I never and some of my my listeners are like what the hell did you just say but my doctor my gastroenterologist said to me I think you have trauma trapped in your gut and there are proven not spiritual although it will affect you certainly there are medical studies showing hundreds of these he believes that that will be part of you getting me off yes Remicade yes so now I'm pursuing EMDR with an incredible therapist and I'm open to doing a clinical trial on now on doing that my only hesitancy is not that it's mushrooms or you know a micro dosing people understand you're talking a very [Music] naltrexone has been historically used for ms so tell trucks don't gets people off of heroin addiction different things like that is used for a variety of ways to cause people to come off of opiates or whatever eighty milligrams or something like that versus point five right for ms so we're talking a very mystical dose now the crazy thing to me my only hesitancy is Willa s mess up my SSRIs in my gut because my SSRIs are very like when they had me on antidepressants years ago no no I don't I don't like Cracker Jacks and II but the stabilizing is very different than ketamine it's very different than other things used clinically for PTSD to help the parasympathetic nervous system reset yep will you talk to me just a little bit about psychedelics and PTSD and releasing trauma yes so LSD and psilocybin particularly have been studied well a lot of these that all that I've just mentioned have been studied regarding PTSD it's one of the most fascinating topics you know sue Sisley here in Arizona is leading a study for with cannabis and veterans who have PTSD also MDMA so using MDMA treat pts yes you know and there are Institute's out there you Sona which is I think out of Wisconsin where psychologists and psychiatrists are being taught how to do psycho assisted their therapies therapeutics right yeah and this this was happening this was happening in in 1930s to 1960s almost 1970 right 1967 is when all this got shut down yeah by the government absolutely you're getting too well stopped little literally yes yes and so like Johns Hopkins was was leading this and and they're they're the psilocybin psilocybin is the active ingredient in mushrooms okay just as th yeah is the active ingredient in cannabis that's what psilocybin is to mushrooms okay no mushrooms I get violently ill from so I may have yes something different yes rooms and and and I won't get deep into it now but there is a purpose for micro dose and clinically what is labeled as a heroic dose right that is that is what Johns Hopkins will refer to yeah as a heroic dose and and stanislav grof he's a pioneer in this you know he's led over 5000 psycho assisted their therapy yeah you know where they I saw it a New Amsterdam and the TV show Oh incredible like incredible that they were doing it this is and my listeners need understand we're not talking about a bunch of unicorn no in a room pink enough had somewhere you're talking John Hopkins Duke Mayo yeah and so I'll run you through what that process looks like a little bit you using psilocybin or LSD what they will do is they will you'll get very familiar with the therapist right typically 2 8 hour sessions with the therapist right because the two most important factors one of the two most important factors in any psychedelic micro or macro will say is your set and setting yeah so your set being your mind set exactly mindset going into the experience right if you are terrified and just you know neurotic and just likelihood is it's not gonna be good for you and it's not the right time and there's other things we need to work on before this is interesting if so mindset set and then your setting alright I've been in in experiences where I'm at a festival and I've had friends I'm truly speaking friends and I'm not saying this is me because I know better but I have friends who have taken psychedelics LSD and MDMA at music festivals and they just freak out the setting is not conducive for that type oh no components not it got it all you know anxiety and fear and all these things can set in and so set in settings so John Hopkins providing these controlled settings right it's a very it's like living room here you know it's beautiful yeah you know therapy chairs music you trust you know you've built trust with this therapist yeah that you've spoken to and yeah anybody who's been through therapy knows how the process gonna talk and the answer that's it yeah I'm an unbiased point of view hopefully yeah and so you you establish this relationship you establish this trust and then the third component so set setting the third component is intention right very and this is such a fastest T important word because prayer intention they have they have am I in my heart a large correlation to each other means right in prayer prayer I've always felt is you're putting it out right you're speaking to God or speaking to the universe you're speaking to source your yeah your our words have a frequency yes we can measure this we can know that this is science aside you can see words just have in a lab you're not a hippie house exactly exactly I are and I encourage people to listen and learn about this like yeah our words have a frequency and when we put them out there whether it be through conversation like this yeah or it be through prayer and more intention exactly we can alter the energetic space our auras around us it's the it's the conversation that helps build context okay context is what you need because when we are under the influence of these altered states psychedelic and yes if we don't have the context what's happening right it can be terrifying yeah anxiety absolutely yeah but if we have the context to deal with the experience yeah then we can then make sense of what's happening right and so you you patients will relive the experience which can sound very terrifying but it can also help bridge the gap in the parts that were blacked out or missed yeah right and then you speak to the therapist about that and again integration yeah that conversation is where the healing occurs and so in and so maps maps dot-org is is leading the world in psychedelic studies and anybody listening wants to go there you can go to resources and you can there's a link for or a page for all the studies that have occurred yeah all of the stage and you can see psilocybin or al a psilocybin used for addiction right right being able to break people who have smoked for thirty years right right PTSD depression yeah you there's so much out there and so that that is the that's the king of resources right there they're leading the world and in these studies and so that's where I would want to direct anybody who is fascinated by the science of this and you can actually read the the controlled settings that occurred yeah it's and and I mean one session for some from any one session yeah what I'm gonna take their whole life right yeah and so there's a joke like I see a couple of your books over here Titan and and tribe of mentors Tim Ferriss who really is uh who really started my personal development growth today but he talks about an ayahuasca experience that he had yeah and he jokingly but seriously says that had I known that I could go do this 8-hour experience and get fifteen years of therapy dello I would have done that hell you know yeah and that's what happens yeah I heard about it so many times fifteen years of trauma and in therapy in an eight-hour session yeah like what yeah right cuz and that's where dr. Joe Dispenza mm-hmm speaks about what's happened he gets into the science I know is you are a see wiring your brain very much so you wire very much so and it is incredibly fascinating yeah I I'm I am a big proponent I love the science of it me too and me too Thomas takes to do it Thomas is being about yeah yeah yeah I'm I'm more in love and passionate about the metaphysical side of it so yeah yeah chill side of it yeah also understanding yeah there's a scientific side to this yeah so when you have someone like Joe Dispenza who bridges the gap between the metaphysical the spiritual healing yeah things which has occurred for thousands of years shamanistic approaches they were doctors shamans were technically spiritual doctors and then you bring this component of science to it you're like oh that's what's happening it's fascinating they're both happening yeah this manifold side is happening yes but neurologically in your body this is what's happened we're tripartite beings yeah so we're body so spirit you can't rest connect right the trinity yes absolutely it's incredible and and I I love Joe Dispenza because he really metaphysically and in spiritual practices it's often that breath is a big component we it's an autonomic process we just automatically do it we are either right because if you don't you're dead yeah uh-huh and we also breathe on consciously right we shallow breaths right words and when you're on opiates you cannot take deep breaths oh wow cuz it's a massive cough suppressant Wow I that was one of the first parts I had to learn is how to react so Jen ate my lungs Wow yeah and and so when we we connect mind intention mm-hmm with heart yeah yeah hate love yeah with breath life yeah something happens in cross something happens yeah right that these practitioners figured out thousands of years ago yeah and have used for thousands of years yeah however someone like Joe Dispenza has dedicated his life to figuring this out Sam Harris these these individuals yeah I have all their books they have measured it and they have the monitoring it and they are sharing it that hey when you connect mine heart and breath yeah this is what happens yeah right incredible and you have all of a sudden these miracles mmm you know people wouldn't consider them to be miracles like it's incredible yeah it's it's I am one it's really awesome and and I I really do I'm very passionate about it I can tell very an incredible human who would have thought a watermelon dummy could bring cannabis I need him to be in watermelon and then I need him this is where he's gonna grow people sometimes ask me what's your purpose you know and it shifts shifts you know that that's I think I think that's a difficult question for a lot of people and I save quite a bit of time on it yeah and right now my purpose is to be here now right Rama das be here now yeah and because if I can be here now I can serve whatever purpose it is I need to serve right here and right now yeah right and I try and apply that because trying to figure out my life's purpose yeah can get overwhelming you know it's gonna change if I'm too tired if people that were in my life and circumstances or maybe I lose a family member and that purpose is gonna change yeah if my dad is sick then my purpose is to go take care of my dad my purposes right right but my purpose is to just be here now so gonna be a blank sheet like sheet of paper yeah you know and and that's that's the that's the karmic way of looking at it right is just to allow what's happening to happen right and yeah that's always been that's that's always been something that I've battled with people with and not like I don't say battle maybe because I don't argue about it but try and get people to talk about it and understand you know because I have friends and family that are like no like you just rainbows and butterflies you know this and that no and and it's like that's a component of it yeah you know I think it's a skill oh yeah yeah very much you know it's not that what's happening if something bad this Cove is happening right mmm-hmm you could perceive it one way I can perceive it the other mhm the same stuff is happening exactly sucks it does it's my choice to deal with it the way I deal with it yeah you know and and that's that like that's my purpose right now is to be here now I think you also have a purpose of helping people be wide awake yeah thank you very much and I'm just so honored that we've been able to spend this time it feels like it was like 20 minutes and yeah I think oh my gosh and

Liz and oh I just hit nine thousand subscribers thank you guys so much that is so exciting next stop 1 million let's go anyway so I've had a few requests for doing a hard candy I did have one video there that kind of I did as a quick music video but I'm actually going to do one of my tutorials more in depth to give you more information and I'm also going to show you two different recipes so I'm going to show you one that if oh you only have can of butter to do with can of butter and the other one is if you've got texture how you can now make a really good tasting hard candy alright so as always I'm gonna jump right into our ingredients what we need and then get everything together to make some awesome candy ok so one of the most important things when you're doing candy making a hard candy making is humidity humidity is a huge factor if it is too humid in your home don't bother trying it it is summer in it is too humid don't bother trying unless you have a dehumidifier or air conditioner so I made these the other day and it was a little too humid and that's what's gonna happen is they're gonna come out sticky and tacky and they're just gonna melt together so optimal humidity is 35% however about 45 to 50 absolute maximum 50 is but 45-year okay at sugar alright so for our cannabutter hard candies you are going to need 1 cup of white sugar half a cup of corn syrup 1/2 a cup of water and a quarter cup of peanut butter and a half a teaspoon of soy or the other one sunflower lecithin yes you can use the powder if it is granular you may need to strain it but I believe the powder will work as well so that's what you're gonna need for your can of butter ones now if you are a tincture person you can make candy sugar & Canas syrup from your tincture if you don't already have those made up I do have the videos that show you how to make those so you can make up your your can of sugar and your can of syrup so for your tincture for takes your candy sorry gap there and this is the way the reason why I did this is so that you don't have the taste of alcohol this way the the alcohol has been evaporated off and it gives you a really nice tasting candy versus probably most you just use tinctures straightforward always have a contend with that taste of alcohol this is going to help eliminate that problem altogether so what you are going to need is a half a cup of white sugar regular sugar 1/2 a cup of can of sugar yes you can use one kind one cup of can of sugar I just prefer again for taste to do the half and half you're going to use a quarter cup of kanna syrup and a quarter cup of light corn syrup and a half a cup of water and again whatever flavors that you would like to use and colors to make it again this is gonna come out very green so you may not want that color you may want some other color and again the white for the solid background again more I'll go into detail now the nice thing about using this recipe is that you don't have to use an emulsifier like gore gum we're not trying to stick butter in places that has no business being and trying to make it stick so these are all natural ingredients and that's why I find this recipe works so much better all right so the equipment that you are going to need is first a pot a cold pot of water with ice this is for us to stop the cooking process when our candy reaches temperature you're going to need a small or medium heat transfer it pot non heat transfer and sorry heavy bottom is preferred and non heat transfer is there is no dark spots in the bottom of your pot so that means that there is no spots that get hotter than any other spots you have proper proper heat distribution and your candy isn't going to burn in it's not gonna be hotter in one spot but another you will need a spatula your candy thermometer your candy mold yes I know they're red and my dummies I say don't use red molds for hard candies are perfectly fine but not for gummies or if you're making lollipops there's this type of lollipop mold which is a 3d mold or you've got the flat mold that you can get as well so you're gonna have get those prepared and have those standby on hand and I'm gonna use these that's probably another one you're making hard candies you also want to make sure that your molds are small remember you want it to be in your mouth you don't want to be like you want it to to feel good in your mouth not be oversized and that's about all the recommendation I have for your candy molds we will get started first on the can of butter recipe alright so for our can of butter candies you are going to add your one cup of sugar your a half a cup of corn syrup and your half a cup of water you're gonna stir that until it is combined and your sugar started to dissolve and then we're going to turn our heat on to medium high oops sorry I always forget so you're also going to need a cup of hot water with a pastry brush or a paintbrush to clean these sides of the pot down up for many sugar crust that wants our sugar and water there of kamae gonna turn your heat on to medium high and you're just going to continue to stir it until your syrup begins to boil the moment that it begins to boil we're gonna stop stirring and we're going to attach our candy thermometer and cook our syrup to 300 degrees Fahrenheit and again you always just want to make sure that you wash down any sugar crystals that you see for it on the side of the pot the reason for that is so say your candy doesn't crystallize if you leave sugar crystals there it can cause your candy to crystallize now when you're stirring you always want to make sure to go around the edges of your pot the sugar likes to sit in there so you just want to make sure that none of the sugar is sitting or forming on the sitting and crystallizing they're on the bottom of the pot so you can see our or I hope you can see bubbles just starting to form there around the edge so it's starting to boil at this point I am going to stop stirring and I'm just gonna clean off any sugar off the edges then I'm going to attach my candy thermometer and as I said we are gonna cook this to 300 degrees Fahrenheit the moment we hit 300 degrees we're going to dunk it we're gonna dunk the bottom of the pot into our ice water and at first when it starts to boil its gonna be cooking off any impurities in your water and your sugar so it will bubble up like this for a moment but then in a few moments as soon as those cook off it will settle down and the other thing is the ones that starts with the boiling and you've tossed your thermometer just turn your temperature down to about medium now while your syrup is cooking you just want to get your molds all ready and prepared because once our syrup is ready we need to work fairly quickly and then just to let you know so when you attach your candy thermometer it'll go up pretty quickly and then you'll notice that it's gonna sit in around 220 220 - probably for about 10-12 minutes that's while it's mainly cooking the water off after that the temperature will start to increase and it will start to increase fairly rapidly so you don't want to go too far away from the kitchen right after that point so if you do need to take a quick little break and don't forget you've got about probably 10 minutes of safely way right now all right so I am 300 degrees remove your candy thermometer dunk it in your ice cold water to stop the cooking so we just want to wait for it to stop bubbling there a little bit turn off your heat and there we go you don't want to leave it too long cuz your can't it'll start to solidify on the bottom now I'm going to add in the butter now be very very careful because you are working with molten lava you're going to just start to gently just kind of get that there now if it does if your syrup does start to solidify too much on the bottom just put it back on the burner it's still warm enough to melt that and now we are going to get our lecithin and we are going to add in a half a teaspoon a generous 1/2 teaspoon of our lecithin and you're going to drizzle it all over the top of your syrup and butter and then I'm just gonna move this hold on and now you're gonna gently stir until your syrup and butter starts to combine be very very careful as it starts to combine you want to stir it from the center like this so you're pulling your butter and your syrups from the side and this is going to help to emulsify them and emulsifying is bringing them together bringing your water and your oil together as one one solution is one syrup so my syrup seems to be crystallizing it a little bit here so I'm gonna add in a quarter teaspoon of citric acid all right so once your syrup is all mixed its gonna lighten up like this and it's gonna go solid now you can add in your coloring and your flavoring so I'm gonna do this one tutti-frutti first oops I added a little too much sorry normally I'd in a capful I don't know why I just went all freestyle there and I'm going to add in the white and the white is going to help to give a solid background to him for our color and I'm going to do this one pink all right so I was having a little trouble there for a little bit there I thought this was actually gonna be a flop because my emulsifier might lecithin wasn't coming together fully with my syrup but I persevered and kept stirring and and it did come together that graininess is now gone that I was having there and now getting a nice smooth candy syrup so sometimes you might think it's a fail but keep going that's usually what's the failure probably close to way it will be failing is that it's just not am also fine correctly just not coming together so you just gotta beat it a little bit better I have just added a little more color here and now my syrups getting a little bit thick here as you can see it a little bit thick to work with so I'm just gonna turn my heat on to low just to help melt to keep it melted so I'm just gonna get this color mixed in and just get that melted I said just gonna heat it up a little bit so it's a little more melty melted and I will get this poured into our molds all right so with the butter and the lecithin your syrup is a little is a little thicker then if you were using the other when using the other method so now I'm just gonna pour it into my mold as best as I can it's a little hard off that happens just scoop it off you can clean that up later okay so this syrup I'm sorry is a little too thick to try and put into the sucker mold so I'll actually show you the sucker molds with the other one I'm just gonna fill the regular candy mold with these don't worry too much about it the Mesolithic drips on the side you can easily break those off and clean up your candy afterwards so yeah it's a bit messy sometimes the other syrup you'll see works so much nicer now if you do overflow on those just get a straight edge so straight an offset spatula or a straight edge knife and you can just scrape it off the top like so I just scrape it on my table and clean it up afterwards so that's it for our butter candies now we're gonna let this B's sit I'm gonna finish filling up the molds I'm gonna let them sit until they are completely cooled which it takes about an hour or so ready so for our texture version you're gonna have already have had pre-made up your canna sugar in your can of syrup and so for this recipe or rework what we are going to use the half a cup of Canada sugar 1/2 a cup of regular sugar the quarter cup of can up syrup and our quarter cup of light corn syrup and our half a cup of water our citric acid does not go in until we are done cooking if you put your citric acid in now beforehand you will actually make your syrup too hot and it will burn so just going to combine all our ingredients and then once they're combined I'm going to turn our heat on to medium high until our syrup begins to boil and also make sure to go all the way around the edges of your pot to make sure to get all that hiding sugar now you're gonna find the difference if you tried between the two recipes this one is so much easier to work with so I turn my heat onto there medium-high I'm going to continue stirring until our syrup begins to boil and I am going to wash down the any of the sugar crystals here that a-port got onto the side of the pot now that your syrup has started boiling you're gonna stop stirring you're gonna touch your candy thermometer and I also recommend to get the fan going just because you are cooking even though you're using the dehydrated sugar in the hut there could still be some alcohol left over and that can cause you just want to have it ventilated now if your syrup starts to bubble up this too high and you're getting a little worried there just pick it up off the heat turn your heat down to medium and place it back down and you are going to let this cook now until your syrup hits 300 degrees the only thing that you're gonna do here like I said you're not going to stir anymore only thing you'll do is if you see any sugar crystals or anything formed on the sides just clean that up and as your syrup gets close to temperature don't forget to grab your pot of ice water all right so I'm almost a temperature I've got my pot of ice water ready let's stop hitting the camera and 300 remove your candy thermometer carefully put it in your sink and then drop your pot bottom into the ice water until it the bubbles start coming down and also turn off your heat okay so I'm starting fires here all right so we've got our syrup here and now I'm going to add in our flavoring so I'm gonna do a peach mango tropical punch thingy here so I'm going to do a half a cup a half a capful of each flavor sorry a capful I lied sorry the jiggling of the camera it's a little hard to work off now in some candy hard candy recipes they'll tell you to put that the your flavoring in right away you don't want to do that I can see how that's vaping up there that's your flavor actually burning off so when you see that huge vape of smoke that's all your flavor burning off okay so those are my flavors it's gonna get them stirred in there a little bit now for the color now if I just have if I'm just gonna add in yellow I'm gonna show you what that will look like rocks I'm gonna use peach and you can use the liquid gel or the gel these gels the Wilton gels either one doesn't matter okay not quite that much so I don't use the white and I just use the peach on its own you have a translucent color but it's not very pretty you don't put some on the paper here so you can see it's not the prettiest of colors horrible but if you add the white in it gives you a solid background and it makes your the color the primary color that you want standout is the actual color and so you can see also this syrup was a lot easier to work with stays much thinner and the same thing though if it starts to solidify a little bit on the bottom there just put it onto your burner it's still warm enough it's still warming up and it'll just get that all melted in so I'm just going to finish stirring that up there and I'm going to get the get this ready to pour into the molds so once your syrup is all nicely one color one uniform texture we can get ready to pour it into the mold see that works a lot better and if you're doing these lollipop molds you want to bring them up right to the right to their edges if you don't then when you put them together you'll find that you'll end up with gaps oops not that much then to put small together just flip her over make sure that you do it on the right side put it together and squish her down and then you're just gonna make sure that it's all well pushed down and some firm I'm gonna fill up our little our little molds here and that's it you're just gonna get these filled up and let them harden up and then we'll get them out of the molds yes he's so much easier to work with alright now that our candies are cooled we can take them out of the malls so our first one with our butter the ones that were kind of messy and yucky and trying to get them into the mold just work them out and then with a pair of kitchen scissors you can always just cut around the excess and it'll just come off and then you can just save that you can also put it all any excess you could also put it back into a pot melt it down if do it in a double boiler and or just put it over low heat but be very careful and you can remount it and then recast him again now what I would probably recommend is with the butter one as I said you saw kind of how difficult it was getting in the molds is to just lay it out onto a pan and score it make score lines in it so they can break it easily you can kind of see have a look at that I did it in the cough drop video and then and then here were my the cans syrup and the can of sugar ones the same think there's any extra edges and these two edges you can just easily just snip them off they come off really easily now let's have a look at our suckers so far so good there's still a little bit warm same thing though just cut off any excess around the edges like so and also top them off there you have it two different versions of hard candies and lollipops so odds obvious if you have it as always not as obvious I apologize as always if you have any questions at all don't hesitate to put them in the comments then I will be back to say goodbye in just a moment oh sorry one thing I forgot to tell you if your place is your good through the humidity's good oops you can just store your candies and just put them into a glass jar or into a candy dish good to go if there is any humidity or you find that they're sticky at all you can toss them in powdered sugar or icing sugar and again store them in a glass jar or airtight container the icing sugar will help them from sticking together so I hope that helps you out so guys that was my tutorial on lollipops and hard candies I hope you enjoyed that and as I said before if you do have any questions at all please don't hesitate to put them in the comments and thank you guys so much to help for helping me get to the nine thousand mark well it's Riley a little bit over now yay and and again to lots more recipes to come I do keep a list of these suggestions that you make

this superhuman supreme they have a super human pre-workout so this is their higher stem um when i when i started learning about these pre-workouts tj fitness deal news told me he's like this one he gave me a list of three pre-workouts superhuman supreme hyper max and freaking pre-phase ko told me were must-haves so i got all three of them so this one let's talk about the freaking facts you know why i freaking like alpha lion they don't freaking put feelings on the freaking bottle you can't freaking print feelings you put facts on the bottle this isn't freaking fox news msnbc cnn or whatever the heck you're watching at home straight up fitness talk with garage jim homie and here we talk freaking facts let's get down to business one scoop 17 grams put that boy on the scale so you get servings per container 21. that's an interesting number i think that's uh an alpha lion thing 21 servings so whatever if this product is as quality as uh you know it's hyped up to me i'm going to talk about if it is or isn't then 21 servings is fine with me i'm not nitpicky about it because i'm not going to use it that often anyway when something's so freaking good i can't overuse it so this is going to last me you know if i use this once a week at the most about if i'm not a supplement reviewer and i only have a few pre-workouts i'm i'm not using this more than really once a week if this is their higher stem whatever i'm not going to use this daily so you know you got some nia and i don't i like that they don't do the freaking one scoop two scoop they freaking got right down to business you take one scoop 17 grams end of freaking story here we go niacin 12.5 milligrams vitamin b12 sodium whatever so then you got your super human energy and focus matrix so you got freaking caffeine anhydrous 300 milligrams that's a freaking solid amount then you've got the juniper berry extract 200 milligram some people say it's a bs some people say it's a good stem that pairs well with the caffeine um gives you a good mood elevation adds to the energy i know redcon1 uses it like their total war and whatever then you've got the orionis extract 200 milligrams that's the end dimethyl

like a freaking mathematician oh my god um so then that die caffeine malate they use the trademark in finergy that's the uh it's a slower release caffeine so after the workout it's going to hold you through the workout after the workout you're going to still feel like you're on freaking legend status hopefully n methyl triamine hci 75 milligrams don't really know what the heck that does but it's part of their energy and focus matrix i'm not freaking bill nye the science guy get over it here to talk about practical experience end of story all right then you got the superhuman pump and

in my head that i don't like it uh really it probably doesn't do anything negative maybe it even helps um so i don't really know then you got the absorption matrix so they give you estrogen and bioprinting so 17 grams loaded scoop they're not clowning around here uh and they give us the dosage of everything so we like that and they got a bunch of trademark names which you know obviously don't mean anything but let's talk about the experience well i have about a third left to this boy is this thing good is this worth the hype yes it's freaking worth the hype this thing is freaking

tasting everything about this is freaking perfect um the citrulline i don't know whatever they did with their pump thing usually when i just have citrulline it's not as good as when it's like citrulline or freaking arginine or citrulline and i i really react really well to glycerol the pumps with just the citrulline on this are freaking amazing i have incredible pumps i have a feeling

Jill Carnahan [Music] good morning everyone I'm so glad to have you here listening on our complex clinical study review so let's jump in so we're going to cover irritable bowel syndrome and it's connection to immunity we're also going to talk about the connection between IBS and SIBO or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth later I'm going to present some clinical case studies and examples of how you might see your patients in their testing and how to interpret that and I also want to review causes of fungal overgrowth and treatment so our first this introduction case study is a 27 year old female she came in with fatigue and severe bloating after meals frequent diarrhea and eczema in her childhood she was treated for many ear infections and had a strep throat treat treated with antibiotics for up to 10 times in one year that just makes us think about either dysbiosis or fungal dysbiosis because of the frequent antibiotics in the childhood we know that more than one course of antibiotics affects and alters the microbiome and the diversity for the rest of a patient's life and I was a joke because I don't know of any patients that have had less than one course of antibiotics in their lifetime she has many environmental allergies and frequent migraines and she was diagnosed two years ago with Hashimoto's thyroiditis before she saw me she went on an autoimmune Paleo diet which is grain free Lego and free gluten free dairy free sugar free and she lost about 40 pounds so this would be an example of the test that we saw with her this is what we're going to be looking at today is the hydrogen and methane breath test I prefer this three-hour test this happens to be a two hour test which does give us good information the three hour just tends to go further into the small bowel all the way to the OEO sequal valve and possibly beyond so we can see a little bit further in some of these cases of SIBO in fact most of them tend to exist in the lower part of the small bowel in this case you can see hydrogen levels methane levels the combination and basically in order to get a good test you want the hydrogen to start out at baseline at zero and then if it is positive it's going to go up over time your prep is probably inadequate or or done wrong if it starts with a hydrogen hi that is not an adequate test and you probably have to have the patient redo it so basically there is methane gas and it is at the bottom there and it levels are in the area of negative 2 3 9 and all the way up to a 13 at a 90 minutes and the levels here you can see our positive are both hydrogen and methane and the methane is greater than 5 which is our criteria the hydrogen is greater than 20 which was our criteria so this patient would be positive for both methane and hydrogen SIBO and you can see here one of the other tests is organic acids organic acids show of markers of both bacterial and fungal dysbiosis and in this case this patient has both which is why I mentioned it in your objectives both bacterial and fungal dysbiosis because the markers are very high on both of them this is important because if you're just doing breath testing and you miss fungal dysbiosis and you try to treat with antibiotics you're going to get a bad result because the antibiotics will flare the fungal dysbiosis so one of the things I always do when treating if I check stool I check are Ganic acids and I sometimes check breath tests because I want to know does this patient have bacterial or fungal dysbiosis or both and it's quite common to have C Bo and C fo which is the fungal overgrowth of the small bowel together so there's lots and lots of papers on IBS and what's the root cause and this is a differential in a table in our recent article on some of the different causes of abdominal pain gas bloating and distension and it can range from gastroparesis to functional dyspepsia to lactose fructose intolerance to celiac disease etc but many of these things overlap with SIBO and I've seen cases I'll show you a study in a few slides where a celiac patient takes out gluten they start to feel better but they're not all the way better and the underlying factor that hasn't been treated is either SIBO or C fo so this is a really important piece of the puzzle in many of these cases and I would say a very large percentage is been quoted anywhere from 60 to 80 percent of patients with IBS actually have SIBO so what is Zeebo Siebel is a normally large number of bacteria present in the small intestine so this is important to understand because number one it's not pathogens it's not parasites or bad players like FAL Manila this is normal bacteria can be lactobacillus and taro back dr. streptococcus present in large numbers in the wrong location so I say it's like they're having a party in the wrong location they're proliferating they're producing garbage and that garbage can overwhelm the villi and the ability to increase digestion absorption of micronutrients and many other things so this is not necessarily pathogens it's just bacteria that is excessive in the wrong location common signs and symptoms include abdominal pain gas bloating diarrhea sometimes belching sometimes people have abnormally a bad breath because the hydrogen sulfide tends to produce a rotten egg smell and the methane gases are typical someone with a very bad gas problem and the smell is pretty distinct anemia b12 deficiency malnutrition bile acid issues steatorrhea or fatty stools fat malabsorption weight loss brain brain fog and systemic inflammation can all result a seat from SIBO or CFL and commonly we may see micronutrient deficiencies such as b12 and the fat valuable fat soluble vitamins especially vitamins ka D and E other factors contributing the SIBO there are things that upstream and downstream help protect us from this bacterial overgrowth and if these things are not working this is one reason why patients get SIBO and continue to get it even after we treat so as a good clinician one of the things we want to do is say why did this happen and make sure we're treating the root causes because if we don't it'll just come back so hypochloride REO or low gastric acid secretion is a problem they may need to have replacement of betaine HCl intestinal motility a lot of times autonomic dysfunction from tick-borne infections or diabetes or other things affecting the autonomic motility will cause SIBO and make it very persistent if someone has had surgery or colectomy with no ileocecal valve they're going to be prone to lifelong SIBO immune globulin tissues so selective IgA deficiency or low IgA would be a risk factor for SIBO and then if someone has poor pancreatic function or poor billiot bile acid secretion they're going to also have trouble with SIBO one of the best tricks I learned while I was at a biological medicine Center in Switzerland is the importance of bitters bitters are herbs that you can take with meals to increase bile acid secretion bile acids will sterilize a small bowel and a really important factor in preventing SIBO it's usually complex so you really want to look at these things and actually address them as you treat the SIBO so that you get a good result again these are some of the same things again just a study talking about how herbal therapy was effective in SIBO and this table shows some of the protective factors like we mentioned so normal gastric acid secretion normal pancreatic enzyme normal bile acid secretion and someone has motility issues the migrating motor complex so this is actually very important the MMSE someone can actually have constipation or diarrhea and have an altered migrating motor complex that is differently functioning what that means is migrating motor complex is the small bowel motility system it is separate from colonic motility so again someone could have impaired migrating motor complex and actually still have diarrhea and what that means is their small bowel is sluggish this is like I always equate it to a Zamboni on the ice rink between the hockey games or at intermission where the ice is cleared off after they play and it just makes a nice clear surface and takes away all the debris our own small bowel has a Zamboni and it's called the migrating motor complex so this clears out the small bowel between meals and at the end of the day when we sleep so one of the things important to patients when you're treating small intestinal bacterial overgrowth is to actually make them have time 4 to 5 hours between meals and at least 2 hours before bedtime where they are not eating and they have time for that migrating motor complex to work because if you're eating the migrating motor complex is still it won't be working so having the time between meals can be pretty important and if someone has either biofilms or issues with secretory IgA these are other risk factors things that can help secretory IgA our Saccharomyces boulardii and bovine immune globulin Zoar colostrum this can all be very helpful so what causes a SIBO well I mentioned in the beginning an autoimmune process and this is called post infectious IBS what can happen is after an infection like Salmonella or Shigella there is a autoimmune reaction that attacks anti vinculum and the vinculum can affect the migrating motor complex and kind of caused a paralysis so it's very common to have a patient say you know every time I went ever since I went to Costa Rica or Hawaii and got sick I've never been the same and this is typically that post infectious IBS that causes a episode of SIBO a claw Hydra we've mentioned all these other things we've talked about Crohn's and celiac short-haul syndrome after surgery and there's a connection of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and SIBO because when you have this bacterial overload that crosses over into the bloodstream it goes directly to the liver and can cause liver damage so one thing I mentioned earlier is if you have a CF patient that went gluten-free felt better but is not all the way better or unresponsive they frequently have small intestinal bacterial overgrowth or lactose intolerance important to test these patients so they said in patients with celiac disease partially responsive or unresponsive to a gluten-free diet SIBO and lactose intolerance should be suspected type 1 diabetes so type 1 and type 2 affects autonomic motility so it's really important to check your diabetics for SIBO and see fo because frequently that autonomic distillate II will make them prone to stasis and migrating motor complex dysfunction and thus the bacterial overgrowth the conclusion here is the patience with autonomic neuropathy have a significantly higher prevalence of SIBO and then history of proton pump inhibitor is very commonly associated with SIBO so if someone has had long-term use of proton pump inhibitors that's probably an issue and you want to be sure and test them for SIBO so this conclusion in this study if fed dysmotility and proton pump were independent risk factors for both feeble and seijo and were present in over 50% of the subjects with unexplained GI symptoms so very very important with your patients that come in with symptoms they can't be explained some of the questions that I ask are you get bloated after meals of course do you have trouble with cruciferous like broccoli cauliflower apples things that are higher Padma and I'll show you that in a little bit in a slide presentation those are things that might help you conclude that you need to do further testing and then rosacea who knew but there's a connection with rosacea and SIBO and rosacea patients have a significantly higher SIBO prevalence and control and in this case eradication of SIBO reduced lesions and actually put many of them into remission so your rosacea patients think Phaedo restless legs I mentioned this earlier restless legs often predisposed to SIBO and you can treat the rest of life if you treat the Sedo so very frequently if you treat the rest of SIBO the restless leg will improve and these are the organisms we tend to see so agenda to remind you these are not like awful pathogenic organisms they're actually normal residents it's just they're in the wrong location and a whole wide and Cheryl caucus and Klebsiella was the most common isolated organisms in patients with SIBO so again same information but don't forget the fungal stuff can coexist and the ways to test this would be the organic acids and you can do antibodies in the blood like candy that IgA IgG and IgM and that will also help you determine if there's a fungal issue frontal issues can be tricky because they don't always present on the stool if they're in a small bowel so and there's no breath test for fungal dysbiosis another big problem is at home that comes from endotoxemia so lipopolysaccharides are the coding of bacteria and they can cross over in the tight junctions of the small bowel and into the bloodstream where they overload the liver iops induce endotoxemia has been associated with things like cardiovascular disease metabolic syndrome obesity and even mood disorders and sleep disorders this is a big deal when these bacterial proteins are crossing over and triggering immune inflammation and that's where and they're overloading the liver so we often see fatty liver disease and obesity because of this bacterial LPS effect on body and viola is super important here because if you're not producing bile acids you're going to have more predisposition to zero and again just correlating metabolic syndrome with the prevalence of changes in the microbiota so part of this epidemic of obesity and diabetes and cardiovascular disease is directly related to the LPS induced endotoxemia which can be associated with Dido so we talked about these before I'm going to go right through it but this is like we talked about cause there's a few awful conditions that are associated with so a few of the new ones you might notice our bariatric surgery advanced age and cirrhosis so let's talk just briefly about hypo for hydrate because it's important to understand this in treatment you can empirically test with a betaine HCl over the counter supplement and you can get a Heidelberg test which is a stomach acid test from the gastroenterologist but that's less commonly done you may see low serum zinc you may see at the opinion you may see low serum ferritin or b12 deficiency because all of those require the team and often in celiac or gluten sensitivity patients will have decreased production of hydrochloric acid this is a common sign you might see on the fingernails those little white spots in the ridges can be a sign of hypo chloride RIA because of the ink malabsorption and again comments and symptoms this will be bloating or belching right after meal within 30 minutes like as they're sitting down to the table they may have weak peeling or crack to your nose acne or rosacea they may have under just the food in the stool or have more trouble with protein they may have Ironwood b12 deficiency chronic intestinal infections and multiple food allergies and things that predispose are being a vegetarian will often decrease production of stomach acid serum the vegetarian is trying to eat meat again they probably will need some help with the stomach acid as we age about 30% of the population loses ability to produce stomach acid so this is very common as well treatment is p\u00e9tain a deal with or without pepsin and you take a capita meal and you habitation ramp that up until they feel either warmth or burning and then back it down so for example if they take six capita meal and they so a little bit of warmth and burning in the stomach that's one too many and their dose is going to be about five and they can actually dose that out I always warn them you should not have any intense burning and if you have trouble with one pill you don't need it so let's talk about diagnosis of SIBO and then we'll jump into a few cases the gold standard is an upper GI aspirin and a lot of times when the docs are doing an endoscopy they will take that in check but for most of us in clinical practice the breast test is actually quite a bit easier so we do now a three-hour lecture most breath tests for those hydrogen and methane it's important to use a company like you know visit does both hydrogen and methane and then we test the levels now these ones have changed over the years a little the twenty greater than twenty four hydrogen is absolutely on board methane now I'm treating above five and some of the indicators say that we should go a little bit higher with a methane so three was an older number now I usually go up to five and again you can depend on the symptoms as far as when you treat it because three to nine is moderate greater than ten is very positive so the methane depends a little now you may or may not notice that hydrogen typically causes diarrhea and methane to believe I was constipation so just by asking them their symptoms you may notice that if they're constipation predominant it may be more likely to have methane so that's just a little hint organic acids and stool are not diagnostic recibo so if you're just doing a stool test or an organic acid test those are great valuable information but they will not tell you about Seto so really the only way to diagnose people is through the breath breakfast or if you have a GI aspirin and again you may see on serum labs some commonly associated vitamin deficiencies to clue you in there there's an issue so again this is just like the one we saw earlier in this case you can see the hydrogen which goes well above twenty even just about twenty minutes and typically the hydrogen should start low if they did the prep of the test right and then wise if it's positive if you have someone who starts at 100 or 80 or something crazy at the first breath they've not done the test right you will only need that low in the very beginning the first test and then for it to go up in order for it to be a valid positive for methane that typically hangs kind of down below and you may have a methane start high that is different from the hydrogen so you may have a line that starts at 60 or 40 and goes high the whole way across from methane that would be appropriate and obviously positive here you can see the hydrogen is clearly positive and the methane is borderline so let's talk about treatment first thing you want to do is a talk diet with a patient five minutes are all over those apps now you can find some some of the major medical systems and you can have the patient download an app or give them a handout and typically what I have them do is after treatment of SIBO they'll stay on the low fodmap diet for four to six months that just helps keep them in remission and then they can start to add back some of these foods and see if they're tolerated these are a list some most of the popular diets include dairy products or include certain vegetables certain grains legumes sweeteners etc so these are the things and again you can look these up online and give them to a patient apples pears can be high broccoli cabbage cauliflower tends to be high those are things garlic and onion so sometimes there's a vaccine and there's a history a patient's don't tolerate garlic onion broccoli and apples they probably have zero again these are diet that you can find online whose when taken on a free website that you can download and it will give the patient suitable food and since not to eat so again you can pick one out and hand it out to your patients or you can have them download the app and then I would have them follow that for four to six months after treatment my favorite one free some Alison C Becker is SIBO infocom this is an actual combination of both SIBO and SCD diet SC d is a whole nother lecture but it's specific carbohydrate diet and they lean got shown on this diet for Crohn's and Colitis years ago before she knew about Zeebo and it tends to do with even more restrictive than just a SIBO diet but I find it works really well for my tuffnut patients so this is kind of my go-to diet handout and again you can download it for free so just mentioning specific carbohydrate diet she has just put together a great book and a lot of data for patients with Crohn's and Colitis which is another lot of patients with Crohn's and Colitis have underlined SIBO so again it's a little bit more restrictive than the size of chemo diet but I find the SPD diet is a really great diet for vets where they're inflamed or in the middle of a cones of colitis flare which is again not the topic of this lecture as we're talking about but even Siebel responds well to an STD guidance now elements of I don't want to mention because in the literature this is one of the best treatments for SIBO so we're talking a few minutes about the actual treatment guidelines for steve-o but if you have trouble you've treated people multiple times they're not getting better the elemental diet is kind of the gold standard it is a prescription diet either studied formulas even X which is available by prescription or there's now a physician element so that available over-the-counter to to those of us who are practitioners either one of these is basically the patient eat eat that exclusively for two to four weeks that's all they eat now they need to get enough calories so you can have your nutritionist escalate things caloric mean they may need to do six to twelve shakes a day to get their course need but by basically starving out to the bacteria this resolves sasebo so these are elemental diets with just pure amino acids free fatty acids and sugars and so there's nothing for the bacteria to feed on and they starve so very very successful eighty to eighty-five percent success rate in an in a fortune big course so it's expensive and hard to follow but if you have trouble with your resistant patients this is incredibly effective so let's talk about treat treatment the typical go-to which is now FDA approved for idfc which is also known as Kibo is the fact women typically reflection in dose fiving or 50 milligrams tid for 14 days that will treat very well for hydrogen and you can typically think about every 20 to 30 points of hydrogen that are positive you're going to get a 14-day course to resolve that so for example for hydrogen goes up to 60 you may need more like 30 days to treat that number you will add metronidazole or neomycin if there's methane so you want with maximum plus metronidazole or neomycin if there's methane because Rebecca man alone will not treat the hydrogen positive SIBO doses for metronidazole neomycin or 500 B ID again for 14 days and then as we said you're looking upstream to try to find the things that are causing problems in the Lotus naltrexone Lotus Ariza mice and Canadian reservoir Bureau gas and ginger these are all helpful agents for genetically moving the migrating motor complex along so I've used all of those and if something doesn't work you could try a different one typically I'll treat first four to six months just like the diet after treating so that they stay in remission conceive of herbal treatments you can use instead of medication these are especially helpful if the patient also has SIBO because I'm sorry steveo quest evoke so if there's fungal and bacterial overgrowth instead of using medications I'll often use herbs because they will treat both you can use berberine oregano garlic meme you can use combination treatments there's many many options out there and typically I would do six to eight weeks versus just the 14-day now if you're having trouble you may add biofilm disruptors commonly in the literature garlic NAC and EDTA are great biofilm disruptors probiotics are controversial because asana lactate producing bacteria will make things worse so my go-to is usually for probiotics and then I will also consider adding the other regular probiotic reflective assistive actor after the treatment but not before other things important will be spacing time between meals so that you allow the migrating motor complex to work so four or five hours between meals and no eating two hours before bedtime and among patients at IBS without concentration reflects Minh forty weeks of significant reduction in symptoms so this is really great and again IBS in this case is another name for SIBO now if X 1-plus Guardium now you probably heard me say you instigate the diet for a low-fat diet after treatment and the reason for that is there's some study as in this one that shows that adding a probe probiotic fiber like Garzon will actually increase eradication so the numbers there was a vaccine alone sixty one percent effectiveness rev excellent post gargle eighty seven and the theory here is that you're actually feeding the bacteria so that they're more active so that they respond better to the antibiotic having said that what I typically do is I don't have patients these super strict on their diet and go after treatment because I don't want them to starve the bacteria put them into an inactive state I saw like the antibiotic is probably more effective so you can add the Gargan if you want to your treatment it is more effective the patients may have more gas and bloating so that's the caveat all right let's go on to a couple case studies and then we will open for questions this is a study of a 22 year old female alternating constipation and diarrhea for about a year she had a parasitic infection about a year ago after spending the college semester abroad and go to protozoa currently still testing negative for parasite and she did have a b12 deficiency so as you can see here she definitely has some significant bacterial dysbiosis she also has a few fungal dysbiosis markers as well and those are in the obviously much tougher left side of the page under malabsorption you see a PAA that's very high and that can indicate of pancreatic insufficiency so we want to check for that and definitely some markers on the vitamin range and the B vitamins that are off which could also indicate malabsorption this was her test so and again and she had the alternating constipation and diarrhea so we expect to maybe see a little bit of both and we do we see a hydrogen that's clearly very very high it goes as high as 120 at 115 minutes but the kind of average change is 62 on the test here so either way it's clearly positive and methane comes to get high in the lower part of the small bowel so they're really both positive so let's go back for her what we would probably want to do is treat with either herbs because she does have some fungal markers or we could do with maximum question you know Meissen or reflection and West Metro medical she did have a history of the parasite it sounds like it's negative and treated but if I did suspect someone also head of protozoa I would choose rifaximin question Metra as well because metronidazole would also cover any protozoa if I give the medication course I would probably put her on nystatin for the yeast issues so this 55 year old female significantly bloating and constipation for several years she has a history of hyperthyroid injured and she gave her the counter and acids and laxatives so interesting because a couple things here important hypothyroid will contribute to SIBO because often you have poor motility or you have decreased body temperature both of which are risk factors in the GERD for which is taking antacids that might be contributing to lower stomach acid or it might be a root cause of hyper chlorhydris and that would also contribute the SIBO okay so this 55 your female misses her test and she had predominant constipation so you see it's kind of flipped here you see that the methane in the black is very very high and the hydrogen is actually quite low so a couple interesting things first of all she is a clearly positive methane sea though and I will tell you up front these are harder to treat so just they are they're more resistant they most often come back and they're more likely to have constipation the second thing is with this highest levels you're probably need a little bit longer course and then say two weeks I probably treat her for at least four weeks maybe longer and then the last thing is some as a methane can hide the hydrogen so you treat the methane and you retest and then you find that there's hydrogen that's high so don't be surprised at that because sometimes a methane is actually a methane producing bacteria you get the hydrogen gas which sounds crazy and then it looks like the hydrogen glow but if you treat the methane you will see next time that the hydrogen is high that's not uncommon so for her what we would probably do is give her the combination regimen with Axman plus either metronidazole or neomycin I might do a month of treatment for her and I would definitely be supporting motility probably Lotus urethra Meissen after we finished the course of a fact Amanda Quest neomycin okay and one more case here we have a seven year old male with history of bloating and diarrhea and this is his test and you notice here this one is only two hours but in general when i'm when i'm testing through Genova I always take a three-hour test because it just gives me more data and there's no reason the patient can't do one extra hour so this happens to be a two hour which is adequate but I do prefer the three hour so he has clearly very high on his hydrogen above the level and he's borderline on his methane because it does go above five at 120 minutes so he this patient I might try because a methane so borderline and because metronidazole and you might sound a little bit more harsh on the normal bacteria I didn't mention earlier but with saxman has evidence that it allows about 95% of the colonic bacteria to remain intact and there's typically no resistance in treatment over time so a couple really neat things about relaxing them is it's not observable it doesn't go systemically and it doesn't really hurt the probiotic colony so you're pretty safe using that and if you need to retreat it's usually effective the second and third and fourth time so this guy I think I would you respect them and and they maybe do a 30-day treatment because again is higher levels are in the 80s which means that he's going to take more than 14 days to clear it okay so 44 year old female with constipation and you can see her tests right here now interesting new with the constipation you do have the methane going above there but it's not as high and remember the lady on the black line so this one definitely methane is contributing and it's probably to be a little bit easier to fix because the highest her methane goes are 17 so in this case again you could do refraction and class either neomycin or metric as well I would just do a chewy course an alternative for her since her levels aren't extremely high would be to treat with herbs some of my favorites are the combination that were studied against ref acumen there's a combination from metagenic called cannabis and AR and BR and they work very well for a four-week course and there's a combination from biotics also studied against refreshment and both herbal regimens were more effective the combination from biotics is dis biocide in SP vital and so in this case because it's not super high and i'm a treat with four weeks of herbal herbal medication okay so we are nearing the end so I should be able to take your questions shortly but just to tie it all together tests don't get and if even if you have school inorganic acids and they're pointing to a problem with that tree overgrowth you still need to do a 3-hour lecture low stress test to confirm you also want to check to make sure there's not FIFO because very frequently the fungal overgrowth coat coexist you may need success around the treatment I started to mention this in the treatment but if a gas is greater than 35 to 40 you probably want more like a month of treatment versus two weeks the average decrease of antibiotics is 25 to 30 parts per million and then methane I mentioned and much harder to treat you can do the double in paddocks or you may try Alison and garlic extract it tends to work for methane there's not a lot of herbs that work for methane so if you are going to treat with herbs with methane I would use the garlic extract it's one of the few things I found to be fairly successful sometimes bio sidon and olive irx can be used as well I would recommend retesting two to four weeks after completion therapy to make sure things have resolved and if it if you have failure you have to address motility I gave you about five different options and it's been very important to keep those sessions on both diet and motility agents for up to six months and again diet you have to address or relapse will occur some patients do better fairly long-term on the low fodmap diet downside is the reason that works is they're starving the bacteria so a low fodmap diet long term may not be the best thing because you're not supporting the typical probiotics that we need or diversity so I don't like to keep people on the low fiber diet forever okay and then other things of why it may not work in Sasebo levels are too severe or there's an underlying issue like total autonomic dysfunction dysmotility something else you're not dealing with you may not resolve it or you may be no longer course methane needs dual treatment so if you tried to treat methane with just with maximum you will not be successful and there are some bacteria that are not successful older treatments of SIBO were ciprofloxacin and doxycycline there's a few others thought obviously those are not as inert they will cross over into the of their systemic and they would probably have a bigger effect in the probiotic colony colonies so I still prefer with accident and there is instructions in the breast prep that the basics are no beans white rice and water fast right before and don't you immediately upon waking you want to have them do ten clearing breasts so these instructions are all in the the genomic kit for the patient okay so I would love to open it up a question and thank you all for bearing with me thank you dr. Carnahan that was a great presentation so we received quite a few clinical questions let's go ahead and start with this one here regarding the use of garlic which is in terms of dietary garlic intake it's considered a high-fat food but is it okay to use during treatment so symptoms become exacerbated alla sinistra so first thing is garlic food is one of the highest Bogner so they want to be off that while they're treating for sure or like I said you may actually have them on it and then after the treatment regimen you take them off on a low fodmap diet but the alicent extract that I'm talking about in treating methane cleveo is not garlic directly and will not ask exacerbate symptoms yeah so regarding patients that you suspect to have a biofilm that is causing the treatments to be a little bit more difficult or not as successful as you would hope what biofilm dis rupture with disruptors you typically use okay I'm getting a little echo and I wonder whether it's just while I'm talking could you try meeting the CFO sure sure okay okay I'll try that Oh much better thank you soon I'm done you come back on so the things I use without some disruptors are an acetal 15 and these were pretty high in doses anywhere from 600 cid after two to three grams garlic itself which again I use just the Alison extracts that capsule come in 450 milligrams and I would use that two to three times a day which again is also going to help treatment of SIBO those are the two really well studied in the literature and then there's some products with EDTA and my favorite is interface plus so those are all really great options the one caveat is biofilm can be there for a reason so I'm not in the fan I'm not a fan of just willy-nilly destroying biofilms unless you know that they are an issue so my typical regimen will be treat without biofilm disruptors and then if you're not getting the response or it's coming back then you can add in the biofilm instructor's perfect so in terms of hypo chlorhydris and the challenge with pectin HCl so if the patient does not notice a warming sensation in their stomach after seven capsules do you typically have them continue to increase the betaine HCl capsules or do you stop them at seven okay so this is a really great question because a lot you will need more than seven or typically conventional wisdom I've always felt safe at 35 hundred milligrams as a max dose and so unless I'm really supervising a patient I really trust them I don't ever go higher than that even if they don't send them however I will tell you I have a couple patients right now that are taking 16 20 caps for meal and there are saving really good results when they get that high one of them has an autoimmune condition where they're not producing stomach acid and the other has other autoimmune conditions so I think there's plate claiming factors in to that and I would be extremely cautious about going that high unless you are confident that you can trust your patient because if they do have a gastritis or an irritation or a history of ulcers and you go that high and they aren't able to tell you they're having pain or symptoms like children I would never do that because I can't really tell you you know when they feel like burning if you trust your patient you could try higher but that's between you and them and typically we advise no more than 3,500 so if you have a patient who you suspect SIBO they have the classic gas bloating symptoms that are aggravated by specific or certain meals especially high-fiber meals but their breath test comes back negative and also they have a negative H pylori test what would you consider would you still consider treatment as if it was SIBO or CFO or how would you proceed oh that's a great question because the fact quite common as all of you listening know so one other thing don't use organic acids to help me determine is there but bacteria is there fungus that I haven't seen on the stool or the breath test there's also something called hydrogen sulfite Steve oh that is not at this point we don't have the lab to detect it and I think that future we may have that but right now we don't so there is a type of zero that will not show up on your test so they have all the symptoms of reacting to high five that foods bloating after meals and you want to try in this case if I didn't have data I would typically go with an herbal regimen for two reasons number one if they also have fungus you're going to treat better with herbs number two if they don't have fever you're less likely to cause any problems with herbs Christmas medications but I would probably treat but you also want to think about other causes so gastric reaches or pancreatic insufficiency or head Foucault's hijriyyah they might have any of these things that could cause bloating and gas after meals and they wouldn't have key though so there's a few things to think about but I would say I've had like half a dozen cases where I didn't have the evidence for SIBO and I treated and did recover too they probably had the hydrogen sulfide seed oh so it is possible and depending on your comfort level you might go ahead and treat you mentioned treatment with herbs if C fo is suspected can you please just list a few of those herbs sure so my favorite herbs for a cheaper would be caprylic acid oregano under Linnaeus acid grapefruit seed extract powder Arco turmeric and ginger regarding guar gum have you used quorum on its own in SIBO treatment or do you typically use it with RAF axon and about what is your dosage range okay another great it's a great clarifying question so the guard on it was studied with treatment because what it is it's a prebiotic so this is a caveat if you use it'll only make them worse which is why I don't give probiotics or prebiotics in the wrong form before I treat SIBO because you're adding for the problem because you give them a lot of prebiotic food they're going to have that bacteria have a party and produce toxins and they won't so well so Garzon in the study was used only with reflection and what it did is it caused without cure to be more active so that they were more effectively treated but it actually made makes them more symptomatic because you're seeking the bacteria so I would only use guard them with ref acumen after the study to be more effective and I would use it at the study dose with two grams per day in children do you typically use rough Axman and if not what do you typically use for the kiddos so it is not indicated I'm not sure what the cutoff is but in children is not indicated there have been times with parental consent I have used it for a very significant obvious case but again it's not indicated so they may have to pay out of pocket I would not use in children under 8 so this is more like your teenagers or preteens but I would use it in we have indicated with parental consent otherwise I would use herbs and I mentioned the two options that have been studied head-to-head against relax Minh and those are the metagenic and of Acton AR and BR and the biotics dysbiosis and SV Seidel some kids those be great option how do you decide whether to do a stool test or a SIBO tests for patients presenting with IBS symptoms so a great question my typical patient comes in I do a very full workup and they always get a stool test so I always start with that and I would say the breath test is more of a secondary as I'm not getting the data or I have symptoms if they come in and they had the classic idea symptoms I may order a breath and stool right off the bat but I would say school I always do first and then you see their stools and or stool and breath tests that person is it once and well if we've looked at everything we have into Sasebo then I'll add that in later but I would say typically go stool and organic acid first after treatment is it common to experience die-off symptoms like an increase in bloating or pain or something like that or even mid-trib yeah so during treatment some people can feel more fatigue in the panic using medication if using the dual regimen that can be pretty especially metronidazole a notoriously causes lack of appetite metallic taste in the mouth fatigue that would be really common for them - so slightly worse during treatment but typically by the time the two or four weeks is over they feel quite a bit better I'm Ashley even had like a 5 to 10-pound weight loss because this can contribute to weight gain in women or men generally people feel really good and when you're treating people I don't see the die-off like I do with fungal so retreating both in your treating yeast I would go slowly and the fungal treatment tends to need more like 2 to 3 months versus 2 to 4 weeks it's much longer term and that's where I see the hooks and the die-off reaction I don't see that a lot with SIBO treatment just a few more questions here when when do you typically recommend your patients dose Pro kinetics like what time in the day and how would you decide whether you would recommend Pro kinetics for a patient or not so in a safe had a significant history before me they come in they Bend like they tried treatments and failed that's when I would absolutely indicate it or do a prokinetic right after treatment so the the sequences you do the two to four weeks of treatment typically two weeks 14 days and right after that you start the prokinetic in the diet and I would have him on the prokinetic and the low-fat diet for four to six months after treatment to keep them in remission so that's kind of the sequence and prokinetic I would say about 50% of the time I do it right away but most of the time I would start it after a failed treatment so if we do the first course they fail the second time I'm next to make that mistake I'm gonna do a prokinetic regarding probiotics if you use probiotics during treatment what kind are what species and do you use it during treatment or after treatment yeah so in my this is clinical experience I don't have a ton of evidence but I do find that typical lactobacillus Bifidobacterium addicts are not as well tolerated with patients with C though my theory on that is that the Siebel organisms are often lactobacillus and other and sterile competent things so we're actually contributing to the problem if we don't take care of the root cause so I don't typically put them on regular probiotics right during the either treatment or before I treat them I do like score for radix those tend to be really well tolerated in SIBO patients even from the beginning before you treat them so I often will use a spore based probiotic and there's many of them out there and use that actually during treatment or even before treatment and they usually tolerate it very well if I do add in the lactobacillus if no bacter it's usually after the treatment and after the four to six months when they're on the diet and the motility agent and the last question I see here is in terms of hypochloride Rhea challenge do you typically use bed teen HCl or have you ever used pepsin HCl yes so I'm the most immense out there a bikini filled with cups and they have those and most people who need both for this so I say 90% people require 18 with Hudson there's a few people like me that don't tolerate the pepsin so for someone like myself I would do just the bikini HDL by itself but either way works I would always start with a betaine HCl with pepsin I think we've addressed all of the questions I'll wait a few things to see if any more questions come through hope here comes a few more questions okay so when patients breath test values are high and you treat for a longer period of time do you start with a 30-day treatment or will you just LLL do the two rounds of 14-day treatment when you have patients with really high breath gases yeah so this might be something if you're just starting out and we priced it to the FDA prescribe 14 days you'll get it approved easier and everything and just be aware and see what you experience because I've done exist for 15 years or what happens is I see the levels of her high and I know okay a fortunate course isn't going to quite adequately treat so what I do would have been do the 14 day course to equate or check them it's partially down but not all the way down and then repeat the course and if you're unsure just starting out that's still a perfectly acceptable way to do it again with my experience a lot of times now I'll just go directly to a 30-day course when I see the levels higher than say 30 or 40 on the hydrogen and you just get a better result in the beginning but there's no real wrong way to do it you can also just do 14 days retest and treat again that's an okay way to do it as well is there a particular brand of Allison that you use yeah good question because there is one brand others above all the rest it's called Allen med or Allen max Pro it's at 4 to 15 milligram I think the professional version is ala max Pro and the Ala med might be over the counter but they are both 450 milligrams of Allison extract per cap it's definitely the most effective it won't bother people who have a garlic sensitivity and when I dosed that for methane SIBO ideas four to six caps per day and that's usually four to six weeks treatment so patients who might have a parasite present along with a positive see bow breath test do you ever use Alinea or how do you approach that type of a situation yeah so another great question because I'm always looking the same what am i treating here and how can I combine all the treatments to fit everything - they might have h pylori or a protozoa like blasto or so this is a great question you could definitely use the metronidazole and I should mention as well because it comes generic it's easy to get but I typically myself use tonight is all thin class less side effects and less resistance so I'm hardly ever using Metra as well I'm almost always going straight to tonight as well and that would cover the core Zillah Alinea is a newer treatment that has been studied for top SIBO especially methane pseudo and it's shown to be quite effective it's also effective for protozoa and for viruses so for the top cases where you suspect multiple things going on a Linea for 30 days can be amazing as a treatment I have to know Linnaeus Blair yeast so if you do trial any I would want to make sure that there's no fungal things going on underneath and I've never used as a first-line I always still use it as a second-line treatment when they failed and it's wonderful but again I don't typically go to it first one can you talk a little bit more about the ten clearing breaths that we might consider taking prior to our first Zeebo breath test collection yeah so it's pretty simple you would just want to have your patients or if you're testing you know breathe in and out through their nose ten times they're just trying to basically get a little bit of a make sure their airway and things are clear before they start so they get an accurate test and that's part of it they haven't done the diet appropriately or the breast clearing breath appropriately you might see that hydrogen start out high if you ever see a test with a zero the time marker is a high hydrogen it is an invalid test you want to have them redo it it's probably shows where they haven't done the clearing breath but it's pretty simply like any sort of yoga or deep breathing would do just a nice deep breath you could hold it for four counts in and 4:48 comes out and do that ten times and then start the test regarding organic acid testing when would you consider ordering it so that you can look at the yeast and the bacteria dysbiosis markers yeah every patient I always get organic acids because it's so helpful on these like you have to and if you're going to be treating SIBO you have to be known you have to know you have to find some way that you're testing for fungal because I'll tell you what you'll miss it if you're not looking for it and then you'll make the patient worse so if for me every patient gets organic acid if you could review again how long after the completion of treatment do you consider retesting yeah so they recommend two weeks and sometimes it's the patients doing really well I'll go a little bit longer so basically you're doing with eczema and neomycin are affected by itself two weeks and then two weeks later is when you would test for cure and if it's normal then you go and go about low fodmap diet maybe motility prokinetic agent for six months if you want sometimes if I think they're doing better I won't retest until they have symptoms and that could be three six twelve months later so it's really up to you but if you want to prove that you've treated them adequately you could test two weeks after cessation of treatment so in the interest of time you will end our

Louis I've been in the Washington DC area since 2011 and ever since I learned about kidney disease and their diet restrictions I've just been really interested in helping people with that especially with my um with my nephew only having one kidney since he's been born but enough about that let's just jump right in so what is protein I mean like you hear your dietician talking about all the time you hear your nephrologist talking about as it's protein protein protein but really what is protein I mean protein comes from the food that we eat it's one of the three essential building blocks necessary for our life the other two are fats and carbohydrates and these are all macronutrients and these are like fancy words but basically a macronutrient is what's going to give us our energy we measure our energy in the form of calories and so protein gives us calories fat gives us calories and carbohydrates give us calories together these all build together to make up our like our food supplies so you're eating like a steak or some pasta these are all going to have these different macronutrients in there so protein is most commonly known for building and repairing our muscles when we think about our muscles we really mainly just kind of think about like our skeletal muscles the muscles like our biceps or our triceps or our quads or our calves and these muscles that are moving our bodies but those other muscles are going to be our organs so your heart your meet your liver these are all these are all muscles in linear music and your body needs to be repairing itself it's going to be repairing it with protein protein also plays an important role in all of our body functions not only does it help build and repair muscles it also like aids in our digestion in metabolism so like how much energy our body is using and it also helps produce antibodies that helps fight infection so when you're sick your mom's chicken noodle soup really was medicine you know because you really do need that um that protein to help with just okay so what is protein protein is actually a long chain of amino acids and amino acids are just some fancy you know molecules that get linked together in different formations and become protein when you break when you digest protein it gets broken back down into these amino acids our body or there's 20 amino acids out in all of our food supply and our body is able to make all of these but 9 these nine amino acids are called our essential amino acids and you have to get these essential amino acids the missing nine that our body can't make from food amino acids so protein is helping us build and repair our muscles amino acids are also used in forming hormones or enzymes and neurotransmitters which are basically the signals that our brain tells our body and like how our brain communicates with our body and you can find protein in both animal and plant sources so complete proteins what is a complete protein basically a complete protein is going to be a food source that's going to contain all nine amino acids all those nine essential amino acids that our body is not able to make is going to be contained in those complete proteins your the list of the different meats 9 essential amino acids the only time you're ever going to need to know this is when you're taking a test to become a dietitian the where can you find amino acid are complete proteins you're going to be found in your red meats your whole which is like chicken or which is like your beef your pork your lamb goat you're going to find it in your poultry which is your chicken your turkey your duck fish eggs dairy so most mainly you're going to find your easy protein and meat sources but also soy and that grain quinoa that everybody's been talking about are also considered complete proteins research you hear your dietitian talking about well we want to eat animal protein animal protein all the you know because it's a complete protein it's also shown that people on dialysis actually have an increased benefit from eating protein that comes from animals it's just an animal protein is better absorbed and better used by our body the same thing with iron the iron that you get from animals is actually better used and better absorbed by our body so your dietitian is going to be right even here I use this term like eat more high biological value protein such as means protein coming from an animal and when you're on dialysis your proteins are actually higher than the average American or the average person and it's because of two main reasons number one when you're on dialysis it's wonderful it removes all the waste build-up but it's also going to remove some of your protein in your blood so you will need to eat a little bit more protein because of that but the main reason is because your body dialysis is putting stress on your body's putting stress on all on your heart on your blood vessels on everything because it's an active actively removing these wastes those Abused waste products so your body is under stress when your body is under stress your body needs more protein and so thus your protein needs are higher the recommended amount of protein for people on dialysis is a little bit higher it's higher than the average American like I said on average people should be eating about 0.8 grams of protein per kilo but when you're on dialysis we want you to eat more so that's 1.2 to 1.4 grams of protein per kilo and most people on dialysis actually know what they're keeping with their weight is in kilos because that's your dry weight so think about it this right here to spine hmm saying that somebody who is about 70 kilos or that's about 154 pounds needs to have about 85 to 100 grams of protein per day and 60 to 70 percent of that or nine ounces need to be an animal source protein so that's about six or seven ounces of meat about two eggs and a half a cup of milk and I know that milk is one of those on that list of foods that you're not really supposed to be eating but I do believe that the recommendations are still that you can have about a half a cup of dairy a day but use also getting protein from other sources so from plants you can get your your protein from plant sources as well and [Applause] the chance like we were talking about don't have all nine essential amino acids besides the soy and the quinoa so that means you're going to have to eat them in combination you're gonna need to eat plant a with plant B because that's going to provide you with all different with all nine essential amino acids and when they're paired together that's called a complementary protein a lot of people who are vegetarian or vegan need to make sure that they're really they're meeting their protein needs because they are eating and then making sure that they're eating these different types of proteins together really what we're looking at you should be eating legumes or being with grains so beans have a certain type of amino acid and grains have different amino acids and paired together they're going to give you all nine amino acids so if you want to eat beans with grains or beans with nuts or beans with seeds that's going to make sure that you're getting all nine essential amino acids for the net meal so they just need to be in in combination throughout the day they don't have to be at the exact same meal but throughout the day if you're going to eat means we need to eat some rice or some pasta or some bread to make sure that you're getting all nine essential amino acids I know you're probably thinking to me like oh my goodness what is this lady talking about she is talking about beans and beans are all too big there's no list you should not be eating beans but actually I like to think about but you can eat a more vegetarian lifestyle but you should be doing it like a per meal or maybe once a once a like once a day or maybe even just choosing a day to not eat any meat but what you're going to do is the way that you can do this is by choosing like let's say you want to go and have like some a burrito and you want to have like a black bean burrito as long as you're doing beans and rice without the chicken that's okay but what we want to do is make sure that you're not doing being rice and chicken because that's going to give you too much potassium and too much phosphorus in that meal but eating a more vegetarian myself that will help you with you know cholesterol levels and energy levels and weight by adding and also with constipation I mean like be into a lot of nice good soluble and insoluble fiber and that can help with your bowel movements but I think a good rule of thumb is if you're going to eat some beans don't eat any meat and that's a meal and I mean I can't stress this enough always talk to your dietitian about doing something like this because let's say your potassium levels are a little bit too high or your phosphorus levels are a little bit too high I don't know what your levels are but your your dietitian does and you can sit down and say hey you know I really want to make sure that I'm getting enough protein but I also want to you know start eating a little bit more on a vegetarian style lifestyle how can we do this together and your dietitian I'm sure has a whole bunch of wonderful great ideas to make that happen but when in doubt ask your dietitians this is a nice little Alma spy just kinda shows you about the potassium in different foods right so we always talk about like you know eat all this meat meat meat meat fun you need to limit your beans or your lentils or your nuts because it has so much potassium in it that's kind of where I got that rule of thumb you know eating beans beans don't need any meat a student if you look at this you can have a half a cup of beans like black beans is about 300 milligrams of potassium where is you know three ounces of like a beef roast is even higher again to tastin is 320 milligrams three ounces of chicken like a chicken breast is about 220 which is a great amount of potassium that's that's like the perfect the second you know the golden is standard and you can always like figure out how much 3 ounces is if you look at your palm the palm of your hand is about 3 ounces so when in doubt look at your hand and say ok well that's about 3 ounces so I'm okay with there and 3 ounces of chicken is about 21 grams of protein so there's a lot of protein to be had out there the next you always you know when you're a dietitian comes around every month to give you your lab she's talking to you about your protein levels but she's showing you a number and it's called albumin and albumin is the number that we we renal dietitians really like to talk about it's but what is albumin it's a protein that we get that our liver makes from the food that we eat I like to think about our the albumin as like our body's mailman it's out there delivering all the necessary nutrients like vitamins and minerals and energy and hormones and different like drugs that your doctor has prescribed to you throughout your body so it's out there doing all these important functions but also not only is it delivering all these things it's also helping keep the fluid in your blood so that way it's able to be removed during dialysis it's also helping you fight infection so there's a reason why your your dietitian is you know talking about humans so much it's also hard to keep your albumin at that you know magic number that she's wanting me to keep it at which is a level of four and how human is kind of sickle I always like to say if you look at it the wrong way it's going to go down but it can be affected negatively so it can go down if you have an active infection if you have inflammation I'm not talking about like swelling when I'm talking about inflammation when I'm talking about like inflammation is when your body is under stress which dialysis makes your body under stress so your body is always inflamed when you're on dialysis so inflammation make sure albumin lower swelling or edema when you have too much fluid on and your feet and ankles start to like puff up that can lower your albumin when you have too much fluid and it sits on your lung that's going to lower your element or anytime you take a trip into that hospital number one your body is under stress you might have an infection you might have too much fluid there's a whole lot of reasons your recent hospitalization is going to make your protein low your albumin low and not also the food maybe not be the greatest when you're in the hospital or you're feeling sick and you don't want to eat enough you know there's all these holes all these reasons why your protein might be lower doing for these reasons and these may not be what sound alike they are like a food issue like I mean infection well how can you do anything about that with food but when you're not feeling well a lot of times you don't eat as much and when you're not eating as much that will also lower your I'll demon level too so again back um you know grandma's chicken soup lets you know when you're in down when you're on dialysis you get that wonderful little report card that your dietitian comes around with you and every month they're checking your labs or reminding you to do you know to take your binders and to avoid tomatoes and potatoes and they always are probably saying oh we will need you to eat some more protein eat some more protein because your ailment is a little bit low we want you to be at a goal of four or higher there is a reason for that there's one lot of research out there showing that people on dialysis who have an albumin level under four have higher risk of death and have more hospitalizations so if your albumin is 4 or higher there is a lower risk of death and fewer hospitalizations which I mean that's always a really good thing um we talked a little bit and a few slides ago about what can make your protein go down or that albumin number go down and one of them looks like the edema or the swelling or the fluid on your lungs fluid really your albumin can be diluted dilutional and if you have too much fluid that's going to make your protein level or your albumin level lower so it's important so important especially in these hot summer months it's already getting hot here in DC I mean like I think the humidity is super hot and I know that the folks here are really wanting to drink more because they're feeling really dehydrated but it's really important to follow your fluid restrictions so that way the fluid doesn't leak out of your of your blood vessels I was talking about how like albumin helps keep the fluid in your blood vessels and when the fluid is in your blood vessels or then it's easier for the dialysis machine to remove that fluid because your blood is going into the dialysis machine and then they're using a mechanism called ultra filtration that's removing the fluid from from your blood and then it goes back in to your body and your body will repopulate the blood with more fluid and then throughout that three to four hour time circle circuit you're able to remove you know 2 to 5 liters of fluid per treatment the more fluid you remove the heart of that machine has to work and the harder it pulls on your heart and it puts an extra strain on your heart so having less fluid on following that fluid restriction is really important for multiple reasons not only lowering your keeping your protein level nice and high we don't want what we don't want to happen is that fluid to go into your third space in third space I mean you probably have heard your doctor or your dietitian talking about it it just means that space that's in between the blood vessels and your cells and that's when you notice like when you look at your feet and they're all swollen and if you can even push down on it and kind of leave that divot that's the fluid in your third space and your the dialysis machine is not able to remove that but if your albumin is nice and high and your protein that's nice and high you're able to it's going to keep that fluid in your blood vessels and you'll be able to remove it easier again I'm talking a lot about fluid the fluid is so very important when it comes to protein and so very important when it comes to your health too much fluid can cause a lot of problems some of these problems are flying around your feet and ankles it can also cause fluid to go into your lungs or sit on your lungs and could possibly end up leading it you know hard for you to breathe making air or you could even get pneumonia also it can start too much fluid can stretch out your heart you have this extra volume of blood and so now your heart has to work harder to move it through your blood vessels and it's not like it's working harder and getting stronger it's actually getting stretched out like a stretched out balloon and it becomes weak and floppy and so this makes it harder for your heart to work makes it harder for you to get rid of the fluid and also continues to make her or your protein or your albumin look you can also put extra stress on your body because now the Machine the dialysis machine is having to pull the more fluid off harder and it's making more strain on your heart which is also going to lead to could lead to all sorts of different things not only like hospitalization so and then too much fluid makes your protein low and then this whole little cycle if your protein is low the fluids going to leak out of your blood vessels and it's going to go into your third space and it's just this is little cycles so cutting back on that fluid and making sure you recognize trying to only hit that 32 ounces of fluid per day is a really important goal really but you your dietician is sitting there telling you eat more protein eat more protein eat more protein how do you do that how can you make your your albumin levels higher you're like I'm eating protein at every meal I you know I'm not hungry I can't eat any more protein how many eggs do you want me to eat a day oh my goodness you know what what can I do the next few slides and actually the rest of this presentation is going to really be about tips for boosting your albumin levels because I think it's really important to understand what it is but really let's talk about real life let's do you know how can we make this happen first and foremost back to this fluid drink 32 ounces of fluid or less a day and a fluid is not just water it's soda its juice it is tea its coffee its soup it's ice its jello if it's ice cream and popsicles and ice um anything that is liquid at room temperature it's going to be considered a fluid summertime is the hardest time because it is hot and humid and people want to drink more you really got to figure out what works best for you some people like to drink a just fill up a 32 ounce glass and they know that that's what they get to drink all day long some people like to have 4 8 ounce glasses and no and so they feel like they get to go back but that's whatever is your personal preference also eating a protein source at every meal it doesn't have to be an animal protein source we just learned that like beans and rice together make a complete protein so like I said if you want to eat beans go ahead and eat those beans don't eat a piece of like meat at the same time though but make sure you're always having a protein source at every meal and this sounds kind of crazy eat a bedtime snack you know a lot of times we keep on hearing about like oh my goodness you shouldn't eat when you go to bed you know all these things and if you have acid reflux eating a bedtime snack is maybe not the best choice but I'm not trying to say like you a big meal I'm talking about an apple or a half of a sandwich it doesn't have to be a protein you know heavy meal it's like an apple an apple has very little as any protein in it but it's still going to give us energy and the reason having a snack right before bedtime is a really good thing is it's been shown that when you're on dialysis your liver which is actually storing your energy only stores about half the amount of energy then some than an average person so you think about it you go to you're using energy all of the time when you are eating and you have food in your stomach like right after lunch which is kind of basically now your body has an instant source of food it's the food that you're eating is the food that you're digesting but your body's not going to use all of that food and it's going to store the rest of that in our liver in a form of energy called glycogen but what happens is when you are on dialysis your body's only able to store about half the amount of glycogen so you go to bed and you're not eating when you're asleep obviously so your body has to use your energy stores halfway through the night you have used up all the stored energy or that glycogen and now your body needs to have more energy to breathe to function to roll over to do any for your heart to keep on breathing or beating all of these things take energy takes calories takes you know you know sugar or glucose if you eat a bedtime snack then your body will use that energy at the first half of the night the second half of the night so you're going to use your energy stores in your liver and then you wake up and you eat you know a bowl of oatmeal or something and then BAM now you've saved all your energy and what happens is because like I said you know like protein is a macronutrient way back in the first slide it's giving us calories well your body is going to use those calories it's going to say oh I don't have anymore the stored energy I'm going to use something that's quick and easy when it'd be great if it was using our fats but it's not that takes a long time for it to break down takes a lot of energy it's going to take your protein in the form of albumin and it's going to use that to sustain you overnight so eating a bedtime snack I can't talk about it enough it's so great another thing who knew but Brazil nut Brazil nuts are really really really super high in an antioxidant called selenium selenium actually helps to fight the type of inflammation that lowers your albumin levels so one Brazil nut a day not two not three one Brazil nut a day as shown that you can't that will raise your albumin levels from a 3.5 to a four within like six months so you can go and find just the Brazil nuts I'm not talking about walnuts or peanuts or cashews or anything like that because they don't have the selenium content that these Brazil nuts do it's the selenium in these growers mill nuts that are going to help raise your elbow and cause it's going to lower that inflammation you don't want to eat too many just one a day because you don't want to mess with your potassium and phosphorus because those are always very important to make sure that they are within range for one Brazil not a day that's an easy quick fix also let's say you just got out of a hospital and you don't have much of an appetite or you just you know you've got these taste changes going on you just don't really want to eat anything and it's just you don't feel like eating and so you're not getting enough calories you're not getting enough protein all of this well if you don't have much of an appetite I always think a nice good little trick is to have like some chicken salad or tuna salad or egg salad in your refrigerator and every time you walk by that refrigerator you get like a a wheat thin or a little cracker that doesn't have any added phosphorus and you dip it in there and you take you eat a little bit if you walk back and forth in front of your in front of your refrigerator like 10 times a day that's like a half a cup and that's going to give you at least 20 grams of protein right there and some calories that will help boost up that level it's just a trick for everybody who you know is able to eat three meals a day and you know eat snacks no this is for somebody who really just doesn't have an appetite and just doesn't know what to do and you know your dietician is saying oh my goodness I need to eat more I need you to eat more well this is a great way of making that happen and then there's the protein powders and protein bars protein supplements we are all very very fortunate right now that we live in this world of everybody thinking that they need more protein members than they do that means we've got a whole bunch of different protein powders and bars to choose from some taste better some don't you know but now you get to make those choice also now with the new food label laws they're trying to you have to have potassium listed so some protein bars have already started doing that I think potassium doesn't have to be listed until 2020 on the food label I could be wrong but it's not it's not 100% yet so what you want to do is make sure that you're finding a protein bar or protein powder that has substance' listed so that way you know that you're not getting too much potassium also talking with your dietitian you know saying hey I found this in the grocery store you know what do you think but of course we are going to talk about these different protein supplements now so when choosing your protein supplement what you want to do is make sure you read the label first I can't as you know enough and talk about reading those labels you're looking for a protein supplement that has a least 10 grams of protein in it and also is lower in potassium your goals should be a protein supplement that's under 200 milligrams of potassium so certainly stay away from anything that has over 350 milligrams of potassium and again some some protein supplements do list the amount of potassium on there some don't on their labels right here these protein supplements these do list potassium on the label I've starred the different drinks and bars that have over 300 milligrams of potassium so the muscle milk protein powder has over 300 milligrams of potassium but the muscle milk low calorie protein powder is actually under 300 milligrams don't barge Larabars all these different types of bars but again when in doubt go to your grocery store take a picture of it and show it to your dietitian that I think is the best way to do it you and your dietitian working together can find the best fit for you again here are some just some snacks that aren't like protein bars Special K high-protein cereal you know like you can when you're on dialysis I know some dialysis units actually allow people to eat in there because these would be a great thing to bring with you if you know just as a little snack or something that you can just carry in your purse of the Special K proteins cereal 14 grams that's and a half a cup and it only has 125 milligrams of potassium that's that's fantastic Takashi go lean with 9 grams what you really want to do is making sure that you're getting the most protein for your bang with the least amount of potassium and again staying away from anything that has this over 350 really anything over 300 you kind of want to avoid if it's going to be something you're in to be eating a lot of again be aware of any protein supplement but does not lift the potassium content a good rule of thumb if the protein supplement is not listing the potassium on the label and it's made with peanuts or any type of nut or seed as a first or second or third ingredient it could very well be high in potassium because nuts as you've seen on previous slides are actually pretty high in potassium so that's a good to avoid any of those protein supplements if they don't list the amount of potassium on their also the reason we worry so much about potassium is because potassium controls muscle function and muscle contraction and remembering that your heart is a muscle so if your potassium is too high and or too low it can cause your heart to miss beat and not to be the way that it's supposed to and you can end up having a heart attack so here are a few supplements I feel like more supplements than not actually list the amount of potassium on there but here's a few supplements that are the don't list the amount of potassium so again if it's made with peanuts or it has peanuts in the first couple of ingredients you want to avoid those because most likely they have too much potassium also sometimes you think oh I'm going to you know eat a granola bar because that's going to be you know high in fat and protein but actually a lot of these don't have very much protein in them at all like I use like granola bars chewy granola bars crunchy granola bars any of those milk substitutes you think oh it's going to have plenty of protein and it's made from nuts but it doesn't so please be wary of that also um sometimes your protein is under 3.5 that your albumin when it's under 3.5 a lot of times dialysis facilities will give you a nutritional supplement either in the form of a bar or in a form of a drink and that will give you and that'll help boost your protein levels your albumin levels but also let's say your protein levels are under 3/5 for a long period of time maybe like three months or longer talk to your dietitian there is a form of protein that you can get during your dialysis it will go right into your dialysis you don't have to get stuck again for another another kind it'll just go right into the dialysis machine and we'll fill in this extra protein during your treatment and talk to your dietitian she knows about this type of treatment talk to your nephrologist they might even be able to find a company that can help you with your insurance and maybe you won't even have to pay for this but really in conclusion protein is a really important part of our diet you have higher protein needs if you're on dialysis albumin is that type of protein that your dietitian is talking about and the reason she is is because it holds the fluid into your blood vessels it helps you fight infection research has shown that it is it keeps you out of the hospital and taking making sure you take your phosphorus binders I didn't really talk a lot about this but I'm sure your dietitian is talked to you plenty about your binders but even with your snack or with you know protein supplements you need to make sure you take those binders because where there's protein there's going to be phosphorus and anytime you're looking to change your diet habits you need to talk to your dietician and your nephrologist first and it's just best to have everybody who's on your team knowing what's going on and I do believe so now it's a question time so I think people have been writing in questions and mike is going to do a rapid-fire questions and then I'll do the answers yeah thank you very much Carolyn we definitely have more questions that we've gotten in and that folks would like to ask more we do have time feel free to enter that in the questions box which is on your your dashboard there so first question from one of yours is why does having an albumin level of 400 or higher mean less hospitalizations in depth they understand kind of what Sannikov edit is happening oh goodness um yes they do now the question is do I know is all about again the inflammation because when your albumin level is under is a four or higher it shows how it really means that you maybe you don't have any infection or your inflammation that causes stress on the body is lower and if you have less inflammation but that is a really really really great question to ask you're enough for ologist your kidney doctor about okay on the inflammation piece also what are some other good sources of selenium besides Brazil not Wow um so is Brazil not is the the highest it's selenium is called a trace element and so they are found in very small amounts in lots of foods but really Brazil nuts is has the highest amount and that's what's going to make it you that's really going to be what affects your albumin level is the Brazil nut okay if you do have acid reflux what type of food would you recommend before bed and how soon should it be before bed okay certainly we want to not a more carbohydrate food so an apple or like some crackers we don't want anything that's going to be sitting in your stomach for a long time so things that are going to be like that have fat in them or that have a lot of protein in it because fat and protein sit in your stomach longer which is great because when you're trying to lose weight and it makes you feel full longer but when you have acid reflux that is going to make the acid to go back up a little bit longer if it's sitting in your stomach longer I would say recommend you could and two hours to an hour beforehand oh that would be just fine you would still get the benefit of the snack you know I mean I'm not saying that you need to lay in bed right before you fall asleep and like you know eat an apple but like hours before bedtime that could be a great rule of thumb for everybody because when you lay down the acid reflux it makes it a little bit easier for it to come back up so two hours okay we have someone that's asking about information regarding protein for patients with chronic kidney disease stages three and four and are there major differences in where could they get more information there are two schools of thought out there there are some new research coming out and it actually is saying that in the beginning these two talked about you we want to restrict protein and that's still the rule of thumb out there but now they're kind of looking and saying that they don't really need to do that some good good resources would be the American kidney fund the National Kidney Foundation divita calm person is calm they all have a really good peer-reviewed journal articles but I think the most important thing is not about restricting protein but restricting different types of protein so eating the more vegetarian style proteins the beans and the whole grains and things like that if their potassium levels are okay it would be in the fish in the poultry and avoiding red meat red meat actually is a vaso constrictor that means it's taking your blood vessels and making them smaller and so that means your heart has to work harder to move that blood and then your heart has to work harder to get your to move the blood your blood pressure goes up so your kidneys work harder to lower your blood pressure your kidneys do so much who knew but so avoiding red meat or limiting red meats to like maybe once a month when you have stage 3 or stage 4 kidney disease I think is the most important takeaway for protein and early CKD okay someone says why am I always hungry now that I started dialysis oh that's a great question um dialysis you have higher energy needs when you're on dialysis I mean like people who don't know anything about dialysis they think oh you're just sitting in that chair for you know three hours no big deal well your body is hard at work when you're on dialysis you may just be sitting there but man oh man that machine when I keep on saying it's pulling it's actually doing that it's putting your body under stress and it's working your body your body is using all this energy and so your your calorie needs are actually higher so I think having some lean protein snacks having some low calorie snacks you know just kind of throughout like in your purse or in your dashboard or by your chair you know it's a good way to get in some calories but not you know not the Doritos next I mean I would love to be able to eat Doritos all day long but that's no good for anybody so like having some lean low calorie snacks is important thank you very much so someone doesn't like apples as a snack are grapes as good as apples and snack and a so red versus green any difference um really no difference between what red versus green some people might say oh there's more antioxidants and red grapes versus green grapes that I think you would have to be like a bushel of grapes to make that be any type of difference grapes are low in potassium they have like zero phosphorous but they are high in calorie and they're high in sugar so that's what's giving you above the calories now it's natural sugars less great but if you have diabetes or you're trying to watch your weight maybe choosing you know like 15 grapes which is a serving versus like 30 grades or something like that where does the excess protein that we intake go does our body get rid of it and how yes when your kidneys are working the way that they should be your body gets rid of the extra protein or the protein later through your urine protein waste is actually broken down into ammonia so when you pee a VP you and you smell that ammonia smell that's partly that's partly your the waste of the protein when your body is but really mainly your body all the protein that we eat is being used it's being turned into albumin is be turned into other types of you know blood proteins it's being turned into muscle and it's really just the waste product that our kidneys are filtering out when your kidneys aren't working the way that they should then your body's not able to filter out that ammonia and that's what it's caused the your bu in and your creatinine these are levels that your doctor and your dietitian are probably talking to you about and your nurses but that causes those to rise and they can cause toxic levels in your body and cause like funny taste in your mouth and even you know kind of dementia sign okay some of this dialysis patient is saying I've tried changing my diet to pass but I always go back to old eating habits do you have any tips for making new habits stick - ditto um yes start small don't try and change everything all at once I think that that is the biggest leading the best the biggest factor that leads to failure in the falling back into old habits also don't like do any negative self-talk I mean we're all going to eat that pizza one of these days and you know just because you ate that pizza doesn't mean that you are you know that you're bad or you're doing the wrong things and things like that say okay I had my pizza now I'm going to move on and not feel bad or guilty about it the best best best advice I can give anybody about changing diet habits or trying to lose weight is number one write down everything a single thing that you eat don't lie to yourself if you ate that Jolly Rancher write it down number two don't buy those chips don't go down that aisle in the grocery store get rid of it at your house I know I mean like things are expensive and you don't want to throw away food and stuff like that but dang it throw it away get rid of it don't have it in your house if you have family members they can plead to them say please please please please do not buy Chips Ahoy cookies because I really I can't I can't not eat those maybe you don't like almond joys and say if you really want to have a snack buy those almond joys and keep them in the house but the most important thing is write down every single thing that you eat don't shame yourself and feel bad and negative when you slip up we all do and don't have it in your house okay great it's probably tips we all can use including me you talked a little bit about a vegetarian diet and that's definitely possible to do it any is it possible to successfully follow a vegan diet while on dialysis yes um it's certainly harder and that is something that I mean I don't know if you can be vegan 100% of the time because dairy will be would be an important source of nutrients and like also be vitamins but that is something that you and your dietitian in your nephrologist should should talk together I think a great way to approach that is writing like come up with a diet plan write down like I could eat X Y & Z and meet all of my needs what do you think you know if you come in with more information than that way your dietician your nephrologist be like okay this person has really done their work they know what they're doing they're going to do it the right way and they would feel more confident okay we have a fluid question I'm a dialysis patient have difficulty controlling my fluid levels what can I do to reduce feelings of thirst and will protein help me feel less thirsty now proteins are going to help you feel less less thirsty at all but you can if you let you know you can like fries grapes and suck on those frozen grapes you can chew gum you can suck on like sour candies I know this these are all probably things that you've heard before also like any type of fruit that has a lot of water in it so frozen apples watermelon pears freeze all your fruit and suck on that don't suck on ice because that's going to melt down and be turned into into fluid a little trick that I used to do back in the day when I was you know young but I would go to soccer camp and it's hot is all get-out in st. Louis and it's humid and it's awful but you need go and you'd run all around you're super thirsty and you drink as much as you can but you're still too hot I would take cold water like the drinking fountain and run it over my wrist where my blood supply was and that would help cool my body down also getting like a frozen washcloth and when you're at your house and putting it on your head and that will help cool you down it's about being high is a lot of times where do you feel like you're thirsty or have it getting a wet towel and freezing that and putting that around your neck when you're walking in this awful heat to the metro or that's less or the what not that is another good way to keep your body cool staying cool what helps decrease your your desire for drinking oh and don't eat a lot of salt salt makes you thirsty thank you very much any difference in the way the body absorbs animal proteins which is a protein supplement yeah because those are all synthetic all the strong work a lot of those are some are synthetic and they're not commonly found in nature your body is much better at breaking down foods in its natural form animal plant when we start pulling things out and making these supplements they're very important they do a great service but your body can maybe absorb more of them or less it just depends on how how it's working out I would look for like a whey protein because whey protein is in its most natural state okay that was the last question I didn't you made it thank you very much Carolyn great job today I learned a lot as well so I really appreciate you coming in doing this tonight okay well thanks I had a great time fabulous hour now webinar will be held on Thursday July the 26th from 2:00 to 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time in partnership with satellite health care we present blaster therapy and dialysis exercise activity and wellness with dr.

"FP-HpHsRLxY": "the schedule to be one hour okay and we're going to get starting and I just noticed as the volume is a little bit low so let us know it continues to be low and you can go ahead and take it away everyone come across Canada I'm delighted with the the turnout and so those of you with diabetes persons with IVs welcome and i see that i have some colleagues health care providers divers educators also online so thank you for the opportunity on invitation from CDA to discuss any well to match diabetes we have certainly long known that nutrition is a cornerstone of diabetes management and as would have it of course nutrition interventions is very helpful in helping to reduce the a1c by one to two percent which is significant in terms of healthy outcomes I'd like to start off our conversation with just that eating well with diabetes but I'd like to maybe review a few myths if I may about food so myth number one people with diabetes can eat sweets or chocolate and I hope to be slide with in advance to the next says the truth is people with diabetes can enjoy some sweets and still control blood Sugar's enjoy them once in a while but don't try to live on them and I think that that's a really important message that we need to convey that it really is about portion control and fitting it into a healthy meal plan another myth healthy foods don't rise blood sugar truth even nutritious foods like apples oatmeal can rise blood sugar to an unhealthy level this happens if you don't have enough insulin to match the carbohydrates you eat so clearly we have to have an appreciation of portion control and choosing healthy foods accordingly to achieve good blood Sugar's people with diabetes should eat sugar free foods truth you don't need sugar free foods to control blood sugar in fact many sugar free foods will raise blood sugar so what is the diabetes diet a caption reads I see you're having a bit of trouble with the new diet the diabetes diet is not really a diet it's an eating plan that's a healthy one the way that everyone should eat Canada's Food Guide is the framework of the diabetes meal plan and if we focus on the four main groups and then we'll address some some other foods that give pleasure in terms of speed salt or perhaps with you're thinking about caffeine so we'll just address those in a moment our interest with good nutrition and diabetes care is to help control blood glucose can help to control blood lipid levels and blood pressure it can help to maintain a healthy weight or help lose weight if you are overweight it can allow you to take less medication it can also prevent or delay complications from high blood sugars I've chosen to take the word diet and redefine it in a way that may be a little more encouraging and a little more positive for the most part diet tends to lend itself to all the foods you will enjoy eating you should really avoid so if we take the letter D of the word diet we want to discover the foods that rise blood sugars for those of you there are new to diabetes and hopefully will attend some diet sessions over and above this evening and obtain some handouts that I will present on here or suppose you do there are currently monitoring your blood sugar it's a journey about which foods Roger your blood Sugar's the eye part of the word diet will be increased activity and we recognize the importance of activity in both blood sugar control weight management and lipid-lowering 150 minutes of activity per week is a desirable minimum amount the e part of the diet will be the eating plan and will address the specifics of the eating plan in a few moments the other a of the word of the letter e for diet I've chosen as emotions I'd like you to give some consideration to a couple of things what is your relationship with food and I think perhaps the first answer might be love it and we want you to enjoy your food but I also like to give some thought to your sensations of when you really feel full when do you really feel hungry you know are you aware of those cues do you listen to your body cues your senses what are you drawn to you when you are stressed emotionally distraught what is your comfort food an important part of the meal plan and the t part of the word diet is st. portions I'd like to suggest with the number of participants we have signed up the sea then we could all share a little sweet amongst all of us so it's not about no sugars no sweets but it's about portion control so for all of you on your journey with diabetes i invite you to really think about the four parts of diet and i'd like you to start with small steps that you address one area that you're going to work on and just work your way through the four parts so perhaps all of you are eating well but perhaps the portions are a little too much or perhaps some of you are eating well but need to increase your activity some of you are just starting your journey with blood sugar modeling just to see how which whose blood why's your blood sugar significantly and which foods do not so I'd like you to think about the approach to die in a very positive way we know that food is made up of three parts carbohydrates protein and fat and for the purpose of the blood sugar control we're going to address carbohydrates first carbohydrates raise blood sugars and do so in a good way they are a necessary component of brain function energy etc so that we want to merit the carbohydrates for what they have to offer us some of our carbohydrate foods as outlined on the slide would include the dairy milk yogurts discussion of almond milk soya milk should also come into this carbohydrate we have our fruits fresh frozen canned dried and juices we have our grains wheat rye pumpernickel in the ancient grains we have potatoes we have corn and we have our baked goods and of course we have liquid carbohydrates as illustrated by the alcohol elected on the slide we have a variety of vegetables that we refer to as free food the peas the character beets with gosh half a cup serving will not impact let sugar significantly all of your rabbit foods are very good choice foods as well that can be well taken into your plan what about fruit we address certain a that suits our combination of carbohydrates consisting of natural sugar and fiber let's consider the following compare apple juice to apples there is a significant difference in how it rises blood sugar the apple juice is a more process we find usually fiber reduced leaving it with an immediate spike in blood sugar I would invite you to really be cautious with your intake of juice even if the label says no sugar added remember there is a natural sugar to that fruit juice on the other hand having a solid fruit such as an apple given the fiber the pectin and the cellulose the fiber now slows down the rise of the carbohydrate into sugar in the body we invite you to include two to three servings of fruit a day healthy wholesome and portion size becomes an important consideration I'll invite you to think about cupping your hand and recognizing the amount of fruit that would fit into your hand cupped would be considered a serving if we consider the various fruit that we have to choose from if we range from the Apple to the watermelon there is a considerable difference in the fiber content of different fruits they are all carbohydrate but the fiber is quite different if we look at the Apple we have a high fiber count same as pairs berries on the other hand if we go to the watermelon section or the walla metals fruit the fiber content is much lesser hence you will enter the bloodstream at a quicker rate and you will need to eat more to feel fuller the fiber consideration here it's referred to as the glycemic index or the GI it's a scale that ranks carbohydrate-rich foods by how much they rise the blood sugar levels choosing higher fiber foods equals a lower GI hence driving the blood sugar at a slower rate this particular handout is taken from the canadian dissociation hand out of which you can access on the website and we've categorized foods and these are carbohydrate-rich foods into three categories we have the low GI and this is scored on a scale of one to a hundred we have the medium GI and we have a high GI in the consideration of how we would put this into perspective I would invite you to think of this in the following the high GI diet or the high GI foods we invite you to choose less often they taste good and they certainly have some nutritional marriage but limited the medium category would be what we would encourage you to choose and of course the low GI inviting you to choose most often so cuz they're the following the high GI foods are good the medium GI foods are better and the low GI foods are best the question now asks is your meal plan good can it be better or can you make the best choice to get a better blood sugar control some of the food choices on the low GI we do a comparison you'll see how one hundred percent stone-ground whole wheat bread a heavy heavy mixed grain a pumpernickel or a rye would be an excellent choice followed by the whole wheat rye or pita and then the white breads are the ones that are categorized in the lower GI for the high GI sorry then you've got your brand cereals and again they're fairly easily identified there are grey bar early vulgar pastas and noodles parboiled are converted rice although is a white rice is a desirable rice because they just steamed the odor kernels and some of the fiber is retained hence in the lower GI section the basmati rice the brown rice and couscous are all very good choices other choices would include sweet potato and yams and all of your leg use lentils chickpeas kidney beans split peas soya beans baked beans you'll notice in the medium section we have white potato new potato Yukon Gold red skin potatoes popcorn stone wheat thins ravidas different soups with black bean or green pea are very desirable in the higher GI food so things like baking potato arrested in particular french fries pretzels rice cakes and soda crackers are for the most part quite refined processed and lack the fiber so we'll enter the bloodstream a little quicker so high fiber foods more often really as a recommendation for the eating plan because they help keep you full longer giving you a sense of satisfaction portion control slows down the release of the carbohydrate into sugar in the blood and certainly has the ability to lower cholesterol levels an all-around win-win food choice flax also fits into the fiber it is an excellent source of omega-3 flax seeds offer you roughage flax meal ground flax releases the omega-3 which is highly recommended and of course flaxseed oil is a desirable oil to use but it does lock some of the fiber if you are then using flax meal or ground flax let your imagination add the flax to a variety of your food choices so if you have a low fiber cereal you might give some consideration to adding flax to now elevate it to a better level a reminder about Fox seed use it should be refrigerated in the fridge for 30 days four months in the refrigerator or a French freezer how to choose breakfast cereals the recommendation is to work with the following guidelines less than 8 grams of sugar per serving three or more grams of fiber mixing and matching circles is one way to get the best of cereal selections adding fiber as we just address ground flax flax seed and adding protein example omens are very desirable ways of adding good nutrition to your cereals of the dairy food group oops sorry whoops let's go back there we go up dairy we know that all animal foods has natural sugar called lock dose dairy contains carbohydrates proteins and fat good sources of vitamin D and calcium of your selections we have milk yogurt cheese's alternatives so considering that if you're choosing a milk for the benefit of your heart and for your waste management consider a lower fat milk and just to clarify if you're choosing a 1-percent or a two percent or even a skim milk remember that the lactose or the carbohydrate is the same in choosing yogurt your best yogurt is a plain yogurt to which you could be adding a fruit with a little bit of nutmeg vanilla or cinnamon to sweeten it your cheese's have a lower carbohydrate count good source of protein quality cheese's cheddar edem Gouda brick Mazzarella are good choices but be cautious of portion sizings as they have a lot of hidden fat the alternative dairies would include soya milk almond milks they can be altered in terms of sugar added so if a particular item readers on sweetens that would be a preferred choice if you're choosing a flavored almond or a soya product be cautious with the amount of sugar that's been added particularly if it's a mocha strawberry or vanilla flavour clearly with diabetes management limiting the added sugars and suites are desirable we know that these particular foods rapidly increase the blood sugars and I think all are familiar with examples of simple carbohydrates such as pop candies jams desserts cake ties I've given you a little indication here of a visual a teaspoon of sugar we round off to approximately five grams of carbohydrate so as the slide presents a 10 a pop a 719 milla pop and then the two-liter bottle will give you a good visual of how much sugar is actually included in these beverages to that I'd like you to give some consideration to the newly arrived to the market vitamin and mineral waters choosing ones that say 10 calories or calorie free would be desirable because many of the other ones are quite high in sugar count approximately 40 grams of carbohydrate per bottle of vitamin mineral water the energy drinks would also fit into this category as a fair amount of simple sugars carbohydrates that would rapidly increase the blood sugars in the interest of looking at labels for identifying your food items we have created some a standard label reading and I present to you a sampler of a box that reads at four crackers and I'd like to walk you through the information that label will provide you the calories are always listed first then the fat divided with the types of fats cholesterol sodium carbohydrate protein and then a variety of vitamins listed at the bottom so if your interest is in looking at the amount of fiber of a particular food you'll find it's easily labeled under the carbohydrate count quick review carbohydrate consists of three parts starch fiber sugar it is with those three parts that we come up with the total carbohydrate so if we come back to our cereal selections you have chosen to have a cereal look for the fiber look for three grams or higher so for example things like weetabix fitted wheat bran flakes bran buds grape nuts are some examples of quality higher fiber cereals regretfully cereals like Rice Krispies corn flakes and special k are very low in fiber and I think we would expect Froot Loops to be in that category as well on the other hand i'd like you to also focus on the sugar that's been added to these cereals so in the interest of choosing more nutritious cereals look for less sugar and the guideline is presented earlier was about 8 grams or less per serving would be very desirable and the fiber being higher than 3 grams comparing labels if there are labels to be had whether it be cereals or other food items the carbohydrate is clearly identified in both counts however having just discussed our interest in increasing intake of fiber choosing a food that has more fiber comparatively and a lower sugar is really ultimately what you want to be looking for the discussion about fiber particularly in this situation really if we address cereals again for a moment at the grocery store if you are standing in the cereal aisle if you focus on the top shelf of your cereals and the bottom shelf of your cereals that's where you'll find your most desirable cereals the eye-level cereals for the most part are refined processed and very often a higher sugar count so recapping the carbohydrates carbohydrates rise blood sugar in a good way choosing whole fruit / fruit juice is very desirable fiber another very important component adding it to your variety of meals choosing high fiber options as outlined in the previous slide of the glycemic index and the recommendation for adults is a minimum of 25 grams of fiber a day clearly limiting the amount of sweets and sugary foods and beverages are desirable for blood sugar control my next food group is protein protein slows or stabilizes or studies the rise in blood sugar these include animal foods fish poultry meat and eggs cheese and the plant proteins as legumes dry peas beans lentils soya tofu nut butters peanut butter almond butter seeds hemp hearts chia seeds sunflower seeds of the examples of your plant proteins it is very desirable to include a protein at each meal protein slows down digestion combined carbohydrates with protein choose lean cuts of meat for animal and remove visible fat where possible I'd like to expect you about the use of plant proteins as they are very desirable offer good fiber low in cholesterol low in fat and quite filling and nutritionally very sound so I list for you a website called pulse canada.com it will give you more information about the use of pulses how to prepare and a variety of recipes that I hope you will find inviting and will give a try to the third part of the food group are the facts they slow down digestion the slowing down however may sound desirable which gives you a feeling of fullness but consider that if you are having a high-fat meal you may find that your blood Sugar's will be high hours after you have eaten that food because of the slowing down of the digestion excess fat intake can raise your cholesterol you can also increase your weight so I'm invite you to really be attentive to the quantity of fat that you do use in your meal preparation if I may offer you a suggestion of three to six teaspoons of fat a day 2 to 3 tablespoons is very desirable we have three types of fat we have butter as I refer to a hard fat we have margarine as a soft fat and we have oil as a liquid fat we then have our trans fats that are either nashi occurring or that which the industry has produced our spreadable cheese is cream cheese sour cream cheese with would fit into the fat category regretfully not into the protein group limiting your high fat foods is very desirable remember though that fat does not increase blood sugar but has a high caloric count I think you're all familiar with some of the food that we're referring to here and they all taste so good limiting your fat intake to 2 to 3 tablespoons a day is very desirable and aiming for more plant fats over animal fats is also very desirable what do your portions look like and I'd like you to sort of take a moment and sort of look at your hands fists palms use that as your guide so for your vegetable selections your broccoli cauliflower etc consider one handful of vegetables or two as shown in the picture a closed fist would be an equivalent of a potato perhaps so our brown rice the meat portion the palm of a hand the thickness of your small finger would be a good starting point and for the men in the audience we may need to stretch that out of the full hand size festivals again the fistful and the teaspoon of fat consider the tip of your thumb as being a serving size with your eyes I'd like you to think about your plate serving we want to include the four food groups divide your plate with your eyes or you can actually buy plates that have divisions make half of your plate the vegetables the green salad the carrots the broccoli cauliflower kale spinach or cooked mixed vegetables make one third of your plate the grains and starches the high fiber brown rice the potato with skin or the sweet potato or the yam or a brown pasta demeanor alternatives a lean meat a lean chicken skinless fish strip loin lentils beans tofu would be very desirable food items and on the outside of your plate consider a small serving of fruit and a dairy serving to complete your meal another consideration in terms of meal planning is a timing of your meals eating three times a day or three meals per day is very desirable spacing your meals four to six hours apart again is encouraged the benefits of spreading your foods over the day help to control blood sugar provide a healthier weight and helps with portion control snacks may be beneficial and perhaps the snack will be based on do you need one do you want one do you have one again I would invite you to consider the spacing of your meals and consider snacks that would be very desirable and the portion control is clearly important choosing snacks if you are hungry again listening to your body cues to identify when full and when hungry choosing high-fiber snacks as illustrated in this particular slide the use of a small apple with some peanut butter would be quite desirable a protein and a complex carbohydrate another consideration might be popcorn with a handful of nuts or a wasa bread with a low-fat cheese or Moffat pepperoni or hummus and dipped vegetables balancing your carbohydrates is critical in meal planning and blood sugar control trying to aim for the same amount of carbohydrates at each meal this will help your bless your sugar stay steady we identified earlier that a serving with approximately 15 grams of carbohydrate equivalent to three teaspoons of sugar for the adult that is looking to reduce their weight it is desirable to consider 45 to 60 grams of carbohydrate per meal steam grams 230 grams of carbohydrate for snacks for the ladies in the group the 45 grams per meal is very desirable and for the gentleman in the group the 60 grams would be desirable so somewhere in between those two recommendations is very doable another consideration is the sodium in the meal plan sodium needs to be addressed for a number of reasons it certainly can lend itself to water retention which can hold back your success from weight control it can certainly affect weight control and it can increase your blood pressure and clearly we need to ensure that blood pressure is held at a good level with diabetes processed meats we know for the most part are very salty and the industry is really where the most salt has been added rather than the pinch of salt that you may be adding to your vegetable water if you're cooking vegetables or potato water convenience food we know are loaded with salt tasty but loaded condiments and sauces have their share of salt as well the consideration here is all about serving sizes and frequency of use here are some tips to shake off salt perhaps the first step is to give her the salt shaker at the table we do see amount that you do add in your food and in the cooking we need to remind that salt is salt it is a sodium derivative and this includes your sea salt your course your salt your red Himalayan salt they're all equivalent however the use of sea salt because of its flavoring in 10 c you tend to maybe use a little bit less until you'll hear people say sea salt is a better choice but it's really about using less that really matters experiment with herv's and spices to flavour up your foods spice it up perhaps you are familiar with the mrs dash the clubhouse the mccormick brand the vinegars lime or lemon are very desirable alternates to salt pepper flakes Cayenne the industry is trying to make a little bit stride in terms of lowering sodium in the food products that we consume so things like your lower salt Bragg season is listed there we have some of our bras that are lower sodium our soups canned soups in particular are very high in sodium and so there is a small attempt to lower the sodium but we still have a little ways to go so our snack foods you may find it are now a little more available in a lower sodium and again I invite you to look for the higher fiber baked typed chips when label reading for sodium look for the sodium level and if I can have you think of it as the street color or street lights consider the sodium of a 0 to 200 milligram count is a good level to work from the 200 to 400 milligrams sodium consider it to be give it some thought to how much you might be using and anything over 400 really should be limited red yellow and green the recommendations for per day for sodium for the general population is 2300 milligrams of sodium for diabetes care it is recommended that you limit your intake of sodium to 1500 milligrams of sodium per day on your label you will have a percent daily value it tells you if a food has a little or a lot of a specific nutrient so he can use it to compare two food items if the label reads as a daily value of five percent that tells you that it has a little if the daily value suggests fifteen percent or higher it means it has a lot and that may be very desirable if you're choosing foods for fiber if you're choosing foods with four salt then you would want to choose the smaller percentage so again in the middle of five percent to fifteen percent is desirable if you choose to work with a daily percent of value again comparing to soup labels on the left hand side we have a sodium count of 660 milligrams percent milligrams and a twenty-eight percent daily value clearly higher than the fifteen percent we just talked about in the number itself over 400 on the right hand side we have a lower sodium version at 50 milligrams and only a two percent daily value so do you make your labels work for you in the interest of really reducing your intake of sugar salt and fat it is a very desirable to get back to home basics to home cooking that way you can control what has been added to the foods that you eat if we look at the processing of our foods and how it increases our salt I've give you an example here of your fresh cucumber half a dozen slices of very low in sodium about two milligrams cucumber salad with dressing it now upset to 234 milligram and once we reach it to the dill pickle stage we're looking at a whopping 928 milligrams the fresh chicken breast very desirable in sodium once it's prepared star bought into a frozen pot pie again that count Ray's is considerably and of course once we get into the fast foods without surprise the count really flares up to over the two thousand mark the use of lemon or lime is a very desirable food item being cautious with the use of soya sauce as you see indicated there a tablespoon is consumed early high in sodium and we just had addressed about the table salt a teaspoon is approximately 2300 milligrams of sodium pork versus bacon versus ham I think it's fairly self-explanatory with a very low count in pork a bit higher in the bacon and of course the ham will have a high count in the types of fats we come back to our fat for a moment we have our saturated the hard stats the butter of the coconut oil the animal fat we have the unsaturated fats the liquid fats the oils and non-hydrogenated margins and then we have the ongoing debate of butter versus margarine for the purpose of this evenings discussion I would like to give consideration to the fact that all of them contain the same amount of carbon five calories and i invite you to really be cautious with the serving size that you do because it does really add flavor to your foods this particular comparison of dietary fats is available for you if you have not already done so you can download the CD a calendar that comes out yearly and on the back page of it has this comparison of dietary fats and just for color coding purposes we've listed canola safflower flax sunflower corn all of soya peanut coconut oil lard palm and butter and coconut the red is the saturated component the blue is the polyunsaturated the mono and saturates are the yellow for simplicity I'd like you to just focus on the oils that have the least amount of red saturated choosing the oils that have the most of the model which is the yellow so looking at the comparison you'll see how safflower oil is seventy-seven percent mono which is very desirable followed by olive oil then canola and then tea oil cholesterol sources in the interest of addressing cholesterol and lipids which is a very important part of diabetes care just a reminder that cholesterol eighty percent of our cholesterol is made by the liver twenty percent from the foods that we eat that are of animal origin in the interest of updating the egg yolk fagor three egg yolks a week are desirable on a low cholesterol plan the use of shellfish should be limited to one serving a week and the organ meats again should be limited the biggest impact on blood sugar control is the fat aim for 200 milligrams of cholesterol a day example an egg yolk is 300 milligrams so again if you limit your intake of jokes that would be very desirable we have two types of fat that we'd like to address the LDL we refer to as the lousy cholesterol which deposits the fat into our arteries versus the HDL which is the happy cholesterol so in your lipid profile we encourage you to have lesser fat so that you have less LDL or the lousy cholesterol allowing for the happy cholesterol how does decrease cholesterol how do you lower the LDL and how do you rate the HDL we've just had a conversation about choosing lower fat foods limiting saturated fats limit food sources of cholesterol choosing high-fiber foods that we address very earlier in the session and clearly increasing physical activity are all desirable ways to lower cholesterol if these lifestyle changes are not sufficient than medication may be required if I take an opportunity to take this whole theory and perhaps put into practice and i've called it meal makeovers the left-hand column will give you some ideas of food choices and how you can improve that food choices and how so if we start off with raisin bran which may be a serial choice for breakfast or snack consider two things the raisins of raisins brand are sugar-coated so now you're getting a little bit more sugar if you chose to go with a brand flake and added high-fiber berries you've increased the fiber you've actually lowered these simple sugars the use of oatmeal with nuts or hemp seeds would be also very desirable improved choice for cereal so choosing again a high-fiber cereal is very desirable low in sugar cinnamon is an excellent way to add flavor without adding additional calories or carbohydrates but good flavor adding nuts egg 10 parts to the oatmeal for added protein is again very desirable if your morning breakfast consists of white toast with butter and jam consider a whole grain whole-wheat toast with PB peanut butter and banana slices use peanut butter on toast yogurt and smoothies rather than having an orange juice for breakfast just as with your toes consider the whole or a smoothie smoothie should really consist of whole fruit it's abuse adding protein is a very desirable way adding flax to the smoothies for added fiber and omega-3 is a very desirable way of improving your food choice if you currently are using egg and bacon bagel you might want to consider an open-faced breakfast sandwich with over easy egg and roasted vegetables portion control cook eggs in a variety of ways ham and veggie frittata adding more vegetables as good fiber low carbohydrate if lunch consists maybe of chicken fingers and fries consider a chicken or a tuna pita sandwich with lettuce and tomatoes veggies and hummus dip lean meats roasted chicken or fish for sandwiches vegetables with hummus dip instead on the side of fries that a fries perhaps the natural platter is what is a small snack but consider that a vegetable or beef chili a whole wheat bun or a chicken taco salad would be a very desirable choice of a makeover adding more beans and lentils to your salads with protein as a main dish if you're through choice is a chow mein noodle consider a tofu and vegetable stir-fry with a rice a quick veggie fry with brown wild or long grain rice a quinoa a barley or a noodle adding to a food place of meat would be another alternative the hamburger and fries you might want to consider a single patty rather than a double patty with a whole wheat bun or a small steak with roasted yam potato and a spinach salad lean meats a baked or roasted potato and we certainly encourage you to have at least one dark green vegetable a day another menu suggestion might be a creamy alfredo penny consider a whole wheat penne pasta with roasted veggies with tomato sauce a tomato-based sauce or a low-fat light cream sauce we give you far less fat add your favorite festivals to bulk up your pasta sauce use a whole wheat pasta giving you more fiber more nutrition more fullness takeout consider a homemade pizza or ask for a whole-wheat crust and more takeout pizza places are providing that demand homemade is always tastier healthier and load up with a variety of your vegetable toppings eating at regular times if we recap some of the recommendations that we have been addressing it's very very desirable choosing a variety of foods of all the food groups is really the goal limiting sugars and sweets we do see the amount of fat including foods high in fiber limiting salt and remember that checking your blood glucose before and two hours after a meal it's the best way to know how your body has handled that meal some of your resources your diabetes see a website offers under your recipe section click on the diabetes in you and there's about 25 recipes that have been nicely listed there that you can certainly access and download for more ideas on healthy eating download a free copy of your healthy living calendar at the same website diabetes dot CA I thank you for your time I wish you healthy eating and I'm happy to take questions from the participants great thank you so much for us so informative a whole hour there I find it there so educational late they kind of serve as a wake-up call plus a review + education kind of all in one there so a question from aisha should i want to know how people adapt when diabetic diets myths are explored oh I guess so how the driving guided is how people adapt when the diabetic diet myths are explored I guess once you kind of talk about them and educate them on it sure well I think it comes with you know and a desire to embrace on how you can change some of the food that you do take and um I think people feel very satisfied that they know that they can maybe fit in a few of me like for example the the sugars in foods or choosing higher fiber foods so i think it is desirable and I certainly encourage people to really work with their team with their educators attend sessions whether it be the one that we did here or just coming to your educator and really getting the best out of life by seeing your dives educator nurse and dietitian team and doctor I think that's so it is it's a work in progress and one needs just kind of come at it with and this is why I choose not to work with the word diet but more as a meal plan and choices that you make mm-hmm great and we have a next question which is how many protein is in sunflower seeds oh how much programs attrition after certainly if I'm walking right i actually think i have a thing of sunflower seeds right here in my cupboard i do oh so you're obviously a horse let's see what i got here in a quarter cup we're looking at seven grams of protein fair enough you beat me to it I'm sick at it on my book so seven grams of protein is the answer for the sunflower seeds mm-hmm that's the equivalent of an egg white is it yeah okay good to know yeah yeah because I never thought of it in that conversion conversion sense I guess you know certainly Nelly the quality of the protein will vary a little bit because the sunflower seeds are a plant base and the egg is a protein-based right and a base but suffice to say that it is a good quality protein all the same subject if I could just add about eggs so if they use the flax meal or ground flax if you take a couple of tablespoons of ground flax mix about three tablespoons of lukewarm water and let it sit for a couple of minutes you'll see how it starts to gelatin eyes and you can use that flock sorry I've had a bunch of traffic outside my window here ok the next one furman cherry is as olive oil recommended to consume and to cook with all of all the very desirable oil to use however it is recommended because it does not have a high heat heating point or you know just told us if heat it is recommend that you not heat olive oil do you serve it sort of as a drizzle cold would be preferred because it doesn't have a high tolerance of heat okay what are some other ones recommended I know you mentioned some in a little oil is a very desirable oil for a stir-fry because it is heat tolerant um the use of canola oil is a moderate and that not to get a very desirable one but the peanut oil would be more for the mr. fry hot really hot uses ring yeah and I'm guessing that also affects the taste right a little the tasty are there and now with the new technologies that we have in the kitchen gadgets some participants may be familiar with the active fry we just add one tablespoon of oil to fry us in that they are excellent what an excellent some just yet and sweet potato fries are excellent in that actor fry great the next one is from a Dale and iris got a lot of good questions here should you eat every meal on time even if you do not feel hungry the timing of the meal certainly should be within a four to six hour interval the hunger part is you know if there really is I am not hungry you know delaying the meal by an hour it's fine but just having a little something even a half a cup of milk or half a glass of or half a glass of milk a half a cup of year with a couple of crackers it's probably desirable but if there really is no appetite no hunger we have to explore what's really going on maybe we need to increase the activity a little bit but you need to need to appetite too and individuals have to identify that point of which what's the hunger in and what's the need to eat right mhm fullness mmhmm yeah question from John on the subject of pasta should only be holy as here but holy whole weight is a desirable choice although the question may be lending itself to alternate passes that are gluten free so the ones that are quinoa flax and maybe a corn base the problem with pasta for the most part is you need you know a lot to feel fuller so clearly choosing a whole wheat pasta is to your advantage because two things that either will happen if you're not fond of a whole wheat pasta maybe you'll eat a little less which is good portion control the whole wheat patch will give you more nutrition more fiber and will enter the bloodstream at a slower rate so that is desirable grid message from gary here question as a high-fiber cereal benefit offset by adding milk and fruits of lactose and fructose um the higher the fiber the cereal certainly for example in all brands still with 17 grams of fiber so the amount of milk that you add your Cyril if you just float your cereal it might only be you know a quarter of a cup or but if you think you're sterile you might be looking at two cups so it's really relevant to how much milk you're actually putting on and because milk has added protein you're not putting in just carbohydrate right the choice the throat should be small serving a fruit and it should be a high-fiber fruit mm-hmm a very arbol you know or sliced apples would be more desirable than an apple sauce that has a lot of a fiber removed mm-hmm great and this list and Peggy and disa comment eating oatmeal or pasta shoots up her blood sugar and then I remember in the presentation she said that you recommend them they are very desirable foods the problem though is maybe the type of oatmeal so consider steel cut oatmeal as the preferred choice compared them to the large flakes would be the next stop being very careful for the instant of type of ready to serve oatmeal's in that particular situation if oatmeal or cereals are driving the blood Sugar's perhaps you need to look at adding more fiber or clearly adding protein at that breakfast meal so be at the hemp hearts the chia seeds adding an alternate animal protein a peanut butter a flax may be desirable and so sometimes we have to problem solve a little bit with the use of certain cereals and seeing what can be added and combined if it doesn't work at a particular meal of the day than perhaps position cereals in a more active time of the day and see if that's more desirable hmm now the question from Elsa so what do you think of the very low-carb bootcamp diets in the book the diabetes miracle in which you limit your carbohydrates for about seven weeks brightened up you know anything less than 100 grams of carbohydrate a day is as low as really should go you know just just for sanity more than anything people will push the limit and there is some merit to it I think the idea is to really choose and work towards a goal that you can sustain and not just a marathon run kick starting with a lower carbohydrate he died is really what it as a starting point clearly but we need to have a clear understanding that we want to sustain well past the seven weeks and the choice of carbohydrate matters it isn't just about counting a number to come up with that low end of a hundred grand it's really about choosing complex carbohydrates and bush oh good another one from Michael I've heard that as a diabetic I should avoid bananas due to natural sugars is this a truth or is it okay in moderation moderation is it certainly the key here and just for description purposes appreciate that bananas are one hundred percent carbohydrate with very little water content a three-inch banana is ten grams of carbohydrate or two spoons of sugar a six-inch banana is four and a 8-inch banana is six teaspoons of sugar mo you need to position bananas in a in a meal plan that's going to be desirable and matched with an activity so if today's an active day bananas maybe the data use them if today is a sedentary sit at the computer day that may not be in your best interest to be using bananas but they do offer good vitamin mineral fiber count if you're trying to reduce your weight be careful with your intake of bananas mmhmm yeah I've definitely heard that before yeah you need to move more and eat a little less oh good another question here how much trans fat is desirable well we're looking in terms of on the label first off if you look anything less than seven percent on the daily value is a good starting point to suggest that you know zero trans or trans fat baby the amount of mean there are nashi occurring trans fats and meat fat so we're looking more at the what's added to the food items so thinking about the baked items the snack foods that's really so the lower the better so look for the percent daily value and look for where it says you know anything less than seven percent is desirable and I'm point were the easiest ways to answer that question otherwise it gets a little more complicated in terms of grams based on the way that versus unsaturated and all that approach mm-hmm great and next we hear from patty have you heard about the weight wise program the weight wise program well perhaps not in the context that the individual is asking but you know weight wise means two things you know losing weight appropriately or weighing your foods to lose weight or I'm not sure that I'm reading that question okay well maybe we can get a clarification in the question part there it's a it's a way wise is that what it's called or wait your eyes weight-wise way twice so I suspect that it probably has some good mirror I'm not familiar just as is if it's a book or but I yes you said yes wait was yeah it certainly has its title suggests that it has some good merit but I'm not just off the top I'm not quite familiar with all the particulars of it mm-hmm I can certainly find out okay great palma nova again the next one here from Patricia did I hear you correctly to choose heroes on the top and bottom shelves in the grocery store all the cereals that was correct just to sort of simplify the selection of steroids if you go to the top shelf or the bottom shelf of the cereal aisle you're like better choices mm-hmm it's all about advertising in the middle I all right the france-based that it's all about marketing you bet mm-hmm I'm just coming up here with a weight wise clinic program classes so like this is happening at the Royal Alec white white clinic royal Alec in Edmonton Alberta I don't know though indigent I'm not sure that that's what they're referring to yes you did say it's in Edmonton now if that is the case there is a wait why'd adult management clinic it's a surgical intervention for weight management it's a bariatric specialty clinic that may be what they're referring to that's a whole different the clinic involves behavior modification counseling for nutrition drugs treatment and/or surgical treatment for obesity and coordinating care and transitioning patient back family physician we're certainly are observing a lot of good success with bariatric surgery in diabetes management so there is some indication that this works well but it's a whole clinic and it's a whole educational component and clearly number one is about behavior modification it speaks to the whole aspect of staying dehydrated eating regularly stop eating when full know when your limits in terms of hunger or appetite satiety so it's if that's what the individual is referring to that's what that program is about and certainly has some very good merit and I mean Alberta and clear that the Royal Alec that's my alma mater so the next one and some Angus um can you please talk about the effect of a beer or glass of wine well a beer is the equivalent of 15 grams of carbohydrates three spoons of sugar so it has a carbohydrate value to it and if we do a comparison of a glass of milk eight ounces of blossom milk is three grams of carbohydrate with 15 or three teaspoons of sugar with 15 grams of carbohydrate please do not interchange carbohydrate beer for carbohydrate in milk the difference right so we're not inviting you to have beer on your cornflakes right the challenge was here or any alcohol so if it is a beer choice a lower carb may be very desirable a Canadian 67 for example is two grams of carb compared to a regular beer of 15 making it a lower calorie count of only 67 calories versus 150 for regular beer if choosing wine a four ounce glass of red or dry wine would be certainly desirable and the use of a gin vodka rum or whiskey if it says bounce what's an a half would be a very low carb the challenge with alcohol is really about moderation one to two drinks a day no saving up is really portion and eat working it into the plan and make it so you have some food to go with it and then the beer nuts with the beer but you know really making better choices is really to your advantage you'll be very cautious the one challenge with alcohol it's again volume related but it can have a delayed low blood sugar effect and so you need to really be attentive to that in terms of playing havoc with blood sugar control mm-hmm weight management and and no it's a trigger for triglycerides as well it can elevate your triglyceride levels got it okay let's see the next one here there's two questions and cook or kind of comments with coconut oil that some Peggy red coconut oil is supposed to be good for us now and then there's another question on the use of organic coconut oil the coconut oil is a really hot topic right now and a challenge is when we look at the makeup on the chart that I presented in the slide it does show it as 91% on a scale of 1 to 100 as a saturated fat the current thought is if it's a cold-pressed prepared oil then it seems to be a little more desirable because it doesn't here to the vessels of the body so that's kind of what gives it merit the fact still remains though that it is a fat source and one needs to be still attentive to the amount of food that you do take in or the quantity that you do take in so going back to the recommendation of 2 to 3 tablespoons of fat per oil if coconut is being used and if you're using whether it be the organic which by the way or again it doesn't always make it a healthier choice it's Nealon a high fat one at that mm-hmm okay and another oil how does palm oil rate yeah it's a high saturated fat not quite as high as the the carpet of the coconut oil but certainly fits into that category so again you want to be you know careful with the choice of palm oils and it's one of those trans fats right and if you used quite extensively in our baked products and items and so you want to make use of less of those items if possible and I'm just going back to our slide where I gave you that indicator your palm wall is 51 person compared to ninety-one percent for coconut oil I said the military probably increases right a little bit it's a little bit fuzzy but I you know it's just getting it captured in the right way but I think you folks can go to download that calendar they'll have a beautiful eight and a half by eleven side painting of the comparison of dietary fat any tips on remember depends went on a busy schedule okay try again I didn't hear the complete question we get any tips on remembering on a busy schedule oh this is scheduled well the technology is upon us watch with a reminder for iPad or your iPhone I think it's just missing the dietitian in the eye in the technology here that sort of says reminder beep beep would be you know there's all kinds of tricks to remind yourself but I think having the tool that your fingertips is probably a very good reminder and so that would be to suggestions right there in the interest of busy schedules don't let busyness take over your diabetes care you need to take charge it's an important so find ways to try and if monday through friday on a work day doesn't work make time to text check blood sugars on alternate times that you don't on the weekdays now this particular comment may not be applicable to those of you on insulin and adjusting and that type of thing i'm just giving us a general guide some of the tips you know how to remember to test but i think the the watch and the paper in your eyes in your iphone might be very desirable yeah there's a lot of alarms and gets we have now that we can use Oh a lot for sure you watch even absolutely that would be very if I could just come back to the way twice what comes up there's another program on here that's just called you know weight wise and that's just a website a generic website that lets you healthy eating getting physical ask dietitian options for support newsletter so you can obviously that's another almost like a website mm-hmm though depends on how the question came up at the weight wise if that was truly about the bariatric surgery or if it was on its website where you can sign up and track your your food intake your physical activity calculate looks it looks like petty she just wrote back that she did have the surgery ok industry in the comments it helps you with the life-changing things there so it really really helped dad yeah good because this particular weight wise is the british dietetic association got a gout so depending on the in title but a different reference mm-hmm and then Peggy just a comment and she wasn't able to lose weight following the CD a recommended meal plan but was able to do so when she restricted her bread pasta rice potatoes and other like carbohydrates absolutely everyone you know ability to lose weight will vary control of carbohydrates is it's really key in all of this increasing activity is also the other components equally equally important that we need to give some and you know portion control is really what matters sometimes the use of potatoes and pastures it's hard to reduce them to a smaller portions so when you're really trying to be successful in your weight management the comfort foods sometimes are the ones that you need to sort of reduce or just really kind of substitute them with alternates and you will use cesses but clearly exercise is important and setting some smart goals you know in terms of just measurable and attainable realistic goals and you know timewise in order to be successful or are very very important as well great and just doing a quick scan of the chat because I know there's some questions in here is it true that the liver releases glycogen approximately every five hours give or take and sort of that time that's very and we find that the in times when you're not eating that's when the liver will release the glycogen right so often what you'll observe is you go to bed at night and your blood Sugar's maybe in a desirable range and when you wake up in the morning because it often is a longer than a five-hour static time that's when you'll have the release of the deliver the sugar from the liver because it's a longer time okay and if anybody else are so I'm just reading to the chest but if anybody else has any questions if you want to write them in the queue a pod because they stream really nicely and then I could just take a look at them there I started doing 11 quick post I think I saw one more question in here I'll just wait another couple seconds to if there's any other questions that come in and feed through here yeah there's another one on coconut or and there's some people asking just about the presentation so this is being recorded the audio and then the presentation so when the Diabetes Association gets it up on whatever the website or the place we're going to stored they'll send out an email so everybody can access it okay yes and I see you put up your information here there's a couple people who are asking about the PowerPoint slides aha well for the right price I just might well actually they now have become property of the CDA so you know at best i'm happy i purposely put my home email for the benefit of the audience there because you know certainly addressing this from a work perspective may become a little bit problematic to we had so many attendance today I'm so delighted at the numbers Anna is great yeah you know I'm happy to send them out i mean if i get some you know requests out that's I'm okay to do that as well if not what can also be I think when it's posted onto the website can there be in attachment with the slice you have as well that's what I'm going to look into so once you guys get the link out I'm also going to just type in the diabetes by email it's info bc-ad diabetes at CA so if anything wasn't addressed to or yet any further questions you can definitely email them out over here great and to do a last scan of questions I covered the basics some but I've covered a little bit of everything didn't Lee mm-hmm eating is mentally hello everyone and we wanted to enjoy your food we want you to choose foods that are appealing that have mels texture you know digestibility it's not about dieting it's really about healthy eating and managing blood sugars and keeping well give you me into just being healthy I have another question here how many apples oranges bananas per day is recommended about two to three servings of fruit so if you choose to make them all oranges there's your answer you know if you make them a variety of one orange one apple one pair or berries so you know two to three servings of fruit are desirable start with that mm-hmm very often you like fruit and I'll give it another little if fruit is really something that you tend to over indulge in consider freezing fruit in particular grapes for example that they really can give you a nice satisfying sweetness without over indulging it's quite remarkable how you might find is you can only eat 10 frozen grapes but you might be able to out of F a bag in a sitting if they sit right beside you yeah yeah really enhance the sugar and really satisfy you with a smaller amount and what are the things for example juicing I was at a juicer last month the courage juice emits as they use in foods and that not David but I always wonder you know if I'd use very arrivals use the caution with juicing is if the extractor extracts the fiber then you really lose out on a lot of the merit that we've talked about in terms of yeah that's the first consideration that really the fiber should be retained the second iteration is what the juice items are so if it's primarily the low carb vegetables like the kale celery spinach if eighty percent of the juicing is the low carb of vegetables and that's very desirable with twenty percent of fruit then I'm that's a good combination right but if you're juicing let's say carrots for example and the fiber is being extracted and not being retained then you're getting a fair amount of concentrated our bhai jaise coming in and I'm attic for shooting up the blood sugar or spiking again yeah and I've also heard related to that they say to eat the fruit and juice the vegetables because of fiber like you're just just mentioning either way I mean certainly eaten the fruit is more like I said I still eat the fruit but I you know if you're kind of a mix of both so that's for sure you the food will give you just that much more fiber you know what exercises you're chewing and slows down hopefully the rate at which you eat but yeah that's very it's all about fiber mm-hmm assume an intestinal gut will will manage some you know they're not overextended a sincere thanks a lot and what do you think about low carbon high fat and high protein for managing diabetes think one has to be a little careful with the duration of that menu planning aspect and when I say generation I don't I don't mean a weekend sort of so the question I think relates a little bit to the app concise ended use of high proteins and high-fat can lend itself to an undesirable amount of things happening I mean certainly can raise cholesterol for some folks like the LDL cholesterol my protein diet can play havoc with kidney function and we're talking extended period of time here you know there's a number of things that can occur so really it's about balancing you're looking for a sustained plan and not just a hit miss type of meal plan and if people are struggling with food planning and in you know just with weight control then because they're increasing the activity that's a really important part of this too mm-hmm I can yet a question about the CDA calendar and maybe because I think you discuss the calendar thank you I did yeah the calendar is you can download it from the website at the diabetes dogwood CA there one of my last slide yeah when I laugh with a donor oh so you can download them in black or white or perhaps your local branch if you happen to be close to one they may still have some yep but it's a very nicely laid out calendar excellent recipes good tips and it's a really it's a review of what tonight's presentation as you know I'll follow up over and above the slides a another question here I've been told to drink I think it is key for a kafir milk to help sleep what is good oh oh you know heating milk has long been thought as a sleep enhancer does it activates the protein the tip to fan eating the kefir it's probably more to do with the protein component of it rather than you know Nelly I'm not aware that it is necessarily a sleep inducer but it certainly is desirable to consume because it is a healthy choice it's low in carbohydrate and has good quality protein so sometimes for for nighttime snacking that's very desirable mm-hmm but of 11 approach to that but ok so just that just winding down the questions here just kind of going through them to make sure I haven't missed anything so Kieffer for sleep right I think with the question mm-hmm for sleep problems so that might be this is taken from the sleep center of sleep center yeah I think it's desirable I mean there's no disadvantages to using it mm-hmm but I'm not sure that we have a clear understanding of sort of what it actually list the protein one this was a heated key for right so i think it's again to activate the protein you know contains that fat jon wolf all right and i have mary's question here sorry Mary your I see you a question here but I cut off on my screen size missing the last little bit of it if you are gluten-free and diabetic the carpet or double is compared to the lead based counterpart it's a satisfactory to cut the grains in half to stay on track with calories and carbs or my suggesting limited the number of servings that a healthy choice have developed a week sensitivity and this is on the option for me ah patient with gluten free grains is that one they lack fiber and they're low in iron okay so what has to give some consideration that their digestibility and their absorbability is quite different and so very often if you do have celiac and diabetes we need to really monitor the quantity of these alternate grades that you do use and obviously we need to find ways and flax is a very excellent way of adding some fiber to these grains or substituting them with an almond flour as an alternative for baking or using it as a grain but that isn't one consideration because they are lower in fiber yeah great thank you so much I think we've wrapped up the questions I just have some closing slides if anybody has anything else just feel free to type in the middle I address that so just again I want to thank you I would thank everybody for participating here coming to join our session and I think you reach for

everybody for joining us i look forward to seeing you on the next one happy eating Bon Appetit everyone thank you near bye for now bye", "4lLn0PhkakM": "[Music] [Music] hey guys mr. and mrs. Smith here and today we're going to be reviewing the heavy hitters cannabis infused gummies we have strawberry pineapple to try today we're actually very excited to try these uh if you don't know already heavy-hitters is possibly our favorite brand I would definitely say I would say it's also primarily smoke heavy hitters for our everyday cartridge and then when we want to like it up a little bit we'll grab some other stuff but heavy hitters is definitely always on a cartridge for us so we're also going to be trying the heavy hares GSC I say trying we've had it many times but we haven't been able to find it for a while not what you are it kind of it kind of went out of stock just weird it used to be available a lot in like 2018 but it kind of just fell out of favor except for certain places would still carry a guy in town by our main delivery service was no longer carrying it but they had it the other day so I had to pick it up cause it's been too long it seems like they almost haven't had it in stock since the name change so JSC used to be Girl Scout cookies I don't know if they changed it in others stances I'm pretty sure it was part of the laws that happened I'm pretty sure it's part of the laws that happened in 2018 for California that's they weren't allowed to call it they can't call it candy I believe they can't use the term candy and they can't use the term anything that could be marketed yes towards children can't market towards children right Paul any so that's why it says gummies or it'll always seem medical or cannabis like that they never never make yeah that would be appealing to a child exactly it can't be bears or anything like that so I mean it's a good law honestly I totally understand why there's some other laws that happened in 2018 which I will give you a refresher on right now now there was some weird stuff that happened when California passed a recreational marijuana back in 2018 I believe it was one of the things that happen is towards the middle of the year they actually switched it to where edibles could no longer contain more than a hundred milligrams per package now if you work in the medical marijuana industry or if you were a user or anything like that prior you know that there used to be packages up to a thousand milligrams in just one treat and what that used to be really good at is you could like just take a nibble off of a treat throughout the day and just kind of keep yourself dosed and medicated off one treat for a whole week basically but they changed it because there were way too many people who would come into a dispensary have no idea what they were doing by one of those really high potency edibles eat the whole thing and then they have a really bad time and end up going to the emergency room they got sick of dealing with that so they made a law saying you can't have more than a hundred milligrams per package there are certain things you can get around that such as cannabutter tinctures and pills those three items you can definitely get in higher doses than 100 milligrams but for edibles and then kind of cookie or anything like that max you're gonna get in a package is about a hundred so today we're reviewing B's from heavy hitters and the way they went about with these twenty milligrams per piece is you can actually rip the pieces in half so it's actually two servings per piece so it actually comes in two to ten milligram servings which I'm pretty sure is the law is that each piece inside a package can only be ten milligrams or something like that I know five to ten milligrams is a state recommended serving I'm not a hundred percent clear on the laws but it's just an unfortunate thing that happened with edibles in 2018 but I am absolutely dying to try these guns so let's go ahead and open up to the [ __ ] strawberry cuz I'm Joey it's been it's been a long time looking for out that let me grab the a7 r3 with the 70s [Music] [Music] yeah we just won't have us we won't help you all this video it's just not working at the moment six and a half hours Nathan I might open the pineapple real quick to maybe these do not open well I feel like we should show just how much of a struggle these were to open just like a montage of the [ __ ] difficulty this is bad this one opened much easier but that first package it just ripped in such a way that it was really hard to open but this is just like the other one has a really strong smell I figured it's it's really strong artificial pineapple mmm it's it's kind of a a bit herbal but not like too herbal it's not like overly pungent or anything like that like you're not gonna have you're not gonna get in trouble they're just keeping these in your drawer or anything like that like no one's gonna smell it yeah I don't know if this has any actual like pineapple juice or anything in it it doesn't have it listed on the ingredients mm-hmm so we're not sure if this is artificial flavoring or real bad no artificial actual coloring and flavor so is that natural flavors that display really use the natural coloring and flavor like or is it a flavor that's kind of that's kind of weird I don't know if I feel someone from heavy Harry's modified food yeah I don't mind it I mean that's just what I mean the people are heavy hitters you might want to put that it is natural flavoring as well like actually specified natural color and natural flavoring because natural color and flavoring just sounds a bit odd it's it leaves it up to the imagination as to is the flavoring also natural or just natural color you're always a nice flavoring this yeah always alright so let's try the pineapple yeah I'm gonna do a full 20 but I'm gonna show the camera how it splits so this is the gummies from heavy-hitters it's a square and if you look very carefully there's this little seam in the middle that if you pull whoops it starts to come apart yes it does if you start to pull it comes apart very nicely into two perfectly even ten milligram pieces so let's start well I'm actually just gonna eat the whole thing at once wait so where's our list of like criteria so I know what the hell I'm supposed to be doing bring it up go on top down your mouth and just roll around a little okay yeah my hands are all sticky now you know I gotta say I'm a little disappointed I'm a little underwhelmed actually I had I had much higher hopes it could just be the pineapple yeah because I mean the strawberry definitely smells better than the pineapple the pineapple is a little strong it's kind of it's very herbal forward which isn't a bad thing a lot of people enjoy that it's not a bad flavor necessarily but it is definitely herbal forward if you're looking for something that you could just totally mound shun and forget that there's weed in it not that we recommend it's not gonna be that yeah definitely don't recommend that but I mean like if you're if you're a fan of someone who like Eric or someone who likes really really flavorful very liked gummies that don't aren't bitter or plant alike at all this is not for you this is made to be strong and to be potent and it definitely tastes like it so keep that in mind and next up we have the strawberry so let's go ahead and pop these open and yeah will rate them in a second let's try the strawberry and I want to go ahead and split this one yeah because there'll be 30 milligrams each mmm much better much better mm-hmm all right strawberry is actually really good um I would say it's definitely pretty it is still has that herbal flavor but um let me bring up the criteria so we can actually start to break these down aftertaste yeah yeah really bad yeah I would say it's a bit odd I I'm almost feeling a little bit um disappointed I know me too it which it sucks because I'm such a fan of their oils but that's where comes in would we be as disappointed if we hadn't hyping it up so much yeah we did we we've also we've held on to these for about two weeks we've been waiting and waiting and waiting to try these specifically for the on camera experience and you know I think that also kind of built it up the fact that we've been we've been like dying sitting on me dying to try them the whole time and I mean they're they're good [ __ ] effects for sure by new user mm-hmm will probably like would probably really like it however its strong grams each heavy hitters recommends 10 milligrams as a dose the state of California recommends that california recommends that I personally have very low tolerance when it comes to most things so if you're like me I would definitely recommend starting with 5 milligrams when it comes to edibles but I mean you've been doing it you've been using medical using marijuana medically for two years yes so her tolerance is pretty high so we can handle the 30 we just say no problem but the big thing is though from let's let's go ahead and actually break this down but the main thing that I'm getting from these is but from trying both of them it is quite herbal forward the the flavor is there the strawberry is much sweeter and more flavorful I would say than the pineapple pineapple is a little more herbal forward as well but let's actually start talking about our rating categories here and give these are actually solid score each [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] we're also gonna open this GSC previously known as Girl Scout cookies for those of you have been in the game a little longer and actually know the OG strings we're gonna be trying that card out today so anyways hope to catch you all later and see you in the next video like and subscribe [Music]", "rBdpAcezqWU": "this did this experiment underway then shall we yes my experiment is complete what a fine specimen you have here [Music] hello guys welcome back to another of the review bros I'm Aaron I'm Craig and together we're bringing you something hype so you all want to know what the results are off it comes in the form of this fine specimen right here we are very very excited to give this one to you guys to strap in stay tuned to watch along and please do hit the subscribe button like the video let us know if you've tried this or there of a pre-workout go [ __ ] yourself which will be reviewing so shortly stay tuned it moves us nicely into taste the mixer belly we've got alien pot sounds nice right who actually knows what alien pop tastes like and probably not many of us alien farts also comes in another flavor which we believe is newer and that is molecular candy or her again who knows I've sound nice to be fair you know despite not really now what they're going to taste like let's do it dead flat scoop gets you that serve inside something very meticulous and wine it because one certain ingredient that we will not mention at this early stage or say is triple smells nice yeah what does it smell like look like alien way yeah maybe that's what it is I in pop mixability looks pretty good yeah it's tiny tiny little bits but we're talking small yeah yeah not bad though not bad at all let's alien pop have a pop let's do it I need pop going down the hatchet lemony aftertaste not bad probably more boring than I was expecting if anything I think what reminds me I'm tasting mostly lemon lemon and drop yeah Lemon Drop driver essentially lemon and lime maybe pushing on it mm-hmm he's got luck in the ice slowly like a lemon ice lollies as the picture which you could argue yeah does taste like that yeah I'd be great hmm which the lemon and lime one in it oh yeah there you go then I'm thinking I'm gonna count it for you yeah three two one I am it made me like it more looking at the ice lolly barking I'm happy to go up to that egg because it has mixed extremely well and it is not bad at all nice on the sweetness level no sourness to it it's not on pain a nice not too much it actually tastes quite like a fresh juice almost and the other flavor sounds nice as well so I am you want to know where to get hold of this fine specimen well we'll tell you you go to a klaxon comm where you'll find this for $49.99 US dollars Oh oh my god that sounds bad but no it doesn't because we've got a 20 percent discount code review bros capital R capital B brings it down to $39.99 US dollars much more acceptable right absolutely and the important part to mention is one of these 4221 servants obviously for the consistency of this channel we're going to be reviewing it on that all the screen which is what the majority of you are gonna want so it's 21 service is an expensive product premium product you could say and I'd really like the marketing straight up or to your pain but quite a lot for this yeah so bear that in mind I'll tell you that works out with our discount code included Oh dollar and ninety cents serving now that or not consistent price and scale works out at a six out of ten actually not bad it does just scrape into that thing so bear that in mind UK guys you can't currently get this at the time we're filming it however predator nutrition look like they're taking it on too soon it's it on the website coming soon so it costs us over here 30 pounds of 86 pence great British sterling or a pound of 40 Stepanek serve so again that's the exact n-space consistent they're straight translation from their Glaxo website so we may like we're not accounting for the ship in you know the customs are predatory nutrition or any other distributor might take on my guess is they'll sell this for at least a five or we'd quit yeah I think so that's but on his trade side six out of ten how does the label come together label time guys and as you know we'll be running on that maximum serving which comes in at twelve point six grams so here you've got a bunch of B vitamins in their most bioavailable form and they're gonna be working with the Ingrid's that we'll be mentioning nobody synergizing no help we've all cellular functions to tell you know these good Oviatt means yep and then we move into beta alanine a 3.2 grams clinical dose guys so that's a sweet spot and there has to build up in the system but when it does it'll help with muscular endurance and relieve and reduce Dom's from lactic acid buildup it'll help buffer that to stop the pain then betaine anhydrous 1.5 grams had on the low side we only see it to two and a half but it's gonna return hell with pumps it's gonna help with muscle endurance it's a good ingredient overall yeah and then we're moving to taurine at 1 gram which is a hydration element to this pre-workout it helped with hydration and you know power up it a pump a bit of jack-of-all-trades really yeah then we got clear over 65 centers Gliss a pump at one gram again that's had on the low side but we've always said glycerol is a nice ingredient for pumps reason being is it's a normal oil pulling water directly into muscle cell thus bringing nutrients with it so it's gonna help we've grove down the line but it's gonna give a nice pump at the time of use yep then into caffeine anhydrous at 400 milligrams which is a nice dose guys it's more than average we have had higher don't get us wrong but it's about four cups where for coffee it's the main stimulants gonna really give you that drive in the gym lovely then we move into choline ace and you guys can see on the screen what makes that up and that's 300 milligrams yes a toad one-to-one ratio guys so you will have the choline but our trader 150 milligrams which is low we normally say that 600 plus you will have the alpha GPC at 75 milligrams again we normally say that 500 plus and the city choline again 75 milligrams so they are all on the lower edge alone of what we've we say but we're gonna hope they synergize together really to work to give you some focus in the gym obviously the colon that you're really looking for here very nice there next up we have l-tyrosine at 250 milligrams which will work with the p5 pay the vitamin b6 you will be able to get some wine muscle connection some mind focus there and it is on the lower side you know we've normally seen more my presumption as they are trying to work it with those vitamins there yeah we'll say synergize ation is the key here then we're moving to l-theanine at 100 milligrams which is a reasonably low dose but that's what we like we see is the blanket over the caffeine it just takes that edge off of it you know some people get the the high steam jitters and a crash at the end of the workout l feeling should work to prevent that yeah then into halos decline HCl 60 milligrams which is a reasonable dose Kaiser is a powerful stimulant it's a fat burner aswer metabolizes in the body Wellman but metabolizes fat cells for energy release so it is a strong one yeah we'll see how it feels in the gym more stimulation and then into role a seen at 3 milligrams this is that love it or hate ingredient known as al for your him bone so it will give us those flu-like effects you know the cold sweats and jitters the dribbly knows that and dribbling mouth some people love it though for a stimulation effects you know it's a powerful ingredient that you definitely will feel yeah and that's not enough guys we've also got you him by NAT 2 milligram which doesn't carry those harsh effects of the Alfio it still would be a blood flow and a bit of stimulation there so yeah good stuff that does tie the label up there's no digestion a but we just have to hope everything comes together nicely and training yeah obviously it's a standout label if it's got a lot of different ingredients you probably don't see in normal pre workouts almost pre-workout should I put it strange dosages the truth will be in our effects okay guys to be been waiting for the effects of specimen boy i'm specimen or not let's get into it at the beginning when we first take this pre-workout do we feel that 3.2 grams of beta-alanine we do to a medium degree not to a free point to grammar degree but we've talked about this and we think that the lack of the digestion aid perhaps doesn't fully utilize the fuels of the barely even though there is nursing we never got the nursing flushes mmm but you know sometimes work with that be around in content to give you that that sense of feel bad but yeah we felt it a bit don't get us wrong but not to the 3.2 level that's just up on its take and we then got to the GM obviously and the the primary thing i think this is that energy yeah definitely feel that 400 caffeine you feel energized you feel ready for the session you looking back fired up to go yeah and and i think the other thing i was going to mention is that alpha yo dose you do feel that so it's important to mention to you guys at this point you could take this as a positive or a negative if you it depends if you like out for yo or not you know three milligrams you feel that al vo but us it is a negative at all scoop it's just a bit too much you know we do get the full effects of the negative out for yo feels we get the jitters we get the dribbly mouth the dribbly nose the Yang's are a cold shivers yeah sweats are the worst and the runny nose so it makes it hard to do it does hinder yeah that's what I was gonna say we rate pre workouts on how good they translate in training and productivity and that does take away from that but if you like that then obviously that's a positive take it as you will what I'm gonna say at this stage is at 4/5 for the scoop it is not you can't feel that it's weird it's like the smallest amount extra makes that different it undercuts a bit I was gonna say freak or scoops but it's literally more than that 4/5 over scoop for me is that sweet or and what I'll say at that sweet spot I feel a nice level of mood elevation I just feel happy to train you get the benefits from the Alpha yo and other games about the negatives your him by and the car today's you know you do through a happy since in the gym and it happy translating train rights you have much better sessions on here is the scoop but for the consistency of the channel we have to review this on its full SKU and I do have a number in mind so we we're looking at about energy to be its best par there's no doubt about that so if energy is something you're looking for this would be a very good one for you if you can fight that out video dose of three milligrams and yes here and pumps their average yeah you know their average have only got a gram of glycerol in here or yeah as glass of pumps you're getting actually 65 so 650 milligrams of glitter always a lower dose and that is pretty much it you get AB 18 and high just don't forget 1.5 but the pumps yeah they're just every yeah their middle ground they're not bad but they're not great and the focus is sort of middle ground as well you could perhaps argue it's better at the 4/5 scoop because you don't have the the alpha yo taking your attention off your training where you're always like you're paying attention to yourselves rather than your training so what do we think of this at a full scoop let's put the scores on the doors and I'm thinking honestly around a 7 out of 10 on that full scoop it's a tricky one it really is we've really talked a lot about this because it's such a strange one I've used this product now that five or six times normally at that 4/5 it goes up if I was writing this product on 4/5 I'll probably give it an a at and yeah because we know we can handle two points up to two point five milligrams without for you without the noise just that literally winning on a live and you like hanging up necklace but you take that for as what you will you know guys it's up to you whether you like the LPO that is the standout ingredient than this full scope stim junkie 4/5 of a scope productive training and literally you this is another point I want to mention and we're not going to delve into effects of it because we you know we still go do this one but why did they put three million Val video also in their only other pre-workout it does leave me a bit confused Aaron said the analogy is that offering two sandwiches and putting Marmite in both and it's like what do I go for now but yes so at a full skirt which is consistent seven out of ten literally falling short just because of the slight bumps perhaps that digestion aid and the FBO is the killer really is good yeah seven honest honest effects final verdict on specimen by klaxon you know it was highly excited to get this one too you know a lot of people calling for it and I mentioned in this stage we do also have the G F Y to get reviewed in the future coming so yeah but we're gonna give you the scores on the doors I hope I've truthful on his feelings on this and we start up always in the order of the review and I recommend going back and checking each section to find out how and what we've got them as we did starting off with the taste and the mix ability of alien pop which we landed on a 8 out of 10 we found it mixed very well and it tasted like a lemon and lime I saw that it literally has it there level in line exactly that like lemon drop moving into the price of the product we gave it a six out of ten so a bit cheaper than your average pre-workout with our discount code and you do get quite a lot in the label it's an interesting one you do have to use that 20% off discount code weekend you guys definitely make yeah it makes it nice and I'll mention in this stage when it does come to the UK rule for what to get you guys one time yeah and the most important part of this review the effects of specimen at full serving we gave it a 7 out of 10 we just found the out for you know feels to be a bit too tricky for us but we did still get good sessions and we argued a 4/5 Kate Moss that sweet spot which would probably get like an 8 out of 10 but for consistency for scope 7 and that lines us on overall score 21 out of 30 Stoke every G pre-workout over all All Things Considered again a lot of those areas are very discussion or even the effects if you like alpha yo yeah attend if you love out for you yeah you'll really like it if you like that so we're 21 out of 30 good stuff like some I hope you've enjoyed this review of specimen you know we kept it 100% honest we'd love to try some other flame you know the molecular candy and I we also got that gfy review to get to yourselves as soon as possible we also have that plasm surge that non-stimulant pump we've done the super greens already subdued check that out if you haven't already and sleep aid sedatives so yeah we've done a couple of bits and we're getting through the next couple of bits yeah we're curious to know have you tried this pre market OGF why if you have let us know in the comments what you thought and we'll see your feelings you know what else I want to know from them do you like alpha yo yes or no let us know yeah it's a you know hot topic at the moment especially with these two products so thanks for watching guys as always stay steams and you will [Music]", "WHkCVQ4q1EM": "this is our one cup of organic sugar and there's a half a cup light corn syrup [Music] [Music] and then 1/4 cup of

[Music] and the instructions say don't stir after your magic potion concoction I do potion so I couldn't say it yeah that see the other one I had to stir until it reached 300 and then put the stuff in well THC starts being killed at about 300 so I always wondered why are you putting it in yeah this is much [Music] we've reached boiling yep we've reached boiling now it's time to insert a candy thermometer there I go I'll put it over by the handle maybe it'll stay a little better I like to do not stir while it's being communal diselle you can see their temperature turn that to bake your phone at the same time it's got quite a ways to go wow that's a long time yeah I think we're gonna pause this of her well", "VhupDcl3wN0": "i'm going to talk to you about nutritional management in pre-dialysis chronic kidney disease and maintenance dialysis patients now why are we talking about nutritional intervention why is it required in chronic kidney disease the kidneys we know are key homeostatic organs among their many functions kidney kidneys maintain body's balance of several minerals like sodium potassium phosphorus and of course protein is a big big big host for them and consequently patients with chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease are prone to uremia and use hidden conditions namely the oxidative stress inflammation metabolic acidosis mineral imbalances which greatly contribute to morbidity and mortality now the term renal disease embraces a number of clinical conditions whose common feature is loss of kidney function development of cardiovascular disease and another common feature that these conditions share is malnutrition now we know that kidneys kidney disease has five different stages depending upon the declining gfr um well it is chronic kidney disease is defined as kidney damage for more than three months so more than three months is the key thing here as defined by structural or functional abnormalities of the kidney with or without decreased gfr now high blood pressure is not included in the definition of chronic kidney disease or its stages but is a common cause or a consequence of chronic kidney disease similarly 13 urea is an early and a sensitive marker of kidney damage in many types of chronic kidney disease and that is also a reason for malnutrition in our patients now if you have a look at this figure this figure is showing you the etiology of protein energy wasting in ckd that is uh pew protein energy wasting is the word the term that the nephrologists use for malnutrition it's been cachexia and all those terms have been replaced simply by protein energy wasting because our patients because malnutrition is basically of two types type one is something which is reversible which does not have inflammation but type 2 is not reversible which is what we see in our patients because it has a very very important component that is inflammation which is the most ignored part in our practice so protein energy wasting is described as loss of protein uh body protein mass and fuel reserves so if you have a look at this figure this figure is showing you because of uremia the hormones leptins are increased in levels the adrenaline levels are reduced and the tryptophan and serotonin are totally disoriented and therefore this leads to anorexia and therefore decreased hunger causes decreased intake of calories because the patient doesn't eat very well now let me remove this from here okay let me remove this thing from here and remove it i don't want this yeah okay and then um then these patients have retention of metal molecules and uramic compounds and then on top of that the metabolic acidosis ensues which causes accelerated protein catabolism leading to loss of furling body mass and then there's increasing inflammation which is so very hidden which leads to increase in acute phase reaction proteins and leads to reduced protein sensors and hypoalbanemia and then on top of that intercontinentalist and the whole scenario here is leading to increased morbidity and mortality in our patients on top of that because the uh real function is impaired there's impaired clearance of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increased levels of point from it to cytokines then of course as i said the superimposed illness accumulation of uranic toxin increased risk energy expenditure reduce energy intake and then the mitochondrial dysfunction is definitely there there's increased free radical production and um then then on top of that um impaired signaling of insulin and igf-1 i'm going to talk to you about this and and then eventually the patient is coming on during replacement therapy and then patient is eventually getting catabolic day by day he's getting sick and they're not really really working hard towards not letting this happen and then he becomes becomes physically frail and so all these things happen so once chronic kidney disease sets in the vicious cycle of catabolism caused by urinary induced anorexia inflammation metabolic acidosis uh malnutrition ferality depression infection anemia so it imbalance and hormonal imbalance begins which leads to loss of lean body mass so surveillance of nutritional status for good nutritional outcome is very very important if you have a look at this figure this figure is showing you the catabolic pathways which cause protein loss in our patients that is the muscle wasting declining nutrition status in ckd so what happens is because of uremia the patient is not able to eat very well so there is reduced dietary and amino acid intake which which means that there's a small amino acid pool available for protein synthesis and then on top of that the leptin levels are increased the grain levels are reduced the vitamin d levels are reduced the igf-1 axis is impaired the growth hormone access is impaired which leads to uh which and and again it is causing inflammatories increase inflammatory cytokines increase antigens into other steroid levels are increased cortisol cortisol levels are increased so here what is happening is there this all these things cause reduce insulin sensitivity increase insulin resistance and hence the whole thing is affecting protein synthesis and eventually leading to more of protein breakdown because of all these conditions and eventually the effective the net effect is protein loss muscle wasting and reduction in the nutritional status now um chronic disease is the catabolic state associated with protein energy wasting decreased muscle synthesis and multiple metabolic derangements due to uremia so in ckd sarcopenia includes any loss of muscle mass and function due to age of chronic illness reduce physical activity low protein energy intake and physical inactivity but regardless of the initiating factor the loss of muscle mass in ckd is attributed to a negative balance of protein homeostasis now if you have a look at this figure this is an elegant experiment in early 1990s by dr dr ikesa which is showing you that as renal function declines as this is the gfr here creatine clearance as the real function declines this spontaneous reduction in the dietary protein intake and here this the biggest study so far in the in the history of nephrologists that is mdrd study has shown that there is an association between dietary intake and the gfr so here as the gfr declines below 60 ml per minute there is a reduced protein energy intake and reduce levels of albumin ensue so under nutrition causes muscle protein loss and is the key contributor to the development of sarcopenia and fertility which affects the nutritional status so deterioration of clinical nutritional status is characterized by progressive weight loss wasting of fat and skeletal muscle tissues and reduction of serum proteins here i should have if i had spoken to you about this in on wednesday i would have told you what is an sg score how do you do the screening but anyway i'll take it up maybe just for 10 minutes i'll take a class then that day also now protein now when does protein energy wasting setting protein energy racing most likely occurs during sickening stages 3 or even earlier because of inadequate nutritional management in the pre-dialysis phase and it becomes clinically evident when gfr is less than 15 to 10 ml per minute and you know that 20 to 70 percent of patients on maintenance hemodialysis or maintenance dialysis show signs of protein energy wasting so why do we need to modify the diets what happens is as kidney disease progresses the capacity to respond to changes in intake of nutrients and water becomes less flexible solute and water excretion per nephron increases but the fewer number of functional nephrons leads to a more restricted range of solute and water excretion and therefore when diet exceeds daily protein requirement the excess protein is degraded to urea and other nitrogenous waste and these waste products accumulate in the body causing uremia here there is lots of nephron mass and here this is excessive protein intakes so therefore the severity of uremic syndrome is proportional to the accumulation of waste products so we need to modify diets of these patients now in kidney failure nutritional therapy allows a very good control of several consequences of the disease like nausea vomiting anorexia and can even delay initiation of dialysis so pathophysiology of ckd necessitates pharmacological and nutritional intervention now uh the pathophysiology of sickening involves two important mechanisms one is initiation initial mechanism of the specific underlying etiology and two a series of progressive mechanisms involving hyper filtration and hypertrophy of remaining very viable nephrons due to a long-term decrease in renal mass so two factors which explain progression of ckd are hemodynamic and non-hemodynamic factors i'm not going into the details of this well um eventually what is happening is the persistent glomerular injury is going to uh disrupt adjacent uh is going to uh cause fibrosis and scar formation and then the non-hemodynamic factors which play a role in the progression of ckd are the angiotensin two the eldest neuron the endothelium and the endothelin the acidosis and the oxidative stress which worsens progression of ckd so malnutrition is an additional factor which causes increased oxidative stress in these patients so protein energy wasting is amongst the strongest predictors of mortality in ckd patients based on isrn classification this is international society of real nutrition metabolism which is quite the term protein energy racing so we are no more using the term cachexia or sarcopenia we are using protein energy wasting so this is according to this classification the prevalence of protein energy wasting increases as renal function declines from less than two percent in sickening stages one to two to eleven to fifty four percent or even up to seventy percent in cd stages three to five and in patients undergoing maintenance dialysis prevalence of total energy wasting is between 28 to 54 now if you have a look at this figure this figure this table is showing you the ckd registry of india which has shown that as the ckd stage advances the bmi decreases that is the patient is losing weight is losing muscle mass in our patients remember one thing the patients the the fat is not mobilized fast it is the lean body mass which is which is mobilized due to various factors inflammation uh you know causing protein catabolism that the serum proteins going down and there's always a signal going to the muscles oh break break break because the plasma proteins are going down so we need more offer will need to get into the normal state so mortality is related to muscle mass in sikkim disease and this association leads us to two important questions how are the protein stores lost and how can the losses be prevented so uh i'm not going to get into these these mechanisms because i really don't have time the loss of muscle protein stores results from three responses one is impaired growth of new muscle fibers two is suppression of protein sensors and three is the stimulation of protein degradation so um muscle wasting and seriously begins with impaired igf-1 signaling causing abnormal protein metabolism reduced satellite cell function which contributes to atrophy and this um uh it's very my favorite uh uh figure which is showing you what happens in when uh in normal muscle growth and how ckd really impairs muscle growth so it's the myod which is the master switch of satellite cell activation which causes which is actually decreased or decreases there's a decreased expression of myod the master switch of satellite cell activation which causes reduced differentiation of isolated satellite cells and from ckd mice which causes lower number of embryonic myogenic heavy chain cells and leads to this leads to lesser and suppressed myotubular formation compared with controlled mice and ckd delays the regeneration of injured muscles and decreased mild d and rna and myogen and expression so in short ckd suppresses satellite cell activation and differentiation impairs proliferation and differentiation of satellite cells and muscle regeneration is decreased and so here you can see this slow muscle regeneration there's increased collagen deposition leading to fibrosis and and increased tgf beta 1 mrna which are all actually destroying the muscles so and the second potential mechanism causing muscle wasting is seeking induced suppression of protein senses compared to healthy individuals experiments have shown that patients with sick kidney have 27 percent lowers a rate of senses of mixed muscle protein and 37 percent lower rate of synthesis of myosin and this is um of the the most important uh mechanism the third major mechanism which degrades proteins you must all be knowing about it i'm sure it's the ubiquitin producing uh system which actually is responsible for the protein degradation in our patients so and actually this work uh got the the the the discoverers the uh the nobel prize of 2004. now uramic toxins exert and exhibit an inhibitory or a pro-apoptotic effect on immune cells and contribute to activation and priming or and anti-apoptotic effects giving rise to inflammation so here you can see immune cells you know and this is um everything is going to happen infection will happen and the the antipope effect and the baseline activation and priming this is going to lead to inflammation and all because of uramic toxins now ckd is characterized by a persistent low-grade inflammation and inflammation is directly related to ckd progression the chronic inflammation major cult is therefore a major culprit in muscle wasting and we are actually not treating our patients for inflammation otherwise we can really control this loss of muscle mass in our patients so early intervention to control inflammation can check malnutrition now um oxidative stress and inflammation cause cvd inflection and catabolism uh in our patients in your immediate immune defense system contributes to the high prevalence of infections whereas pre-activation priming of immune cells as i just mentioned previously leads to inflammation and consequence to the cvd and now how can the losses of muscle must be prevented now we're talking about intervention but the first thing i always say is control information which we are really not doing so in order to optimize the response to any specific drug therapy for muscle wasting disease it is important to first diagnose and stabilize the clinical condition of the patient provide adequate nutrition provide an adequate level of exercise and control inflammation okay so um there is a gap between the goals of healthcare team and the patient's patient in the chronic kidney disease so chronic diseases require adaptation to lifestyle adaptation to a new situation where whether good or bad involves acceptance a patient has to accept it to achieve health goals behavioral changes are the prerequisite and the three most widely studied interventions linked to effects on gfr slowing progression of ckd are lowering of blood pressure proteinuria reduction and antihypertensive drugs so i'm not getting into this metabolic changes impact nutritional status we all know there is effect on the glucose metabolism protein catabolism and abnormal lipid metabolism in our patients now in early sticky stages renal specific diets help protect kidneys from further damage so current guidelines for security management recommend dietary and lifestyle modifications in our patients what are specific nutritional requirements of our ckd patients we know that excessive protein intake when nephron mass is reduced causes damage to remaining nephrons increase in single nephron geofiring and increased chlamydial capillary and transcatheter pressure effects renal mass reduction and after adrenal mass reduction is a cause of accelerated glomerular injury so dietary protein has an independent therapeutic effect we know the dietary protein causes postpartum hyper filtration induces or increases proteinuria leads to grammar sclerosis and renal insufficiency so low protein intake when the patient is not in dialysis lowers hyperfiltration retards onset of proteinuria and glomerular fibrosis so if you have a look at this fig this is a beautiful uh paper by calendar zade in this is very clearly shown that low protein diet has independent therapeutic effect in the sense that low protein diet causes vasoconstriction of the aphid arterioles and vasodilation of infant arterials thereby reducing intragrammatic hypertension that's preventing decline in renal function through angiotensin modulation so a decrease uh so the potential advantage of low protein diet is that it decreases theoremic symptoms improves phosphorus control um because hyperphosphatemia is a major comorbidity in our patients delays administration of dialysis does not increase the risk of protein malnutrition if combined with essential amino acid supplementation and protects against oxidative stress which may aggravate protein progression of ckd so one has to remember that when you're giving a low protein diet to a patient it is actually you're pushing your your patient towards energy malnutrition which means more of a muscle loss so you have to ensure that your patient gets enough energy intake and your dietitian is going to help you with this so um so therefore one has to correct signs and symptoms and complication of chronic renal failure reduce urinary toxicity decrease proteinuria maintain good nutritional status lower the risk of kidney disease related secondary complications and slow the rate of progression of kidney failure to esri and delay initiation of dialysis that is what is the main aim of nutritional intervention in our patients along with what you give as ace inhibitors or arbs you know trying to um prevent uh damage through uh accelerated hypertension or uncontrolled diabetes and all those things so in pre-dialysis stages he can secretly stage two to five non-dialysis protein-resistant diets may result in essential amino acids deficiency and thus deteriorate the patient's nutritional status so therefore supplement your patients with keto analogs i'll show you they are excellent they work wonderfully well with our patients now when we talk of supplementing our patients with ketone rocks we're talking about very low protein diet male or protein diet when it began it began as 20 grams per kg body weight per day along with one tablet of keto unlock per 5 kilograms body weight but now things have changed and so uh the concept of has increased from has increased from 0.3 2.4 to 0.5 grams per kg bodyweight per day of protein in a very low protein diet along with one keto unlocked tablet for every 10 kilograms of body weight to prevent uranic symptoms delay time to any to dialysis and lower phosphates but ensure as i mentioned earlier also they give them a high energy intake and do check for calcium levels routinely to prevent hypercalcemia when you whenever you're something supplementing your patients with keto analogues so this is a study that we did here in our department which has shown that you know this is this is the intervention group that is the ketone law group and this is the control group and what we saw that in the intervention group the uh decline in gfr or rising trading was much much slower than compared to patients who were on in the control group here and as you can see here that there was faster decline in function into esrd in control groups compared to our treatment group here okay so and also the the major advantage here is that the proteinuria is is you know reduced by the end of this study the metabolic acidosis improved the um you had we had better control of phosphates we had better control of insulin sensitivity there was improvement in insulin sensitivity the hdl cholesterol went up and the triglycerides came down so uh in ckd patients proteinuria is the strongest correlate of arterial hypertension particularly of increased nocturnal blood pressure rise possibly as an expression of vascular damage it's a low protein intake lowers hyper filtration and retards onset of proteinuria and glomerulofibrosis and here you can see in this figure that very low protein diet um a hike with high quality of fruit and vegetables and with a low amount of protein supplemented with essential amino acids and kidnogs of non-essential amino acids considerable considerably reduces net endogenous acid production by 53 after six months and 67 um after 12 months and potential renal acid lows are lowered by 120 after six months of the study so correction of hyper hyper potassium as a consequence of physiological correction of metabolic acidosis was observed after 12 months on very low protein diet now um the the source of protein is also has a very independent therapeutic effect the plant-based plant-based diets contain low amounts of protein they are rich in potassium and phosphorus but only 40 of phosphorus is absorbed because the human beings do not express the enzyme called phytase therefore whatever phosphorus is available from the plant plant protein only 40 percent is absorbed while if you give uh animal protein 80 of the annual protein will be absorbed so plant protein is always preferred over animal protein in our patients and they are believed to be the plant plant diets when you talk of them they believe to be unsuitable for ckd patients because of high potassium content but you can always take care of you can choose fruits and vegetables which are low in potassium however if vegetarian diet is used wisely it delays the transition from one second stage to another now this is a beautiful paper vegetarian diet in chronic kidney disease a friend or a foe i would say it's a vegetarian diet is a natural source of prebiotics vegetarian diet might potentially reduce uranic toxins like indoctrinal sulfate and precursor production by the intestinal microbiome and levels of intoxicating precursor days are lower in vegetarian patients undergoing hemodi filtration compared to patients who are having animal protein and they also generate low serum urea and of course the patient has low serum phosphorus levels now plant protein therefore should be preferred over animal protein because there's 20 less proteinuria in soya based diets these studies have shown and fibrosis is lowest that is 20 in soy group compared to casein group um that is 45 percent in the casein group therefore reduce animal protein intake reduces global hypertension and here you can see in this figure that with animal protein load the gfr and the real plasma flow increases compared to the soy protein load and when you combine ace inhibitors and arbs you know that it is an arb is reduced degree of flood genera and renal disease but when you combine them with low protein diet an additional antiprotein uric effect is observed in the in the patients so low protein that should be supplemented with calorie dense and low protein supplements um yes and uh this study has shown that six uh that um control uh in the control group on low protein diet that is point six grams and the supplemented group when they were considered [Music] hello uh is anybody saying anything to me all right so i'll continue with my talk supplemented grow group on a low protein diet and hypercaloric supplements had the the better preserved nutritional parameters and they had less mark decrease in renal function and um also an effective strategy to enhance the solitary effect of lupus lopez diet is to assure at least 60 percent of the protein that you give to your patients is of higher biological value um and you must provide adequate energy that is 30 to 35 kilo calories to prevent malnutrition and these are the foods of high biological value the milk and milk products and the soy products are really very good and remember that the phosphorus don't be scared of the phosphorus content of the soil products they will not be absorbed completely only 40 of them will be absorbed and well meat products are high in phosphorus so if you have a look at this table this table is showing you what is the actual uh guidelines for our patients the low protein diet the second row is 0.55 to point six grams per kg body weight per day of protein and however if the patient is not able to accept such a low protein then you can increase it to 0.75 grams but the latest guidelines have um are encouraging use of 0.55 grams to 0.6 grams per kg body weight per day of protein and very low protein as i mentioned is 0.3 to 0.4 or 0.5 grams per kg body weight per day i've already spoken about your diabetics the diabetic patient should be initiated on pointed glass per kg body weight per day of protein which should be reduced to uh 0.6 grams per kg body weight per day as gfr starts declining and the energy intake in diabetic should be 25 kilocals to start with but if required you can increase it up to 30 kilocals per kg body weight per day so that their sugars are you know well maintained in children patients who have nephrotic syndrome the protein intake is 0.8 grams per kg body weight but actually in children um you do not restrict protein at all because everything is done according to the recommended dietary allowances but in in adults it is again 0.6 to 0.8 grams per kg body weight per day for at least and with one gram for each gram of uh albumin lost you add one gram of protein to uh each gram of albumin lost in the urine soy protein are beneficial for our patients because they are rich in branching amino acids protein intake according to your rda for uh strong it should be the rule of the thumb whenever you are practicing or treating a child it restricts with in a nephrotic patient of course i'm going to talk about it later but whenever the patient even in chronic kidney disease who is not on on dialysis whenever the patient has acute illness please do increase the protein intake to one gram per kg bodyweight per day because these patients become hyper catabolic so therefore in order to preserve nutritional status as far as long as the patient is not vomiting or is not having too many uremic symptoms you can increase the um the protein intake and energy intake is according to years if the patient is above the age of 60 years they we consider them to be not very mobile they are more sedentary so the energy intake should be 30 kilocals per kg body weight per day however the patient is less than 60 years of age then the energy takes more than 35 kilo calories it's more between 30 to 35 kilocals and the visible fat that you have to give to your patients is between 50 to 20 grams which is you can give them a combination of peanut oil with mustard oil rice bran oil or sunflower oil and as dr sudhi was mentioning i'm i'm not going to talk about the mediterranean that i'll just show you one slide i knew he's going to he was going to cover it up olive oil is is um is an excellent uh replacement because it has it is rich in monounsaturated poly ammonia unsaturated fatty acids and you know that in the mediterranean area they use lot of olive oil and these patients do have do not have such a high incidence of hypertension and so um and 30 percent of the calories should come from fat and the dietary cholesterol should be reduced to less than 200 milligrams daily along with you can supplement them with the omega-3 fatty acids sodium intake should be less than 2.4 grams per day i'm going to talk about sodium later on and i'm going to talk about potassium also the intake should be less than one milli equal per kg body weight per day calcium should not exist exceed 2 000 milligrams per day and if the patient is on vitamin d analogues do uh prefer bringing down the dietary and the supplemental calcium to between 1200 to 1500 milligrams per day now anemia cannot be corrected through diet so correct iron profile of the patients and supplement the vitamin b12 folic acid and iron and epo of course you have to give this to the patients and well we know that metabolic acidosis plays an important role in the pathogenesis of nutritional abnormalities associated with urine because they because of metabolic acidosis there is increased activity of branching amino acids a branch chain ketosis dehydrogenate an increased activity of caspase-3 and then there's insulin resistance along with that there's inflammation and reduced serum leptin levels and the whole thing then leads to protein energy malnutrition in our patients so pre dialysis stabilized serum bicarbonate should be maintained at 22 million equals per liter in chronic kidney disease stages three four and five and the serum uh levels of total carbon dioxide should also be maintained at 22 milli equals per liter and here you can see in this figure that when you supplement your patients with sodium sodium bicarbonate there is improvement in metabolic acidosis and improvement in in the nutritional status of the patients and for preservation of female function advised anti-protein uric uh omega-3 fatty acids as you do and the recommendations are k2k guidelines do recommend use of omega-3 fatty acids in iog nephropathy if even despite use of ace and arbs and all anti-protein neuric treatments the patient is not responding then to control proteinuria you can add omega-3 fatty acids now aha recommends which dr sudeep has already very nicely covered discovered all these things food sources um for omega-3 fatty acids are fish flax seeds and flaxseed oil canola ice oil soybean oil and nuts at least two servings of fish per week particularly for our patients on dialysis because in in this the pre-dialysis patients we are really worried about giving them protein um from the animal source because we are scared of the hydrogen ion overload so we do not want them to get into metabolic acid also we do give them uh soda by carb but we want to uh want to prevent metabolic acidosis from setting in so we discuss our patients to taking you know plenty of excess of i mean not even excess a lot of fish and chicken routinely we prefer them to uh to maintain them on vegetable or a protein or vegetarian vegetable origin now uh limit uh we i've already spoken to you about uh fats limit intake of saturated fats to less than 10 transfer years to less than one percent and substitute grains and unsaturated fatty acids with fish vegetables legumes and nuts diets and rubbish in unsaturated fatty acids rather than carbohydrates benefit in modulating that genetic dyslipidemia so this study has shown this is the omni heart trial they've shown that their carbohydrates are partially replaced by when carbohydrates are partially replaced by uh fat unsaturated one of uh monounsaturated fats it lowers blood pressure triglycerides and increases hdl cholesterol so um the component of diet which really helps reduce dystopia are the plant sterols that is the source is soya bean butter or the marjorie which and this also improves the glycemic control and so you can think of giving two grams of plaster oils to your patients through soybean butcher or margarine in two to three divided doses reduced dietary cholesterol i've already mentioned restrict full-fat dairy products and tropical oils like palm oil coconut oil and palm kernel oil and let's say big no no to bakery products because these contain a lot of hidden saturated and trans fatty acids dr selip has already covered this and a stop reuse of oil which you did ask him before frying and all and restrict eating out in restaurants include soluble fiber in the diet to reduce total and ldl cholesterol and you know a very good source of soluble fiber is bindi bindi has is very very advantageous for our patients and then gargum that is gohar pali is very very good um source of soluble fiber because uh every gram increased in soluble fiber decreases ldl cholesterol by an average of 2.2 milligrams per deciliter so fiber intake should be between 25 grams and it can be increased up to 35 grams for per day for our patients now hypertension everything doctor sleep has already covered i'm just going to talk about step one and step two diets are widely recommended for the as the first line for cbd intervention lower for lowering that cholesterol levels now uh the gnc and the national committee on prevention and detection and evaluation and treatment of high blood pressure and all they recommend non-pharmacological interventions such as diet weight loss and physical activity for primary and secondary prevention of hypertension and for a sickening patient the sodium intake should be reduced to less than 2 grams per day for better control of blood pressure and edema and gnc 7 recommends this in 1.5 grams of sodium per day a reduced intake of salty processed food cheese and meat and modification of lifestyle is very very important our patients are depressed they tend to be more sedentary so at least 40 minutes of work at least five times a day is is something that the patient should do and salt intake um and if you have a look at this figure showing you that salt intake has a direct correlation with protein urea and edema so therefore a white one patients must avoid canned foods fruits pickles fruits fruit jam because they contain salt as preservative um in ckd patients proteinuria is the strongest correlate of arterial hypertension and particularly of increased nocturnal blood pressure which have already said before possibly as an expression of vascular damage so one has to control blood pressure well um dr philippe has covered mediterranean diet but i am not uh asking you to prescribe mediterranean diet to our patients because it is very very rich in fruits and vegetables the only reason i'm going to talk about this is because of the sun study and has shown that olive oil is very very cardio protective the olive oil has laser protective effect of polyphenols which increase the endothelial synthesis of nitric oxide and has protective role on both systolic and diastolic blood pressure this is how a which mediterranean diet looks like but so for our patients you can pick up fruits which are low in potassium i'll tell you right now vegetables which are low in potassium bread and cereal well you have to give but you have to give them refined bread and because uh we are worried about comorbidity that is hypophosphatemia so we do not want our patients to go into um ckd mbd that is mineral bone disease so we have to prevent hyperphosphatemia at any cost olive oil you can use or you can use um mustard oil which is uh which is also very rich in monounsaturated fatty acids and then of course eggs you can always prescribe to your patients we're going to talk about it later so um a well mediterranean diet it shows an adequate intake of beta-carotene vitamin c to eukaryotic acid and it is really really really very good but not meant for our patients now moving on to hyperkalemia where we have to prescribe a low uh potassium diet if the if the potassium is serum potassium is more than five milli equals milligrams per deciliter and potassium intake should be less than one milligram per kg body per day for our patients remember that one gram of protein brings you one milli equal of potassium so you can easily calculate if you're giving 30 grams of protein to your patient you have straight away given them 30 milligrams of potassium and on top of that when you give them fruits and when you give them other things and vegetables then that is again going to contribute to the potassium intake so that your dietitian can very well calculate for you how much vegetables um how many uh how much potassium the vegetables are contributing towards the diet so you have to restrict green leafy vegetables tomatoes sweet lime lemon carrots raw salad mango dry fruits fruit juices water watermelon vegetable soup and coconut water in in our patients and and also remember that you can reduce potassium content of the vegetables by leaching or removing potassium from vegetables by boiling or soaking chopped vegetables in lukewarm water for half an hour but presently there's no consensus on this because studies are showing that you know um you really have to work hard to leech potassium so it's better that you keep your patient on a low potassium diet too you know not asking to leech them but by giving them low vegetables and low potassium vegetables and fruits now moving on to hyperphosphatemia patients with renal impairment progressively lose ability to excrete phosphorus hypophosphatemia is a strong predictive of a predictor of mortality in advanced ckd stages therefore restrict phosphorous to between 800 to 1 000 milligrams per day advise the protein diet in pre-dialysis patients with low phosphorus content and supplement with ketone rocks to maintain nutritional status use phosphorus this is a phosphorus pyramid you can choose it it is available on the internet and you can choose foods of low phosphorous content and advise foods containing low phosphorus to protein ratio because studies have shown here that there is a two-fold increase death risk of death in patients on maintenance modalises who take foods with very high phosphorus to put to uh protein ratio foods so there uh here you can see if you if they're taking something like 20 or 16 a ratio of phosphorous to protein then the likelihood of um the death of risk uh the the risk of death increases so um well um these are the things one has to avoid anything that contains chilka has is rich in phosphorus so dals with the pulses of the lentils with chilika they have uh um high content of phosphorus so you must tell patients to take duli dals or dals without chilka all right and of course they can take kidney beans and chickpeas once a week that is all right because these are soaked overnight and so a lot of potassium and is leached and then they are cooked for a long period of time and so phosphorus happens to be heat labile therefore the a lot of phosphorus is also killed now remove choker from atta as i said you have to give them refining bread to the patient that is refined bread or chipotles you can't give them whole grain you know bread so because choker is is the the chulka and it is very high in phosphorus and the sources of plant foods as their as dietary phosphorus are basically the legumes the nuts and the chocolates along with inorganic phosphorus in the form of food additives and remember the good news is that egg white has one of the lowest phosphorous protein ratio and is also devoid of cholesterol so it's a wound for our patients and it's a it's a food of high biological value so you should prescribe more of egg white to our patients the highest of phosphorus comes from protein rich foods that is nuts heart cheeses egg yolk meat poultry and fish so you should avoid giving these to your patients and avoid foods with phosphorus-based additives like cola beverages enhance or restructured meat frozen meals cereals snack bars processed or spread with cheeses and stand products refrigerated bakery products and this is a table which i am also not able to read so i can't expect you to read but this table is showing you various the variety of foods with different kinds of the different levels of protein to phosphorus ratio and here remember if your patient has residual renal function then the requirement of phosphate binder is definitely low compared to a patient who is anuric so try and preserve you know the residual function of the patients and advice faucet binders with meals protein you know has a linear relationship with phosphorus so as you increase the intake of protein the phosphorus intake also goes up one gram of phosphorus can protein contains 13 to 15 milligrams of phosphorus so you can actually uh calculate if you're giving 30 grams of phosphorus just multiply it by either 13 or 14 or 15 and you will have a true estimate of how much phosphorus you're giving to your patient okay and high phosphorus uh is a is a risk for the development and progression of cardiovascular disease and mineral bone disease about which we are so scared and eventually we don't lose our patient because of the kidney diseases we lose the patient because of this thing the cardiovascular disease okay and and how can dialysis be of help to in controlling phosphorus well we know that one day of petroleum dialysis clears between 300 to 400 milligrams of phosphorus phosphates and one regular hemodialysis can very easily clear between 500 to 800 milligrams of faucet yet phosphate binders are a must because the patients are um i'm not talking about the pd patients but i'm talking about the hemodialysis patients who are not on daily dialysis they are either on a twice weekly or twice weekly diet so they are always in in a positive balance for phosphates so they have to be on phosphate binders and as i mentioned that boiling reduces phosphorous contents with a negligible loss of nitrogen leading to a more favorable phosphorus to protein ratio food for them and here i'm going to talk about a little just a small bit about the nephrotic syndrome um this is a paper which is talking about effect of combined gluten-free dairy free diet in children with steroid resistant nephritic syndrome here we know that idiopathic nephrotic syndrome is the most common type of nephrotic syndrome in children presenting clinically with massive proteinuria hypoallernia hyperlipidemia and edema now without response to steroids and therefore uh persistent proteinuria the the steroid resistant nephritic syndrome poses an enormous therapeutic challenge and so therefore if you can give them a gluten-free diet and or if you can keep them away from daily dairy foods for some time for a month or two or three then you will see that proteinuria will start resolving you know um exposure to sensitive foods i just compiled the slides now so they are not looking very beautiful but anyways i'm trying to give you the message here the exposure to sensitive foods may trigger the release of inflammatory factors the cytokines that could directly damage the podocytes and here in nephrotic syndrome we are talking about the placement of polycytes and we are so worried about it so you have to do something about it and therefore there's several papers now on elimination diet and it's actually called elimination diet where you start eliminating one food after another and you see a wonderful wonderful result in these patients so um so for a successful treatment of nephrotic syndrome with hypoallergenic diet has long been documented in several clinical studies and case reports in the past two decades so you can try this on your patients and in short your estimating syndrome patient requires the low fat low salt diet enough and a lot of fluid restriction if you use animators and so um where you can give your protein intake has to be according to their rda for a kid and for for for an adult it is between point six to point eight grams with one gram for each gram of protein lost uh albumin lost in the urine and um well you have to restrict sodium you have to restrict fat and you have to restrict uh soya cholesterol but soya proteins are really beneficial for our patients kidneys now last part about the nutritional intervention and dialysis patients now um nutrition problems in adult patients with ckd stage five chronic kidney disease on dialysis can be classified into three categories the protein energy wasting the recipe and the diabetes now protein energy wasting is an independent determinant of mobility and mortality in hemodialysis as well as in our pd patients twenty-five percent of hemodialysis patients exhibit a high risk malnutrition as estimated from serum aluminium and trans territorian levels that is the pre-albumin and the yearly mortality rates of hemodialysis and the put and the patient analysis patients with low serum albumin and trans theration are close to 25 to 30 percent so if you have a look at this figure this figure is showing you a simple thing that if malnutrition is present at the initiation of dialysis it is a strong predictor of subsequent increase in relative risk of death here is malnutrition and this is a patient who is surviving very well on and with the normal nutritional status now from metabolic point of view each child succession decreases plasma minor acid levels and as a consequent consequence blends into cellular protein synthesis so protein losses are not as high in dialysis in hemodialysis that is only one to three grams but in peritoneal dialysis which is a daily dialysis the losses are five to 15 grams can up can go up to 48 grams and if the patient has peritonitis then it can go up to 48 50 uh grams in any any amount so you have to be careful about it now this canoes are this is a figure from canada's study which has shown that the relative risk of death increases with lower serum argument levels for every one gram lower serum aluminum concentration there is an associated six percent increase in the relative risk of death and as one unit as you score um this uh the subjective global assessment i do not know how many of you are aware of subjective global assessment i'll talk about it on wednesday uh this uh for every one unit towards sgs core is associated with 25 increase in the relative risk of death so our ketoki guidelines uh recommend that maintain serum women at more than four grams per deciliter and certain period women at more than 30 milligrams of this litter and the rule of the thumb is to reverse protein loss give high protein diet to patients on dialysis and at least 50 of this potentially of high biological value now if you have a look at this table this table is summarizing you all the different three types of stages that the two types of stages one is non-dialysis ckd where i told you we go for a low protein diet moving on to the dialysis stage that is hemodialysis the latest guidelines say you should give one gram per kg board with per day but the previous guidelines of the previous before this update said 1.2 grams per kg bodyweight per day of protein for hemodialysis patient which is simply twice as high protein as for the non dialysis patient from 0.55 you straight away bring it to one gram okay and in patients who are on paternal dialysis you give them 1.2 to 1.3 grams per kg bodyweight per day but the update says 1.2 grams per kg bodyweight per day of protein for these patients and if the patient has peritonitis you have to increase protein intake to 1.5 grams per kg bodyweight per day normalize plasma branch in a minor acid levels by administering relatively large amounts of branched in amino acids through intra-dilating parental nutrition or by uh in one point one percent intra patient minus infusion in case of pd patients which contains multiple amino acids and improves visceral protein sensors sodium potassium everything is the same anemia you have to correct with iron with the with folic acid b12 and iron supplements esa and if required um uh l-carnitine also can be given to the patient now uh to increase protein energy intake prescribed wrinkle specific oral supplements in in between the meals for sick patients use energy and dense and protein dense ons please do make sure that you prescribe renal specific supplements because these are specifically made for our patients and these are low in sodium potassium phosphorus and these are the three killers of our patients so awareness can actually provide approximately 10 kilocals per kg body per day of energy to our patient so the therapeutic um treatment for our patient is to improve appetite to decrease protein breakdown and to promote protein sensors and to reduce ceramic symptoms so we are talking about anorexia now now if you have a look this figure this figure is showing you that malnutrition causes muscle racing leads to cardiac achexia or and left ventricular hypertrophy cardiac hypoxia which reduces blood flow throughout the blood throughout the body and this leads to gut hypoxia leading to anorexia impaired gastric emptying gastroparesis gastroparesis is not just seen in the diabetic patients it's also seen in the non-diabetic patients and impaired intestinal motility so anorexia is also because of you know all these factors because of cardiac in cardiac insufficiency in our patients so prevention of malnutrition necessitates nutritional intervention in ckd now low-branching amino acids and tryptophan transport across the blood-brain barrier causes abnormal synthesis of neurotransmitters and anorexia odor branching amino acid supplementation therefore improves appetite of malnutrition patients with low branched amino acid levels and low protein and energy intake now um um inadequate dialysis as estimated by weekly dialysis time of less than one and uh kt by v of less than 1.1 is a documented cause of anorexia in hemodialysis patients so non-clearance of inflammatory cytokines due to misdialysis low in nitric oxide and high leptin concentrations may cause iron induced anorexia so modulate inflammation by antagonists tnf alpha with pintoxyphyllin phosphate binders may induce loss of the appetite which you have to give to your patients so therefore if the patient is really not eating this continue discontinue use of faucet binders for two weeks to see if appetite improves and in such cases advise low protein diet with low phosphorous content and supplement them with ketone rocks maintain nutritional status egg albumin is your your patient's friend because it is lowest phosphorous to protein ratios and is also divided of cholesterol discontinue use of ant supplements if there are repeated gi upsets discontinue calcium supplements if bowel movements are irregular and particularly in our pd patients correct zinc deficiency with uh and supplement zinc um pro uh motility agents to patients can be given with gastroparesis which will really improve their food intake and prescribe appetite stimulants like medistrol acetate now what happens if the patient is uh is not taking renal replacement therapy um adequately and is is absenting himself from dialysis so in this in these patients the uremic symptoms will get aggravated in esl patients so uh what you can do is it's a beautiful paper by uh on the power of hypoprotein uh nutrition in end stage renal disease um uh this is uh in this paper they have shown very clearly the patient uses dialysis on a non-hemodialysis day you can advise a low protein diet and restrict food rich in potassium and phosphorus and on the dialysis day you can increase protein intake to one to one point two grams per day uh per kg body weight per day to compensate for the hyper catabolic trig uh hyper catabolism triggered by hemodialysis similarly in esrd a severe state of dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiome occurs which functions with with functional disorders of the intestinal tight junction permeability so these biosis of microbiota can be improved with plants pulses and fiber with careful concentration of potassium levels this is also reduced generation of uremic toxins and provide adequate metabolic control reduce oxidative stress in these patients now this is a beautiful um program which uh giovannity and location had started long time back which was on integrated dialysis dietary program in which the the patient was kept on weekly hemodialysis integrated with a very low protein diet equal to 0.32.5 grams per kg body party of protein supplemented with essential amino acids and their heat unlocked to reduce uranium-induced metabolic complications but this study was not a very very successful study because there were 66.6 dropouts because of non-compliance to a very low protein diet so this was uh this integrated dietary dialysis program was modified to combine diet dialysis program in which the protein intake was increased to point six grams per kg bodyweight per day with the free diet on dialysis day and the outcome of this combined diet dialysis program was that at 24 months the cumulative survival rate among 38 38 patients on the once weekly hemodialysis with with the combined diet uh dialysis program and 30 on the standard thrice weekly dialysis was identical however at nine to six months of follow-up the same remaining patients showed a higher cumulative survival rate in the combined diet dialysis program highlighting a significance uh saving in terms of indirect costs that is hospitalization and a reduction in the direct cost by 75 percent the outcome and the restricted protein intake reduced uremic symptoms attained adequate the patients were able to attain adequate metabolic control by reducing generation of urimic toxins providing some dialytic purification while preserving residual renal function longer by avoiding the need of ultrafiltration that is renal ischemia given that more frequent dialysis could worsen renal perfusion and this is the same thing by stiffening your carrier which says that infrequent dialysis uh that is once a week session combined with veil of protein diet low phosphorus diet supplemented with kidney logs is a useful schedule treatment for scheduled um esrd patients with markedly reduced residual function but preserved urine output so here we really want to preserve your output for clearance of middle molecules remember this and lastly i'm going to touch upon the fluid management in these patients you know that in our words the first thing we talk about is the input and the output charting how much the patient was able to make urine and how much fluid he takes so oral intake of fluid includes the oral intake of fluid the iv infusion and the urine output charting and the fluid intake is actually what's taken with meals medications and otherwise tea coffee milk curd or any other liquid this whole thing is fluid intake prescription and the prescription that we normally use for patients is previous 24-hour urine output plus 500 ml if the patient is dry however if the patient is animators then we may reduce this extra 500 ml to 300 ml or even just say that well just don't take too much of to fluid and be stay with whatever you're in you're making and so the take-home message of my talk is uh council patients monitor dietary intake individualized dietary prescription which your dietitian can done can do but listen uh friends my request to you is that you should know about the dietary intervention so that the patient is your responsibility and you have to come back the patient comes comes back to you so you should be able to counsel your patient as much as possible and prevent setting enough protein energy wasting um correct uremia acidosis monitor close play nutrition status and nutrient intake individualized diet prescription closely supervised low protein diet treatment for energy early stages of uremia restrict protein energy to intake to point five to point six grams per kg body weight per incredial suspicions supplement very low protein diet with keto analogues contemplate dialysis without delay if nutrition status is threatened and uranic symptoms appear prescribed high protein that is one to one point two gram per kg body rate for their protein to patients on dialysis prescribed renal specific protein supplements and here is a pyramid that i made for our patients to prevent muscle catabolism and here i'm going to insist upon resistant exercises which should be started in our hemodialysis unit also and also for all the patients whether they are on hemodialysis or they're not on hemodialysis walk and resistant exercise are something they're going to help the patients and thank you for your attention if", "3nlkGbxOKEs": "tasty beef jerky spicy original pork jerky from blazing Kings it's true buds TV and we're reviewing these products the spicy tastes a little better than me than the original cannabis flavor doesn't come in looking strong when you're chewing it but the aftertaste is there overall I would say great tasting but what I care

pieces missing I'm gonna come back to you guys and let you know if I think it's worth the money in terms of potency taste yes with I love jerky I make my own jerky I'll be making some cannabis and huge jerky you guys know how to make too but for now let's see baby King's beef jerky works as good as it tastes and smells I'll be back in about an hour so it's a while later and thumbs up some good stuff to me it's feeling kind of like a indica dominant hybrid gotta be chilling but I'm still working doing some editing I love beef jerky good work plays and kings true that Stevie was feeling your [ __ ] [Music]", "Al5UfAJOLXo": "hey there today I am bringing you a video to go over my second week of the keto slim down plan that I have made for myself based on an alley Makua Wii video I will post it in the description box below if you want to see how she did it I had watched her video a few weeks ago and was just kind of blown away by the food she was eating and then still able to lose weight so I wanted to go ahead and try my own version of it I did week one a few weeks back and then just kind of got off track and was doing other stuff and didn't do week two right after I did week two this last week and I'm gonna do week 3 next week but if you haven't seen my week 1 video I'll put it in the cards above the results were very different than it was in this video and the the foods I was eating were they were the same in that my main meal was the same but the desserts I was eating was different this last week as well so definitely check that one out but what I'll do is I'll go ahead and show you each day what I was eating and I'm not gonna do daily weigh-ins I'm just gonna show you my beginning weight and then my ending weight and i will total up the weight loss for the week so without further ado i'll go ahead and show you my first weigh-in and first day of eating day 1 so i'm having a hard time today i'm gonna go ahead and have this snack pack it's a sugar-free jell-o zero carbs i think it's like 5 or 0 calories but i'll have this to kind of hold me over until dinner I did some meal prep yesterday and I have to cut up sausages in here I'm gonna go ahead and heat that up have that for dinner with some mustard ok so this is what I will have for dinner it's two sausages and some mustard I have just this really cheap mustard that I got a grocery outlet it's zero carbs and zero calorie have that and then I'll wait a while to have dessert so I'm gonna have a couple pieces of this strawberry jell-o dessert has a mascarpone cheese in it and a pack of jell-o I believe that's it I made it a few weeks ago and it's a little bit crystallized around the edges but it still tastes really good I took a bite out of one of the pieces but I'm gonna go ahead and have two little squares of that and I think I should be good for the rest of the night so I just had my first piece and now I feel really stuff so I'm gonna go ahead and put this piece back it's really good I wouldn't say it's rich I just needed a little something sweet I might have that later okay so I'm having a hard time waiting the for dinner so I'm gonna have some of these I've had already seven I think I'm gonna call that quiz one carb for nine pieces seventy calories so I didn't have these sugar-free Jolly Ranchers anymore so I went ahead to happy they're really tasty though they have all different flavors super yummy but definitely don't eat to make these okay I have my two meal prep sausages again have some mustard and then I also added some barbecue sauce today this is the G hues Hickory that's the nutrition but I only put it very little bit and I'll use those two sauces and I'll have dessert probably in a little bit but if you haven't tried hot link sausages with barbecue sauce it is amazing so I think for dessert tonight I'm gonna have some of this kind of like strawberry fluff with it which is the mascarpone cheese I think it's half a cup of water and a jello pot I'm gonna have some of this in a bowl and top it with some whipped topping okay so I was really looking forward to dessert but you can only eat about half of this it's just it's very satisfying I don't feel like I need to eat a whole bunch so I'm gonna put this back and have it another time I went ahead and had eight of these sugar-free Finland bears had these yesterday and they didn't seem to affect my weight loss so I'm gonna head and had eight right now because I'm feeling hungry and it's not even close to dinnertime so to try to hold me over till dinner I'm having one of these strawberry lemonade ices I haven't tried this flavor before but it's actually pretty good I thought it'd be really tangy but it's very mild but it's got a good flavor to it I like it only two o'clock but I'm really hungry so I'm gonna go ahead and have one sausage and then the other one I will have a little bit later okay so I'm having my other sausage here I have some barbecue sauce and some mustard same mustard I've been using and same barbecue sauce I've been using but this combo is really good because this is this mustard super tangy and this Hickory barbecue sauce is a little sweet on a spicy it's just all the things that's so good but I'm gonna go ahead and eat this and I might have a little bit of dessert right after we'll see okay so after dinner I'm wanting something sweet but not quite my dessert yet I'm gonna have one of these diet dr. pepper cream sodas for some reason diet soda is just tasting like carbonated water to me so I can't really say how great this tastes occasionally I will get a sip that tastes kind of like vanilla but it's been just tasting like carbonated soda but I think that's just something with my taste buds right now so I'm gonna have one of these just to have something a little sweet and then I'll show you when I have dessert I went ahead the rest of this bag which had probably eight pieces left which is about one carb seventy calories but I was feeling hungry first thing in the morning so I had that feeling hungry it's about 12:00 I'm gonna go ahead and put in the freezer let's diet dr. pepper cream soda and hopefully that will hold me over until the afternoon time or dinner okay so it's still a little early for dinner but not by much just by like 30 minutes I went ahead and cut the sausages the middle just to make them a little thinner and then I'll chop them into little pieces and then got my mustard and barbecue sauce just like yesterday and that's what I'll have for dinner so I'm feeling like having something salty but I don't want to have too much of anything so I cut up this pepper jack cheese it is 110 calories for 1 ounce which is an eighth of the block so I cut it in half and then cut each of those pieces and how and I just went ahead and had one of the little squares I didn't do a perfect job cutting you could see that like some of these are a little bit thicker than other but I just can't cut straight so I really feel like having another square but I don't think I can fit it in my calories so I think I'm gonna go ahead and have dessert before I eat something I'm not supposed to I'm gonna have for dessert two of these caramel cup slim-fast keto fat bomb I don't know if I test my ketones with these yet I can't remember but each of them are 90 calories and I'm gonna have two so each is also one met carb eight grams of fat so that should fit into my calories I've been a lot of myself about 400 calories or dessert and since I had that cheese I've had a couple of these I think I will be okay and these are really satisfying so I'm gonna go ahead and have two so it's ten o'clock and I'm feeling hungry I am going to have eight pieces of these gummy bears that'll be about 70 calories it is about two o'clock I'm going to have one of my sausages with some mustard and some Chi Hughes barbecue sauce so I don't really feel like having one of my other sausages but I am gonna have one of these two good yoghurts because if you like something a little bit sweet but not quite my jello they're only 80 calories per cup and they are three total carbs so we'll see if this kind of stops me from losing weight or not but I kind of just felt like it's the last day of my slim down so I figured why not so it's five o'clock I'm gonna have my dessert I'm gonna have two of these you know slim fast fat bombs the caramel cups they're so tasty we have two of these hopefully that's gonna be enough to hold me over for the rest of the night I'm not gonna have cheese today to see if that makes a difference in my weight loss I am just feeling snacky so I am going to have two bags of these smart sweets there are only 80 calories each so I'll still be below my 1154 calories for the day okay so my beginning weight was 137 point two and then you just saw my ending weight was 132 point two I think that is crazy I think I lost a little bit more than that during the five-day egg fast but I was only eating eggs for that so I'm I'm really blown away in my first keto slim down week I was much more strict with it I only had the sausage and mustard and then I only had ghido fluff that I made which was just like cream cheese and jello but this week as you saw I did different variations for dessert and I wasn't quite sure how I was gonna work out but I actually lost almost twice as much weight so in the last keto slim down week that I did I lost 2.8 pounds so my 5 pound weight loss this time was almost twice what I lost the first time so I was pretty blown away by that I'm gonna still play with it and definitely do some things different next week but as of right now I'm really happy with my results and I haven't been feeling like I've been deprived or anything but being able to test my ketones for a couple of different dessert variations was very helpful and then also see if I got kicked out of ketosis but I still lose weight and I know I didn't show it but I had tested my ketones for keto fat bombs from [Music] slimfast and also the peach rings I'll have a product review video coming out showing you those ketone tests but even after having the keto fat bombs and two bags of the patrons which even I thought was a bit excessive but I was still able to lose a full pound from yesterday so that's kind of interesting and I'm gonna keep that in mind during this next week and kind of have those desserts as like a fallback for you know there's some variety because it can definitely it can be hard doing the same thing every day eating the same food every day so I want to have some sort of variety and I've been so scared to have any other dessert options while doing this slim down because Ali MacGraw we had such great results and she didn't like venture out at all so it's like a recipe you know all the ingredients and all the measurements are there and I'm too afraid to alter the measurements at all because I think that like just one little tweak is gonna just mess all of it up and then the outcomes not gonna be the same so I had been worried about doing that in week one but week 2 I was wanting to venture out a little bit because I was struggling a little bit more by being able to have different sweets and having that variety really helped so I'm definitely do that next week I'm going to keep my main meals the same as those hot links because I think that fat is really important in the weight loss results that I'm seeing so I'm gonna continue that but definitely keep an eye out for my week 3 video will probably come out in a couple weeks just because I have a week to do it and then I have to edit it and stuff and editing it actually takes a lot of time I know I'm not the greatest editor but even though it doesn't come out that beautifully it still takes a long time to do so anyways with that being said that is all I have for you guys today a please give this video a thumbs up if you liked it I would really appreciate your feedback drop me a comment if you have any questions about what I did this week or anything keto related I will try and help the best that I can but I really just love talking to you guys and talking anything keto related so definitely drop me a comment I'd love to get to know you guys but I will see you guys in the next one bye", "9byEOvA8-0w": "hello everyone we are back yet again with another week's review it is time for a week's mini review where we help you make sense of your dispensary and in these mini reviews we take smaller size edibles this is a 200 milligram edible and review them in a smaller format than traditional instead of our 30 6120 I just come back with you guys at two hours later and let you know how we're feeling so today we are reviewing something that we have never reviewed before a new brand this is from mcclenney confections quality you can taste and feel we shall see as you said this is a 200 milligram edible handcrafted cannabis nougat and caramel dark Belgian chocolate and it's the dark sneakers I guess kind of like Snickers except dum sounding all-natural ingredients whatever that means 1 to 8 servings we're just gonna have one serving and it says at the top the portions of a portion of donations go to animal shelters in need which is great ok it's got kind of this fancy plastic packaging just sort of unique I've never seen packaging like this for an edible nicely sort of floral rounders just got this odd plastic packaging let's open it up see how difficult is this it's not so bad inside maybe the slightest slightest hint of marijuana smell but nothing that's gonna get you busted that's for sure more of a dark chocolate aroma as it says but let's go to try okay and it's pretty good you can see the nougat and caramel inside there wow that is pretty tasty it tastes kind of like a dark chocolate Snickers bar without peanuts it's good it's very good um I'm eating it refrigerated so it's a little cruel but I like it that way I could get it and suggest you try it that way so in terms of taste Wow those consumed excuse me this gets high marks for taste but the proof is in how high this is gonna give me this this family at 200 milligrams only cost me I believe seven bucks is pretty affordable but we will check back with you guys in two hours to let you know how we're feeling thanks for watching Leakes hi guys I'm back it has been two hours since I had the dark sneakers chocolate bar from mcclenney confections I've really enjoyed it this bad boy only costs me six bucks maybe seven bucks can't remember exactly which but it's a hell of a value good tasting really enjoy the taste no discernible marijuana taste whatsoever I'm pretty quality chocolate I think and over two hours later I'm still feeling pretty stoned so if you see a dark sneakers at a dispensary near you go ahead and grab one you're not going to be disappointed thanks so much for watching wheats we'll check you guys out on the next review", "me8M8379s-o": "what's up guys it's me pick CJ I'm going to eat edibles and then do my makeup I think just for fun for funsies so I have three of these left there indica want us so I think I'm gonna eat those three and then that's thirty minute milah grams and then I think I'm gonna have a big chunk of this because it's supposed to be ten pieces ten milligrams each it melted so now it like all piled into like one corner here so I'm thinking it's gonna have more than just ten milligrams in it but I'll eat a nice little piece of that too and then I'm gonna do my makeup I'm gonna think about what look I want to do one two three I'll eat this big chunk that's scary should I eat this whole thing I don't know how much is in this there's probably like two and a half pieces in here maybe more it's pretty thick and eating about 50 to 60 milligrams of THC right now that was gross okay guys it's been about thirty minutes a little longer than 30 minutes I went ahead and did my eyebrows cuz I need to pluck them and shape them so I browser done already I didn't really pick a makeup look I'm just gonna do it and I got a sunburn so my skin is like different flicking than normal I'm being so quiet why am I being so

colors in it I'm thinking of doing like purple blue we're going with purple I thought I was doing good until now I think I'm gonna do black in this out early I don't know what I'm doing okay this isn't like terrible this highlighter I'm doing the color sapphire [Music] who's what it looks like so far [Music] okay I'm going in with that darker blue [Music] that's the face I've been making this whole time I just got hit with a huge wave what was I doing mm gonna put a little pop of this crazy like seafoam green right here in the corner and put it on the water line why do I make this I can't stop it's done okay my bad actually do some highlight oh my nose here and then oh no I didn't do this ah okay I feel pretty mmm okay I'm just gonna do like a little thing [Music] that love that does not look at that hey little bottom guys guys I look pretty damn good I don't look bad super impressed with myself right now alright let's see if I can apply this [ __ ] lipstick I mean I like beautiful I wish my hair wasn't a [ __ ] rat's nest but then I would do like a whole thing wait I thought I was gonna [ __ ] this up I'm so high right now but maybe you think of it should I wear my

I found it back yeah so while she's eating that thing I think I mentioned a it's 40 milligrams of THC the big old 40 anyway while she's eating that I'm going to show you guys the stuff that I grabbed while we were shopping around at the candy store no I'm not really the candy store Walmart and yes I wore the GoPro and I'd show you guys the footage but this is an edible review video and Walmart was boring as [ __ ] tonight well what does Dollar Tree - and at the Dollar Tree they got these back I bought two packs but I haven't had in a while so I already ate one and it tasted as good as [ __ ] when we're at Walmart as you noticed up on the wall right here I got a little dinky car collection is that would you call them dinky cars hey do they call that do they call them that anymore well I don't know that's what they used to be called Hot Wheels well anyway we found this one here at the Walmart for a buck and a quarter The Dark Knight Batmobile so we'll be sticking that up there I see

out today some exit yeah Mexican Jalapa no M&Ms actually they're Mexican jalapa no peanut M&Ms hopefully you guys can read that my camera's been stoned as [ __ ] lately hey so it gets blurry once in a while so yeah anyway back to the review video here back to what she's doing let me open up these Jalapa no M&Ms I can only smell chocolate in the bag you think that you can smell some of the Jalapa no but you can't probably noticing anything you struggling what's a pop come on they want to see you eat the whole thing to know that you got it into you okay don't taste like it the overall even if it didn't have THC in it and somebody gave you this oh it's doing shivers up my spine all know when you're all high as [ __ ] later you'll be happier these taste like regular peanut M&Ms except for they leave a little bit of a spicy taste in your throat but they're not too bad you probably use a little bit more Jalapa no yeah I'm not if there's any vegans that watch you whatever but definitely not for me you big uns must have a teeth a tasty [ __ ] nothing [ __ ] it all up I [ __ ] up what I was gonna say I was gonna say you vegans must have [ __ ] up tastebuds according to Donna oh I don't know I don't eat vegan food it looks a little [ __ ] I mean it looks okay but then you can't win it looks like it's made out of [ __ ] that you know stuff that'll make you [ __ ] hey we're still smoking the dirty old timid Street weed I had to buy a teeny bit more today tomorrow we're gonna do a review video of either tuna cush or night nurse that's night nurse not night nurse we got a box here from buy my weed online that's Charlie growling if anybody's wondering if we got a box here from buy my weed online no we're not going to open it today we're gonna open it tomorrow morning when they get up and we're gonna do it unboxing of this and at the same time we're gonna do a wake and bake and we're gonna do a review of one of these [ __ ] strains in here and yeah that's Toros video the video after this video so if you want to see that hit the subscribe button and stick around for the next video I do the review for you guys today but you guys know the rules on my channel you got a week and baked with a new strain you know what I mean you can't just smoke some dirty old [ __ ] weed and then start smoking something else and be able to give a [ __ ] a good review you know an honest opinion of how good that strain is you got a [ __ ] you know you're done yeah so yeah once again those 40 milligrams I hope you guys can see it if not [ __ ] go back to the beginning and [ __ ] read it again 40 milligrams of THC [ __ ] we're gonna wait for Donna to get all loopy and we'll be back but first I'm gonna do this bomb talk here because I need to do a [ __ ] bomb toke was there anything you season news today that I don't know because well you can take a quick look if there is there is if there's not does not it's been kind of quiet for like the last three days because I cannot watch yeah I can't do boy that's it's hard to watch Haley and surf the Internet at the same time she's quick she's all over the place you got to stay with her that's the name no rocks missing I didn't see nothing earlier either anyway I'm gonna fill my bowl back up we're gonna wait for Donna to get all loopy and we'll come back with her review of the blue jay bar my review so far on the taste don't don't buy it because you think it's good cuz it's oh she says don't buy it because of the taste like if you thinking but that's only because she doesn't like the vegan stuff if you're vegan that might be for you you go over to can abismo and get yourself a couple you know I think I showed you guys the back egg all you vegans out there might want to see the that this and that's there I don't know if it's gonna come in though hang on give me a second give me a second here there so pause your screen and you can read all the health [ __ ] on there or whatever your nutrition facts and yeah and yeah pause your screen and read that and maybe it's for you hey we should also note that when Donna eats these edibles here she usually gets the really tasty flavored waters like chocolate flavored and vanilla flavored and mint flavored so to get this vegan one here is gonna be quite the difference in taste so keep that mind just saying anyway I'm going to fill up my balls we're going to wait for that ship to kick in and we'll be back with Donna's review or opinion or whatever you got whatever you want to call it you feel it yet a little bit Donna might look a little different because she took a shower well you're wearing different clothes a few seconds ago in our body it sound like I was playing in the mud that didn't make it sound like you're playing in the mud but okay if that's the way you feel are you feeling the did you answer yes and would you say cuz I didn't hear it a little bit she's feeling it a little bit you guys might have noticed an echo in here it's getting worse and worse for the last couple weeks that's because a few months back well maybe almost a year ago Timmins housing sent me a letter saying they were gonna well they offered me some different places how'd that work they gave me a list of [ __ ] places I had to pick three of them that I would like to move to if I was to move because the place I'm in now this place here has too many bedrooms and I don't need that many bedrooms so then we're going to give me another place and throughout the last year or so we've been slowly putting things in the boxes and that's why you notice some stuff here is like bare like some of the stuff that used to be here is not here anymore and my bookshelf that used to be here is gone and my books and all that and some pictures and whatever anyway whatever who cares anyway a lot of my stuff's in boxes right now cuz apparently I'm supposed to got a new place to live in but I don't know what the [ __ ] that's gonna happen if anybody gives a [ __ ] but that's what the echos from would you eat one of these Donna's eating one of these Jalapa no peanut M&Ms it says Mexican Jew Mexican Jalapa dole if that it was any different than normal July but you know like that you're just the worse so it's not fully kicked in yet though it's 40 milligrams you're used to taking 30 did you feel 40 also I wanted to mention over on my Twitter there's a billion different marijuana dispensaries sending me messages asking me about their [ __ ] this and that whatever and I'll get tired of telling everybody if you want me to review your product my [ __ ] address is in the description below send it to me I'll make a video review your product and tell you what I [ __ ] think it's easy stuff a trained dog can do it hey so yeah stop sending me stupid messages and just [ __ ] send me your product then I'll [ __ ] smoke it and tell you what I think and I think that's all I have to say now we're waiting for your review of the [ __ ] vegan bar vegan Bluejays thingamabob the taste is we already heard that you didn't like the taste maybe people are skipping through that part now whatever okay I'm gonna do a bomb dope glad Donna oh forgot my ball earlier oh well okay so oh yeah just it tastes horrible and even when you're done it and it's been a long time the taste is still I don't even want to know what the taste what tasted okay although than the taste everything's going okay everything's going the plan hey Donna yeah I just can't get rid of the taste and it's not like HC taste or yeah I can help you get rid of the taste miss Vicki - laughs little chips don't get rid of the vegan taste in your mouth carpet what the [ __ ] is Hardy carpet not so much you'll enjoy the weekend I will or they will I will why cuz it's supposed to be oh I thought you were saying everybody was gonna enjoy the weekend I was trying to figure out how anyway as I was saying earlier the Edible that she's eaten today it comes from can abismo that's Charlie snoring under the table if you guys are wondering they move this over to the board fucksakes can abismo dot CA you can go there to get yourself some edibles some really good weeds some shades and also uh clothes and hats and all kinds of [ __ ] mostly stuff to get nice and [ __ ] up with a you get nice and stoned if you go there and buy your stuff there they got really good weeds and I thought the batmobile hanging up there now as you guys could see I don't know why I hung it up for I probably should just throw it in the [ __ ] box a pack and stuff up anyways [ __ ] but you gotta remember this is Timmins hosing it's already been a year since they said they were gonna give me another place so I'm gonna be here another year just living my stuff in boxes who knows at least nobody will be able to steal my stuff all my good stuff would be buried and I put all the heavy boxes on top so nobody wants to steal books hey nobody wants to learn any more so my books would be safe we got some chocolate chip cookies from the Walmart they're pretty good but they're kind of tough yes I was baked in store mm-hmm baked in storm that somebody leave them out on the counter overnight these aren't like soft you know what I mean the air got to them somebody forgot about the cookies it's Walmart it probably wasn't really baked in the store it was probably baked into us in it he was probably baked in store somewhere [ __ ] else and then shipped here well wherever that is they left them out too long hmm you don't enjoy cookies like that do ya no I don't home mm-hmm what you gonna eat it anyways well you're not supposed to waste anyways I'm gonna fill my ball back up but I'm getting the munchies I'm gonna make a [ __ ] uh a ham and cheese sandwich and for both yeah I was kind of hoping you were gonna make mine and then you could make one for both how about that anyway I'm gonna fill this up and maybe maybe that'll kick in a little harder and we'll see what happens mm hmm what you don't break a tooth on your hard cookie Donna made me a ham and cheese sandwich and if it wasn't for the mustard I don't think I'd be able to get it down why you so cheap with the cheese and [ __ ] ham I put two slices that's very that is thin meat it's so thin you can almost see through it you put two slices like a still with two slices together I could still [ __ ] see through it and the cheese doesn't even cover all the bread yeah but then you'd have overlapping I like it overlapping so much bread here she's got leftover taco salad if anybody's wondering what the hell are you laughing at the animals kicking in look you have mustard seed yeah I got a mustard sandwich that's what seems like the taco salad that she's eating she made that yesterday if you guys go

bit smaller and go with a 250 milligram animal their lemon sugar cookie really excited about it every canticle I've had so far has tasted great and has exceeded all expectations in terms of potency so this is the lemon sugar cookie and Kanako's signature fancy packaging really really nice packaging look at this box it's got that little nice 250 milligrams sticker beautiful nutrition in four packs

time you have tuned into a week's review the way we do it is I'm gonna eat some measure of it in front of you maybe the whole thing if it's not that big maybe just part of it if it's really really big because I don't want to bore you to death but rest assured I will eat the entire thing and then I'll come back to you guys in about two hours to let you know how I'm feeling because that's the most important part of any edible review it's not necessarily how it tastes all of that is important the most important part is how it makes you feel does it get you high so I'll see you I will eat this and come back to you guys in two hours I'm gonna shut up now open this bad boy up get a smell get a taste all that fun stuff their second layer of fancy packaging here will rip into it okay so here it

of a weed odor but not a lot that's a good cookie there is a bit of a weed taste it at the end but not over a woman not put not not gonna make a gag it's a very rich cook you do Wow dick chewy incredibly rich like a butter cookie okay that's good welcome for your burnishing there so I will see you guys in two hours to let you know how its landing and if it's anything like any of the other

remember how many I've done over the 250s this might only be the second one it's certainly the most potent of the 250s holy hell I can barely articulate what's so great about it umm it's not my favorite tasting I mean it's not bad tasting at all I just don't like blending sugar cookie as much as I like they're like brownie or whatever but it's good for a lemon sugar cookie but it is so oh my god it is kicking my ass I as soon as I sign off here I might have to go take a nap I'm sorry I'm having difficulties just describing why I like this so much umm it's great it's great it's great it's truly wonderful you should if you see it at a dispensary near you and if you aren't opposed to lemon sugar cookies for some particular reason or if you you know if you need something vegan don't go

next video", "VeH8zfDrt9k": "[Music] hi welcome to infuse these the cooking show where everything is infused especially me today we're making lollipops this episode is brought to you by the body fast herbal infuse er you can save money on my favorite herbal infusion machine with the cove ruff house at the urban futurecom here's what you need to make infused lollipops you need 1 cup of granulated white sugar I have a cup of light corn syrup or a quarter cup of water and 2 to 3 tablespoons of infused tincture you can use alcohol or glycerin tinctures 2 teaspoons of flavored extract such as orange lemon mint or whatever flavor you like 6 to 8 drops of food coloring which is optional you'll also need some lollipop molds and a candy thermometer the first step is going to be to make your tincture if you don't have one already and you can use a vegetable glycerin or an alcohol tincture either way though you're going to need to deke are you for 250 degrees Fahrenheit for 25 minutes then put them in the hopper of the mighty fast if you're using that machine and then you're going to add in about a liter of 151 proof alcohol you don't want to go to the hundred ninety or any stronger with the herb oil infuser machine it will burn it up and then you choose the mighty long cycle that'll give you the right temperature so that four hours later you have a nice tincture just like this then you just need to strain it through the provided hemp cloth or whatever cheesecloth however you want to strain it out put it in a jar and then you have your your infused tincture that you can use for any kind of recipes such as this here now we're gonna proceed along now with the rest of the recipe we're gonna take our two sugars our that's both the corn syrup and the white sugar or put those into a very small saucepan I'm gonna put that over a medium to medium-high heat and just let it start melting and you also want ahead and add your water and at this point what we're doing is we're just making all this syrup turn into sort of a simple syrup and then we're gonna bring it up to a boil it won't be long all of yours Sugar's will be cooked together it'll turn real clear and start boiling and at that point you want to start monitoring the temperature make sure you have a candy different a candy thermometer that will go up to over 300 degrees because that's we're gonna do we're gonna boil this it'll take a little while but watch it very carefully because it can get hot really fast once it starts getting hot but as soon as it hits 300 degrees exactly we're gonna take that off of the heat [Music] and then that part we're gonna let it start cooling down now you're going to also monitor the cooling process because when eight hits to 250 degrees Fahrenheit that's where we want to start adding in the rest of the ingredients so I'm adding I'm using orange because I want to orange flavored lollipops here so magadh about two teaspoons of the orange flavoring then I'm also I'm heading in some yellow food coloring a little bit of red food coloring to make the orange lollipops and now I'm adding in the tincture you can use two to three tablespoons here I'm adding two I don't want to be too strong but you can add in two to three and you can evaporate it down if you want to first but it's gonna be okay but you can see now when I start mixing anything together it's still 250 degrees so it's going to start evaporating and bubbling out the remaining water for you already we're just going to continue mixing that down by hand very carefully it's still very hot until you see it'll all incorporate together and become very sort of translucent and sort of unified in color and you need to move pretty quickly here because you don't want to the candy to harden up which it does pretty quickly so you can put the lollipop sticks into the molds in advance and you won't have to be rushing through it like we did there but then we're going to pour that carefully pour the candy into the molds until you cover up the sticks of the lollipops and then after you have all your molds filled up you're gonna let that chill best in the refrigerator or freezer for one to two hours till they get fully hardened [Music] and once they're fully hardened you can pop them out of the shells really easy you can use these silicone molds that I used here they're perfect for this this recipe had filled up three of the molds that came with four in the pack but just filled up three of them came with the sticks if you like that mighty fast herbal infuser and these kind of recipes please

one of my personal favorite edibles which is their chocolate-covered coffee beans yes they make a sativa 5 milligram chokolate covered coffee bean which I am just the biggest fan of so Big Ups to Kiva yeah they work they work they work they work for you know they really work great for speaking of the holidays they work great for holiday gatherings like if you ever have to go yeah I suggest giving every member at the table a little 5 milligram yeah but even if they don't want to partake and you do I promise you there's gonna be one less argument at that table yes everything's gonna taste really good too what something else to that that that I had was was kick cocoa tranquil tea how was that it was actually very relaxing it was for sleep I got it for my dad actually because my dad has Parkinson's and he has trouble sleeping getting to sleep at night and so and he took like he loves tea obviously there's no caffeine in this cuz it's to help you go to sleep and it's it's five milligrams of CBN 3 milligrams THC and it just relaxes you puts you to sleep and it works really really well Wow did you try the flavor what flavor was it it was chamomile valerian sounds like something out of Game of Thrones I'm from house chamomile valerian anyway you know I'd love to hear you know we we're not all over the world we're not all over the country even we're just three people and if you guys have any products you think are fantastic or you know great value please let us know we're happy to talk about them we're happy to try them if we're in the right place I might not get arrested but yeah we'd love to know it's it's a great way of sharing what we what we encounter so we all liked we all would say the Camino gets a lot of points and the name of the tea again Alan was it the brand is Kotoko and it's chamomile valerian is the flavor that I had but they have a bunch of stuff they have synth the sympathy sensual positivity they have all sorts of different stuff for different effects it seems I'm looking at their web so they claim anyway well by the way this is not a paid endorsement this is not a paid or folks this is just us sharing our is with you okay well I'm also back in New York for some work and a visit and I did spend the week upstate in the Catskills in the woods and also had a really delicious gummy this one was a little bit different I think this one comes out of Colorado and it's a company called Incredibles and this was a peach gummy 5 milligrams we were kind of popping them every I don't know six eight hours depending on how the ride was going throughout the course of the weekend and these were also fantastic really manageable it was a good uplifting you know we're communing with each other we're communing with nature we're cooking food having a great time and it really lifted our spirits had us laughing and giggling about so again these great quality products that are available and out there they affect obviously affect people differently some are uplifting some are down lifting so you're just gonna have to get out there and try it but let's start slow yeah five milligrams a great place to start totally enough totally enough just just enjoy the ride these were available out of Massachusetts and but I think the company is out of Colorado look around Incredibles and if you want to find more on them online I love Incredibles com will show you their entire product listening and I guess they're like an old guard you were saying yeah when I when I was running reporting brave new we they were just beginning

elders Charlie and Shelly winninger's you're probably not going to hear this kind of conversation on CNN you're certainly not gonna hear about it on Fox but he's 70 although that's probably where they should be their target demographic yes I guess I don't know he's 70 and he's the author of a new book that will be out this year called listening to ecstasy which you can figure what that's about he's also a psychotherapist she's 68 and a retired RN and listen they've been married for 20 years and they told me point-blank that their sex life has really never been better hmm he's having full-body orgasms amazing men most men don't say that and hers are getting more powerful as she ages at one point in this interview they even said that they knocked Charlie out of bed so what so they use a bunch of substances and this interview will it be exploring many substances because we are a poly substance we are Pro poly substance but they really like cannabis and a little dark chocolate and they're gonna talk about a lot of the secrets that they have learned over the years and if you go on to our our blog and brave new weed calm I also posted a something called a harm reduction call which is if you are gonna use substances that do change the neuro chemistry of your brain it's very useful to take some supplements before during and after a journey that will reduce some of the depression or negative feelings you may have following them everything in the protocol that I posted online is available in a health food store or on Amazon instead of natural supplements about yeah like when you do Molly you come down and well what so the service component really drops right so you can you can you can mitigate that by taking these these up your list a few na RA la I don't know what that is magnesium glycinate vitamin C and grapeseed extract okay now when you're after the journey I've always known about this you take something called 5htp which which again sort of changes the way the body produces serotonin it gives you it makes it much nicer much easier so anyway that harm reduction protocol is posted on the brave new weed site under this episode episode 72 it's a very valuable thing I think okay so in the meantime let's talk to Shelly and Charlie Winton sure so I'm here with Charlie and Shelley winning juror thank you for joining us on the brave new weed podcast folks we're gonna talk about cannabis and sex and aging is what we're gonna talk about today these are topics that are interesting to me and to many of our listeners I just want to introduce you all to the listeners before we begin so Charlie you are a licensed psychoanalyst and you're also the author of a book that will be out in 2020 called listening to ecstasy just tell me in one sentence of what listening to ecstasy is please it's about the transformative power of MDMA and a memoir about our 65 MDMA experiences together and how they've made me a better husband a better psychotherapist and has helped both of us with the aging process that's great and surely you are a retired RN what's your what's your role in this other than the significant other well it all started by being a woman going through menopause and we found we were kind of sad that our sex life is going to kind of be depleted somewhere I I didn't meet Charlie until - until 2000 is this your second are you married i we are we are we are married okay great and is this your second marriage yes okay and you met him in 2009 Oh sex life started declining when four or five started going through menopause I went through it at age 53 uh-huh yes ooh look these are topics that are not often discussed in the mainstream so that's why we have podcasts cuz we get to talk about them freely and openly here so tell us so menopause happens sex life gets to be a bit of a drag or not as interesting or exciting how did you come across cannabis as a possible antidote to this and feel free both of you to talk to us freely well when I met Charlie he told me he was a hippie I had been a hippie during the day and we started smize started smoking with him I do smoke before maybe five times not really so and I raise children working as a nurse you know and life was different for me okay but I found that it made me more sexual and what we did actually I think we added hash to the mix a little bit of hash and it made me even more sexual and that we started playing around with it cured the menopause symptoms the symptoms being pain dryness discomfort no just low libido libido yeah Charlie how about as from the man's perspective here has this helped you in any way in terms of libido or desire I've known about cannabis in specific you are talking about kind of it sure I I mean when we have sex generally the only drug I'm doing is very dark chocolate and Shelley is the one who's smoking because I don't I'm fine and she is she turns me on completely and and and actually more than ever before okay that's great so you're not a cannabis user in terms use it but every now and then I'll use it and make love with it and I I what the only thing I notice is it heightens my sensual pleasure and my orgasms oh great okay yeah so are you guys smoking are you eating what what method of ingestion are you using smoking mostly either vaporizer or regular joint a joint well actually no vaping vaping okay vaping bud or vaping a Candace okay or oil yeah but what I have found what how it works for me especially as I've gotten older it's like noise a noise cancelling headphone it blocks out all the the [ __ ] from the day yep from the day and from like my son called me or my daughter is having problems with the kids and you know with my grandkids cetera and it helps me focus on but on him on Charlie yes and yourself no doubt yes it I listen to the music I listen to my body I'm feeling Charlie whatever he's doing and the love that we have I know the fight we were talking about it I don't know if I would be as responsive it was if it were a casual relationship but because our love is just so deep it just it's like whipped cream on top it's just wonderful that's great that's great I've always thought that it increases the word I use is receptivity so in that that expect goes I like that work as it sort of spans all things be it sex be it music be it food right the things that we know that cannabis does I think it makes us more receptive actually with anything to do with this senses but you think yes how does that work for you Charlie can you be more specific well I mean certainly for music at heightened his musical pleasure anything to the touch anything to the taste so and she looks like I say even better to me than normal so when you know on some good weed we're having sex and I feel like I am strolling into the garden of Shelley so Shelley I have have you told a lot of people about this obviously you're on a podcast I know you've done public appearances on it in New York it shows you talk to your peers about this you talked about other women your age who do you talk to you about how you use cannabis for sex most of my peers that's a good question thank you because I don't work anymore so and I couldn't when I worked I could not talk about it to my coworkers okay because by law just by now legally I was they could report me I could have lose my license right back in those days okay yeah otherwise no difference attacks yeah so I I it was mostly in this psychedelic community I mean we went to a concert in Brooklyn and there was some women who was it Disco Biscuits and we were table is talking after the concert to some women behind me who were younger they were in their like 30s and Here I am in my 60s and I don't know how it came about but we started talking about weed and sex I mean it was a Disco Biscuits concert Disco Biscuits is a yeah our jam band Phish like jam band and Disco Biscuits it's actually named after an old term for ecstasy okay but we were smoking smoking pot so you know it know you're taking ecstasy as well probably we were that night yes okay that does tend to enhance conversational bill you know was a conversation right yes so do you guys use it I just want to finish that god yes because with you were talking to these women about it and I was noticing that they were they start surrounding her in a rapt attention they were all like 20-somethings and they were fascinated by how as they get older they don't have to stop they don't have to stop rocking and rolling and they don't have to stop smoking and they and their sex life can still be as alive as ever they don't have to stop rocking and rolling or smoking and screwing okay I don't what I don't want you to feel inhibited we are an open podcast I say we want no advertisers are gonna drop because we don't have an advertiser but so it's a lot to talk about here there's cannabis there psychedelics how do you use so you're smoking what kind of sex do you find is enhanced with cannabis for example I know that I tend to get dry mouth if I'm inhaling so it doesn't it takes me a while to sort of like get get kissing back back in order got up to speed you have any do the create any issues for you no that's good the only thing is sometimes I do have to smoke a little bit more than if I want to just relax I need to get a little higher you need to get higher yeah that's what needs to be that's your noise-cancelling yes it doesn't mean I'm not present and it also depends what kind of pot I'm smoking what kind of weed I'm smoking or whether it be sativa or indica what do you notice the difference ah well with a sativa even though the Charlie's like oh sativas best for sex I was using sativa and I was having problems it wasn't helping and it's making you too anxious no no it just wasn't making me as orgasmic Oh once I started adding indica making it like a hybrid whether it be a vape or vaping a combination of different weed I became much more receptive and more orgasmic cuz it changed the quality of your orgasms and can you describe that really it just makes it easier easier mmm I'll tell you what I've experienced on this end from her yes I know and this is just you know very subjective and I don't know exactly what she's experiencing of course but it seems to me that is she gets older her orgasms get more intense because that that's what it's been like and more frequent than when we first started almost almost 20 years ago Wow more powerful would you say yeah the one thing I do find because these substances are powerful sometimes after having I call them orgs so they're like little orgasms sometimes I'll have larger orgasms but many times most of the time actually afterwards I still have a lot of excess energy inside me and Isis after I'm done he's finished I wait a few minutes sometimes some I'm listening to the music and I'm like I'm not finished you finish that a certain point in life and yes we do and but those because they come fairly quickly and I mean I'm using more stimulation a strong vibrator and it's like BAM and my whole body he can feel it a full body organ yeah he can feel it after times it knocks me out of the bed and it's not that the vibrator is you know a better lover than Charlie because it when I I don't think I could do it unless Charlie helped me but it just gets that energy out if somebody was to come to you and say look I'm in my 60s I want to have better sex with cannabis what would your recipe be either one is a play with different kinds of cannabis whether indica sativa or hybrid and smoke enough or eat enough whatever you want to do where your your high start that way or start low and then if it doesn't help just get a little higher and music helps again let's talk about music for a because you've now mentioned music both of you several times what's what's the playlist chill out 2016 it's there the trip hoppy kind of music that I put it on shuffle oh we on Spotify or we on Pandora what are we on here well Pandora we do trip up okay but this I have Amazon music so I can download different of different albums the plug for Amazon music will work for Amazon I'm thinking of switching over because they don't have everything I want but in the meantime they have this one album 30 30 songs I shuffle I sometimes I'll say I never heard that song before and because it's just shuffling and sensual and exotic music sonic erotic it's edgy 0-7 is another is a group that has some albums and they're very edgy and what I what I do is when I'm listening to the music I kind of pretend well now we're talking about a little bit of fantasy I go for it I pretend that I'm in a movie and or in a in a in a place and the whatever music I'm hearing that's what in my mind I'm surrounded by whether it's if it's Eastern I'm surrounded by colors you know from rugs like like you know in a tent if if it's like a Scottish kind of thing I'm I'm with a fireplace it just just helps me set the mood so it also sounds like cannabis somehow stimulates your imagination as well as your your vagina and other organs is that correct yes absolutely absolutely cannabis is great for well it's it's notoriously good for creativity and I used to use it creatively now I can access I write a lot so I access my creativity and just like I said with dark chocolate but interestingly cannabis and dark chocolate are two of the world's most complex chemicaly chemicaly complex organs or or substances I should say but yeah certainly when I'm high my imagination runs wild they both stimulate the under cannabinoid system they both have an effect on the under cannabinoid system I'm not quite clear I don't think anybody quite knows how they affect it but it's quite interesting to look at is there any particular sexual act that you've been more prone to exploring has cannabis opened your your your I want to say your your sexual imagination in any way are you comfortable talking about this just um finding different parts of my body that I know are reactive but like on my breasts but even more so anything anything goes and I will tell you just to tell you if we're talking about a combination of psychedelics with with pot yes let's just just standing at a concert over this summer listening to music and just moving back and forth I hadn't or against what psychedelic was that MDMA and wheat they go well together did you go well together but I want to ask Charlie do you find that MDMA is a sexual stimulant as a man good question thank you it's it's a double-edged sword I think it is to Tommy I find it frankly more difficult to get or stay hard on MDMA similar but there's something I can take for that right yeah I do that if we're gonna have sex I will do two things I'll take a cialis and I'll smoke and both those things will will help me stay hard and also if I if I smoke enough the MDMA is if I'm not at the height of the roll I can come got it so lots of I went to the maps conference this year in New York I know you were there - I saw you're there and there's lots of information about MDMA and its ability to increase empathy right I mean obviously ecstasy I think you know this was when it first came out they called it empathy but right really a great brand right people didn't really go there so ecstasy worked much better yeah how do you find the connection of empathy and and physical pleasure how does let's make let's sort of draw some connections there they're not necessarily connected well for us they are I mean it's like I don't know it's like the difference between you know the part of Wizard of Oz where all of a sudden they enter Oz and things go from black and white to color yes well it's sort of like that so when when the MDMA comes on whether we're smoking or not it just heightens the intimacy between us and our kisses are more the less delicious and and and a touch is more remarkable and astonishing and so it just heightens everything and that is where the sensuality is heightened it heightens the heart-to-heart connection yes I find the same but so let's talk a little about your book please listening to ecstasy oh okay if you don't mind how many trips did you do 68 we've we've we make it called rolling over also 65 about 65 rolls that that we have done together over how many years over about 1516 years so it's like four or five times a year and can we talk about what got you going on this ah Shelly I had given up MDMA by the time I had met her but she said you know she was just out of a what'd you want to talk about it she was just out of a long hard difficult marriage and she wanted to spread her wings and when she found out that I was interested in psychedelics she said I want to try ecstasy people told me about it I want to try this so I said all right it's and I I had given it up I I didn't know about the protocols at the time and how to make it a safe and rewarding journey so I turned her on and decided to do it again with her and we learned about how hydrating and keeping ourselves hydrated during the experience we learned about 5htp afterwards too - we've never had what they call the Tuesday blues never did it never but we regulate the dosage we get a lot of sleep the night of so we're very careful and we've we've followed the protocols and since then I mean it's it's just it's add icing to our cake you said that but it must have added more if you're writing a whole book about it but before you go there I want to ask you what is the correct dosage of 5htp to kill those Tuesday blues well if you make that measurement that's a good question III don't know what it might be for you for us we take 200 milligrams the night of and another 200 milligrams the following night at that time not in the morning no we do the night of at bedtime for two nights that's what that's what works for us Shelley I just wanted to say one thing something interesting I have coronary artery disease I have a six stents and when I tell people that they're like what and you you take MDMA and I cleared it with a expert a physician who's an expert on ecstasy and this doctor said just take a beta-blocker MDMA has some amphetamine in it so it'll speed you a beta-blocker makes your heart go slower so and I'm on beta-blockers anyway so I just take an extra one I've never had a problem you've never even had a symptom or anything when we're rolling and that's something that people older people especially with their medical problems it doesn't mean it's a life sentence of abstinence not necessarily I mean some people with some heart problems you definitely should stay away from it and if you really have a high blood pressure issue MDMA will increase your blood pressure slightly but often the medical community is a little hysterical about things like MDMA and so but don't take our word for it check with your doctor if you have a have an issue good good good warning right there are good disclaimer but let's go back to other things that listening exes to ecstasy other topics may be that you're broaching other than sex it really has helped me and both of us I believe with the aging process well that's it know about that a little bit well for one thing you know Minh my time comes I am NOT going to have too many regrets with or with the I mean I've lived a full life and can't continue to live a full life but MDMA makes it even richer and more complete and so I know that I and we are living life to its fullest so just from an existential point of view we're choosing to live a very full life that is not in the norm and and and gives us four or five times a year walks in heaven together and that is an interesting it's an interesting way to look at it but it's a way of preparing for one's demise to tool it to know that the one has lived fully and but also it just helps me because it helps with transitions as I'm listening into older age psychedelics and an MDMA in particular it just helps me get get it get be at peace with the changes that are occurring I think that's crucially important I'm thinking about these things a lot now as as I begin aging or ternal there are two opening let's say opening a new narrative how's that okay and you know I mean it's a struggle it can often be a struggle especially when you're beginning to sort of recognize oh I don't recover as quickly right I don't hear as well or I may lose my balance the things that want I don't have all those issues but you know for people I know my pot my parents did certainly you watch it always hit you as a bit of a surprise doesn't it yes it does and I'm wondering how you know psychedelics I mean obviously I know I know the studies that have shown that it helps people who are really at end-of-life deal with end of life yes people with cancer and they know they're dying especially we just know we know we're dying on a different scale rising on a slower more more gradual yeah scale right they're giving in studies famous John and hop Johns Hopkins study over ten years ago where they gave psilocybin which is magical mushrooms to two people who are at the end of life and it it helps them deal with faced their mortality and quell their anxiety you know yeah yeah and they're giving it to other people who are very mature who are who are well and they're coming back and saying this was one of the most profound experiences of my life and they follow up a year later and they say that was one of the most profound experiences of my life so a lot of doubters would say you're you're taking psychedelics which is a complete sign of your craziness it's obviously gone to your brain and obviously I'm not one of those people yeah how do you address that that sort of response there is I would say to that person you know if I was exposed to the same drug war information that you've been exposed to all your life without any opposing point of view I would believe the same thing there's been a lot of hysteria around that and around psychedelics I rock your brain they burn your spinal fluid they destroy your chromosomes all this has been debunked but the media doesn't follow up with the debunking story so it gets a bad reputation I also gets bad reputation from people who abuse the drug and you know if you like I say if you abuse MDMA it will return the favor you know if you do too much or if you do it too often it's it's going to hurt you but that's why you have to follow the protocols as I outlined in the book you should never do more than 120 milligrams that at one time and halfway three hours later you can do another half of that amount you've got to stay hydrated and you've 5-htp and getting the sleep that you need and and and after you do it especially if you're over 40 you shouldn't do it again for at least a four to six weeks do you choose ceremonial occasions do you or do you create your own ceremony around them we well let's put it this way we don't sit around on a Saturday night and with nothing to do and say gee why don't we take some whatever little let's drop some acid let's take some mushrooms we don't do that everything is plant when we go on on trips out of the nut nuts like Delic chips but regular trips yes like what vacations like vacations we do often do psychedelics in fact our most the it wasn't the first probably my third or fourth time doing MDMA we went to a place in British Columbia called Butchart Gardens and it was the most beautiful garden I have ever ever seen I'll bet it was and every time we when we travel we were in Barbados one year and we went to a botanical garden couldn't compare so so with jug garden this is like our gold standard so we're often checking out places to see what can be our next gold standard we also will if it's New Years Eve sometimes New Year's Eves will spend at home and we will plan an experience around that this New Year's Eve we're gonna be second time in a row we're going to be celebrating with a few friends and eighteen other thousand people in Madison Square Garden at a Phish concert oh so that's so great I thought we were going to say eighteen friends at an orgy experienced yet yeah we have it all right you know I'm not sure psychedelics or cannabis lent to that they are more intimate in using experience correct yeah and I know they're certainly orgies that occur within the MA and have you been to any well we did we wouldn't that we didn't have sex with anybody else but we went into the there's an a regional burn a burning man light experience called the Philadelphia Experiment or PEX and we went into the sex tent that pecks one one one night and it kind of blew us away no pun intended it was like a just a an extraordinary experience what we saw there and you'll have to wait for the book to read the details now that's a good two years but let's just say when we entered it we knew we weren't in Kansas anymore it was one of the most remarkable experiences of our lives and it's still every now and then I'll get back to it in your mind in your cannabis fueled imagined absolutely have you had either of you had any negative experiences using cannabis with sex as it made you overly thinkI or overly cautious or overly paranoid III do notice that I can get into my head and get lost there when I'm smoking the way out for me and this just works for me I don't know for anyone else is to get into the body and into the into my senses as I'm a gestalt psychotherapist and Fritz Perls who innovated and created Gestalt therapy said lose your mind and come to your senses so with cannabis if I focus out if I get to get out of my head I'll get into making love to this gorgeous woman I will get into the music that we're listening to I'll taste some rich chocolate anything sensual helps me get out of my head taking a bath sure absolutely hot bath hot shower absolutely sauna on the sea swimming in the in the ocean we want to swim we were on a cruise and it where it was freestyle dining so at dinner time like six seven o'clock there was an indoor pool we were we were the only ones and we we just had the pool to ourselves and they had lights and under underwater and it was beautiful beautiful amniotic sac experience yes yes absolutely yeah any other revelations that have occurred to you about cannabis and sex I mean you guys go out you talk about it public if kids by the way I do so they obviously know that mom is talking about having sex at the age of six what do they say well they don't know too much about me talking about sex they do know that that I do psychedelics my daughter actually had a misconception she thought that I was doing drugs and I just recently ahead all the time yeah like all the time I said I have to tell you I only I done LSD once every two years same with magic mushrooms once every two years MDMA four to five times a year and and she smokes more weed than I do so you know it and I said and that's it she said oh I thought died for some reason I thought you did other things I'm like no well it is you know look I think one of the very effective propaganda tools of the drug war is to put all substances in one bucket yes yes and make no distinction between them and make no distinction for Responsible use versus whatever other countries there is other people will disagree with me they'll all say you know all drugs are good and human beings should be able to put whatever they don't want in their body I mean I have a slightly different opinion about that because I've seen people go off the deep end sure a lot of feda mins and I mean it's not always been pretty that way and I know enough people who work in substance abuse clinics to know that addiction is one real problem I think that substances we're talking about here have never been shown to be in any way addictive or physically debilitating right right everyone draws a line somewhere when it comes to drugs but there's another issue there are people who to them what we're doing it is almost sacrilegious they feel that these these medicines medicine these medicines should be sacred and just used for sacred for ritual or or spiritual enlightenment like people who who will do ayahuasca or magic mushrooms for for spiritual development and so there are those who on the other side will judge us for using something like the like using mushrooms or LSD or MDMA or cannabis for recreational purposes and I like to say that fun joy play these can be transformative experiences I I I don't take that lightly I think that's a really important conference really important point fun is psychologically healthy I think another thing when when we talk about it with a group with groups and I say well I don't usually set an intention but what I do is especially if we're out in the park or something I learn not learn but I really appreciate nature i reaiiy appreciate what we have here on this earth so even a blade of grass or a little flower i'll see there's no question so so even though I say I'm doing it for recreationally I'm learning I'm appreciating and that's important to me also I prefer from to recreational which which sounds too many years as trivial frivolous and frivolous I prefer the word celebrational I like that so you look at these as celebratory experiences you make sex a celebratory experience you make a holiday or a yes walk through nature as a celebration yeah yes I love though I think it's really gorgeous let's end on that note Charlie and Shelley winter I'm so glad you came by to talk to us on the brave new weed podcast I want to end it but is there anything else you want to tell us or do want to discuss there anything we haven't brought up in this rather wide-ranging well interesting you use that term I have found that with psychedelics and and with cannabis it's wider ranging that when I was a younger man because of what I learned from set about sex from other guys I thought that sexual pleasure was really limited to my penis or just the tip of my penis yeah little one-inch that's right think about it it's like it's it's so limiting and and so what these substances have taught me is that there's a wider area of pleasure and that my whole body can I mean I want so twice in my life had full-body orgasms I've been really yeah yeah so but when when using any of these substances I can experience intense sexual pleasure and orgasms throughout the entire it's often through the entire pelvic area from my belly button down to my knees I'm like having an orgasm let's learn dog that no because what could be better thanks again folks so glad you joined us thank you thank you hi listeners we are always on the lookout for great things

of things that you've done or leads on books or products that we should know about you can always contact us at brave new we've cast at gmail.com [Music] alright gentlemen here we are yeah we've just heard that interview what a conversation what do you think I think it's great I think it's great first and foremost just from the most base level of people being able to talk about sex just in the same way that we have experienced prohibition of cannabis and other substances by nature Western society especially in the United States has this weird mental prohibition about talking about sex I think that because so many of us were raised in the church and had this morality beat into us or abstinence only education in public schools we just have this massive shroud of mystery and sort of general kick about talking about sex and one of the things that I've learned in in moving to Germany is that you get away from that moral abuse I'm gonna say and and and people are better about talking about sex people are better about communicating what they like what they don't like what works for them what doesn't work for them sex positivity is a thing in the world and needs to be a bigger thing just like talking about cannabis normally and normalizing it if we can talk about sex normally and have it just be a normal thing that people do because we we all do it or we all want to do it one way or to bury it and hide it and say oh it's dirty and it's immoral and you shouldn't do it because God says or because you know people will talk about you you know we got to get past that mentality and I think it mirrors cannabis prohibition in a lot of ways to be able to just freely talk about our sex lives thank you Matt what struck you the comment on that I want to lump therapy into that mental have Salou mental health as well our culture just the generation of you know 40 and above like our parents generation 50 and above I guess at this point just don't want to talk about mental health it's bearing it barrier to hide it and then it's all it's like don't enjoy yourself don't express how you want to feel it and I just like how you know there are many things I don't like about Millennials but one of the things I do like about Millennials is it there's like well in therapy let me tell you about what we just talk - yeah we're getting to a good point anyway about that interview it was very very interesting to me her comments on menopause because I've as a man who has a partner who has not gone through menopause I don't know much about it and it's going to come oh yes it will I'll tell you about buck yeah of course I will and and for me you know like libidos can change after childbirth and libidos change obviously during menopause and so for me to my question was about like whether or not orgasms are affected and I guess that's an orthogonal conversation too - libido so you can still have powerful orgasms and and have things to amplify and sustain that side of your body while doing things the other conversation is how do you have the sex drive back to then want to have the origins and how do you keep the intimacy factor going right I mean that's that's not easy after 20 years we all know that if you don't know it let me assure you it's not easy okay so I I thought that they were very bold and very brave to come on and talk about this I'm so glad they did and I want to remind you all that this episode was brought to you by 420 summit which is part of the YPO organization young presidents organization or to actually but here's how you do

you that you have tried hard but no one explained to you something about your biochemistry you understand that during this program no more fatigue no more lack of libido no more thinking that your answer to your inner beauty comes from outside we're going to dispel these myths and set the record straight it's about time why me why a man discussing an issue on health well for one reason for the past 40 years of my life i've watched how women have been treated by the mass media by the medical community everything evolves from something in the past that we almost never understand if you went back into the middle ages you'd find that women were really not allowed to go to school they couldn't have higher educations in most areas of the world they were prevented from being in guilds and crafts and learning things as a result what was considered sacred which was knowledge was given to men only so women did what they could they raised their families and some women learned about midwifery they learned about herbs in fact almost every village the person who did much of the healing locally was the local herb women and they mastered this craft and they helped a lot of people so it's not difficult then to understand over the centuries how those few women who tried to lead and educate were always persecuted they were always martyred and it's not even until the late 1800s that we started to see any school allow women even in for any position and it was not until the beginning of the century that women actually became physicians and then it was rough form they said hey if i'm a woman and i'm a physician i'm going to honor healing and healing has to be whole body mind spirit environment emotions one of the things that i suggest that you pay attention to is the relationship that you create with your attending physician and why not look at to see if you can participate in your own healing process where you're not just going in like heal me i'm a broken part you know my brain's not working something in my arthritis my you know i've got an ovarian cyst i've got amenorrhea dysmenorrhea uh i've got depression what am i gonna do from a woman's perspective a woman is now aware that she is a dynamic wonderful integrated being and everything is in balance disease only exists where there is a lack of balance when you have a lack of balance you have conflict conflict then manifests as symptoms by the time you see the first symptom it might be 20 years of conflict when the doctor says hey you're lucky we caught the breast cancer early you say from the woman's perspective no doctor you caught it late in some areas doctors are superior than other forms of healing i'm not bashing medicine i'm not attacking doctors i support good medicine and good doctors i've had 15 000 physicians on my radio show what i don't like is medicine that doesn't honor the need to change when it's shown that it should and doctors who are are leading with their ego where they're not willing to listen to you because you don't have their education so how could you know as much as they know so from my perspective i support surgery when it's necessary emergency medicine look if you got a heart attack if you had you know if you if you needed something as critical care we've got the best medicine in the world here it's the chronic care that we miss out on we all have to be honest about what causes disease including our environment when it's polluted our diet when it's misguided our emotions the levels of our stress all these factors impact upon whether or not you're going to get sick and how sick and to what degree when we talk about women's health issues right at the top of the list has to come heart disease for simple reason it's the number one killer of women when you look at the 50 million americans who suffer from post-stable hypertension high blood pressure a lot of those are women we don't deal enough in our society with nutrition and heart disease and certainly stress and heart disease and here's what's unique we now know and there's no question about this that if you have a stressful thought anxious thought angry thought you immediately over stimulate the production of stress hormones those stress hormones like epinephrine norepinephrine cortisol adrenaline those are only meant to help you for a few seconds to flee right they're not meant to be with you all day long the body cannot distinguish between you're being you know under a bad day because you heard something you didn't like over the telephone or you're just not feeling good about something and suddenly you're killing yourself every negative thought you have every stressful thought cascading now if you had no skin and you could look into a transparent body and you could see all these trillions of biochemical processes every second and they were destructive you could see the cells dying because of cortisol heading you could see your brain chemistry changing because of cortisol when you start when you start playing with the brain and the brain chemistry you really get into some deep water because when you start thinking stressful thoughts normal brain chemistry shifts and now you've got negative brain chemistry whereas if you thought positive thoughts happy thoughts constructive thoughts empowering thoughts motivating thoughts then the brain chemistry elevates up because the hormones you're secreting are all constructive hormones not destructive that's why when we say you know you're killing yourself from stress you know that's what we mean you literally do kill yourself and women are under enormous amount of stress and chronic stress day in and day out so dealing with stress is a crucial part of the healing process and one that cannot be avoided or denied anymore the trouble is we've never practiced prevention in our culture the way it should be the doctor is looking for obvious gross problems but unless he does detailed examination they'll never know how sick you are they can't seek your arteries clogging up you could have clogged arteries for 25 and 30 years getting smaller and smaller and smaller and then one day your arteries like that your blood pressure is having a hard time getting through there boom stroke you're only going to find the first symptom that you're sick with a heart attack or a stroke or a tumor or enlarged enlarged ovary that's the first time you know something's wrong otherwise you think you're healthy prevention is the key prevent it you will not look like your mother did or feel like your grandmother did when you're at the same age you'll be able to reverse that process down i want to share with you some protocols that i've created that have helped other people with heart disease and do them in stages i understand that not everybody can do everything and i'm not suggesting you have to do everything but i am suggesting that if you really take your time and you take one step at a time and you decide for instance that with these protocols you're going to do at least some of this every single week and you're going to move more in every month so it might take you a year before you do everything on a protocol so you understand me i'm not saying do everything all at once tomorrow right but do it gradually even with the bad things for example all right i know you're not going to give up everything in your cupboard right you're not conditioned to do that you're not conditioned to go home right now open up the cupboard and throw everything in this in there out because i'll bet you don't have a good thing in your cupboard all right but there's nothing in there i'll bet your cockroaches are even dying prematurely you've probably got cockroaches sitting here with high blood pressure cancer their diet and the fat in your diet fats are not bad i'm not suggesting a fat-free diet men women go on these fat-free diets wrong and unhealthy you want to have a healthy heart and i'm going to get into this protocol you've got to get rid of the animal fats and put in the vegetable fats olive oil i'm not even going to restrict you in olive oil all right and flax seed oil i want you to have this stuff this is healing and oil of primrose and walnut oil and avocado oil plenty good oils to eat but because they have essential fatty acids our body can use to help protect our heart that's right and the oil of salmon did you know that salmon oil helps protect your heart from heart attacks lowers your blood pressure is great for hormone balance do you know one of the best things in the world to help your hormone balance is oil of primrose those are the oils we want and in california the seventh-day adventist did a study and found that those seventh-day adventists that consumed five ounces a week of walnuts or almonds had a tremendous drop in heart disease all right something simple one item walnuts and almonds but when was the last time you had a handful of walnuts because you're oh there's fat in there good fats but you'd sit right down eat one of those big steaks and be on a high protein diet bad for you don't eat it now there are other things that will help you if you have heart disease i'm just going to give you a list and there's good literature out there there's good reading that will help you in your journey this is all based on good science and terrific uh clinical experience these are all natural nutrients one is called coenzyme q10 it gives extra energy to the heart it builds up your immune system it's powerful between 100 and 300 milligrams a day whoa could we help people with heart conditions vitamin e 400 800 units vitamin b1 25 to 50 milligrams vitamin c buffered from 1000 to 5000 milligrams and then once you can reach 5000 milligrams a day then start upping it and also by the way vitamin c is great for diabetics cancer heart disease it's the overall best single nutrient you can take into your system vitamin c is so good also it's good for your skin too because this skin is held together by collagen the connective tissue and collagen is synthesized and made better with vitamin c so when you're smoking drinking eating a processed diet there's no vitamin c in it and as a result your skin begins to sag and free radicals create the wrinkles and you start getting that kind of ruddy look vitamin c changes all that now l-carnitine l-carnitine is an essential nutrient that also protects the heart i would suggest anybody who has heart disease consider l-carnitine generally between 500 to 1500 milligrams now as a runner as an athlete i always take l-carnitine before i work out and cones i'm q10 and finally lecithin lecithin is essential too unless there comes some soy and it's ground up soy and there's so many good benefits is soy and don't forget their stress management being able to do oh let's say relaxation techniques let me just show you a simple relaxation technique when you really get stressed close your eye just close your eyes eye when you close your right eye you're closing down on that left side of the brain and breathe deep and by deep diaphragmatic breathing put a hand on your belly and hand on your chest now when you breathe deep and you let that hand on the belly come out first breathe in now your chest now exhale through the belly exhale through the chest and you do that about five or six times a deep diaphragmatic breathing that will help relax you because you're increasing the ability to de-stress the brain by enhancing brain hormones this is all for your heart i'm suggesting this new millennium you come first your health your well-being so that there is no re reason to have disease because you're not doing anything that creates conflict within yourself disease manifests in the presence of conflict look at where conflict exists and resolve it prevent it and then you won't have heart disease you'll have a vital heart that'll last you 150 years i'd like to share information with you now on a very serious topic and that is breast cancer breast cancer drives a stake in a lot of women's hearts because it's so terrifying rarely has a conditioned been such that women feel helpless when they get it and so i'm going to give you some tools that you can use to re-empower yourself first the idea of early detection as the primary way of determining your chance of surviving it that's only part of the story second the idea that if you should be told that you have cancer then by all means get the treatments generally surgery and chemotherapy and radiation and always get a mammogram at least on an annual basis depending upon your age as a way of helping you prevent the cancer from early detection if women begin the changes of lifestyle changes in getting rid of the pesticides in their diet taking the healthy phytochemicals now there's the key there is the key to breast cancer why do you think that the japanese women do the japanese women have a different breast different tissue in the breast no they have 400 less breast cancer why is it they're not getting breast cancer in japan and in china in indonesia in the philippines as they are here because a they're eating a soy based diet a vegetarian diet primarily they have lots of grains nuts seeds legumes and lots of sea vegetables the average american woman has no sea vegetables ever kombu wakami nori hajiki sea vegetables you can buy them in your local market we're not eating them because we don't know about them now exercise exercise aerobic is crucial because when you increase the aerobic quality get your pulse up right and to get you really healthy so by aerobic exercise cancer does not manifest easily in a high oxygen environment but when you're sedentary and you're smoking and taking alcohol and eating sugar things that create an acid base in your body acid it's not good you want alkaline and that's what you get from a vegetarian diet and exercise all right cleanses the body you get toxins out of the body faster and you burn them up get them out and you also want to detox now when i talk about detoxification i'm not talking about alcohol i'm talking about cleansing the system everyone i work with now for the first six months i put them on a cleansing program first it's eliminate you must eliminate all the things that are bad for you all right you know what they are you know all the pastries and the candies and the sugar and the ice creams and and the coffee and the bagels and the hamburgers hot dogs french fries and you think my god gary that's all i eat there's nothing left well that's the problem that's why you're sick because that's what you do eat and throw in occasionally an orange and think you're doing something good and you don't take an organic apple you take a regular apple and they put paraffin wax which is the cancer causing agent on there and then you smoke for your nerves why you didn't smoke before but the doctors and commercials in the 1940s and 50s says women need to smoke for their nerves do you know the tobacco industry gave millions and millions of cigarettes free during the first world war in the second war to get service people to start smokes every time you saw a serviceman you saw him with a cigarette right so the idea was oh good you know all american quality smoke think about every movie you've ever seen right go back betty davis joan crawford norm norma shear toulou blanc had they all had a cigarette and they had a drink it was either alcohol or coffee always my parents your parents they watched this these were the role models so they didn't think anything was wrong with my parents smoke they were nice people your parents were nice people i couldn't get my mother stop smoking or my father stopped smoking my father died at 50 my mother died at 58. he of uh cancer and she have a heart attack 58. yet they thought they were doing okay because well gary they would say if smoking were that bad um and what you're saying to die is that bad why didn't our family doctor say it to stop i said because look at the family doctor he smokes and drinks needs this stuff he's not going to tell you to stop doing with he's not willing to stop himself i said it's not good for you and i couldn't get him to stop okay but maybe you'll think twice about this so we've got to cleanse the system juicing start with one glass of vegetable juice per day and build up and it can be celery and cucumber your favorite green and even aloe vera and with vitamin c in it and that's terrific as a detoxifying and watermelon juice cleanses that system out great for you also lemon and lime terrific also helps prevent cancer so take some watermelons put in the whole lemon meaning the skin and the seed because it also helps you with your candida the yeast intestine and bacteria helps cleanse them out now let's go to the mind-body connection with cancer norman cousins wrote an interesting book and in that book he had a disease that was not reversible medically and he showed that by thinking funny thoughts and watching marx brothers films it changed how he felt and ultimately he was able to overcome his condition that's how powerful the mind is well think from a woman's perspective all of the different thoughts that will give you a sense of completeness wholeness an integrated sense of self that you haven't used think of your attitude if you have an attitude that you're a victim you're overwhelmed you're overworked you're not honoring your own life maybe you went to school maybe you got a career and and you did it all right you did everything you were told to do you did not disobey anyone and then one day you wake up and you're still feeling alone and disconnected does that happen to any of you you think hold on i work so hard i've done everything why why do i still feel empty and you know what women frequently do when they feel empty work more get busy but move more things they never stop for that moment of unconditional quality of self because if you're all alone and there's no distractions there's no noise phones nothing else except you then you've got to come to grips with you so what if you just started to say okay okay here's what it comes down to if i've lived my life up to this point and if i do not feel fulfilled then i'm going to change my perception and perspective about who i really am i'm going to start honoring the real self not the conditioned self not the social self not the you know the self that everybody is relied upon i'm going to honor the real self you are what you eat that's a very real phrase and you are what you drink and what you smoke and what pills you take they all affect how you feel and how you ultimately look i know you want to look your best and you want to look younger next i'll help you get beyond how the media is telling you how to look how addictions can aid you and how to rid yourself of them stop the extremes of dieting and stress and deal with chronic fatigue syndrome and save thousands of dollars in cosmetics and still look beautiful and slow down the aging process do you think you're beautiful by what standards well if you're the average woman and let's say you're 35 already based upon how we treat beauty in this country you're looking in the mirror and you're somewhat concerned because you're no longer 20. and if you're the average man looking between a 30 and a 20 year old woman or a 40 and a 30 year old woman you're looking for the younger woman shouldn't be that way but we're told unless you're thin almost anorexic unless you have a perfect body that's flows both breasts have to be absolutely equal both sides your face equal your lips flush and pure eyes like a little dove and a long beautiful body that somehow you're imperfect a woman has to do somersaults to try to show that she is acceptable that she has something special what if the woman could be anything they want you know they could be overweight they didn't have to take care of their hair or face or makeup or anything but the guys had to have a perfect body they had to have an abdominal muscles you could do your laundry on right they had to have no fat had to have a perfect rear muscles flawless face perfect nose perfect teeth perfect lips articulate and be sensitive kind emotionally available how many men could honor that you know one i don't know one right why do we have to have a double standard why can't we simply say that is really immaterial how beautiful you are it is the beauty of your spirit is the beauty of your nature that counts you go putting all that gobbledygook on the face go look in the average woman's medicine cabinet my god it's like a witch's brew in there look at it there's 13 000 bottles right you spend a fortune all this stuff and for what everything you put on the body doesn't change how you feel about yourself it only changes temporarily how you think you look [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you", "4PhUEFnvfLc": "hello everyone it's the trash man hopefully I don't get interrupted again because I've already tried to make this three times ready and I keep getting interrupted we are trying some candy today we have three different flavors because you know I like to try three different things we are trying clays candies since 1919 we got a bunch of different flavors here we have ends eye or however you say that n sigh or something like that we have root beer then we have watermelon okay so let's see if we can get it this time before we get interrupted again these little candies right here I don't know if you guys can see like the little sugar coating so apparently that was picking the 1919 I don't really know this one's not that bad I've tried them yesterday when I got him so I wanted to make sure that was interested in them before or trade them this one kind of has like a black licorice sort of deal and that's kind of weird because they they have a black licorice one and also kind of has like uh like a clove sort of flavor to but it definitely you can definitely taste like a licorice eat thing going on there so it's not bad but it's like a subtle black licorice sort of deal I could only imagine on the black licorice so I'm gonna stay away from that one I like black licorice but I mean this is as far as I'll go because this is just it's perfect so oh yeah you getting that crunch it's really good candy I wasn't a big fan of this one yesterday but yesterday I would have given her about a three I'm gonna give it about a seven this time it's sat in the car overnight so it's not bad so next one we're gonna try is the root beer flavored one oh no I'm just making a taste testing video so no I got old fashioned candies hmm well that's probably from Kelly's vape juice so this one is the work beer that's more of a brownish flavor color the inside was more of a reddish color and it still has like that we can see all the sugar hmm hmm I really can't taste the Ripper in this one now because I had this one first okay yeah I can get the Ripper flavor now it's it's good it almost sounds like wow that's good I almost feels like an A&W sort of deal but then there's like a different sort of root beer kick when you chew on it and bite into it it's got like almost like an rub grippier overload I could taste like three different root beers in here and definitely anw I would have to say mug would be another one that's a really good prepare if you guys haven't had that and another root beer not a lot of people have heard of its called barks root beer yeah this one this is giving me in my top Ted and there's plenty more of these so I will be buying more tomorrow and we will have another video tomorrow as well so now we're going to go for a watermelon water now you can see this isn't what they look like this one's just broken it's got the sugar coating again I'm guessing all of these are going to have like the sugar coating I guess it's something that they did back in the day but I wouldn't be surprised if this watermelon ones a new flavor because I highly doubt they had watermelon flavor in 1919 but you never know these are all artificially flavored unfortunately these are fat free and gluten free and it says now you can enjoy that old fashioned watermelon flavor and a delicious hard candy try some today I'm sure it says that on you know a phone you know it says the same thing except for whatever flavor it is no where's this watermelon one and it's good my only complaint though is watermelon it's supposed to be like a sweetie the sweet watermelon this is more like a tart like it's really tart so that would be my complaint because when I have watermelon a lot of people put salt on it I guess it's like a southern thing I'm not from the South I'm from was gone so I put sugar on my watermelon like you're supposed to [ __ ] that all salt crap that's Nancy yeah that's my only complaint with that is its part with the watermelon flavors there because I don't know if you guys have noticed this like if you guys ever eat like watermelon candies not all them taste like watermelon sorry I don't know if you heard that but I kind of hid it got like a sour punch - not all watermelon candies taste like watermelon unfortunately well that's my review I'm gonna have to give the watermelon I gotta give it an 8 so it's still still up there but my favorite my my winner today is definitely gonna have to be the root beer mm-hmm so yep this one wins today tomorrow I'm going to get three more new ones I'm not sure which ones I want to get I know there's like a like two of them that I've been eyeing up one's called Lemon Drop and the other ones called green apple and then there's another one called something [ __ ] or something I can't remember yeah something [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] sore so I got I'll show you guys tomorrow so hopefully you guys enjoyed my

using canned butter and kennel oil so let's get into it all right guys so before we get into the video i just wanted to give you guys some information so so in this video i'm going to make a large batch of heart candy but what i'm going to do is divide the ingredients into two different pots however since i'm not actually accurately measuring the ingredient one pot is going to have more than the other one so it's not going to be equally divided so when i add my jello at first it didn't turn out right but overall it did so just for my beginners use this recipe for only one type of method don't do it the way i did it so i just wanted to let you guys know that but let's get into the video so the ingredients to make my cannabis hard candy would be lecithin so we will need the lecithin to help bind all the ingredients together so i'm using one teaspoon per recipe next we're gonna be using two third cups of light corn syrup two cups of sugar i'm gonna be using one pack of jello i'm gonna be using blueberry jello and raspberry jello next we will need our water we're going to be using one cup of water also you will need a candy thermometer so we're going to be using a quarter cup of peanut butter for one batch of our hard candy and i'm going to be using a quarter cup of can oil for the second batch of hard candy make sure your candle butter is at room temperature before making your hurricane but let's get into it all right guys so now what we're going to do is measure out our can of butter [Music] now i'm just going to add this to my container so now i'm going to measure out our kennel oil [Music] so this can of oil was made with 14 grams of blue drink all right guys so once you have all of your ingredients the next step would be to turn your stove on now the temperature that i'm going to be using is like medium heat i'm not going to turn it on high so i have two parts on my stove and that's on purpose so i'm going to be using one pot to make the hard candy but once i finish making a hard candy i'm going to add some of that mix into this pot here so i can add my kennel oil so you don't have to add your peanut butter or your kindle oil mix it after your ingredients reach the 300 mark so just keep that in mind let's get into it all right guys turn your stove on medium so that's high right there i'm not going to do that i'm going to do like right here so like medium to high heat so add your sugar then the water [Music] and then your syrup while you're mixing your ingredients just look on the side sometimes there's going to be sugar crystals that's going to form on the side of your pan just remember to brush the sugar crystal that may form on the side of your pot now it's boiling so i'm not going to miss it anymore now i'm going to add my thermometer all right guys so my temperature is getting closer to 260 degrees which is perfect so at any point now it's going to shoot up to 300 degrees hopefully i can get this on camera but we'll see all right guys so we're getting close to it so this way was perfect so this time didn't shoot up like it would usually do i guess because of the temperature that i got it on once it gets to about like three or five i'm gonna turn off the stove and add a portion of my mix to the other pot it's over 300 degrees so now i'm going to turn off my stove and add a portion of the ingredients to the other pot let's go ahead and turn off our stove [Music] now we add our jello to the mix [Music] now i'm going to add our kennel oil [Music] and our peanut butter [Music] now i'm going to add lecithin [Music] so [Music] all right guys so i had to put this back on the stove to mail the ingredients so what happened is when i split the ingredients from one pot to the other obviously i didn't split it equally so this one here had way more jello didn't have the ingredients so it was really really dry so i put this back on the stove just to give it more of a liquid base so now what we're going to do is now we're going to add this to the mode so let's get into it so now i'm going to add my mix to this mold right here [Music] now i'm just going to pour the rash onto this mat right here [Music] do i'm gonna put this in the fridge for about three hours and yeah i know right now it don't look that good but don't worry it's gonna come out fine all right guys so we've been about three hours so now my hard candy is now hard so now what i'm going to do is break the hard candy into small pieces and remove the other hard candy from the candy mold so let's get into it [Music] [Music] i'm just going to use a knife to break my card candy [Music] so [Music] [Music] all right guys my cannabis heart candy is now done thank you for watching this video don't forget to like share and subscribe [Music] peace [Music] you", "GopidLYktQA": "and in our Health Alert tonight nine students in Florida hospitalized after eating marijuana infused candy apparently a student inadvertently brought the THC candy to school mistaking the product for a popular sour candy our chief health editor dr. partha nany joins us now with more on what happened and how those kids are doing now doc thanks Alan well first of all the students injuries were not life-threatening the kids were between ages 10 and 12 and were sent to the ER because they were having stomach pains but this is still a warning for parents who have edible marijuana products in their home if the packaging and the candy or treat inside resembles any products that kids are familiar with then they're more likely to see it as normal food and be tempted to eat it unfortunately these types of accidental poisonings are on the rise so dr. nany why does food prompt more overdose incidents well Glenda edibles often have several times the recommended dose of THC now t-h-e is this psychoactive ingredient in marijuana yet the edibles take a longer time to kick it me that you won't feel the effects right away so oftentimes people end up eating even more of the drug as for kids they can experience severe effects like trouble breathing loss of coordination altered perceptions panic paranoia and heart problems all bad things all bad things for sure doc so when kids overdose what are the long-term effects super important question Alan and honestly I don't have a good answer for you because acute marijuana exposure on children has not been systematically studied so there's no research or science findings regarding the full effects so it's super important that anyone who has kids in their homes keep edibles and all types of marijuana products out of reach and out of sight they should also be kept in child resistant packaging that also contains the the way so that it seals it conceals the contents rather so it can't be seen and please don't consumes the edibles in in front of the kids because we need to keep them safe we do dr. Nandi that's great advice thank you for joining us and if you a question or health concern for the good doctor email him dr. Nandi at ask dr. Nandi dot-com or send it to us on Facebook or Twitter we'll get it right to him", "q-Bw9ipv5ok": "so we're doing some of them you've never done before huh what you're doing tie-dye today right yeah tie-dye so how do you feel about it let me see your hands are they shaking like a surgeon he's ready no problem yeah you guys so Terry told me you guys are gonna split them into like three different color groups and then kind of mix them like like yeah it's gonna mix a couple colors of together okay yeah and this was inspired because of loft watching you know love to pursue its Greg you're gonna give it a whirl yeah we're gonna it won't be like his butt no you don't say that we'll see you want goodbye for you golfing you're ready everyone's been saying that very sorry he's wrecked out for this out to nor shall counter to and let's then come it's a holy Angra needs its cereal this smells really good so what is the actual flavor barium punch orange if you're saying old cliche and gummy go punch somebody all the time I would say couple sets back there so why are we hitting up there the cool entails because we're going to divide this into three pieces we're each gonna man our piece or woman it depending on what you are but we're gonna so we're gonna color it but then we get this whole it and then come back here and swap some colors just sitting around a little complicated exactly so this is gonna buy us a little bit of time by not letting it get too cold hopefully Thank You Ronnie no no no back in the kettle for a second we probably don't want to be you know we aren't gonna be mixing them all on here I think it's time so we're a little squirt down here a little squirt there they told you about these bubbles the clown middlesex let you do all this oh wait every time I shoot a video oh hey well yeah not necessarily every time you shoot a video could be every - ah - - every time I hear that could just be my thing I'm not known for being perfect hey Steve I said I'm not known for being perfect yes you are yeah yeah ouch so what is he right now actually no that's my wonderful son from another mother one of many your collector right yeah I have a collector of sons so what was your question I've seen Greg he'll like yeah but then it almost looks like he's holding on to the corner with I don't know we want to be quite that tricky well I'm just trying to think like like whenever we try to split the batches this is more liquid than typical and whenever we do it we have to pull the batch away as we're cutting it otherwise it comes back together no no we'll figure it out maybe or unless we don't we might just have brown tie dye earthtones panic max noises [Music] requite panting yeah give it a minute you will there's so many things that could go wrong here man what are we gonna do it trust me this could affect us for the rest of our lives at least for the next couple of minutes yeah well that looks really easy mmm it is I'm just making about what I do okay so we've got a nice warm ish table which is gonna come in handy oh it's warm make sure everybody else is ready okay okay max oh that didn't really work though yeah it's terrible how we gonna keep it separate yeah you're right hey Steve may be different yeah I mean know your books so hard you're gonna have this little piece of candy here well if your name is Greg it takes you one if you're so far it takes three but we might do put the camera down another stop oh I guess we should be telling what's going on here okay so we're taking the challenge that we gave Greg we're taking the challenge back we're gonna make tie-dyed okay - we're poaching his techniques we studied the game film you saw how Greg did and we're like okay well I don't think we one person wants to do that she really wanted to make tie-dye but you can figure it out so she was like oh so we have first of all you gotta know your color wheel okay so we're taking our primary colors of blue red and yellow pulling them on the hook then we're coming back to our warm tail so we couldn't do it without this whole cooling table but right now and put hot water through here so it's a warming table so gonna we're gonna each take a turn and pull our handy on the hook then when we come back we're gonna swap pieces out we have to make orange so I'll take your head hash yellow mix that up in the orange I'm gonna make purple so I'm gonna take half half red make purple then we're gonna take meat green which will be half blue half yellow make green I'll see that again I will do it Steve I think my head's spinning honey make orange orange yeah I don't know what that is that's adopted now we still gonna use the welding gloves or where we just use pull out right here magic don't make me come after you the colors always been really awesome alright not bad it's like a mini competition everyone's gonna have to fall in luck candy triathlon yeah dude I've been losing for a candy little bit so yeah I can't do that I think it's because of the color cuz that's that's kind of what I'm using to to allow me to do mine oh the stupid stick yeah oh it's the biggest batch of ever thrown I don't know my arms are getting shaky believe in yourself no believe in the heart of the cards huh it's kind of weird I gotta tell you really tense we're tested you in yeah I'll hit the camera don't test me all right how red are we going here is this just leave it here should I give you someone who should we swap our colors now I mean what do you think I think this is pulled enough yours actually does already look like Oh what's my name again Wow this is the right color yeah well I need somebody hit hammer hammer time we've decided that I don't have to pull mine so what we're gonna do now is we're gonna divide our little colors into thirds and we're start so we're gonna play the swifty swappi game okay okay so if we do this man this is huge it's roughly it doesn't have to be even remotely even just come close is that gonna work off thirds well just let me feel that there doesn't have to be even no I mean the colors at the end we know we're gonna make it no we're gonna make a flat layer so if there's two thirds going into orange but we have to give red I have to give one red and one red so then the the secondary colors will be twice as much as the primary today that's what and these two together are gonna equal turf all this is me and I'm gonna give you I don't really care come on it was ripped off that's true what mix mix this these together mix them together they're gonna be equal great no maybe some mixed some neat I like this just mix them together to remember as a kid having later that was it okay this is alright I won't get in trouble yoanne oh you're gonna get in trouble anyways Max is coming together really cool yeah that's right I'm cooler than you guys said yeah yeah I want turn an orange orange alive right because I'm stronger and faster I'm not gonna do that although my arms is a little close to red so we'll keep it oh I'm trying look at the stripes we don't want start well mix it up do you like you do I want to try yours that's looking green that's what we're she's like a platinum purple right now I guess we can start off Oh Greg uses a rolling pin do we have a rolling pin - quick the scheme Jim I was gonna say miss Carla theorist oh we're just hanging okay yes we don't do we have never a dull I'll take it if it wasn't labeled Oh doesn't say for candy only hey this is green no okay that's it so everybody make your stuff black guys want this cause I'm gonna use my rhythm method I just found my thumbnail okay I'm just gonna decided the order that we're gonna kind of stiff for us to be pulling let's pair hurry up let's see if he'll do purple on top of the orange hair and this does not have to be exact light dark light dark really handsome colors anyway this feels like like an airhead or something it's you know Steve has said that this is ixnay on the even candy ray and as we turned this one into ribbon candy what you want the red right next to the orange we'll take your greens Wow Wow I'm on God give us the cruddy okay yay teamwork no we're not out of the woods yet any work no whoa she's curling it to make the tie-dye circle and then we'll form it into a triangle for dodge yeah have you like watch the video no I made this all up from my brain big brain okay it's all for you now I do the honors well you can do [Music] that means no one met speaker i means I don't know misty please don't make me please don't make me I'm so nervous I could it also screw it up [Music] can't wait any think just like a newborn baby 21 pounds and 3 feet long oh we have to taste this - yeah I think you know think it'll stay nice and soft in front of the heat from your lips to God's ears I'm sure listen I'm trying to I'm willing the positivity into this candy all right cuz it looks too good to not work please triangles bro that looks so cool oh wow yeah look it there it is there it is that's the way it is that's the way it so Steve how do you think it's coming out looks pretty neat yeah I like it probably look really cool in the the packages cuz I know that Terry said that she wants to do packet sets some of this in the fruit and friendly ones and then their own tie-dye yeah so it'll be cool to see an entire package full of these rainbow sick it's not burning my mouth you finally got something right to you all these years I took all day are you sneaking some already Terry you can see me I knew you couldn't stand you can stay away from the tie-dye tie-dye tees good this is Kara hey everybody it's Dylan I was just sitting here doing my edit of the hard candy video and realized when I was doing this taste test with Kara that there was some music playing in the background typical me I didn't realize that that was music going on and we can't have that in the videos so I just wanted to do a little voiceover let you know that kara loves the hard candy she loves the fruit punch flavor and she can't wait for the second without telling me I think they still do that I think they do have I think my kids a lot of a die I always just hit the reset button how do you know because of the way it birds can fly north so any direction and it's totally up to them I think what I'm excited about is the next guy see what happens you know and that's the coolest part is like I think a lot of people think that you guys would be like test it once it works out perfectly or something you know what I mean or you doing it's the best way and then when we keep trying to it make things better yeah keep giving the riddles and stuff that we make all the time we're always trying to well I mean you guys did cashew and peanut brittle this time and then recently just fixed and brittle yeah and that's like that's my new favorite yeah that's also I never knew how good it was and then we did it it was like my eyes were opened yeah first time we got the first batch man the first batch yeah I bought you can't send a little too early but they tasted like Oreos man the whole what it tasted like Oreos to me I know everybody else they call me crazy [Laughter] yeah oh wow Alec it all nice work men yeah it looks like s you candy just wait a sec it's all or a cute boy yeah oh wow yeah you're right I got a blanket over looks just like that maybe we're a little biased I think it's pretty cool while we're making very nice trip you really like who's hot Oh hot I was always on the ball pulling over tow he's a little fruity he's okay with citrus [Music] it's pretty cool worried about that almost coming through analysis very 70s yeah well yeah it looks completely different now yeah just from like the last like series mission so now yeah does it for 70s Steve you're a superstar max you did it work okay I mean as in like handling it yeah look it's a little cold yeah but I don't max was a little concerned we got quick Steve on the candies probably if you wait until this cameras off we're gonna tell you I really I mean wallah sir last time you did this get you miscounted in the audience oh really I did miss count four right yeah oh and they caught you they were like thank you you put it and I counted I go so there's no - number two right number two are we doing anything different this time I know I'm gonna arrange the colors a little differently okay and then put into a triangle already done okay yeah I mean it came out awesome but we're real close we're just gonna make more colors oh it well it's just we'll learn it might take us a couple times to get it down okay that's good some of my extra students actually max I just wanna log in to the table want to keep it up - he may be of this pose setup it's pretty cool toward equity oh I'm hoping I want yeah all right we're saying watch our heads like ironically to each other but you really should watch yeah you're behind they do yeah I kicked it back last time that I wanted hit the bear line [Laughter] [Music] what are you thinking about yeah he showed us how to make orange image candy we showed him our technique it's like did we show them how to do a little different something that was so last year I can't rely seems like we're gonna use off-color crops I think yeah let's color - yeah slip I almost busted my butt there no I think you got a crack in it I know I think it said I might supposed to be that I don't know the times you're floating back isn't a bad even this one's in the back you can sell a piece of art I'm thinking less color seriously I'd say take some out yeah I'm going yeah take some not just scoop it out did it again did you get that at drop me yeah I got three four three now yay no I don't think it's another batch okay let's snip it and mix it I don't think this we're gonna mix either Oh fiddlesticks very sticky on my fingers they'll be sticky finger Terry that's really not what I need to be known as it's better about them Terry who runs she runs their walls [Applause] [Music] it's at 1:22 no know if it's gonna stay at this I don't know I'm just gonna get cool enough for us to throw so do you wanna put a lot of cold water longest I actually want us there it's all mixed up and you want it to win get the point where you want it to be cooler just bring it over here how sticky is here man I'm like Ronnie's like in a canvas well yeah well it's not okay it'll be all right I keep sticking like right in the middle here well basically the Sun is your colors on me that's right Mike I don't cause of color and that's kind of widows boom it'll still be a Primerica sticks to the canvas all right why would it because it's so really that's not oh and I think this video why she's had to be split for parts she said one half and then I don't and I think it'll help us with the color distribution this definitely had some heavy heavy colors in that last batch or you know we gotta throw them first it's still a real toast it feels better that be interesting to see how this yellow turns out to perfect well the longer that we throw it the better it'll go more like pastel I thought you didn't want to be noticed - he finger Terry so we do want to go extra pastel yeah we will go as past those I don't know how do you think Dylan is that changing color anymore Wow looks like it might have change it might i think it's hit it to limit i've been watching in free pass already we got another challenge or approaching oh okay now last time this turns real quick you know if i want to hook it the way i usually do because it's so small it's kind of harder when it's smaller takes a lot of focus years of training oh yeah they get twice a week for the next year all right toys a week making somebody use the hammer for a minute mommy told me where it is at our front so all right right there right there I see it that's good thank you I'm watching it like so much so as you guys can see there's a lot of multitasking max you're just doing some more handful on you yeah sure hey let's get it off of that hold on you're right okay hammer right yeah that yellow looks a lot different from the first time obviously smear in it so what what are we cutting these into just like you did before Mex it has a different ratio and I don't see how that is when really we're doing we're gonna need six pieces so hopefully colors are gonna be two parts right [Music] [Laughter] [Music] that's your purple okay who's on first nobody is the problem what's on second oh I know who's on first stay Brown I see you've got us beat this time I didn't understand I didn't Steve looks like I felt so wrong doing I think I'll pay the rent no so we're gonna go dark light dark light light and I can get eco six right say that again I know you told me in between batches you had an idea for how you wanted to try and oh yeah no no okay I think if I Steve Steve's away this time and then okay if we you know still wanna experiment I was thinking if we did it like spokes on a wheel then the outside layer would be evenly distributed for the colors well we are gonna do this twice a week next year some of the true-true yeah okay so I must let's start with orange on the bottom where can we do a difficulty on the bottom actually orange on the bottom last time on then it was mostly orange okay what color would you like to do max okay yellow we could build it like a backwards quick whoever's watching write down in the comments which one you wanted yeah so that we can see your comment a week from now yeah run do it in rainbow colors am I one to start late darling let's have yellow next Lakers candy yeah that's accurate going for her hopes do that one else sure can now hold on that's a stretch yeah whatever Network top Seattle you guys are making just too long it doesn't have to be a hundred percent it's okay if it's random ish let's do orange next okay so we're just kind of you know saying like we're still doing it order it's like did somebody say something about cutting this whole mess in half and then no I said that don't care you know okay I don't want to I don't want to mess with the UH okay what's not terrible you know what I'm saying it would have more colors than it would later yeah so I trust you for what right so what does that mean sure all right okay here you go Steve quick you know I got a half an hour what's she trying to say I think she's just pulling our collective chance to put in too much color yeah yeah let's do another batch after this yeah another that got enough less we need more or less more or less he's trying deleting it right here and now [Music] start to go down no yeah just kind of keep it super green guac okay ground beef Mindy lettuce there's some lettuce there's some corn pork a new porky suckered in porky [Laughter] you're a big meanie yeah how's that feel huh you big meanie that's the look at those it looks like one big image on there and then not leave on any more joke's on you [Music] we'll wrap it up right at for anything less Jason Joey don't wanna fall backwards to try to make Fanta phone select roasting this like indicators that's what I was thinking yeah as long as you you're just got to push this much of it but but also trying to keep it separate so too it should be separate though could you guys put it separately right he'll take the clip well okay I mean max I'll take the credit yeah the yellow is making it a lot a lot more vibrant I know it it almost reminds me of two is uh oh is that zebra bubblegum seems right all right subscribers like that right like rainbow ish kind of packaging oh yeah good my mom I can do whatever I want don't don't you mix them up don't you don't you do it you put that candy down mr. young man Wow so here just kind of have a

good workers I'm proud I'm proud of you both [Music]", "kiyU7x_H1YY": "[Music] hi guys I'm Jen John's welcome back to the channel today I have another episode of my amazing homemade candies for you now this is probably the one that was absolutely most requested out of all of the homemade candies that I've been receiving and it is homemade Jolly Ranchers I'm gonna be showing you how to make homemade Jolly Ranchers there the little rectangle ones you can also do them square if you prefer and I'm then I'm going to be showing you how to do them in lollipop form so kind of like two videos here and you know like at Christmastime when you have gifts that you have to give to people that are like not always on your list but you want to come off as like this really cool person that gives gifts to like everybody but you don't have a lot of money and you kind of want to be cheap with your gift or is that just me but anyways I think that making these homemade lollipops and giving them away to gifts for Christmas time to like anybody that you meet is a brilliant idea so let's get started on this tutorial to make our homemade Jolly Rancher candies we're going to be using one and a half cups of granulated sugar we need 3/4 of a cup of clear corn syrup you can use dark corn syrup if that's all you have but it will affect the color and it may affect the flavor of slightly we need 1/2 a cup of water and then the secret to Jolly Ranchers is in the citric acid we're going to be using 1/4 of a teaspoon to a half of a teaspoon you can even add more if you want to now citric acid is a natural occurring fruit acid and what we use it for is to enhance the flavor of the candy we're going to use a gel paste to add a bit of color to the candies you don't have to but if you want that traditional Jolly Rancher look you do need to add a little bit of color to it and for the flavoring that your original flavors are watermelon grape raspberry apple and cherry my favorite is a blue raspberry so I'm going to be showing you guys how to make the blue raspberry but all of the flavors you would follow the exact same procedure that I'm going to show you up next and if you're looking for the candy flavoring I find mine at bulk barn in Canada and you can also get them at different times of craft stores or cake decorating stores and I'll also put a link in the description box to everything that you need here so I've got my sugar here in a saucepan on top my element I'm going to put it on to around a medium heat and I'm going to add in my water and the corn syrup and these are the only ingredients that we put in at this point so what I'm going to do is just stir it until the sugar actually dissolves and once the sugars dissolved I can put my candy thermometer in to the pot and then we're going to heat it to what's known as hard crack which is around 300 to 310 degrees Fahrenheit once your candy has come to temperature we're going to add in our other ingredients so I'm putting in my coloring and it's going to bubble and hiss for on us here and I'm putting in a 1 and a half of these little gems of the color of the flavoring you can do that adjust it to your flavor to your desire whatever you want it to taste like I just found that one wasn't quite enough to get that real Jolly Rancher flavor so while it's still nice and hot here I'm going to add in half of a teaspoon of the citric acid so again if you actually like when I was testing this recipe I kind of I had a real jolly rancher went you know what it's way tartar then I remember it being so you could even put more of that citric acid in if you so choose so I've got this nice blue color here you just want to keep stirring it until most of those bubbles are kind of gone it's kind of working them out here if you leave the bubbles in it's really no big deal it just gives a little bit of texture to the candy and you might want it to be a little bit more smooth you can see it happens quite quickly now I'm going to pour it into I've just got a bread pan here with a parchment paper lined in here I'm just going to let it cool in here now I'm going to let it cool for about 20 minutes or until I'm able to start cutting it and then I will show you how to score it after we've let it cool for a bit once the Jolly Rancher mixture has cooled we can remove it from what we're going to do now is for it so I'm just taking a sharp knife that I've got I've sprayed it with some nonstick spray and I'm just making the places where I want the candy to be able to break or cut once it's cooled completely so you want to do this while it's still relatively warm because that's the only time once it gets really hard you aren't able to manipulate it like this it will just crack on you so if you wait too long it doesn't work but if you do it too soon you actually will find that it's really difficult to cut and that your cut lines will disappear and that it will just melt back together so what I'm doing is I'm just starting at the center and then I'm working my way towards the outside here and once your knife starts to get a little bit sticky you can reapply the nonstick spray or vegetable oil whatever you've got handy so once I've got it going that direction I'm going to turn the other way and I'm starting in the middle both times because what I found is like when I'm working it does press the Jolly Rancher little area here it changes the shape of it and I just found that working from the middle and outwards towards the outside had the least impact on the shape it still does change it as you can see but it's kind of the easiest rather than starting at one side once the Jolly Ranchers slab has cooled you can start you can either break it with your hands here or you can use the knife or something to to actually cut it in half it's quite easy to break into these little pieces so I just kind of prefer to do that and if they just have they end up like together like that you can take a sharp knife and then just help it along like that so I'm just going to finish breaking these all up and then you can wrap them up in like little pieces of plastic if you want to and you could put them in a little jar and give them to your friends makes a cool little gift so I'm going to show you how to do the lollipops next so to make the lollipops what I'm going to do is use this sphere mold it's just got nice little round domes on the other side now you're going to take the lollipop or the Jolly Rancher pieces that either you didn't like or you just have extras if you want to and you want to really squish them into the mold it's going to miss shape the mold to start with but what you want is that to have enough inside of it when it goes to melt it fills up the whole thing or you'll end up with like kind of a weird wonky looking a little like sucker there so I'm going to pop these into the oven it's preheated at 375 degrees and I'm gonna put it in for about 15 to 18 minutes I want to make sure that all of the Jolly Ranchers have melted completely so once the Jolly Ranchers have melted in the little mold all you have to do is take a lollipop stick and insert it into the center there just pressing down to the bottom and it will be a little bit wobbly if you try to do it while they're still super super hot so you can let them cool briefly before trying to put the sticks in so you can see that a start kind of starts to tilt over but I've got some ones over here that I have already finished and I'm just going to pop them out you just have to like play with the mold and cuz you have them like shoved in here quite hard you got to pop them out so there we go a little Jolly Rancher lollipop so there you go everybody how to make homemade Jolly Rancher candies it's a totally easy and I hope you guys thought so too don't go easy on the citric acid because that is definitely what makes it a true Jolly Rancher or you just made yourself a plain old lollipop now you know that I love the blue raspberry like I told you guys and the watermelon though mm-hmm it's delicious too totally amazing if you liked the video please give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and leave me a comment about what homemade candy you want to see me make next and I might just pick yours and thank you so much to everybody who suggested Jolly Ranchers because this was a delicious tutorial see you guys all again next time bye", "IyGcwdRzPSc": "today Kevin and I are going to be trying to four different kinds of old-fashioned hard candies these are clays candies and they've been around since 1919 Zac syntheses from South Bend Indiana he said that normally they're a dollar ninety-nine but they were on sale in his store for 99 cents so he was able to pick up these fours for $4 I think that's awesome I have the wild cherry and the Lemon Drop root beer and cinnamon and we are we are not going to be able to sit here and like suck on a whole candy so what we're gonna do is we're going to be disgusting we're gonna put a piece in our mouth and we're gonna taste it for a while and then we have a paper towel that we're going to lay it on so that we can go on to the next flavor but we will be able to tell you what it tastes like to us okay so this is the wild cherry these are artificially and naturally flavored they're fat-free and gluten-free it says now you can enjoy that old-fashioned wild cherry flavor and some delicious martini try some today I wonder if they're all the same calories 3463 460 whether 20 calories aged no made the same they're just flavored oh they do have a lot of other flavors they have natural horehound peppermint green apple the watermelon they have a bunch Randall berry do a lot more around always it really really strong for me okay this is the cherry oh and I love this it has a powdered sugar you look hooded and shut up I'll have a picture of them at the end so you can see they're very very pretty candies you could even for these out into a candy dish yes to me that tastes like a pop drop but no but I like it - the medicine yeah you don't really strong - mm-hmm you don't get the medicine apart but it's just a red cherry hmm but if you do not like cherry cough drops I don't think you would like that because that is exactly what does look it's not like a cherry watch savoring - it's not like a jury laughs I know it's like a cherry cough problem yeah because I'm meeting if you're sit in the meeting and one was cut off his penis now this is women some of those are really big yeah some of these aren't are like giant size also you have to get through the sugar-coated we get the point [Music] not fast for the part of s1y I hate that down - wow I just got the lemon it's really strong mmm now see I like that I like that buy that mmm is it too limiting to you it's not like you know like we've said before a cleaner like furniture polish or something like that that is not like that at all this is more like during an eliminator it's like yeah I'm like lemonade that's a good yeah I like that a lot quite quite good mm-hmm that it's just like a lemonade I wonder if you put them like if you mix them and put them in a candy dish together if the plenty because I don't think so because they're coated with that sugar all right so you could do that what's your favorite barks are aimed at me and we drink the diet and it's so good yeah diet barks it's better than the diet NW but I think I like anomic barks probably barks is the best one the barks is never on sale and they don't put it in bottles around here yeah we like to drink it out of the bottle yeah you always buy I am Debbie because that's what's on sale involved mm-hmm aren't they smaller model soon dude 16-ounce ball no the 12:05 I hope those guys have a good climate oh yes and you can tell that it's not sugar-free you can tell that that's like the full flavor that's the that's the real deal and root beer if you don't get the barrels after you eat Oh mold for a while but her mouth my mouth start our leeks with her tongue out - yeah they're so strong mmm they're very very good that is under excellent mm-hmm do you do you like those or the barrels I like these better these tastes that are quality noodles I agree the barrels piece cheaper I agree now this that's cinnamon sometimes the best for last I'm not a lover of cinnamon I like red hots I like atomic fireballs good hardball please I take out my own name this one's not gonna be like that though mm-hmm that's just a really nice yeah like a cinnamon disco that's exactly looks like it's a cinnamon desk mm-hmm except the cinnamon disks are wider yeah and this these have on around this room hmm that's really really good very strong flavor I'm wondering if I'll lay it next to the cherry if I could tell the difference in the color now it's the same friend it looks like the like the exact same red that's the cherry so you wouldn't be able to tell that that is my favorite out of the four our curriculum um I like a cherry I like a cinnamon cinnamon is good it's just uh there's something I want you all at home mmm that's nice I like the since the cinnamon is my favorite then what I will do I don't know how a lot of people do these I said you could put them in a candy dish for me though I like to put some in a baggie and a ziplock baggie and keep it in my purse and like Kevin has put it in Ziploc baggies and put it in his bag for meetings and stuff like that Kevin loves taking stuff like this for me I'm sure the person next to me love yeah you know why do you have nice breath I would rather have someone with nice breath and squishy noises yeah that's someone with a bad breath you know so yeah so and thank you very much as I these are really really good I like them and now that I've seen that name clays I'll have to be on the lookout for all around here to see if we have other flavors so I really appreciate you all Center me this I think you send me these I should I have a picture of one that's pattern and one the done powder another man wants to see the slobbery things okay no they're not slobbery they're not slobbering than the sugar oh yeah I'll take a picture and you all will know that these have been sucked on but that's okay and and I'll take some with the powder and then some without so that you can see what they look like because they're really pretty I love them with the powder on them I think they're gorgeous so I hope you enjoyed the video if you've had these before or other flavors that you really like leave me a comment below cuz I would like to hear about your experiences and thanks for watching [Music]", "8Yki13g42mo": "step-by-step process of making watermelon heart candy for one full-size batch they combine seven pounds of corn syrup into a copper kettle 14 pounds of sugar in two quarters of water oh as well as one teaspoon of cream of tartar this is a pillow candy flavor oil they heat the stove up to 310 fahrenheit pouring it onto the marble table to cool down [Music] the whole process is so exciting we've always wanted to know how hard candies are made here they add in the color and flavoring oil [Music] fyi this video is made for educational and entertainment purposes only making hard candy is a dangerous process due to high temperatures used to make it [Music] so if you attempt to make this at home you do so at your own risk [Music] the candy stands stretched on a hook they stretch it to add in air bubbles which turn the candy white [Music] the color is already changing they combine different color stripes to make the candy [Music] so far so fun [Music] then they put the candy through the fancy candy cutter [Music] so yummy [Music] this looks like candy heaven [Music] which is your favorite flavor by the way [Music] after they're all cut they wait for the candies to cool down and back them up for you to buy yup this is definitely candy heaven go get your bags folks [Music] [Applause] would love to hear what you thought of the process enjoy the candies [Music] until next time you", "nehx8ZqAmA8": "hi guys welcome back to the sugar test kitchen today I'm making habanero salted watermelon some of you guys have asked for videos that are longer and unedited so this video is a real-time video and then the next video that I'm uploading is an edited high speed video so choose which one you want to watch or watch both it's all good with me enjoy the video so here I'm adding a mixture of citric and malic acid to make it a little bit tangy without any acids the candies are just gonna taste like nothing in a real fruit you've got tang Ennis what's the same concept in a candy [Music] here I'm adding a new addition to the sugar pantry it's a sea salt from the Jacobson Salt Company that's infused with habaneros it's really salty it's got a little bit of a kick to it it's really nice not as much heat as I wanted so I've also gonna add some habanero powder into it as well which is from Silk Road spice merchants here in Calgary it gives it a really nice heat something that's gonna smack you in the face but still be really nice on the palate you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] here I'm pulling half of the sugar until it's shiny and opaque I want it to be quite a bit lighter than the unpooled sugar so it has a nice contrast in the design to the candies it also makes the candies feel a lot nicer in the mouth and gives you the ability to crunch through them if you wanted us crazy people that likes to bite through their candies [Music] [Music] a pattern that I'm going for in these candies is really soft and subtle I like the contrast of a really spicy really intense candy with a subtle soft design that sort of tricks your mind into thinking that you're not gonna be eating something and crazy hot that's gonna make your mouth burn in your eyes water to have the such a contrast is really nice in these candies because it's just a nice baby pink it's it's a nice candy it's so innocent nothing's gonna happen when you eat them it's also a good way to trick your friends into thinking that you're just being really nice and giving them a candy [Music] I actually have a funny story about our spicy candies I have a customer who buys our candies all the time and he has them on his desk but he keeps complaining about his work colleagues who keep stealing his candies it was driving him crazy so one day what he did was he bought our pick-and-mix but also bought some spicy candies and mixed them in with his pick-and-mix because they really don't look any different he could find out who would take his candies when he'd see someone walking through the office with tears streaming down their face because they had a ghost pepper candy or habanero candy that looked just like a nice innocent candy they thought that they were maybe getting a peppermint they're a bit wrong he says he's never had an issue with anybody stealing this candy since of course I do have to add that I don't condone this but desperate times call for desperate measures [Music] while I'm pulling these rods I just want to explain a little bit about how pick-and-mix I've had so many emails and questions asking what is pick-and-mix how does it work and i have people who want to try 18 flavours and the Lord that 18 boxes not understanding that they can mix them and then want interchange so the way that it works is that you pick a box size you can have small medium large or extra large which is coming soon and you pick the flavors that you want to go in that box so say you want salted caramel salted licorice peppermint it's fizzy elderflower with strawberry and fizzy Cola you pick those on our list on the website and then I'll mix those flavors into one box for you just for the cost of one box so you get to try all of those flavors without having to buy a box of every single flavor if you want to buy a box for just one flavor that's completely fine as well that's an option on our website but a picker mix is a way for you to get more freedom and to try as many candies as you like [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] now we have to keep the rods around to stop the count these from being all flat and misshapen the candies are still edible of course if that happens but they're just not as aesthetically pleasing so we like to do this just have to say that chopping these rods was a pain because of the salt in them and the spices they don't cook cleanly like regular candies so they like to chip off in really small pieces and really big pieces that you have to go back in and chop again definitely not my favorite candies to cut they taste really good but boy were they paint [Music] so those of you who stayed to the end of this video thank you so much for watching these candies will definitely be made in our commercial kitchen and they'll be up for sale on our website this Sunday please stay tuned at Stewie's wwg candy com thanks please like and subscribe and have a great day [Music]", "LrbEwHv8Q3Q": "I've always been a lover of sweet things sugar addiction was always a problem for me and now it was summer coming and the fruit season coming along I wanted to share with you some of my favorite candy when this comes out of the dehydrator is going to be like a cross between taffy and cotton candy this is so delicious now everyone slices about this then watermelon is interesting it has in the seeds a the seeds have a substance that make them kind of a diuretic which means that if you eat the seeds along with the rest of the melon that would keep your body from unnaturally retaining too much water if you get this too thin then it gets to be too hard to get off of the sheets so you want probably those thickness if it gets too thin in it it doesn't dry up as well as it could and it's kind of sticky so you don't want too thick and you don't want it too thin and depending on the type of fruit and how much moisture is in it and the thickness of it the length of time is going to vary here's a thin one that has stuck on to it but even that comes pretty good normally they don't come off that easily I'm going to turn these over see if maybe that'll quicken their drying time now this one is at a really good stage I like the stage that this one is in you can tell that it's drying a little bit leathering this one is still too moist see how it kind of springs back up there's still a lot of wet pockets in there so that's going to need more time this one is still wet inside you can see so I'm going to put them back probably by this evening or maybe tomorrow they should be done this is how they look after about a day and a half of drying there perfect the worst part about them is they don't last very long and are so good it's like caramel candy taffy cotton-candy all mixed together this is some of the best candy you could get ahold of as a whole food tastes great it's going to be hard to save some for John when it gets home from work I can do three very true you you", "MhAxL7ENWsY": "hello and welcome to lofty pursuits and public displays of confection in tallahassee florida this is greg today we're going to make some orange chocolate candy and it's going to be great for times like easter and we're making this thing using cocoa powder which solves a problem most chocolate candies to me taste like wax but this one tastes like chocolate and then it fades into orange jake added the orange oil which you saw in that little vial to the hot candy and then poured it on the candy cooling table and now he's adding colors because we need an orange component and the rest is going to be colored brown and it'll be colored brown by the cocoa powder itself if you look carefully as he adds the color you'll see that he's stirring it in and the color starts to boil this is because the color contains some water in it and the water evaporates out because the liquid is not water it's molten sugar and the molten sugar is so hot it raises the water in the food coloring past the boiling point and boils out all the water keeping the candy from being sticky the white powder is citric acid as the orange flavoring has no acid content you don't get the sour of an orange and we have to add it in retroactively and now jake just works the cocoa and the citric acid in so when he does the next step hopefully the cocoa powder won't go all over the place and truthfully it does a lot of the time [Music] anyway [Music] do and now it's time to do the break break the bars away from the candy the candy is partially cooled here the center is still hot and molten the edges where it touches the metal is cool and jake has to even out all the temperatures and he does this by folding we usually do this with dripping the candy too but the cocoa powder goes everywhere so this is more of a delicate process than we normally have to do with the candy [Music] i'll keep that [Music] [Music] [Music] um this candy is part of an assortment we make chocolate orange chocolate black cherry chocolate pomegranate chocolate strawberry and chocolate raspberry and if you want to try this candy for yourself you can get it at www.pd.net we ship to most of the world so we can get it to you almost no matter where you are jake is building the orange stripes they'll be a bit muted because they'll be hidden between the chocolate which is a dark color but hopefully it'll allow you to identify the different flavors because each of the flavors is in a different color this is part of our easter assortments we have more than one of them we have these chocolate fruit drops we're going to have some old rabbit rollers and chick rollers from the 1800s making drops in marshmallow flavor and we're working on a third one which will be an image candy assortment of all sorts of easter themes we haven't done this for a number of years but we've had enough requests asking for it we thought it would be fun so over the next couple of days or weeks you're going to see new flavors appear at our website [Music] hmm jake stretches the candy preserving the stripes and he cuts off a hunk to put through our old candy press this press will make square chip shapes and it was made in 1879 so it's older than we are by a long shot but i love a piece of machinery that was designed to work for a very long time and then did can you imagine thinking about building a machine that you're designing to last for a few hundred years you know it'll be used long after you die think about the pride and the manufacturing of this stuff and it shows in the quality of the equipment sadly there isn't much of it out there and people ask me all the time where do you get it the answer is from old candy makers who want it to be preserved and they call me up every now and again and say i've got this would you like it and i feel because of that that i'm part of this tradition that's been passed down over the centuries if you like this video

the shower so i have a baggy t-shirt on and my hair is wet obviously the edibles that i'm going to take i took out the little card but this is the edible i already took these three but with these three i cut them in half i took one hole like a couple days ago [ __ ] is crazy but the other two i cut them in half and like took half the dose but this is a 200 milligram edible um this is the card it literally says this super potent gummy is 200 milligrams strong the company suggests that patients should begin with one candy at a time and adjust as they become familiar with the effects this product is segmented into four candies so dosage can be well managed i'm going to take the edible now but it does take an hour to activate so i'm going to eat the edible on camera chill my bed time it for an hour and come back an hour and doing makeup so that's what we're gonna do the only thing i don't like about these gummies is that it's a little hard to chew it's super super hard but honestly like they're nuts so this is it it's obviously like lemon flavor and it's a little alien the freaking alien design should say how like strong it is but [Music] like i can't even chew it i have to really just pluck on it but i'm gonna put coconut oil in my hair oh my god i'm gonna cut the video because i'm gonna be chewing this for the next 10 minutes because this is how hard it is i'll see you in an hour it is 12 30 right now so i'll see ya at 1 30. okay so it's been an hour um yeah all right so i'm gonna start doing my makeup all right i'm not even gonna lie when i'm when i'm high my voice gets really low like really really low so that's just yeah okay i want to play music so bad right now because i love like listening to music when i'm high but i'm gonna get copyrighted i'm doing my eyebrows with this palette even though i have my mirror in front of me um i'm gonna use this mirror because it's closer and my eyebrows need to be precise i've done my makeup hard before but like it always comes out like fine all right so what should i talk about because i don't want to just stay here silently oh almost look about the first time i got high okay i don't remember [ __ ] okay so when i first got high it was [Music] pretty sure was my 18th birthday i think it was like after it was like a week after my 18th birthday at the time one of my close friends at the time she had already like smoked she was already like into it so she knew what she was doing um and her best friend like also like my friend her best friend and her sister so they all like knew what they were doing already um i had always been like really nervous to get high because i was like i don't know how i'm gonna act i don't know like how i'm feel because you can explain to people how it feels but you don't know what it feels like until you feel it oh i was like i already had like my like like i guess my my stigma about it i don't know i had my own opinions about it but i was like [ __ ] it i'm 18 like let me just try at least i wanted to at least try it because i was like okay then i can know if i like it or not i went to her house and i don't know i don't remember if we planned on doing it or not but i think they had planned on doing it and i was just gonna like chill out but then eyebrow okay i said i do my makeup better when i'm high but my eyebrows coming out a little funky so whatever she lives like five minutes away from me not even like a two second walk and i'm at her house so i got to her house and they started to smoke and we were all in a circle they were so we were like a little diamond i guess and i was sitting there like hella nervous because i was like yo i said oh my god when i was like nervous because i was like am i gonna do this right like am i gonna smoke this right until i was like what's gonna happen to me i was like [ __ ] up so i think i think me having anxiety prior to even smoking is what caused my experience so i was like freaking out whatever and it gets past me and like they spent like five minutes trying to teach me how to do it right because we had done it before the first time i really really smoked i didn't do it right so i felt a little bit but i didn't feel like anything compared to the time i'm talking about right now did that make sense so whatever they spent like five minutes trying to like teach me how to do it and i was convinced i wasn't doing it right i was like nah i'm not doing this right i don't feel [ __ ] because in my head i'm thinking oh it's supposed to be like an immediate feeling because when they were doing when my friends were doing it they i could already tell they were snacks i was like what the [ __ ] so whatever i passed this for her sister circle kept going right it goes to i don't know if they care if i use their name and i'm just saying that i'm like i'm like this like i'm like yo what's happening right now and i'm like i'm not realizing that that's what i'm feeling that i'm feeling hot in my head i'm thinking like am i laced because i didn't know that that was the feeling you got they when they explained to me that you felt like what i what you would feel what i would feel i don't know what the [ __ ] i'm chatting about right now they were like basically saying you feel calm you feel high like they don't know how else to explain it because it's like i don't you don't really know how to explain it to a person i'm too smack right now um where was i oh yeah so it gets past and i'm sitting there like confused as to what's going on because i didn't know that that that feeling i was feeling was the feeling i was feeling high so i'm sitting there like yo guys i'm like freaking out and i go i think i go on the bed and i just sit and i'm like i'm like looking out the window i'm like yo i like in that moment it felt like i was in heaven but because the sun was sitting and it was coming through her window so i'm looking at the sun like so i'm looking out the window like yo i'm in heaven right now and they're just laughing at me because i was saying like nonsense it did y'all i feel like this looks bad they were just laughing at me because i was saying like a bunch of nonsense and i don't have the video from that day because it was in my old snap and everything i deleted but um i was basically like just bugging out i was like i feel like i'm talking to computers going off and they were like yo are you good and i was like i was like no i like i knew i wasn't good i wasn't good to where i was like unsafe but i wasn't good because i like i wasn't comprehending that this is what you feel it was my first time one and two i didn't know like what to expect [Music] so in my mind i'm convinced at that point i'm convinced i just got leased and it's not i wasn't thinking that because of them or anything i was thinking that because again i didn't know that that was how i was supposed to feel so so i was asking them i was like yo is mine different like i don't know i was like yo did i smoke something different because i don't know like i feel crazy i was saying like i feel crazy because everything was just like yo okay that took a lot of concentration she asked me she was like is this your first time getting house like like yes bro i was so like frustrated because i was like i was like oh my god i was like i don't know what to do they were living their best life they were enjoying it but i was just so paranoid and i wasn't enjoying it at all like it honestly it really wasn't a fun experience for me because my anxiety was just like getting the best of me i was just getting hella paranoid and my anxiety was just through the roof and i was just sitting in the corner like yo like i wasn't crying but in my head i was because i was like oh my gosh and then like when it like hit me that this is like me being high what was i saying i forgot what the [ __ ] i was saying oh yeah i was like i was just hella paranoid i like i didn't know what to do with myself and at one point i was like when does this end i was asking them like yo when does this [ __ ] end because i just didn't want to be high anymore i was like i'm over this like this is no um and they were like give it like another like four or five hours because like at the time i had never smoked before so it was gonna last a long time not smoke that much compared to now if i would have smoked that now i would have been like okay like can i get another one that was my first time getting high i was hella paranoid i had hella anxiety i told some of my friends the story they're like they're like so if you had that bad experience why do you continue to smoke and like [Music] eat edibles on [ __ ] camera for youtube um honestly i tried it again after that because i was like i was like okay i need to have a better experience because i truly feel like in that moment all i was doing was just panicking and like questioning everyone and like just acting like annoying so i was like okay i want to experience this again because i want to learn how to just like be okay and just enjoy it instead of like freaking the [ __ ] out so i ended up trying it again and the second time it was the second time the second time was a way better experience it was a lot more fun we actually went out and did stuff so i was cool what gets me tight when i meet people and i'm like oh like do you smoke heavy smoke before they're like yeah i've smoked before but i i didn't feel anything so it don't work for me i'd be like i mean i'd be like wrap it up because i'd be like one it's either you didn't smoke it right or two you didn't have actual weed because no you didn't have good weed i'm like i mean i says you didn't feel anything because you didn't smoke it right because if it's me if you're smoking weed you're gonna feel something especially if it's your first time so you death didn't do it right and i would know because the first actual time i did it i didn't do it right and i barely felt that i had like the giggles more because i was like oh my god how but like i didn't feel [ __ ] because i didn't do it right so that's why when people always say that [ __ ]

medium heat i do medium because i don't want my sugar to burn so and i'm not using can of sugar in this one um i'm just showing you so and you're only going to stir until it starts to boil and it is starting to boil so now we're going to insert our candy thermometer and you're going to insert it and you're going to let it boil and do not stir until your candy thermometer reaches 305 degrees do not stir at all and then remember we want it to get to 305 degrees okay we are at 305 degrees so we are going to remove it from the heat and let the temperature drop back down to 280 degrees all right our temperature has dropped back down to 280 so now we're going to add in well i'm adding in distillate i'm also adding in tincture we're going to stir we're gonna add in our candy flavoring um it's one to two teaspoons of candy flavoring i eyeball it gonna add our food coloring [Music] i'm using americana red because i'm doing a fruit punch candy and the recipe is the same for hard candies than it is for suckers same recipe and then you immediately pour into your moles um you have to pour fast because it gets hard fast and then you just let it set out at room temperature until it gets hard um it takes about 30 to 45 minutes um humidity and the temperature in your house they play a big part in how your candy's set up okay they have been cooling for about 45 minutes now we're gonna pop them out this is just the batch i'm doing for me so i'm okay to touch it with my hands lego man i recommend using silicone molds because it is easier to get them out of and like if there's excess you can just break it off do little hard candies you", "AWqTWDBveMc": "what's up guys my name is mike and this is caitlin hi today we're going to be trying five different flavors of cotton candy now it's going to be a game we don't know any of the flavors of the cotton candy and the loser has to eat carolina reaper cotton candy now first up i'm not really sure what it is but it looks pretty good um i'm gonna see a bit of peace jesus it feels good it feels a lot better than just like cotton candy that you'd get from like a like a fair or something yeah like it doesn't feel like light and like it's dense i don't know this one's oh wow this one's good at first it was like super sweet and then it's like a little nutty the aftertaste is kind of spicy yeah the aftertaste just hates you in the throat but it's like a good like like i could eat like a ton of that it's almost like a chili yeah like a chili you really taste it like after the spiciness after let's see what do you think it is some sort of chili flavor it's like i don't know it's like sweet and then it can't just be like normal i mean now i'm gonna say chili like some sort of chili like um like it tastes like um like what are those peanuts called honey like honey roasted peanuts with like some chili on it yeah yeah yeah are we right close it's pecan green chili okay okay well hey that was pretty that was still pretty like close it was like a little sweet you can definitely taste the chili yeah definitely taste the chili it's like really freaking good um all right up next is this this one is like an orange flavor i noticed that the flavors are kind of so yeah so i'm like right now i'm thinking like maybe like orange or peach i'm gonna get a nice big chunk of that it smells good oh totally different way different super good i'm glad i got a little extra yeah it's like a little citrusy like i'm telling you guys this was like amazing yeah i think this one's my favorite so far like i can only eat so much cotton candy like i could probably eat like like a stick of it like if i got to like the bear or some or you see like those vending machines like in the mall i don't know if anybody's ever seen those but sometimes cotton candy's like too much but this is like addicting it's like and it's not too sweet it's like just the mouth it doesn't feel like i just ate a spoonful of sugar like yeah it actually has like it's got a really good flavor to it and the texture is nice yeah like it's crazy but it's like i don't know i'm gonna say like man i don't wanna say orange but i'm gonna say orange it tastes like orange it's like i don't know what you think like an orange tangerine type dill it tastes really good like it has a nice aftertaste too it's like i just drink some like gum it's like refreshing in a way can i get like can i get a guess breakfast breakfast maybe uh sparkling a little sparkling a little orange juice mimosa there you go oh yeah all right up next is this one and it's just it's white it's like clear i mean it smells good i wonder what this means i'm just getting my hands all up in there thank you whatever look at that oh it smells sweet see and you can tell like the quality of this like it's not i mean i've seen cotton candy like this like oh i mean look it still well that one's really sweet right and look like you know cotton candy just melts on your tongue like it actually has some sort of consistency wow that one's really sweet oh my god um huh this one's definitely definitely like a maple flavor in there at first it's sweet i taste like like a smoky like a smoky like yeah like a beef jerky almost yeah there's like a sweetened smokiness to it but the aftertaste is like i don't know now i've had like cotton candy that tastes like like meat like bacon cotton candy but it's been like oh my gosh like terrible we went to the dollar store went to the dollar store and i'm sorry my window is open and it's the wind is insane but don't mind that um but i've had bacon cotton candy and it tastes like like dog food like it's gross it's really freaking nasty they sell at the dollar store if you get it try it it's terrible um but it's just like i don't know it's good it tastes like it's sweet but it's got like a smoky flavor yeah it actually tastes like i don't want to say like it tastes like bacon but like it's not like it doesn't taste like artificial like a maple bacon like it doesn't taste like movie bacon it tastes like bacon like if you just went home and cooked some bacon and you ate it it's really good like that's what it tastes like does it make your face make a baby okay i got that one yeah that one is good yeah that one is really good it sounds gross but it's actually pretty good let's see up next this is another just plain white looks like the stuff that would be in my pillow it's nice and fluffy this one is very fluffy this one smells good is this one can we just eat this one no no this one's definitely different i don't know what this one is is it it's spicy what i don't know you don't taste it it's got it's got a little bit of spice dude you're crazy no i'm serious you're lying i'm not lying i need another piece maybe i just fell off there's like a tiny bit of spice to it like get a smaller piece and like put it in your mouth oh it's spicy like a little bit not like okay i just got a totally different piece like huh hold up it's not unbearably spicy but there's a little bit he's eating all the cotton candy shut up i don't know what it is i really have no idea what this one is huh it is spicy yeah and it's spicy not like it's not like spicy spice there's like a hint of spiciness to it it's like i never got like some tahini and like put it on the lime like is it like a chili another chili one watermelon lime chili okay oh okay that makes sense i think there's like i don't know i thought i could really taste something i got one and i was like huh yeah i wonder are we even keeping track of coins she did the she had the maple one and then she had the chili lime one i think they're almost like neck all right let's try this one the pretty pink color cotton candy this one definitely looks like just your og cotton candy like you know what does it taste like i know right now yeah original has to be original or like the regular cotton candy flavor it just tastes like um like traditional yeah cotton candy i'm not sure what the flavor is but definitely just like yeah it's like i don't know it just tastes like it tastes like cotton candy but like like the flavor is more intense like everything is like what i've noticed with these cotton candies is everything is more flavorful it's more intense yeah like compared to the ones you buy in the store there's not as much flavor as this one yeah yeah so next video blindfold taste test comparison store-bought cotton candy versus sugar drips cotton candy and we're gonna see if we notice any difference right now i'm noticing a difference yeah but i don't want to be biased but i'm going to definitely say this is like an original flavor yeah it's bubblegum okay okay so we'll mark up your totals and then we'll get back yeah and we'll see who eats the yeah right now we gotta make it but everybody has a get out because it's so like deadly domain it's like breathing and pepper spray yeah yeah so beware but we're going to record the process of it and uh you know [Music] all right welcome back sorry for the little cut we had to make the cotton candy the [Music] is the ghost pepper it's the reaper right yeah the carolina carolina chili jesus i've had ghost pepper before i've never had carolina so hopefully it's not like you know gonna melt my freaking head off but supposedly i'm the loser i don't know how you should let me know who actually won i don't i don't think any of us won i'm gonna be the one eating it and if she wants to be nice then it's an honorable thing to do yeah yeah so i think we tied maybe if anything yeah i think there's a time going on yeah there's some time going on all right man you ready you're so scared you want to go first i want to be a gentleman i'll go first i'll be the i'll be the tough one oh that's how it is that's rude right off the bat this one's oh [Music] so at first it's not bad but then after you eat it it just starts getting more and more intense but it's good oh my god you had a big chunk too this is like insane like it's like really hard this is definitely hotter than ghost pepper by the way so if you guys any any of you guys had a ghost pepper before it's like worse than habanero serrano all of that out the window this is like like the devil just like ripped out my tongue and like shoved in his ass crazy hot it's like insanely are you eating more dude

"VEiE_EhsW6Y": "a warning from police in Westchester County tonight about cannabis candy they discovered some during a bust last week and now one police chief wants to warn parents that these marijuana infused treats could easily be confused by kids for the real thing Marcus solace has a story police admit it wasn't the arrest of the century an alleged low-level marijuana dealer busted in Tarrytown this week but it's more than buds that were seized there's THC in liquid form attachments for e-cigarettes and what's most troubling for the police chief edibles in the form of gummy candy I feel very strong that there is no need to put it in the form of something that's very attractive all to young children Chief John barber Len says the issue isn't whether recreational use of marijuana should be legal in New York as it is in several states and most recently in Canada his concern is the marketing of certain products containing THC there's two issues here hey is it an attraction to younger people that really shouldn't be making that decision and B what is the possibility of accidental exposure the chief points to a Journal of the American Medical Association study that found in Colorado the number of children hospitalized due to accidental exposure jumped 34% so could the sugary stuff be mistaken for something harder the similarities are striking down to the same shape and coloring of the products so if I was to put this on my counter with my ten-year-old daughter home what's to say she's not gonna pick it up and he didn't think it's a gummy worm from CBS who was to say the difference a difference he says parents should be aware of", "fZwPhSCIlLI": "today I'm going to be making cinnamon rock candy it's actually a pretty easy thing to do except it takes a long time to do it about an hour but it doesn't have very many ingredients as long as you can babysit it for a while you're good to go it's actually a pretty easy thing to do so I have 3 and 3/4 cup sugar 1 more 1 and 1/4 cup of corn syrup 1 cup of water and you'll need a teaspoon of red food coloring and a teaspoon of cinnamon oil and you can get the cinnamon oil at a cake food store they don't normally sell it or you can buy it online now you're gonna dump your sugar in the corn syrup the water you'll do a teaspoon the red food coloring turn it on to medium-high heat and what you're going to do stir it in all together will start to melt together here but this will become very syrupy you're going to let this boil on medium high heat stirring occasionally and this process takes about 15 minutes to do to get it to boil ok so when it comes to a boil then I have to take a lid and stick that on there for three minutes okay so now my sugar crystals are all dissolved so I'm going to take the lid off and mature my fan on now and it's going to be nice so then I'm going to take now I'm going to take my candy thermometer stick it right on the edge just like that I'm gonna go up I need it to get to 300 degrees before I can call it good here so it'll just go up a little bit and this will process will probably take about 20 to 25 minutes depending on how high your so yours going to leave it you don't stir it you just let it go and you'll let it boil and come check it often okay so well that's just cooking we're going to prepare for our next part of this and you want to get like an ax I think this is 11 by 16 just a piece of tinfoil so it's got a wall on each side because you don't want your candy sticking to the pan at all for touching the pan so once you get that done you're gonna take either butter or margarine something doesn't matter and what I do I stick it on a napkin I know this is weird but I'm give it a good heavy coat because it is hard to get the candy off of this if it is not buttered it's just about done I'm going to dump a teaspoon of cinnamon oil in that and then I'm going to take it over here and I know this is a crazy setup but it really does work I've set a fan I'm going to open my window and all the steam from the sin roll because it's very potent is going to go out the window and not in my house and I'm going to dump it on my tray here that we've got buttered okay this is ready to go so I'm going to take this down I'm going to be very careful and you should too nuts you don't want to burn the inside of your nose and so I'm going to shut my heat off dump that in I'm going to turn my fountain it's not going to do anything until I stir it and then it's going to go crazy let me get out of the way make sure it's good and stir it in they're going down here is not open here we go now we're going to do this select your cow don't try to scoop it out or just whatever's in there they kind of rock it back a core just to make sure it's to the corners and there's your tray of silicon okay so once it's hardened for about 45 minutes I will go ahead and put a piece of wax paper over the top of it to keep it from getting stuff on it and so it's nice for you and you can keep it like this for overnight if you need to so next thing I'm going to do I'm going to leave this on here while I crack it so I've washed at the end of a hammer and I'm just going to take it and that's it so I got to do okay so the next part after you have hammered it you're going to flip it over and so the wax paper is now on the bottom and I've already peeled off all of the tinfoil so you just peel it off and put that aside so this is kind of what it looks like any next you're going to take some powdered sugar and I have a sifter and you can sprinkle it on but I feel like this does a pretty good job and what I do is just sift it over the candy and then once you're done you call it good then what you do you can get little gift bags like this I like to get them after Christmas every year because then they're super cheap not that they're already cheap but they're now they're super cheap and then you just take your little scooper here up with the bait down so you can see and I'm guessing I can do about ten ten bags worth per batch that I do but I don't seal them up until I know for sure that I have enough in each bag so that's it and what I'll do is just take a little tie tie it around and sometimes I'll even so there's your little cute bag of candy it's really fun sometimes they'll take ribbon and put it around - and tied someone's name on it but that's how you make cinnamon candy from start to finish um thanks for listening", "GlCw8icMXRQ": "[Music] my friends welcome to wheats the marijuana a show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking a look at a new product new brand and we are taking a look at I don't actually know the name of this brand I think it's the master bud teller doesn't have an oh sorry the master baker 420 and they're lovingly named multiple Bayer Gazans 200 milligrams again from the master baker 420 very small edible company Emily seen them out a couple of places the gummy bears look a little weird never seen gummy bears that look quite like that very shitty packaging generic little prop 265 label seems to be prop 215 label cheap little ziploc bag with some cheap little stickers on it never a good sign no ingredients no laboratory testing also very bad sign but it was a more expensive than then you would imagine at 15 bucks for 200 milligrams for gummy edibles is a little bit higher that's a little bit more than so like you're at a pure or infused creations normally for that price so hopefully it'll be good I don't have a lot of faith I generally find to be gum needs to be not very good I've found a few exceptions to that rule but again the exceptions that prove the rule and generally shitty packaging no laboratory testing are pretty big indicators that something's gonna be a pretty shitty shitty product but will give it its fair shake hopefully they taste good and hopefully they'll get me high at 200 milligrams they certainly should so I'll go ahead and shut up give them a taste and if you guys have never tuned into a wheats root review before the way they work is I'm gonna eat the product some number of it in front of you maybe not the whole thing don't wanna bore you to death and then I'll come back to you guys in two and actually let you know how I'm feeling because that is the most important part of the edible review so okay nice little tear open packaging easy to open it's always a plus so here are our gummy bears very again weird we are looking gummy bears it's not focusing very well there but nothing like I've ever seen before a lot of like crystallized sugar on them let's give it a taste mmm not bad certainly taste better than infused creations or at a pure it doesn't have that really astringent cannabis taste there's a little bit of a cannabis aftertaste but it's not nearly as bad again as the sort of more egregious companies yeah not bad slight cannabis taste but not gonna make you gag so guys I'm gonna finish off these multiple bear gasp limbs which I do kind of like that name and then I'll be sure to come back to you guys in two hours to actually let you know how we're feeling so thanks for watching weeds and I will see you guys in just a bit peace welcome back to weeds guys there have been no bear gazans to speak of certainly not multiple bear Gazans not that I really know what a bear gasm is but I assume it's kind of like getting high or having a normal gasm orgasm and this is nothing like that this is like having shitty gummy bears and then not much else happening after that yeah there's not much to say about these they're bad they don't taste as bad as a tepee roar infused creations or some of the other really awful tasting gummies out there but they're just as weak as those in terms of potency and even shittier packaging and maybe a little bit more expensive than those as well so uh straight-up no thank you when it comes to the master baker 420 I think I might try some more of their products review some more cuz I think they have some things that are more confectionery in nature your brownies your cookies we'll see if those are any better but a really bad start so far for the master baker 420 with the fun named but not so hot of a product multiple bear Gazans 200 milligrams that's a total total pass for me if you guys see these skip them no problem saying that well that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds guys sorry for the bummer hopefully next time we'll have something a little bit more fun for you I appreciate you watching as always and we will see you on a future review peace", "vm6lR4ZFaZM": "been unsuccessful you know I'm talking to hey I got two viewers already one like this went on and went away I guess I'm not like hello hello this is

run out of Meg's of our gigs of upload bandwidth I've been told that since I have t-mobile t-mobile will give me binge watching for uploads - because it doesn't know the difference so we're actually testing this today if I have any bandulus levant when I'm done with this for the rest of the month I'll be a little surprised but I'll be happy it is strawberry-flavored yes just like that strawberry emoticon lick your screen check it out I've seen Willy Wonka guy in London I don't care what you say the London is not as hot and sticky as Tallahassee just because you don't have air-conditioning hi Debra we're in Brooklyn are you from if you could teleport not only could you be here but I tell you what I needed you to pick up on the way this is interesting when you have 370 s Watchers right now so that over there is the fron at the top of the strawberry this over here is the background color jessica is probably making the center of the strawberry berries or seeds would you want to put a hairnet on that hair it would be destroying fine art it's a hard question whether there's a cooling time difference between fold and unfold candy when you pull the candy you bring in air so it's colder to begin with no matter what you do Wyatt the Gryffindor why don't we sell unicorn droppings online because this is our current stock of unicorn droppings they sell out locally faster than we do these shelves are bare because too many of you came to visit and bought our unicorn droppings we don't make a lot of them and they sell too fast they're also annoying to ship they don't fit in the boxes our website is www.miamikettlebell.com they're named correctly so just because now I'm making each little seed of the strawberry individually and she's using candy multiplication and here's somebody who just bought a unicorn dropping and a thinks of generic silly putty that's really cool silly putty can be sawed off your play it at home kit I know it's dangerous but we perform without a net I hope your ancestor who is executed in the Salem witch trials as he just posted was executed after he had children not before we're making strawberry image candy right now Jessica is building the

camera please check out our web site at www.movinon.com [Music] sometimes you want the candy sticky so while she's working on the outter app she's throwing it on our batch roller to keep it moving this machine's cast-iron weighs about 500 pounds judging from having to have lifted this with about six other people and with me it's somewhere between 1895 and 1910 oh it will twist it it just doesn't matter at this point so this is going to be the outer wrap Patrick of course we make government candy check out our website WWE do I just got back from my trip today from visiting Hercules

somebody videoing us video candy tastes better when it's meta can you repeat your question about two hours from starting the path to finishing a batch maybe a little bit more the banana video you said the banana candies to die for what about our dice flavor candy we have made candy in the shape of dice within candy that looks like dice we're to die for not bananas that's not that's confusing [Music] probably not gonna make the tide pot candy again that jokes been done I also got a very polite phone call from the head of consumer safety of Procter & Gamble Mike was a very nice guy I'm not making any more right now because he asked me so nicely he didn't even threaten or anything who came to us very simple agreement I was reading a candy that looked like a poison he was making a poison that looked like a candy that was really how the conversation what now anyone out here have any questions because you probably mirror the questions of the people online we're streaming right now by the way you can take up to 18 months to get fully mastered maybe a little bit more Jessica's been here since October and she's just about got letters going and she's possibly my fastest student ever

in the North America of course we ship to Canada is Rose flavor yes we make Rose candy that's rose flavors which means it's either going to be one of the most delicious things you ever tasted or it's going to taste like your grandmother's soap it all depends on how you were raised and weirdly uh we could go tomorrow I was at Hercules candy the cane sugar thing is fully shot it's a real pain to edit apparently the Alexa thing worked I've always wondered it would the necessities look like pretzels for toppings and egg creams and possibly the bag looked like it got watch McCall at cartridges for the whipped cream container we shift to Northern Ireland you may be right it's that hair attached to you like permanently oh okay I was just wondering do you have any food you can get Jessica's

at Hercules candy those guys are great ok folks it's time to take it bye bye Jessica", "SmEIe45TtOA": "they come in different colors different shapes and sizes in flavors ranging from fruity to minty from tart to tangy pretty well everyone enjoys sucking on a hard candy from time to time for children and adults alike these sweet treats are just irresistible our love of sweets goes back to the caveman who delighted in eating honey from beehives in ancient times people indulged in treats made of honey covered fruit and nuts in the Middle Ages Europeans made candy from boiled sugar but the high cost of imported cane sugar restricted this delicacy to the wealthy candy finally became affordable for the masses in the 1800s with the discovery of a new and domestic source of sugar the sugar beet these hard candies aren't mass-produced confections they are gourmet candies custom made and crafted by hand the candy maker starts by bringing a pot of sugar and water to a boil then he adds glucose a thick syrup made from starch he heats the mixture to a specific temperature depending on what type of candy he's making and lets it cook for about a half hour then he stirs in liquid flavoring once the mixture is evenly blended He pours it onto a cooling table the candy maker has several flavorings at his disposal from eucalyptus oil to fruit flavors he also chooses from a wide range of food colorings this candy will have a strawberry design in the middle so he and his assistants are working with three colors green for the leaves red for the berry and yellow for the background to enhance the flavor they add citric acid then they keep blending until the candy has cooled down and hardened enough to be malleable they separate the pieces by color and put each piece on a heated table to slow the hardening process so that the candy will remain pliable now they create the design they form various shapes and sizes and like a puzzle put the pieces together to make a jumbo version of the candy design once they've assembled the red berry and green leaves and yellow background they roll on more yellow background then a layer of red for the outside trim all that's left is to reduce this giant wad of candy into a bite sized version to do that the candy maker pinches one end and stretches it out to form a long uniform strand called a rod he cuts the rod into pieces 60 centimetres long but he has to keep rolling them until they cool and Harden or else they'll go flat when the rod is just the right diameter the design is in perfect proportion all they have to do now is cut candy sized pieces they use the same technique to make Kiwi candy pink grapefruit candy and banana candy to name just a few varieties want to order up some candy with a personalized message here's an L an O a V and E a y OU and you again they create a yellow background and red trim then it's more pinching pulling rolling and cutting until the rods are down to just the right size if you look at the back end of each rod you'll see the lettering in Reverse that'll be the underside of the candy when the raw candy comes off the cooling table it's transparent to make it opaque or to lighten the color they pull it on a hook here they intertwine two colors and feed the rod through a special machine that forms bands of pillow shaped candies after cooling they simply break them apart by hand if you're no sucker for hard candies no problem they could also twist rods into lollipops", "lVCdtzVV58s": "whoo okay ready for this ghost pepper candy okay it's really hot in here that's what I haven't saw something it might drink to go with this and I know you're I should drink I mouth water I'm milk ice cream right so actually you know I'm Asian I know that stuff so trying to open it if I can there's a little notch and I can't even open it with the dog can I not open to anything but I have to use my scissors right oh there's no water no I thought I expected it to be spicy spelling but it really just smells like one of those okay I smell a little bit of space how I try these oh jeez it's black once I know a little bit agreeing on this side when I just put this down somewhere I'm not expecting it to be real Bob and I'm sure close that up smash that a is no just take my madree last a drink who one reason why I'm kind of stalling but one reason why I'm doing this

like it is hot but it's not hot like it's actually like making me cry make me burn up I mean I'm kind of red right now but just cuz the heat the main part is when like maybe like it gonna sit back

like one and yeah that is this and I'll see you all later bye", "NiaPli8UDB0": "welcome to episode 4 of mmm medical edibles I'm chef Tynan Nicole chef and culinary nutritionist and today we're gonna make flavored candy also known as Jolly Ranchers this episode is sponsored by fat bull and the new ill-mannered film series custom agents check it out on our channel in our playlist section the following are the ingredients you'll need to make the candies okay today's ingredients are sugar light corn syrup flavored oil food coloring water vegetable oil Keith and confectioner sugar for this recipe will be using Keith if you'd like to learn how to deke are pure Keith you can go ahead and watch episode 3 this Keith is from this tangerine dream are you high for today's recipe what you'll need is a candy thermometer a pastry brush and several spatulas I prefer silicon some candy mullets metal measuring spoons and a large saucepan start with your large saucepan our first ingredient is 2 cups of sugar and I like to sift the sugar in case there are any large lumps that's annoying next we'll add 3/4 cups of water which I've already pre-measured here for this next part I recommend you pre grease your container with a little bit of vegetable oil spray that way the corn syrup won't stick to it and you'll get the correct measurement oh yeah got any grease yes I also recommend you do this with your spatula as well and your measuring tool I'm just gonna use this to make sure it's all coated okie dokie for this we're using a 1/3 measuring cup all of the tools have been sprayed with vegetable oil now we're going to measure out the light corn syrup we need 2/3 of a cup so we'll measure 1/3 of a cup twice you can see that the syrup is not sticking normally you have to fight for it to come out we're gonna do this again now that we've measured out our corn syrup we'll just add it to the rest of the ingredients and you can see how easily it comes out of the bowl now we're going to take this over to the stove this next part of the recipe is going to take some time so you want to make sure that you can really pay attention to the saucepan on the stove you want to watch what you're doing make sure you're not on the phone or distracted you don't necessarily have to attend to it in terms of storing or mixing it but you were going to be watching the temperature because we want to make sure that we get the right consistency for our Jolly wrenches it can go from soft candy to hard candy to burn candy the mixture can easily burn and then the taste is going to be really off you'll still be able to eat it but probably will not be enjoyable so make sure you have time to pay attention that way you won't have to start over from scratch and waste your batch you want to turn the stove on to a medium heat you're gonna stir your mixture until the sugar dissolves you can see that it's sticking a little bit so just put some elbow grease in it oh that's greasy that's really [ __ ] I said yeah it's greasy get in the corners because sometimes the sugar tends to clump up together on the bottom and then once you see the sugars pretty much dissolve you can just leave that alone we're gonna use our candy thermometer and you want to make sure that you don't put the bottom of the thermometer to the bottom of the saucepan because then they'll give you an inaccurate reading I put a little bit of water in here what you're gonna do is you're going to take your pastry brush and just dip it a little bit in the water and then I'm gonna wash down the stuck sugar crystals onto the mixture you don't want that to interfere with how the candy comes together you can see that the mixture is coming to a boil and that's perfectly fine we're waiting for it to reach 260 degrees so once the temperature of the candy reaches 260 degrees you're going to add your food coloring okay you can get this at any grocery store and we're actually gonna do the mint green color for the green apple flavor that we're doing today and that's just following the instructions on the box start with nine green drops and 3 yellow drops and then we'll see what that looks like and then adjust the color accordingly if we need you we just need about one or two more degrees some more and then we can add the food coloring one two three nine well once you've added the food coloring you're not going to mix it at all you're going to just let the boiling action mix it itself it looks like it's a nice bright green I added a little bit more yellow because it was just a little bit too much of a grass green than a green apple green I passed on grass all the time the minty green gives more of a green apple tone to it we've pulled the pan off the stove at 300 degrees we're gonna add green apple flavoring to this I'm adding a full tablespoon you want to keep all of the essential oil with in the saucepan and now we're gonna add our Keef as well now remember this has already been decart so we don't have to worry about that and we just need to get it off the paper there we go star very quickly you don't want the essential oils to evaporate completely this may smoke so I have my lid ready and because we're using Keith versus BHO you may not have the same uniformity but this came out really really good all right we're gonna lift the lid on and now you're gonna take your candy moles and spray them with vegetable so the color looks really good I try not to over pour it if you have someone that can help you they can kind of shimmy the candy tray so that all of the portions are pretty equal I've done this several times so I have a pretty good grasp on it the colors of these Jolly Ranchers look really really good they're really bright and green they have a uniform texture to it you can't see the keep at all I can't even see it in these when you pour these you want to have a very steady stream and a steady hand the higher you go the smaller the stream will be but just remember that the candy cools very quickly you just want to make sure that each one has about two-thirds full these green Apple Jolly Ranchers are for Bernadette price we'll be seeing her later in New York what would be filming a video for the new Sean price out and they have compressed show senator so they don't we'll put a link to it in the description I hope you like them you want a lot of these two completely cool for this recipe we made 200 pieces using five grams key so I use all silicone tools because as you can see the candy is all on it all up on it so I usually just run it under hot water along with the saucepan and any other tools and I find that it cleans very easily some of the mixture fell onto this silicone pad that I have here and that's actually completely cooled it cooled we're gonna stack the candy rolled trays just the silicone mat with confectioner sugar and then we can pop them out of the candy molds that will prevent them from sticking to each other I also have a container with the lid that also has confectioner sugar on the inside and then we can store them into the freezer [Music] by spraying the moles with vegetable spray it allows that the candies come out very easily you can see that there are really nice bright green the Keef is evenly distributed throughout the candy you really don't see very many speckles at all if any I like to sprinkle in between now let's go grab a sandwich bag and use it as a glue here we are green Apple Jolly Ranchers if you want to make these sour candies you can just add some citric acid to the bowl and shake it you want to make sure that all the powdered sugar is coated on each and every one of these so what I like to do at the end is put a bunch of powdered sugar on the top put the lid on and just shake it vigorously before I put it in to ensure that they're all individually coated this is episode 4 of mmm medical edibles please subscribe comment and give us a green thumbs up that was awesome [Music] I'm rolling up all your good and all your gun [Music] this is not for you no chocolate for your dog you", "HmClCY2OJS0": "hey Pennsylvania patience it's me again medical Mary and I thought today since I have to go to the hospital later in the week that we can make a nice edible to take with me I've decided for this edible on using a Cresco RSO a nice sativa blend you know can't go wrong has some cbgc BC THC so what's next what do we do with it after trying lots of different ways to try to make different edibles and doing baking I really wanted to make some hard candies I don't want to get a candy thermometer I don't want to boil sugar and corn syrup so I found something about melting down Jolly Ranchers and then just pouring them into a mold and doesn't that kind of sound fantastic if it works hooey you already kind of know it works as I showed you so you want to see how we did it we just bought Samara so and I have a ton of Jolly Ranchers 22 and we're gonna try to make some melted down Jolly Ranchers and add the RSO and these levels this is gonna be real time-consuming taking them all apart separating them crushing them up and then hopefully make it easier to melt the fam well it's we're gonna use strawberry and pineapple watch this like now let's crush it up [Music] so we're probably going to double triple quadruple bag these ranchers before we smash it off with a hammer [Music] I don't have any three years of thanks are being so quiet she's terrible [Music] empty out we're emptying the contents of the crushed-up Jolly Ranchers into a pot and we're gonna put out on the stove yeah she looks all innocent this girl's been Barkin the whole time I'm gonna make sure some little butter in there just to give the heart so something to stick to so look a little sour - hey Zeus all this butter over here jacked up with candy on it just keep stirring just keep stirring [Music] it's kind of the consistency of like previously chewed bubblegum yeah accurate it looks like that too yeah it's five minutes away from giving in and becoming a liquid and you how long do you think we've been like stirring this on low oh my gosh at least 10 15 minutes okay not there yet it wasn't really doing much so we turn the heat up just a little bit it's like number two or three right in between there like a little past three but now it's really starting to melt down and I think we're almost ready to squeeze the RSO in there we have to heat up a tower so a little bit we're gonna fit the RSO in there for a couple minutes let it soften up so it doesn't break that click container so and we're gonna squeeze about half of this into that mixture if you could only smell this right now remember it was pink mmm no it's dank I'm gonna just pour it into the mold but it's to meet you hard to film that so I'll show you the aftermath here's the aftermath the pan came pretty clean only burned a couple fingers definitely a whole bunch of edibles I'm working on cheeping my own it's a little edible to be [Music] yeah I was just told that people don't keep confectioners sugar in the fridge comment below and know where do you keep it [Music] yellow like it was definitely worth making him this way but it seems like definitely a team effort yeah if I was alone I would have been really stressed out there's a audibles calculator online if you go to how to add a bowls calm and you type in the amount of product you use and the amount of THC that's in that product so you can use or so you can use distillates you can use your own can of butter and it tells you how much each of your edibles is when you divide it by the amount of edibles you make out of it so I'm not a math person it makes me real stress to even think about it the how-to edibles calculator is a lightsaber doing the math on our half gram of our so that we added and and we made oh I forget how many pieces but we had done the math the other day so the larger pieces that we made around 14 to 15 milligrams and the smaller heart pieces that we made were around 7 so I'm not mad at it I tried on the other day it was good it didn't last as long as people claim that their edibles last but if I get a couple hours of relief it's worth it for me and you know just keep eating them like you would a gummy bear so it's nice to have like a hard sucker so medical Mary approved", "3y4TTMbD2tI": "okay so the last time I was sitting here face to face with you guys I was talking about Coco dogs do you guys remember what that stuff was that was a weird chocolate like candy that kind of looked like actual little green dogs in a glass jar if you guys don't know what I'm talking about I'll have the link right up here in the top right kind of give you up to speed but I need you more recently I actually got something else in the mail and I want to talk to you guys about that because other than the coconuts which are actual candy this stuff you're getting that camera guy this is just CBD stuff and I actually have another packaging tube that helps matter of fact the company of this the acronyms in the name so look at that so this stuff is actual CBD infused gummy candy and unlike the last stuff that I talked about that this stuffs are actually kind of real it's not it's not just like 100% candy chocolate that's made to look like you know a green ugh the stuff in this little plastic jars actually I mean if you want to want to get technical is somewhat of a psychoactive unlike um that that chocolate stuff that I talked about before so here's the funny and ironic part about all of this you know you look at these two things these two jars full of you know it looks like simple harmless can you buy it like the supermarket and you think about the last thing I talked about which was the coconut one looks like something that you could get arrested immediately for for just having a jar on your person whereas this this stuff right here looks like something that you could waltz into any preschool and you start handing them out to kids without anyone batting a single eyeball and that's the funny part about all of this like it's just the way look how innocent this stuff looks it's crazy it doesn't it doesn't make any sense because it will in the state of Florida you got to be 21 at least from from what I recall but actually by this stuff even though it's completely harmless so we got here is uh neon poppers and everyone's favorite sour gummy worms i realistically they both taste almost exactly alike it's just they're different shapes from the shapes and sizes you can I don't know if you're getting that camera move but there are a whole bunch of little smiley faces there don't worry it on ecstasy but before I begin guys I'd be remiss to not kind of show you some one of the basics that you need just in case you guys don't really understand is where it comes from well what it's actually all about so many of you probably know about the stuff but maybe this is your first time learning about stuff like what is it I've never heard of this before CBD is that like LSD is it gonna like make me see pink elephants and ceiling fans with built-in swimming pools so let me explain really quick just exactly kind of the gist about it is got my handy-dandy whiteboard here perfectly by the way before I begin I'm not a medical expert so don't take my advice as I'm some sort of doctor or something yeah I totally left that field I mean I know I have the Asian face and everything but don't be alarmed because I definitely left the medical field I left to pursue a YouTube career where I rake in around $13 a month honestly the age of 40 is right around the corner and I still have absolutely no idea what I want to do for the rest of my life so for all you outgoing recent high school graduates that are kind of freaking out about the whole real world thing and have absolutely no idea what they want to do yet don't worry cuz my book - way worse so I'd say a majority of you guys watching this video are probably more familiar with THC not too much can be said about CVD like I said earlier and there's still a common misconception about this kind of stuff especially the top of gram of certain psychoactive effects THC as everyone knows is the most active ingredient in the Disco salad this is the stuff that gets you intoxicated or is in simpler terms hi as I'm gonna do my best to try to avoid super confusing medical top of big science Awards because trust me there was a whole rabbit hole science terminology that this can all really boil down to alright so let's try to understand just exactly how THC you know gets you up there by the way before I begin try your best to not be offended by this little placemat behind here just in case you're one of those type of people basically everyone has in their bodies two types of cannabinoid receptors so let's just call these guys CB 1 and then CB 2 THC only binds to one type of cannabinoid receptor or CB so the cb1 receptors are usually found in the brain unlike the nervous system lungs liver and kidneys and the cb2 receptors are usually found somewhere in the union system there actually might be other CB receptors but that's totally not the topic here by now you probably can guess which of the two receptors THC binds to and that's actually this guy the cb1 receptor so THC see th see why not so THC is basically something that activates or stimulates that receptor and that causes like that cool rewarding effect or like that happy feeling that sometimes people get sometimes too much of it in some cases can get you was seeing like really weird like pink elephants magical dragons or like ceiling fans with built-in swimming pools and unfortunately for some people that cb1 receptor can be blocked and that euphoric feeling that many of groans so custom - just really doesn't work out for them but if you're one of the more majority lucky bunch then well Cheers now one like it's a brother ii cv receptor deals more with things like inflammation and pain management you know these can usually be found in like the gastrointestinal system and this is probably why CBD has a potential to help out people with like PTSD anxiety or other types of weird inflammation that goes on in the digestive tract or like around the body so okay let's break it down in a simpler example and this is lifted from green relief by the way they put it this way just imagine you consume cannabis and the THC and CBD are like a whole bunch of keys which are you know and searched for a lock to open those locks being the receptors these guys they click together with the proper key isn't different messages or scent you know all throughout your body so I'm like THC CBD doesn't exactly bind well with the cb1 receptor so really you kind of just almost don't really feel anything and if you really wanted to you have to take way more in the suggested limit but the worst thing that can honestly happen is like a slate rosiness or an insane state of calmness okay back to the talking Asian you really want to be careful with buying some of this stuff because a lot of the people that sell this kind of product aren't really will informing what exactly they're selling you so like last week before I actually got these things and you know the local vape store looking around for you know products that were similar the only reason I didn't is because the prices online are vastly different than what they are on stores they're actually kind of cheaper online to be honest and the stores are a little over there something like this and a store would probably cost you around 70 bucks online these things are like mid 50s or mid 60s so I walk into the store and I'm like you know I'm asking about him you know I'm asking about this type of stuff and I was asking like what's the whole thing about this almost immediately he just goes yeah bro stuff is totally worth the dude I'd like three or four of them and I was like totally gone in like five minutes dude I was I was I was surprised I was I didn't even know what to say you know before I even go in the store I kind of knew what the stuff was it wasn't well it's not exactly the most complicated thing to understand when he when he said he was gone he was like gone like with like 17 E's that's how gone there's this like his description was and I was you know I was taken aback I was no surprise you know so like three or four seconds after that there was like this like dead silence in the entire store and the only thing that I thought to myself was like dude I really hope this guy does not smoke weed because he's probably the first person that'll overdose on marijuana don't go into these stores thinking that you just found like an insane goldmine of like magical stuff because it's it's not it's not it's not that kind of stuff especially if you're in a state that still doesn't have fly solid recreationally illegal because it doesn't matter if you do that stuff and if CBD does get you like that I sure hope you don't take anything with THC unit so yeah this video is made way back in 2019 so I'm sure 10 years from now we can probably take a look at this kind of video and have a good laugh at it considering the fact like how strict the laws were on like you know this kind of stuff especially the ones regarding disco spinach because those right now even in states where it's legalized that's still federally illegal and it's classified as a schedule 1 drug okay so one of the part that probably wouldn't have you fast forwarded to the the actual product I was able consume a good amount of the bag well in the jar in the past 24 hours I didn't exactly read up on the recommended dose but I guess I should have since this was sort of a hefty sized jar at 300 milligram over 1000 1000 milligrams total so according to the little jar thing here it says that it's approximately 72 pieces you guys can read that there so thousand milligrams 72 pieces you do the math what's a thousand divided by 72 so you're looking about 14 milligrams per little candy thing well this guy this one's I think this I think there was a I think there's more gummy worms was there this had 142 pieces this is the smaller so if this stuff is still closed this has 72 gummy worms in here Oh this one had 148 smiley faces so 1000 divided by 148 okay so about 7 grams 7 milligrams of CBD and you show these little smiley face gummies usually the recommended daily doses I think it was between 15 to 25 milligrams for the stuff don't quote me on that I'm sure everyone's body chemistry is a lot different so in order to affect someone else it could vastly depend on like your size in your weight so my guess is the gummy worms here that have yet to be consumed will be a little bit stronger so I have to eat these in moderation because these guys on the other hand I kind of was just popping in like candy I forgot this was a CBD candy thing like I actually started eating them like as if there were something from like the candy aisle at Walgreens so you pop these in your mouth obviously consumer eager and they literally it's candy there's no hint of like you know when you have like the actual edible stuff from the other stuff you can get a taste of the good stuff this Kandee complete freaking candy so those a bit skeptical at first and how this helps with certain problems like anxiety and pain and you know while I didn't really have the laddering his idea was something that was pretty salient especially when driving around like the state of Florida some of you know me and the majority of my content in this channel is usually you know automotive related useless content right now while I've totally loved cars I absolutely despise driving on public roads that's that's a given fact I love cars but I hate driving and again I live in South Florida so this is kind of known as God's waiting room this is a place where older people move after they've realized that they're too old for other old people they hung out with but you know here's the thing it's not just the elderly which which are kind of terrible at driving a majority the people that drive here I feel like more than half of them have gotten their driver's license from a happy meal and because of this driving around in the state of Florida it kind of puts me on a weird edge the things I can definitely say that this stuff helps me out like like immensely I can't tell you how how much this stuff actually kind of works especially driving it gives me the nice reliable feeling that I'm not gonna get sideswiped by like a Corvette every 13 seconds anybody comes in a whole different types of forms you can get it as popcorn tinctures like something you can drop into say if you don't want any candy if you're someone that's trying to lose weight don't want to delve into the whole unhealthy candy eating process you got chips even got like CBD beef jerky and so they they put CBD and like act like a lot of things nowadays and I know this might be a totally unpopular opinion but I think edibles of anything is the most safest and best way to consume any type of whatever the help no matter what anyone says I think the whole inhalation of smoke and everything really messes with your whole body chemistry you know scarring of the tissue and the lungs and all that weird stuff so hopefully guys this was able to give you a sort of introduction of the whole alternative world of CBD let me know in the comments below it sure not only helped me but it helped anyone else that's trying to you know figure more stuff about figure out more stuff about this stuff other than that guys I got nothing else for you if you guys wanna help support my channel or visit my website it got merged stickers hats and other things literally out here calm and click everything yeah I don't I'm not a very good salesman I just had to say that at least the bare minimum I'll see you guys in the next video in the next vlog in the next whatever peace [Music]", "wnHEErptRfc": "when I was a little girl I was\ncompletely obsessed with candy I remember constantly begging my dad for\na dollar so I could get on my bike race as fast as I could to our local\nconvenience store where I would purchase as much candy as I possibly could for\nthat dollar and at that time you really could buy a lot for a dollar so in\nmemory of my younger obsession I figured we would switch up a few things and\nwe would make some liquor lollipops in this video we are going to make some\nmargarita flavor so let's go spice things up so on medium heat I'm going\nto add 3 cups of sugar 1/2 a cup of corn syrup and now 3/4 cup of the tequila mix okay so now stir this until the sugar\nkind of dissolves and then to add a little bit of color and a little bit of\nflavor I'm going to add the strawberry syrup and then one more teaspoon and\nthen stir it real quick and as you see it has started to bubble so now that it\nstarted to bubble we will want to stop stirring this and just let it bubble up\nand you'll want to take your candy thermometer and just check the\ntemperature and once it reaches 320 degrees we can add the liquor okay so\nin the meantime while your mixture is reaching a high temperature you want to\nget like a pan and line it with parchment paper or you can get some\nsilicone molds and just spray them with some cooking spray because you are\ngonna have to work really fast and so you want everything prepared and then\nyou want to get some sucker sticks also you can use skewers if you want and just\ncut them down alright that's looking pretty good between 300 to 310 is the\nhard crack stage that's why you want it to reach 320 okay so for the last\ningredient so now that this has reached the hard crack stage now we are going to\nadd some tequila this is just cheap tequila it doesn't have to be anything\nfancy and you'll want to add 1/4 cup of tequila and then I'm just gonna give\nthat one last stir to mix the tequila in and then I'm gonna check the temperature\nreal quick and you want to make sure it reaches 310 again alright guys if you\ncan see it's pretty much there at the 310 mark and just in case you're\nwondering it is kind of a long process it does take a while for it to heat up\nto the hard crack stage and then once you put the alcohol in it takes a\nlittle bit for it to heat back up to the hard crack stage as well but once it\nreaches 310 you can go ahead and just turn your burner off and then this is\nwhen you will want to work really fast so that you get perfect little\nlollipops because it definitely hardens really\nfast so I'm just going to pour mine right into the measuring cup so it'll be\neasy to work with okay so we're going to try really fast to pour it into the mold and then for the parchment paper you can\njust go ahead and just try to make little circles and then I'm just going\nto take some margarita salt and just put it on the top makes it a little pretty\nand really gives it that margarita drink taste and then you can take your sucker\nstick and just put them just kind of twirl it around like this and make sure\nit really gets into your syrup and then I'm just gonna lay my sucker sticks like\nthis because obviously these aren't real sucker candy molds but you can always\nbuy those at the store they actually do sell sucker molds but the whole point is\njust showing you you can really use whatever works for you or if you just\nwant hard candy you don't even have to add the sucker sticks it can just be\nhard candy okay so you can just leave it on the counter for about 10 to 20\nminutes until they hardened or if you want it done faster you can just put it\nin the fridge for about 10 minutes Aiden what are you doing getting a piece\nof candy see my boys have my same addiction of when I was a little girl\nwith loving candy my boys have candy jars alright so I actually put these in the fridge\nfor 20 minutes just so that they'd be nice and hard and if you can see they\nare done cuz you can hear it's nice and hard and then these ones really turned\nout really cute too so a little circle one and a little star and then these ones\nturn into like little cute hard candies so they all turned out really well\nI'll show you again so you can hear it so they did harden nicely and so they are done I hope you guys enjoyed making this\nrecipe so let's give it a try this is my broken one mmm this is really\ngood and if you guys have a favorite candy\nyou can send it to me and my boys and I will open it in an upcoming video where\nwe will try out all your guys's favorite candy and you can find my address in the\ndescription box below and if you have any questions just\ncomment below and if you want to see more videos please remember to subscribe to\nthis channel thank you guys so much goodbye and see you in the next video and just a side note these would be great\nparty gifts or party favors for adults", "8-3Xe7RMg3w": "So today, we're making a batch of Guava flavoured candy. The design will have three different colours white, black and green. There will be a very beloved animal design inside our candy today. The animal has two colours, black and white. You can take a guess at what we're going to make today. So now I'm mixing in the white colour which is going to be the face of the Panda and background of the candy. The green is going to be the wrap of the candy. Since Panda's like bamboo a lot, we figured to make the outside of the candy green to resemble the bamboo's colour. We put some of the candy in a frying pan... the reason is that it's easier to control when we have many different colours. So now I'm about to put the malic acid into the black part. It's the kind of acid we put in our non-citrus flavours, to make the flavours more robust. So Guava is kind of a sweet flavour, but we still need to put in quite a bit of the malic acid. So now I'm going to pour it out. The candy is very liquidy, that means it's still extremely hot. It's about 180\u00b0 Fahrenheit which is still too hot for us to make a shape with it. So we're going to let it cool down a little more. This big piece is also cooling down, so we're going to check if it's cool enough to put in the acid. We don't want to put the acid in too early, otherwise it will burn and make the candy yellow. The temperature is about right so I'm going to put in the rest of the malic acid. Now let's mix it in. As you can see, the edge of the candy has already cooled down. It makes it easier to separate. I need to separate this really quick, and to be accurate. So later on I'm going to stretch this big yellowish mixture. We're going to make this shiny and white by using a technique we call sugar pulling. So what's she's doing right now, is cooling the candy down with her hands folding them, making sure it has an even temperature all around As you can see, it's no longer as soft as it was earlier. The candy mixture even right now is extremely hot. How do I know? I learned the hard way. Look at my battle scars. [laughs] You will be very surprised... we are working with something extremely dangerous and hot. Right now I'm stretching this big piece on a hook. What I'm doing is called sugar pulling, candy stretching... many different names but basically what I'm doing is folding air into the candy so it will reflect more light The tiny air bubbles also help make the candy very crunchy. What I'm pulling is about 6 Kilograms of sugar. I have to keep pulling this at a steady speed. This is truly quite a workout. A few more stretches, we're almost there. At the end, this big piece is becoming harder to pull, because it is cooling down a little bit. That's why we have to do it really fast, when we get the chance. We're done. Now it's so white and shiny... and it's so fluffy. This is going to be our panda. You may ask, why don't we use the hook again? It's too small for the hook. It will cool down too fast. That's why she'll do it by hand on the table, while still warming the candy. This requires a lot of physical strength as well. I'm just happy to have a break. [laughs] You may notice the black is no longer very dark. It became kind of a silverish grey. But Don't worry, the final result will be very dark, and black. So now I will start to make the panda. We will make his eyes first. So I cut a little piece of white off, let's get a little piece of black - to be his eye ball. You may ask why we're only making one eye, when a real panda has two eyes. Well, in the candy making world, we try to make things that are identical only once. So later on you can see how we turn this one eye into two eyes. To make the piece, I'm applying a little bit of water on it. And then we're going to put the eye ball right in the middle. Then let's wrap the black with the eye white. Then roll it out. Then I'm going to take this black piece right here and make the panda's most important symbol on his face which is his lovely eye shadow. So now we're going to make this one bigger. So we will be able to wrap the eye we just made. So earlier you saw were were applying two pieces of candy together with water. Water is really like a superglue when we make candies. They help two pieces of candy that are a bit cold to stick together. When the candies are hot they just stick on their own. So now we already made one eye for the panda. Now we will turn that one eye into two eyes. It's actually very simple. When we make candies and we need to make multiples of identical pieces we simply stretch it and cut it into the quantity that we want. In this case we're going to seperate the one eye into two eyes. Now I'm going to cut this piece. So as you can see we've already finished the two eyes of the panda. For the nose it's going to be a little downwards triangle. The mouth is going to be two half circles with black outlines on them. Like I said earlier, we're just going to make one piece, then cut that in half. We have our panda's face all assembled. You may not see the entire panda yet, but soon. Now we'll just make his face fatter. It's face is nearly complete, we're just going to make an outline of black, to draw his face. We have to remember to leave some black to make the ear. Now... it's big round face. Now we just have to make it's ear. Now the panda is inside the roll. What's left is to make a final wrap using our green. The reason why we have to constantly roll the candy is that the table is heated. If we don't constantly roll, the candy will become flat and the image inside will become disoriented. So now we're going to stretch this big candy into small pieces that are bitable sized. Now it's about ready, this is how we make it small! Thank you very much for watching the video. My name is Lin. This is a customized lollypop made of real sugar.

Until next time... have a sweet day!", "vGOYds0MKpE": "hello and welcome to lofty pursuits in public displays the confection in Tallahassee Florida I'm Greg and Jake is making candy today and we're gonna ask the question where did the idiom blowing a raspberry come from because it seems to have nothing to do with raspberries but it does these fruit drop rollers are a little different than most of the ones we have you see these raspberry rollers are asymmetrical the top and bottom are distinctly different and they create the top and the bottom of the raspberry and this is cool because when you put one of these in your mouth it kind of feels like a raspberry because you get that 3-dimensional shape you don't even realize you're connected with it this is sort of like the strip effect that we covered in our video number 73 and while I found studies that cover flavors and colors with this strip effect I haven't found any that covers texture so I find these interesting the flavor and color was added when the candy was in the pot but Jake now sprinkles on some citric acid that'll give it just a little tang and make it taste more raspberry like I've always been fascinated with words and the origins of them and sometimes words can be confusing so let me give you three words to think about entomology etymology and entomology etymologies of course the study of bugs etymology is the study of words and entomology is the study of snack cakes and while the third study might be useful we're going to concentrate on the second study and go back to the origin of blowing a raspberry because it has a fascinating story one that takes British television British censors American TV and the paranoia of movie studios all together to add a term to the English language that's an unusual term in the first place so while Jake flips the candy to even the temperature and lets it drip he needs to get it all to the right consistency to go through the machine clearly let's go back to the early days of television television was on unlike the early internet it was struggling for content it could make some but it needed more than it could make and the movie studios in the United States were not being cooperative they were scared of television they were afraid it was going to destroy their business so they didn't want to license them their blockbusters they did license the monster movies that they thought they'd never show again like two Creature from the Black Lagoon which will be in another video by the way and they also did old old films like ah The Three Stooges Laurel and Hardy and our gangs sometimes known as The Little Rascals but what they ended up doing was leaving an opening but American television found a solution that was England you see the British film companies didn't see a threat from the American film companies in post-world War two and for many years after that people in the United States got their first real exposure to British movies and it was a good one and we absorbed accents we considered the British accent cool I think it paved way to the British revolution in music and the acceptance of it here in the United States but it also added words to the lexicon and one of them was blowing a raspberry that sound that you make when you're disappointed with things sometimes known as the Bronx cheer the writers in British films started using terms like blowing raspberries because there were censors in the British film system and there were pretty major cutting things out these sensors were originally employed during World War two to censor letters movies to keep information from going to the enemy but after the war they found a job the censoring films for the public's quote-unquote protection and the directors and writers found this stifling so they try to get around this by putting things in the censors didn't know but the public might and one of the things they used was London rhyming slang sometimes known as cockney rhyming slang if you're not familiar with it it's two words that rhyme with another to confuse the upper classes and the police so table and chair would mean stair but you wouldn't say table and chair you just say table you'd have to know stair to get to chair and for another example is frog and toad being rode well there you had a term raspberry tart but if you think for a second you might be able to figure out what raspberry tart rhymed with fart so because London used rhyming slang in people knew it the movies could use it to get around the censors in England when the movies came to the United States that were shown on American television because the television companies couldn't get American movies and a term entered the English lexicon that meant the term that the sound blowing a raspberry makes and I loved it came full circle there's the Golden Raspberry award that now gives awards for bad movies and the name of that award is the same linguistic origins as the name for sticking your face in a baby's belly and making a funny noise that makes it laugh and if you haven't figured it out already there's a reason why these candies are called drops thank you for watching

the temperature because you can't get over a certain temperature because water won't get me hotter than 212 degrees so as you deal with like 5050 water and sugar as that percentage goes down the solution can get hotter mm-hmm to its maximum temperature so we're measuring moisture content at the 310 we should be under 5% water now if you get over the burning point to sugar and get rid of all the water the sugar burns caramelize this turned brown and that's very round problem his family used to do to 320 and it would get wouldn't have as much as nice of a white snow and I think that made

circumstance the candy will be hard enough it'll just be in my experience more susceptible to humidity you know because it just has more water so it can absorb less and stay hard but yeah we used to do three or five I mean hard practice what 292 something theoretically can be hard over any time not hard crack Park wall anytime you're over hard wall temperature I don't remember what that is I tend

mostly water to mostly sugar it changes how it behaves and somewhere around 257 degrees have you ever noticed just sort of slows down getting hotter then I want to passes that point it accelerates yeah and that point is where does this transition and that's where it transitions from a solution to a different type of fluid these two when two different materials are dissolved into one another can often behave like this this is how blue ice works so blue ice is a mixture of propylene glycol not ethylene glycol and water ethylene glycol being toxic but really tough so it's not your car's antifreeze and they're in a proportions that the freezing point is below whatever temperature one blue i3 refrigerator it's usually like 28 degrees Fahrenheit 25 degrees Fahrenheit so when it freezes it becomes solid but it takes a whole lot of energy to make it freeze but also takes a whole lot of energy to get through that point to make it defrost so it stays cold longer and that's why you want blue ice sugar and water does exactly the same thing except it's just annoying it doesn't have a useful purpose it just takes longer to boil and then it goes young because yes snow as the temperature goes off and then it speeds up again so the atomic bonds are breaking or something that once they're broken it's like I don't actually know it's taking a lot of energy to do something but I haven't actually thought about it in sugar I've got a very large treatise on the subject that I haven't been able to slog through so the ice there hasn't been a lot of research in the candy industry but there's been a lot of research in the ice cream industry because they need to deal with the continuous process continuous process on coconut oil and with continuous process cooking you have to take into account how long you need to calculate the thing needs to move through the continuous process because they're not doing it a batch at a time you can't just wait you something else is coming behind it so you bake things longer and the continuous process thing by having it run down an assembly line longer yes who's pouring this badge Stevie's gonna be you and me or think so look I make sure them can you make sure that area is greased that's query I calculate how big it needs to be I saw the one on the right this one no they're all looking I don't see like the whole forever yeah I think I think you did the whole venue yeah there's a brad sighting we have a newcomer behind you don't be alarmed or anything yes we have a little max discovered a little dry spell just so oh I don't need don't worry about that end it's the other end okay so how do you want us to pour this as far we're still learning our lesson right no do you like to do it while it's still boiling or I just wish soon as we turn it off I tend to pop pour it so I get as much heat as possible or some flavors in the pot if it's what we call a weak one we will do that in plan sometimes you do the orange that way because it is slowly I usually pour it in the pot and stir and so that it has as much heat as possible to evaporate off that water so I have more time to work with the other one and get the end ploy off the colors now you have a gel food coloring and I usually use water based so yours has less water in it so I shouldn't have any trouble but your flavor be babe yeah yeah that's actually that's very much what I do but the gels gonna work just as fast it's not going to be any different if anything it's gonna solve problems I like that because I can mix colors more easily when I need to combine a yellow or green or whatever to make a different shade it's very hard to mix in with the jealous it's very easy to mix them just by going drop drop drop into that so I tend to use that and since i buy that by the gallon it's what's laying around it's like the wooden spoons that everybody thinks is plastic and it's going to dissolve in the candy when I make it there's a the real question is well the real reason I use them is they're lying around there are wooden to go store ice cream readily available easy to do got a little ways to go away over there in the citric are we using the citric acid today yes okay now do you have a measuring cup by any chance just sure actually do you want to do this with citric acid or without C because the stuff I made gave you yesterday citric acid in it and this way you can do it before and after taste look it's not sound good just in the first square right there it should be the right amount of I did my math right with not slow down and I'll move the bar yeah get your scraper Steve you feel like you don't know it was right I got about there it is who we meet you this tan scraper did you know how we always stuff so the host cards don't hurt hmm without the winning game man where we're moving just one you guys are gonna let me introduce you right yeah was it always this way fun times I was just like go to the grocery store put some holiday without being filmed okay right is it weird flying in not thinking yeah yeah now this is where I would just start mixing it all up and get it cooled down instead of mill this isn't a master okay let me get the gloves off now oh well just for the moment I get a little more dexterity and so we're gonna do about third third and third so this is wider than I normally do normally I do it deeper and narrower but you only have the limitation of this bar sorry so we're gonna see how this works do the choose your corner judgement usually they go all the way across but it's going to be hard to cut all the way across without it flowing out so I'm going to try to do is I'm gonna try to do that's gonna be hurt you I think I'm just gonna go all the way across you're gonna want these aren't you eventually oh this is cooling down so much faster than anything I've ever felt oh just at that end okay that's good oh this is about a third so and hopefully we won't have a problem that the sides getting cold really fast turn off whatever fan is behind me okay yeah yeah this is fighting me fast so this is gonna be the light our nose right there cuz this right here it's getting cold - too fast and this side it's a little hot okay so we think that is great for ya the sides already ready oh this is much faster than I'm used to see but that side isn't ready yet that's gonna be interesting for me to cut I should have done it the other way but don't break it oh I see haha your tabletop sticker at this end then descent probably isn't relevant for what you do normally but it's here so I'm breaking the vacuum you know I felt the table so fight so I'm gonna go about a third right here so I think we do this one first this is gonna be the pulling light and I take that drip it right over here we're gonna keep that going I'm gonna take this for the orange slices pull this over here and leave it on the hot spots I can work it a bit that's going to be pulled and this over here so I'm right now what all I'm doing is I'm folding it trying to get the cold bits and hot this mix right so why don't you start folding that I'll start holding this you see how little orange I put in there yep Steve may have another paddle please [Music] the secret is not to let it touch very long because when the paddles heat up we're gonna probably switch sides here cuz that sides warmer and this is your polling so it needs to say the warmest this is that why he kind of separated so you have the warm side Anna cool side yeah I get to use the table for an advantage of it on my table I yeah I tend to like the clear on the other coldest I'd actually this way worked pretty well because parts have to cold park is too warm and I was able to mix them but you see we got three roughly even pieces here and we're trying to get them oh yeah I tend to use the rubber gloves when it's really hot because I can handle the little cold bits on the edge but since I make a longer thinner thing I end up with more cold fish Steve I think this is about the right temperature to pull what are you maybe a little hot well actually I was about to turn it to the house so let me go over there I'm gonna put this thing in front of your here this is just a little warm I am Lauren that I should listen to brag to me oh I wonder bring that piece over here there yeah all the way back to the right and the chute soon as she's out of here I can set up a camera that's my present cook you saw my - yeah but what if you're Robert Phillips goes to the chopper there's a ya bonus for the customers like your ball of corn syrup it's a lot warmer huh we just flip it so doesn't stick to the canvas is it well elbow is that what the issue is okay I need the scissors go ahead don't tell you that if we turn the air back yes please turn your back on I'm sorry if it's getting hot but I'm used to it being hot my candy shop yeah I guess one concern is that we do have chocolate down here so let's see oh I see what you're saying here let me give this thing's fault so we're doing you got to get this to go fast or you can pulled out so I'm doing long pulls obtain the heat we can't how to get you cool yeah which means pulling quickly is the thing now we really hammered the hook to shake it loose oh you're gonna need that no not if I do it right the hammer service no I don't hammer the hook you can put crystals back in the candy you can actually make it crystal eyes I know it's not 100% likely if you keep this thing rotating so the same torque moves off the hook at a time you can put forward and backwards you distribute the heat it's sticking to the hook because hook is heated up so is that make sure you keeping the hook cool I'm not moving yeah okay so that if you do that it shouldn't stick but it requires moving fast because if you move slow you get more heat on the hook once the hook passes a certain temperature I have no idea what it is the candy I want to stick to it and to those into this metal scrapers you have a candy stuck to us oh yeah they just got hot yep okay there we go so now the first thing we're going to do is we're gonna make our try this we're gonna make our triangles by cutting this into six parts so I'm just gonna cut this in half and this half is gonna be like you want them to be about the same now we're going to just pull them out and I'm going to cut it into thirds you want the thirds to be as even as you can [Music] see this one looks a little smaller yeah I'm gonna cut this here a little bit to that I thought looks pretty even yeah that looks pretty good okay so what I'm gonna do here is I'm just gonna make three triangles of the same way and I'm gonna put these over here so they can cool down because we want them particularly cool this red needs to be the dark orange needs to be the hottest of all of them actually I'm going to stick this on your galvanized so cool even faster don't you thank you oh yeah so we really want triangles to be triangles and to be able to keep their shapes this way this can actually get too cold because we're about to reheat it with the with the outer wrap and if it's not cool enough you go shape this one too and I'm rotating them to get a nice sharp edge all gonna be the same length not to be too cold the temperature differences here are much greater than in Florida we're gonna be able to do this very very quickly and this area seems like it's cool enough to keep it from getting much cooler and not to keep it hotter thank you so now this thing we're gonna cut up in a white off this is gonna be the bottom layer for the middle okay push it okay if it's a little too wide it's not okay if it's too narrow okay so I'm gonna put this right on here put this right down here by the way I usually keep a wet sponge what I'm trying to do this without it lying around glue a very damp sponge a very slightly damp sponge I can put it down I can glue stuff together that doesn't want to stick don't need it if I do this right I won't need this so now I'm just gonna pull a strip of white out and I want you to do just one I want you to take this stretch it to the same length press it down make sure it's wider than this piece of orange because if it's too long it's okay and I'm pressing the center right there making sure cuts all the way to the bottom I want you to do the same okay I want you to being about the same thickness kept two portions right kneecap oh you got too much bit I think so you do a tribe now you know we'll make you see how thick it is so what we're gonna do is we're just going to pull this longer get it to the right thickness and I'm just going to cut it to the right length I'm gonna keep this stock here I'm gonna fold in the middle flow okay there you go now you could always if you need to make it square your spatula and you can push it in or you can slide the candy to the spatula to get a straight line okay now why don't you put that right on there this side yeah press it in and wanna make sure because all the way down to the bottom if there's like orange touching orange it never looks good now we're gonna grab another one of these triangles I'm just gonna fit it in here now half of its done and I'm just gonna thicken it around now you're gonna do the other half and you're just gonna you don't have to put this white divider in because we've already got it so if you're gonna do is you're gonna put a white side here a white side here put the green in but when you make the white side I want you to pull it out like this because this will give you a better idea how much can you're using and II feel better about yesterday by the way you didn't see me make the lollipop it's a little wider because I can see it's wide enough okay yeah press it on one side loose yeah just like that now you got to do one more of these just like this by the way the utensil heating up includes the scissors that's why I always keep two or three pairs of scissors around oh this is the perfect put it in here it doesn't matter we can just rotate it around I thought this okay see how it's too short I'm gonna spread it out okay so it's gotta be the same same width top to bottom or longer it can be longer now put the top one I'm just gonna push these two together so the white pith touches the white pith nope you're just putting this right in between the two just floor it straight up and press it at all so okay so now we have two halves March our entrance and all right so I'm gonna round this one off a little bit more because I want them both to be the same width it'd be easier if we put it together and I'm just gonna together like this now you know wants that wet paper towel very damp very slightly wet paper towel might be useful right now see I'm not used to the bottom getting cold because your he comes from above my key comes from below there we go so now I'm just gonna go like this so now yeah well that's excellent now I need you to this over here whoa and you need to make sure it goes 360 degrees in all parts of it since my table is evenly heated you need to so you're only rolling it halfway you need to roll it 360 degrees and I'm assuming with that heater you're gonna have to lift it up occasionally and turn it or one spot it's always the spot is always going to be the hot at the hottest does that make sense uh-huh so now you see you see one the white right here didn't come all the way to the edge oh okay so now we have to figure out the diameter of this so I'm gonna mark that I am to here with my finger it's gonna go around to here okay so that's how wide I need my white to keep it rolling okay and now we needed as long as this piece I may have used a little bit too much white in the center so we may end up not using the whole thing thank you okay let me yeah so your heating thing is hotter in the back and cooler in the front mine's hotter on the left and cooler on the right so I'm having a little trouble converting so we're doing this we just made a little to body now putting the pith on well so it's not sticking just gonna take this goggle it we did see somebody else it's just glue you know water makes candy sticky sometimes it's a useful thing yeah okay we make this a little smaller make our life easier and to hold more heat in can you continue to roll this okay now we're gonna do the outside wrap this can be done by one person it's very difficult to learn with Walker's okay I need a measurement to know how long I'm in so you see the seam here it's a real easy measurement we're gonna put the seam here we're gonna roll it around goes to the hole you'll notice when I'm pulling it I'm lifting it up if you don't lift it up it pulls unevenly I had a thin spot you usually have thick spots over here you just cut off the fix pocket the scissor to patch the thin spot donal ever notice that looks good let's do another measurement from here to there it looks like I've got the right distance so I'm gonna see you're gonna lift that up I'm gonna slide this over and you put it right down the center mm-hmm I'm gonna put this up like this I'm putting this up like this if you notice I'm not rolling it over I'm pulling it over because I made it a little smaller there's the overlap it's it's better to stretches now the whole things now if you notice I did two things I made the outside wrap a little longer I don't always have that option but that that'll reheat the ends too we made the inside very cold eventually we wanted all the same temperature so what I did to solve that problem is the outside wrap is hotter it's heating up the inside it's evening everything else it's just something I don't show this on the video because it can take a while but just by poking the end I can tell if it's heating up or not evening everything out and the last bit here it's gonna be too cold anyway that's why I pinch off the ends that in the image listen so now we're gonna pinch it so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna size it down to a smaller diameter so once you try that we're gonna roll it and pinch at the same time slowly it's not a lot of pinching is you don't to distort it too much now we're gonna start stretching it they grip the right there that's actually easiest way to do it we just want the force to go everywhere evenly just what beat your help you see how that works that got my start beautiful you know I have to keep it moving because I'll get a flat side if I don't also I'm gonna need that white chopper over there you see this little spot over here so now all we need to do just do a smooth motion and we have orange fun thing about this is another scissors of yours again start stretching this out my goal is to keep the back half I need you to help now okay you're gonna be the roller so once I put this out it's still going to be hot in there if it is hot when it um it sort of if it's hot that's out here you can just I need to roll it on currents gonna fight you because it's gonna have a flat side at first that make sense yeah I'm trying to do it on this those pads I have have some grip and definitely help the roller now when I give these to you the hot ones are going to want to stick to other hot ones right so put a hot one between two over it okay and then it won't not only want it to sit but the cool ones always keep it straight now it's your turn to pull I didn't use my chopper here's the stuff see how it got flat side here so your job is to keep the I might drop sir keep the spinning your job is to pull go to the other side of me and I'm gonna show you how the pulling works sort of like petting a cat you don't kind of tack by choking it you pet a cat by sliding your hand down it yeah that's perfect and you're aiming for good I hotter the other way this can be as long as you can handle don't worry about twisting your [ __ ] neck Indians you want us to show here and go or if you end up with too much hanging off at it we'll all go down at once why don't you wanna shortest you know characters get wedding we're making it look like something that we can would like others to choke chopper this is a sharp edge that works by the way what I'm doing is not what it looks like you're you roll what I'm doing its up swinging it all the way what we're trying to do is we're not so much cutting it is we're breaking what I mean by that it's watch this this is a non-newtonian fluid so if I get a sharp enough blow it'll just wear smoothly and straight that's kind of dull you might want to try the round end of the scissors and you have a better lock watch the other side Heil smoochy yeah if you cut it with scissors it'll be like a candy cane and you have to do that right now if you want to see if we cut it with scissors it just sucks I mean when you cut it it's oh it's gonna be fine that's the pitch but you it'll be absolutely fine but you lose a piece at the end then at the image on IV broad yeah and that could be you know one out of every 30 pieces you don't want to do that keep them rolling you don't you oh keep all rolling yeah can you come down here take this over I'm gonna give you some pictures gloves oh you got that kind of gloves - your stick just keep it rolling like this you want to do a full 360 degrees this end should be closer to the heat source so now we're gonna come down here so we actually want to do you see how that one had a little bend in it super oh so now because these things this thing's still gonna get as long as the conventions you get a flat side I'm going to keep rolling yeah gotta be in the air like that give me against the table who's against the table you're swinging fruit so what I do is I hold the thing off with my left hand [Music] and by the way the length of dispossession covered by your ability so you can't roll any wider than about this spread of your arm right it's thinner he's got a cup inner floss [Applause] are you supposed to keep rolling but I certainly know a certain point they're hard like that okay and then I tend to scoot the hard ones off because they're not necessarily in order when you alternate okay this is getting a little cold this is getting to support one of the trick is not to let it get this long yeah lots of distortion up there that's okay but back this off you see how that broke yeah not too cool at this point it'll stretch it very cool always okay it'll be chopped it's a piece of cinema sure oh you can have to keep it rolling for that I'm just gonna work around the roller it's flexible enough we don't keep the heat even doesn't take long and the heavier it is the more likely it is to flatten out [Music] now I'll tell you if you're doing something a car you can get away with doing letter yeah the more detail to design but the orange is really it's forgiving it's where we start people go go the only way you learn like anything else is doing now look at how easy is pulling it up and just cannot be what it was like pretty was a kid yeah you're this good reviewer kid oh yeah try the ground into the scissors this seems to be better you gotta let it pass through and here commute for dropping it's attached to something else should we have the fans we usually well that might be useful over there yeah oh thank you oh yeah yeah but I mean this is going off so fast in here but yes we use a fan too know what's kind of on it'll be fine they do break they break when they cool and they're not round it makes cutting a little bit slower you like the cards if you're cutting multiple sticks at a time which is the efficient way to go let's say two of them stick together go play with the non-newtonian properties to break apart well if a section becomes too cold sacrifices yeah you don't know one party to hack off of it just like every day's the same this is the same thing we should be very similar to point an oh we're just keeping it rolling you did it right to a triangular right yeah I've seen from the French guys new candy canes with squares where three each three on one side one each on the other side needle inside right no no no that was handmade ones oh let me take a lecture get a four out of it so now let's take a look in a second this is different than mine it's coming down here so let's just on my I do have an over this veto in a batch roller and I have the name of the board the trick here is to make sure all side computers yeah right so if you just go like this on the half three yeah I can't get the border to cash out okay you can do it this is pride by the way you want to get a good deal by the way it's tough at this is this is as tough as I like it when I'm doing the real detailed work because the hotter it is the less distortion you get in the middle or the colder it is the less distortion does this kind of more stays play I'm really gonna want some footage off you different all right there we go I made a swamp just the only time you've ever made arcane is over then yes the first time yeah we're gonna start cutting somewhere around here we have that metal block right there come on right there yeah so this looks like a perfect thing to use you just need a sharp edge so let's take these I'm gonna go for the cool ones to do in about two or three of those they want to break under their own weight so you really need to open the hands and the longer they are you may want to break them in half before you ever cut them so all this is just it's actually just about the perfect thing to use also so Steve those ones are so they I want use the ones ever come over there once you take them away yeah here's the things yeah so you're gonna start with one we're gonna start with not a long walk but a short so you're gonna put this over here now gonna angle it down like that and this has to hit at the right angle to this I don't care what angle you do you just have to follow it's that way exactly sideways a little think of it as scissors can do it absolutely flat it's hard to do it because your hand wants to angle so I usually find the comfortable angle for my hand to go speed and I match it with this does that make sense otherwise you end up hurting yourself if it dings if it gets chipped you know it doesn't go all the way through rotate it a little bit you're not going to get it to work on the same way you try to oh you want it's just harder to do they can't be apart at all daily I know I need an apartment even you apprentice there is a machine one is currently meeting me and all I can hope of everyone who talks about it it's pretty terrible candy that doesn't looks like you no one was made I'm not sure when I'm in the nineteen forties thirties World War two it's obviously a European it was an American make the makers name would be stamped on every possible area this is nothing there are two guys you know the one that's currently being made doesn't do a good job this one appears to but the one I have let's look at apart and suddenly tears and what scared - I'm sure I can take it apart that's I have a friend who rebuilds transmissions [Music] [Music] do you see this you see the jagged pieces it wasn't a no straight angle oops well see how you just got that turn it maybe halfway now from longer strokes and some pieces may just be set up they want to shatter yeah I don't by the way I don't wear those heavy gloves at this point I can tease dude I'm just wearing vinyl oh yeah actually it's not really when I'm going fast like I don't go but uh i neva then yeah I can't but if I'm doing the angwa power strokes as close as possible without hitting it this head tells the blade I mean it doesn't mess up the candy way your back on if you get tired let me know I'll take over I didn't have the muscles to do the damn g'day I'm creams but I have the muscles to do this oh yes make it stuff in there after a while like four funnels in it I can't be more than like five pounds or yeah I think it's just after like oh we're just discussion yeah holding that funnel for like that line it was not that long for me and it just broke me down it's actually my knees because you had on the low thing and I was crouching you know I'm afraid I have a few want to do another batch of this but I think the ribbon candies but people we're gonna want to stay doing really I got so many comments why don't you do it like her with her fingers I was wondering when you were saying fruit by the foot what you were talking about yeah [Music]", "bwbZTN4fMGM": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today i'll be showing you how to infuse starbursts so delicious and surprisingly was one of the easiest edibles i've ever made and i feel like i'm going to make these many times in the future they turned out so well [Music] to make these starbursts here's what you're going to need some starburst candy i wish i could have had the all pink kind but we don't sell them in canada so i just got the original infuse coconut oil and optionally you can also use a concentrate or extract to make them extra strong and some lecithin to help with absorption first i have the top part of my double boiler and then i'm going to peel the wrapper off of some starbursts and place them in the bowl i use 30 pieces here but the amount you use doesn't matter too much the recipe is very forgiving then you're gonna heat up a pot to a light boil and place your double boiler container thing on top and then using the spatula you're going to use to mix everything together add a scoop of some lecithin and then mix that in they do take quite a while to melt so just keep an eye on them and for the first five minutes or so they probably won't melt that much so you can pretty much just leave them be but then after five minutes when they start to melt like this um just keep stirring them and watching them until they melt all the way down then once everything is pretty much melted like this we can add our coconut oil so i'm going to be adding one tablespoon of coconut oil but you can add for this amount of starburst up to three tablespoons of coconut oil and to make it stronger i'm also going to be adding some concentrate now we just have to mix everything together so i'm having some trouble getting the starburst and the oil to emulsify together you can see um the oil kind of just doesn't really blend into it at all so i'm going to grab a whisk and see if that'll help us emulsify a little bit better so using the whisk aggressively actually turned out very well everything mixed together and it worked better than i expected honestly now i'm just going to put my starburst mixture onto a baking pan that is covered in waxed paper and then i'm just going to place another sheet of wax paper on top and kind of roll it and shape it out to the thickness i want in the end i feel like i wish i would have made it a little bit thicker so it would have been the exact same thickness of actual starburst but next time i'll do that i guess and then i just use this sharp utensil to kind of just shape it so i could have nice corner edges and then i placed it in the fridge now while i'm waiting for it to cool in the fridge i'm going to heat up my double boiler again because um i don't want to waste any of the starburst and the coconut oil mixture that's left in the pot so i'm going to make a little drink out of it so i have a whole video on how to do this and to be honest that video is going to give you a much tastier result than this one because this is just like a little makeshift one i did and i'll post the link of how to make that drink below pretty much you're just going to add some water and heat it up so you can get all the mixture combined and then you're going to add a drink mix to it and then cool it and serve it over ice but check out the video i have on how to make an infused starburst drink because it's like literally one of the most delicious drinks i've ever had and you can put quite a bit of coconut oil in there and you can't taste it which is very surprising considering how much i put in it okay so now that our drink is made and our starburst has cooled down a bit i actually left mine in the fridge a little bit too long it was about a half an hour and i felt like it was a little bit too hard for me to cut easily so i just took it out of the fridge for five ten minutes until it was ready to be cut so i'm just going to start by cutting these little edges on the side which i'll probably just snap on while i'm cutting and then i'm going to cut all of these into squares after i cut them i realized that i feel like the size was not accurate to the size of a starburst so when i make these next time i'm going to actually place a starburst on there and measure it out now they're all done so i'm just going to throw them into their little container and that's it they are ready to eat [Music] these turned out so well i'm so so happy with them this is probably going to be my go-to instead of gummies now they just just everything is amazing thank you guys so much for watching i hope you enjoyed this video if you did please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe thanks so much guys have a wonderful day [Music] you",

and we're gonna talk about the history of pink grapefruits because it's humid we heated the sugar a little hotter than normal it's about 315 to 320 degrees and it's already flavored with pure grapefruit oil and yes you can get oil out of a grapefruit Marky is pouring this hot sugar mixture onto our cooling table which is a giant steel heatsink it's going to drop the temperature a whole lot and change it from a liquid into a semi solid so he can start sculpting it into the artwork that will be the final candy mark he and I take turns adding color to the hot sugar solution I'm adding pink and he's adding yellow the yellow will be the skin of the grapefruit the pink will be the inside wedges we've got to do this before the candy cools down on this cooling table if Zuma gets dropped quickly because soon it will be in a shape that we can sculpt it into its final artwork if you look carefully when we stir you'll see that steam is coming off and the candy solution is boiling the sugar itself is pure sugar there's nothing to boil in there but it's so hot any water in the food coloring boils out almost immediately and turns to steam and this is good because we leave the moisture in there the candy would be sticky in its final product [Music] grapefruits are sour and that's what this white powder is it's pure citric acid going in and that's gonna make the candy nice and sour so that it tastes like a grapefruit now we have to separate our artists palette of colors clear pink and yellow and we're going to separate them and let them cool even more by letting them drip you see the inside of this candy is very hot where it didn't touch the metal but where it touched the metal it is cooled off almost to the point of being solid we need to have urge this out and turn it into something with the consistency of a stiff clay over the years people have asked me what the favorite flavor of candy that I make is and the answer is grapefruit and I realized I've never made a grapefruit video before now grapefruit we don't sell separately we sell as part of our assortment pack it's a citrus assortment pack of orange grapefruit lime and lemon not only is this a delicious assortment but it's also a great way to train a new candy maker as they're all the same and design so there's a lot of repetition and repetition will make smoky and excellent sugar Smith's over time you may have noticed we only put the citric acid in the white that's not a problem you see the white is gonna be in every piece of candy and it's gonna hit your tongue and your tongue doesn't have endpoint accuracy on where the taste is so as long as we get the right amount of acid in every piece it's gonna taste just like you want it to but we need to make part of it white and the citric acid being white itself hides beautifully in the white and we do this by pulling the candy on the hook this is both a harder skill and a hotter skill to master than most people think and here goes marque as he's going to do a beautiful job with it this is just about his first time soloing doing this [Music] we sell our grapefruit online as part of our citrus assortment which includes lime lemon orange and grapefruit and you can get that on our website too w WP e D net and check out the website there are all sorts of cool things there to ever come through Tallahassee Florida please come and visit we're open from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. we don't make candy all the time but we have brunch in the morning and serve ice cream in the evening and if you're lucky you can catch us making candy because we do make a lot of candy there we're going to start building the art for the grapefruit and we're gonna do this with six pink wedges one wedge for each ledge of the grapefruit marquee and I shaped the grapefruit wedges and let them cool just a little bit so that they'll hold their shape I pull the white and I picked my strength against the candy this will be a line stretching across the diameter of the grapefruit grapefruits have their start in the Western Hemisphere but their ancestors did not they are a cross between a Jamaican sweet orange which is actually an ancient variety and a pomelo which comes from Barbados it probably started as a naturally occurring hybrid it came to North America in 1823 here in Florida in a town known as safety harbor it didn't originally go by grapefruit either it went by Shattuck or shoptalk until sort of in the mid 19th century when it changed a grapefruit because the fruits unlike most citrus forming bunches around the tree or at least that's what the documentation says I have a 40-foot grapefruit tree in the backyard of my house and on a good year I get 200 grapefruits and on a bad year I get 800 grapefruits and I gotta tell you these things don't seem to clump together in more than bears on my tree and then in Texas the first pink grapefruit was found naturally and it became extremely popular and they discovered if they did some breeding they can get some that were absolutely blood-red but unfortunately in a short time they faded back to pink they solved this problem by exposing the trees to radiation yes some cesium it seems and the radiation locked in the red mutation this may make the red grapefruit the first genetically modified organism end up on our supermarket shelves and this is why we make our candy grapefruits make now we built one giant piece of candy and we have to mass-produce it down to about four or five thousand pieces and we do this by scaling it we first have to get a little narrower here as we convert the log into rods [Music] Marky's scales down the candy on the batch roller this big metal machine makes this a little easier it keeps the candy spinning you see it's still sort of a liquid and if we leave it still it will go flat under its own weight by spinning it like this we get to keep it in a round shape and keep the image we've worked so hard on from distorting we now have two things going on and one is our patreon page and thank you patreon subscribers if you're a subscriber you already know that you get almost daily updates about what I'm working on as well as

pursuits in public displays confection in Tallahassee Florida today we're going to make some strawberry image candy we've poured our flavored hutt sugar out into our candy Cohen's bedroom this table was made over 150 years ago in Hartfield Connecticut and we're now adding food coloring for our palate we're going to use green for the top of the strawberry yellow for the background and the seeds and of course red for the strawberry the strawberry shape that we make is a good example of how we design our image can we're not going for an exact image going clues that your brain is together making image in this case let's look at a strawberry it has yellow seeds that a little vertical specks it is a red background that has green on the top and we're going to take all of those elements and when we make the final product it's not going to look exactly like a strawberry but your brain will see it as such the white powder you see is citric acid that we've added to give that little sour lemon strawberry taste like strawberry we're about to cut apart the sugar and the edges that have been touching the metal are now cooled down to a point that we can touch them they're actually to cool but the center is still over 300 degrees we're going to cut our palate apart into pieces and then we're going to fold it together to get the temperature to be even in each of our colors an Arizona where the Batman you hope the yellow on the hook to make it an opaque yellow the room where the pastel and we've separated our colors we have green on one side waiting to become leaves and we've got the red separated into T hearts one part is going to become the seeds and if we made into a cylinder the other part is going to be saved wrap this one cylinders would be multiplied into all the seeds it's too large right now to use but when we stretch it will become smaller in diameter we'll cut it apart and you'll make it to strawberry syncopated again let the here the fellows come the Western Sun you can see us make the scandium person in Tallahassee Florida and lofty pursuits we do it right in front of everyone and that's why we call the public displays confection you can also buy our candies online or if you go to WWE at our website you can even request for custom candies to be made we make custom candies for all occasions from weddings to anniversaries to any special event we even make it with corporate logos while Greg rotates the triangular shape for the body of the strawberry maggie starts the frog she'll make the spacers that are triangles out of the yellow this is actually the harder part of the tron and then greg will use the green candy to add stripes which will become the fron itself they add letter by you by love for you is true on account of you kid they are letter by make sure my love Oh hey out of mine ready the background rat was stretched to size and log is assembled waiting for it out around the artwork in the center of the log was cooled to a lower temperature than the RAM we are going to be rolling this back and forth for a bit to equalize the temperature Maggie during this time we'll be making the outer wrap and she'll be making this with a green stripe the green stripe is there mostly because we have leftover green we don't want to waste the sugar and the outer design sometimes changes depending on what colors we have left and how much candy we've used we have to keep the log of candy moving at all times it'll distort under its own weight because it's still soft and we stretch the log into rods which then get rolled on the candy cooling table to cool down once again if we don't keep them moving they'll go flat or they'll cool all that's left is to take the rods candy and cut them to their individual bite sized pieces

mini episode of wheats the marijuana review show where we review edibles and help you make sense of your dispensary showing you which animals are worth your hard-earned dollars today we're looking at a new brand TK over edibles there are 200 milligram Bharani they proclaim it to be an award winner but don't tell us what award day one say award-winning best edible right there on the package no ingredients and no nutrition information very small brownie square tiny little thing very basic packaging so TKOs and they call it that because they sing it's going to knock me out but TV sends for technical so that is a very boring looking square ass browning smells like weed has a pretty high we'd smell or a pretty potent D weed smell I'm not optimistic to tell you the truth this nothing about the screams this is gonna be a good one it smells bad looks funky it's kind of hard but I'm willing to the doubt and it was affordable this was seven dollars at my dispensary for a what they say is a 200 milligram edibles so we shall see but let's give a taste no wait okay not good not good aroma yuck it's no koruba salted caramel or brownie but in this case guys looks we're not to see them it looks it tastes as bad as it looked there's a lot like weed there's a pretty great flavor very dry kind of stale taste in people it's not very big so yeah okay pepin back up here I have got to polish this off which is something I'm not looking forward to once I polish this bad boy off that's customary with our weeks many reviews I will come back to you guys in two hours and let you know how we're feeling and let's cross our fingers that work feeling pretty good because otherwise man I go in through some nasty food for no reason okay well with that I will see you guys in two hours and wish me luck I hope hope his ropes see you then hi guys I am back it has been 2 hours since I had the TK hoe edibles award-winner brownie and I gotta say it has been a pleasant surprise pleasant surprise it tasted pretty awful admittedly and while not quite a TKO it still packs a pretty good punch for a 200 milligram edible I'm pretty high right now I was not expecting this so maybe the awful taste was due to its onion advertised potency potent delicious every time is their catchphrase I can tell you at least one of those is true and at least one of those is false the third one I don't know so with that being said if you see a TKO edibles brownie in the dispensary near you it's affordable this cost me seven bucks and as long as you are not particular about taste as long as you are okay with the foul tasting edible give it a shot it's a potent edible for a fair price but if you're really really conscious about a flavor that's gonna be a hard pass so that's it for this review of weeks we will check you guys out on the next episode and thank you so much for watching", "pUhJnKKQDTE": "as marijuana becomes legalized throughout North America [Many] are trying edibles for the first time as a healthier option but with Edible marijuana Providing such a different experience than smoking how does it work and is eating pot Actually better for you? When you heat cannabis you effectively change the chemical makeup of compounds within it called Cannabinoids Smoking heats it to around 800 degrees Celsius and converts thc a to Delta 9 thC which binds to receptors in your brain making them continually fire and causing your imagination, thoughts and perceptions to magnify this is why every thought can feel like a significant one and Because it travels straight from your lungs into the bloodstream and to your brain the drug works within minutes and lasts about two to [three] Hours, but when making edibles the weed is heated to around 150 degrees Celsius burning less of the actual plant and minimizing Carcinogens ThC is Lipophilic not water-soluble so the activated Thc must be dissolved into something fatty like oil or butter and once the substance is consumed the onset of the high is delayed as the drug is absorbed more slowly through your gut but this high typically lasts four to eight hours and most report feeling more high than Compared to smoking marijuana [this] is because when you eat edible weed the ThC is first metabolized by the liver before entering the bloodstream and here Delta 9 thC also becomes 11 o h thC which Passes the brain barrier more rapidly and is a more potent chemical so using the same amount of marijuana You actually get more high with Edibles because it ends up creating both Delta 9 ThC And 11-OH-THC which is a stronger compound and because there are more? psychotropic types of Cannabinoids acting on your neurons you'll be high for longer of course you also get to skip out on the toxic chemicals that smoking provides like Carbon monoxide Bronchial Irritants and tumor Initiators smoking anything means you're inhaling cancer-causing molecules so if you can get high without smoking it will be healthier for your lungs and body the downside it's much harder to control the High you'll get because it can take up to one to two hours to feel the full effects and the dosage can vary significantly modulating the effects or Titrating as it's called is much more difficult [and] as a result you can end up a lot higher than you intend - but unlike those who consume too much alcohol Opioids or other drugs you won't be suffering any serious long-term harm Toxicity [or] Lethal overdose if you do consume more than you intended [if] you've ever wondered why marijuana gives you the munchies? check out our AsAP stop video that breaks down the science behind that by clicking the screen or using the link in the description and subscribe for more weekly science videos every Thursday", "5EVEDI5VAgQ": "Hello, this is Lin and Mei from Candylabs! Today, we're bringing you another candy-making video. Today, we'll be making a 7 kilogram batch of candy. The design will be a suhi or a maki roll. There will be 5 ingredients in our sushi candies: there will be crab, egg omlette, cucumber strips, salmon, and rice but all made of candy! We're adding the citric acid now. This is a strawberry-kiwi flavoured candy, so it's fairly sour. Now, we're pouring the candy from this pot onto the table, so we can cool them more evenly faster. [music begins and metal clangs of tools] This white, right here, is going to be the white for the sushi and the black on top is going to be our seaweed. [music, metal clangs, and scissors cutting] [music and scrapping noises] Now, we're folding the candies on the granite table. This helps us to cool down the sugar evenly and mix well the colour and flavour, as well. I guess you can say I am preparing the rice for our sushi and Mei is preparing the seaweed! Now, I'm going to stretch our rice - the white candy - on the hook. A lot of viewers ask me, \"Why do I put the white colour into the white?\" since we can stretch the candy to white. The reason for that is very simple: We can make the white even whiter and brighter. Right now, I'm stretching this piece of candy on the hook. This is what we use to stretch a bigger portion of candy, where we can't stretch by hand. We're going to stretch this piece about 120 times to give us the perfect texture and colour. And... 120! Look at that! How beautiful it is... [music and stretching noises] As you can see, we're stretching the smaller portion on the hot table. This way, it doesn't cool off too fast. Believe it or not, it actually requires more physical strength than if we stretch it on the hook! [scissor snip] [banging and stretching] [scissor snip] So right now, Mei is stretching the salmon, which is made of orange and white. I'm doing the pink part. That's going to be our crab meat. [music begins again, stretching and banging] Right now, we're working on the crab meat piece. We're going to make it a triangle shape just for the fun of it. But, the two little white triangles beside it are to maintain its shape. m[metal table banging, sticky rolling, and music] [scissor snip] So right now, I am making the omlette part of the maki. It's going to be a square shape inside the maki. We will place this one on top of the crab meat that we made. She's making the salmon piece inside the maki. That is going to be a quite complicated one. [music and metallic sliding] [music, sliding, peeling, and smacking] [scissor crunching and cutting] [music and sticky peeling] [music and sticky rolling] So now, we're using these two kinds of green to make the cucumber part of the maki rolls. There will be about 8 strips of cucumber slice inside the roll. [music ends] [louder sticky peeling and rolling] [scissor crunching the candy] We're going to wrap this cucumber rectangle with the white to separate them. Then, we're going to stretch them into 8 and stick them back together. Now, we have 2 pieces. I'm going to continue to stretch, and then cut them again so we can have 4. [scissor snip] [scissor snip] Now, I'm going to put our 8 cucumber strips next to our crab and omlette. [clunky rolling and scissor snip] [music returns, clunky rolling] Just like a real sushi, the ingredients in the middle are going to be covered by a layer of rice, which is our white candy right here. [music and stretching] Alright. Time to assemble. [music and swooshing wiping] [music and sticky peeling] [music and clunky rolling] So while she's making the sushi roll round, I'm going to make the final touch: the seaweed wrap around the maki roll. [music, smacks, and sticky peeling] Now, let's make this giant sushi roll small. This is where the magic happens, guys. The gravity will help us pull the candy. [metallic chops and music] [metallic rolling and chopping with music] Thank you very much for watching our videos. You can now book workshops online, where we teach your how to make your own sushi candies. Come visit us! We are located in downtown Montreal. Have a sweet day! Au revoir!", "DiLc2xUQxWA": "[Music]", "L2EvOegVsN8": "hey guys welcome back today I'll be showing you how to make peach ring gummies I am including a recipe in this video but you can use any recipe you like you could even buy orange and yellow pre-made store-bought gummies and just melt those down and that will work just as well and this video is going to include some troubleshooting because I had quite a bit of issues making these I had to remould them multiple times I'm gonna show you guys how they started which was like this but eventually I got to them to come out like this here's what you're going to need 1/3 of a cup of water three and a half tablespoons of gelatin 1/4 teaspoon potassium sorbate mixture which I will link how to make below 1 teaspoon citric acid 1/2 teaspoons of peach flavoring oil 1 tablespoon of Tincher 1/4 cup of sugar 1/4 cup corn syrup 1/2 a tablespoon lecithin white food coloring and yellow and orange food coloring the first step is to bloom your gelatin so just pour your gelatin over your dish of water as well as your citric acid your potassium sorbate mixture your flavoring oil and the lecithin no need to stir this just leave it to bloom for about 5 minutes now pour your sugar and your quan syrup into a saucepan and heat that up once that begin to melt you can add in half of your gelatin mixture and then stir that in you're going to add in a candy thermometer and you want to keep stirring and heating up this mixture until it reaches between 200 to 210 degrees once it's heated up to that temperature you can add in your remaining gelatin mixture and stir that in then turn off the heat now I'm just going to pour in my tincture and stir that in and then because I'm going to be doing three different colors I'm going to separate this into different dishes I'm going to be coloring one yellow one orange and this one here is white and yellow I filled up a pyrex dish with very hot water to keep my mixtures warm while I'm not using them and then I'm going to pour my first one into a plastic bag that I have sprayed with cooking spray so it doesn't stick and then I'm going to fill up the first half of my molds alright so you can clearly see I'm having a lot of issues pouring the mixture into the molds it's too sticky it's making a mess and not coming out smoothly so I try to warm it up again and that is not working so I am just going to have to figure out how to fix these and what I decided to do was to take them all out and remelt them with some more water and a little bit of gelatin so I added a couple tablespoons of water a few for the microwave for about 30 seconds and then now I'm going to add in half a teaspoon of gelatin and just mix that in I decided instead of a plastic bag I'm going to put it into a squeeze bottle so I'll have better control of how much is coming out and you can see how amazingly it's coming out it's absolutely perfect I was very happy I also added a little bit of water to each of my yellow and orange but not extra gelatin as there wasn't a large enough amount for it to matter I wanted to try and see if I could put the yellow and orange directly on top obviously I couldn't so that means I needed to leave it in a freezer to cool down for a bit and then after all of that work I realized something very unfortunate and that is that I did everything in the wrong order so the curved part of this mold is on the bottom meaning that I needed to have the orange and the yellow on the bottom and the yellowy white color so once again I am pulling them out and going to warm them up and remould them and then I just threw it in the microwave and poured it back into my little squeeze bottle and everything looks like it's gonna be perfect third time's the charm right let's hope so well after this was done I put them in the freezer for about half an hour and they were good to come oh they look beautiful well after all this hard work I am happy to say they came out very nice they have a beautiful texture they look wonderful hopefully if any of you guys try this out some of my mistakes will help you guys not make them and then I want something to have sugar on them so I'm just gonna throw the ones that have a little bit of imperfections into a container of sugar shake them up and then lay them out to dry and just a reminder that before you cover your gummies in sugar you need to make sure you have let them sit out for at least 24 hours so any excess moisture evaporates otherwise they will become watery thank you guys very much for watching this video if you enjoyed it please leave a comment give us a thumbs up and subscribe also let me know do you guys prefer shorter videos that I don't include any troubleshooting or errors or you prefer videos like this where I kind of talk about things that can go wrong and how you can fix them let me know in the comments below", "FAWkFq5zPi4": "hi everyone there's flowers on 1970 and this morning I am going to show you how I make my suckers it's basically the same way you make the candies your quarter cup of canola oil which I already put in the pot your half a cup corn syrup I use beehive please do not use like Aunt Jemima or anything like that like pancake syrup don't use that use beehive or you can use a no-name brand I believe that is bought a fresh coordinate Aunt Jemima because it won't turn out so we got our quarter cup of oil in there we have our half a cup of corn syrup and I'm going to do the 3/4 cup of white sugar while there's no numbers on it so I had to put a mark on the stove so medium it depends how hot your stove goes to be quite honest so I keep it if it was numbered I think it would be number four or five on the stove so I'm just gonna stir in the goodness and don't worry about it all being granule e because it will dissipate it'll heat and it'll go to a liquid state so there we go get my candy thermometer you will need a candy thermometer it has to go up to 300 degrees because 300 degrees is the hard candy state so I put that in there and put my timer on the stove for 12 minutes just so I don't forget that there's something on the stove I have done that before so we let that go and it sometimes goes from 12 to 15 minutes depending on the temperature of your stove you don't want to burn it because it's a total waste of ingredients especially the can of butter so I have my sucker trays I have my sucker sticks I'm going to make 20 suckers I believe it is we'll see how many we can get out of the mix I should be able to make 20 suckers and their happy face suckers so we're gonna watch this boil which is probably gonna be boring so maybe I should pause it you know we'll just let it go if I pause it I'll probably rough it and shut it off or something like that so I'm gonna go get my ball and I'll be right back piece got my tea got my bong so yeah it takes about 12 minutes or so to reach 300 degrees I do stir it occasionally just to move the mix around the butter doesn't always cling to you'll see it's kind of like when you fry eggs and you put oil or butter in the pan you'll see a little bit of the the residue on the outside of the item you're cooking and that's basically what happens here so I try and stir it all together but you're not gonna get it all mixed even when you're pouring it out you'll have some butter left over and I call it sweet butter there you're see see how well that's bubbling that's what you want so we got nine minutes left and I'm not even sure what kind of candies I want or what kind of suckers I want to make today I have caramel watermelon Apple raspberry butterscotch and cherry I'm thinking cherry what do you guys think wish I was live so I could ask you guys so butterscotch or cherry I don't know I'm gonna put them in my hand I'm gonna do this I'm not even gonna look I'm not even gonna look and I'm gonna pull one out and that's which one I'm gonna make cherry so we're gonna have cherry suckers yay sometimes I put food coloring in them just to give them a little punch of color I don't always do this just because sometimes my friends when they're over here know munch on some of my candies and one of my friends this is allergic to dyes so I don't know maybe I shouldn't only two batches of suckers I'll do cherry and butterscotch and that way she can have butterscotch because there are no colorings in the butterscotch well I don't have a butterscotch colors though so as you can see it bubbled very vigorously and then it fell down so that's all normal don't think it's too high of a temperature as long as you have your thermometer in there your candy thermometer and you're paying attention to the degrees on the thermometer and keep in mind that 300 degrees is hard candy state so as long as you reach 300 degrees with your mix even a little above 300 degrees you will have a hard candy it will solidify into a hard candy state so we are at almost 375 we have 6 minutes left to go and I'm gonna take some of my medicine in a little store today so I have some Skywalker og lapped no more CBD oil that did not last long I wish it lasted longer who excuse me so I'm also gonna take you once this is all done I'm gonna put you on the other part of the counter over there and we're gonna pour out the candies so I'm thinking what a neon color or just regular color for the cherry probably regular color yeah so I hope everyone's having a good day I got my healing health compassion center shirt on and on the back it says THC and CBD equal healing so yeah this is from my local compassion center I went to a little party that they had they had their two year anniversary and I went to their anniversary party and they had games and they had some really nice food out there some cookies and cakes and sandwiches and it was really nice and they were handing out these t-shirts so it's it's an extra-large I am NOT an extra-large person but I got myself a nightgown it works so we are reaching 300 degrees and let that bubble a little longer clean up my mess over here so I can put everything down on the counter yeah so hope everyone's having a good day hope it's a beautiful day where you are it's very warm out here today I think right now it's almost reaching 20 degrees and it's I don't know not quite 11 o'clock yet so I guess we're in for a hot day I was hoping for a cooler day so I'm shutting the stove off because it is at 300 degrees as you can see it said 300 degrees whether you can see that or not I don't know so we shut the stove off I need my knife so they're very hard to open at least for me so I gotta score it with the knife whoo there goes my bone there's the cherry oil oh my gosh it smells amazing maybe I should do too just so that we have really good flavor oh my gosh what did I do with my knife I am just not with it today folks know I'm a little out of it I had a good sleep though come on okay there we go - dreams of cherry we're gonna stir this baby around you can see the smoke that's okay it's just the oil you can smell it it smells amazing so I'm gonna move you over to this part of the counter so that I can show you please excuse the dishes in the sink oh no is that gonna work okay yeah please excuse this think I have a few plates in there and some stuff from doing all the baking yesterday I was just too tired to do the dishes last night but after this batch I'll do it there's no suckers gates and not prepared you are known to propose so we put the sicker sicker sicker stalks stick oh my gosh sucker sticks say that five times fast in the trays so when you pour the hot candy mixture in here that is going to push down the sticks okay so here we are oh I know something I forgot to do and I got to do it before the candy mixture goes in here you got to do this folks you have to use complements butter flavored to lubricate the sheets for the candies so I have to do that right now so that my suckers come out of the containers so there we go we're ready to pour it into the funnel got the dye today guys so there we go we got the dye in there so they look like cherry coming on folks [Music] so here's our funnel we just pour it in you're going to see the butter remain on the top some of the butter that didn't get mixed into the mixture which is fine because we just reuse that again and they pour off the SX and just put that aside so where are we at I'll go this way so he just pour it out maybe I won't get 20 suckers but that'll be alright a few is enough just munch on these throughout the day so be careful not to overflow just one enough in there sometimes I twist the stick so they get coated I think I have to do that this time too so that they stay in there sorry for the sniffling folks they still have that little bit of a cold going on oh we're gonna get 20 suckers hi mama oh wait that's Molly and because there's still so much in there I'm just gonna pour out the butter the oil I have another tray I don't know if you can see this pink one over here I'm just gonna fill that with the rest of [Music] they smell amazing you guys I wish you to smellivision love cherry so there we go that's it and then you stick them in the fridge or the freezer for about 10-15 minutes and they will solidify but with the suckers I can't move them like that I'm turning the stick so that they all get covered with the mixture and they'll be gooey and all stick together instead of this one didn't even go in excuse me I'm so sorry about that everyone it's I really feel like I have a cold I should probably be wearing gloves but because I'm the only one eating these suckers so we're gonna let them sit there for about 20 minutes I'm gonna put this one in the freezer and there you have it so I'll just let these solidify I might even put these in the freezer and you see if the Train will fit there we go good thing I didn't go shopping and fill that freezer full of stuff yeah so it smells amazing in my kitchen smells sweet and there you have it folks and in one of my videos I will show you the actual suckers but there you go just let them Harden in the fridge and I don't know about 10-15 minutes maybe 20 minutes if you want and pull them out and enjoy so enjoy everyone have a great day love and peace stay tuned stay unique bye", "xlfkPFBW36o": "hey Pennsylvania patience it's me again medical Mary let's melt down some butterscotch we're gonna try to make some hard candies with our SL and let's open some of these I put 20 in here we have 1/2 gram let's melt them down I highly suggest using a rubber spatula we're trying to stir this mixture because it's gonna get stuck on everything else even though I swear when you cook with these I will never lick the spatula because it tastes like rubber okay it's a weird taste to it so well melting these down you just kind of want to keep stirring it so we don't burn it we're get it stuck to the bottom it will start to melt if you want it to go a little quicker you can smash them up first but I kind of want to see how long it took just to melt when I need the Jolly Ranchers on here we had them crushed up and I had them on low forever they just it turn into this weird like you dumb mixture ooh so I'm trying them from full and I'm gonna go a little bit higher I have it [Music] when these all get melted we're just gonna add straight our so to it and I think a little butter but I don't know that I would add anything else so if you still want that candy to get part again and here we start adding all this sticky stuff I'm not sure that it would solidify and starting to clump together keep stirring the hardest part is judging like how many you're gonna make I put in 20 hard candies I'm going to use half a gram or so it's so hard to dos when we just need peanut butter cookies doesn't that look like peanut butter I think it was a good idea that we didn't start on low started around four but I don't even think it's been ten minutes and it's almost ready for the RSO and butter ah broke this dang injector maybe this will work [Music] ding-ding-ding we have a winner [Music] [Music] oh yeah there's a piece of plastic but I don't want to waste all this I'm gonna pour it in here everything's ready to go it gets cold fast and you want to pour it back [Music] [Music] you were there you were there I know you're incorporated with the mixture damn it give any court ring for top number two [Music] [Music] so like to see which is a little lip on it [Music] so far we have a nice little mixture [Music] [Music] we had a butter double chocolate [Music]", "o3weg_vvpbk": "welcome to 420 RX cannabis cooking and confectionaries here's Jamie hi oh we're gonna make THC infused paleo coconut oil chocolate candies put my coconut oil

I've got these sublime products here elevated cannabis is a 10 milligram THC we've got this little sorrento cucumber cucumber Serrano and the desert citrus blossom sublime products I love sublime products I've talked about them numerous times again the reason being is that they're really consistent these are no different than anything else and they are low dosage again 10 milligrams can you see it there 10 milligram THC I've already taken this because I already know what they do again they're so consistent that it doesn't matter from batch to batch they're always the same and what I think is important to discuss here is how they work and why they work for me and then maybe you can decide how they're going to work for you and if they'll work for you I take these as a preemptive strike these little goodies never make me feel high I never get that I'm high from THC feeling what I do feel is a ease of anxiety so when I know I'm gonna be in a stressful situation I take these beforehand for instance I ride my bike a lot there's a lot of places out here or there is no bike lane you know people just don't care either you do not get that three feet that they are supposed to allow between you and their vehicle they don't care there's none of that so a lot of times there is no bike lane I've got like this you know what's supposed to be the shoulder but it's just kind of where the asphalt kind of trails off into gravel and that little area I have to write it as usually filled with debris and rocks and things that I have to avoid so while I look as cool as a cucumber while I seem to not be worried about anything if you were to look at my hand you would see that I would just Knight white-knuckling it you know I'm just gripping so hard but these help a lot with the anxiety and it's why I look as cool as a cucumber because these help with a lot with that I usually would take them excuse me like maybe an hour and have two hours before I knew I was gonna be in the situation and they just smooth out that edge so I'm not in a situation where I go from anxiety panic attack it is very scary riding your bike on the side of the road because people are insane anyone who rides their bike knows this and you don't have to have PTSD to have that anxiety so if you you know bright a lot like I do I'm not gonna allow my fear to stop me from living my life so these candy has helped so much with that all right so I'm done talking about how great they are this also helps a social anxiety by the way social anxiety again they won't make you feel high they won't interfere at all for me anyway because there are such a low dosage didn't they just help smooth the edges now let's talk about the flavor these two that I have I've had one before it this one I have not tried yet so I'll try here but this one if you are a fan of spicy stuff which I am I love spicy it's got a nice little heat to it it's not spicy enough for me so it's not like flaming hot level but there's a little heat you know you feel in the back of your throat as you're sucking on it and the cucumber is really nice and refreshing so this is a really good choice I have other flavors of this that I like but this one definitely is is a go-to if you like a little spice and you like a little heat definitely this one now this one I haven't had so I'm gonna try it and let you know what I think mmm they come packaged individually so whether you know this was a sample this was is what I got at 4:20 hey from Phoenix suspensory and my swag bag I was so happy that I got sublime goodies oh shoot I need my scissors hold on so I find it difficult I find it difficult to cut these open on my own I mean you can't with your teeth but there's so much easier just use some scissors you know use the tools available to you in life so such as blossom then my first thought was tangerines hmm like those little halo candies but now it's kind of devolved back into like lifesavers orange that's what it tastes like lifesavers orange so the initial yumminess in my mouth it's still good but the initial mmm tangerine kind of went to orange flavor it's good I like it I'm pretty sure something have the same effect I mean as everything else does that sublime makes yeah okay so anyway this is gonna be short one there's really nothing more for me to talk about sublime products the flavors of these candies are good they're not too sweet for a hard candy I think that's great I don't want too much sugar even though I love it and I know that's important for some of you would diabetes so not too sweet these are really great 10 milligram THC again cucumber Serrano and the desert citrus blossom both great helped a lot with anxiety if you want to get a high off of them I'd eat a bunch but keep in mind there's only five in a pack I got these for $8 I believe I eight dollars five and a five of these little candies so 50 milligram is basically for eight bucks which is not bad it's pretty much in line with everything else but again if you need the high feeling take more than one then then just figure out what your dosages for you as with everything else so I'm gonna enjoy the rest of this candy you all have a great day thanks for stopping by if you like my videos and you want to see more just subscribe to my page please maybe like the videos let me know you're watching say something

try crow there you go give us a little bit different don't be taken against some edibles so that further ado come to the close-up and Pete that [Music] all right Burke up just most bird emoji flat from the comment section as we take a look at today's edible today we're looking at these I guess the watermelon pieces and this is from the cannabis candy company oh this is actually gonna be my first package of anything from now says this 300 milligrams of THC this is a tea but ain't you know that that's my favorite out of sativa indica because it's the more creative kind of uh hi um however when you take edibles it's a different experience than smoking we wanna do is you wanna get could eat out the pack see what these two mile I see if they smell like candy if they smell heavily we then will taste you wanna see oh if it tasted the same let's get these things out the pack I see they look like all right bear cub that was not the easiest package to open well we did get it open finally on these gummies have a nice sugary coating they don't really smell too much of a cannabis they kind of just smelled like Borden on candy I'm going to you gonna go ahead and see what they taste like huh man see you see if they got like the more cannabis or more of a candy flavor 300 milligrams I guess for this whole packet I don't know how strong it cannabis taste will be but let's find out all right Burke up about to uh try these edibles and see um how much of a cannabis tasted you know it doesn't smell like like smells like candy but not but there's a back layer smell on it makes them not like smell the most appetizing but my steak room temperature it's a nice texture I'm not really din I'm a deep Canada's taste I'm getting more like a bunch ill or a fish you watermelon flavor plus our to toss harbor and not really like I'm not tasting today like stepmama TV this is Joey do you in the Mitzvah the aftertaste ain't even a relief it would like like a lot of cannabis flavor they'll do intoxicating the fact that this product may be delayed by up to two hours oh so we have to taking these you might have to wait two hours maybe I I'm already hot because I've been smoking all day um I guess I guess we'll see if these in our pride take about two more that's like three pieces should give you know I mean a decent filling mum again not not strong cannabis taste our hair other edibles where you taste it read write and told me you just taste cannabis cannabis cannabis this is a tart watermelon this is kind of like the best way I can describe it but we'll see how they develop I'm with them to a more I'm out birkut flat flat [Music] [Music]", "9-8Etzgd-lc": "with cannabis edibles and extractables becoming legal later this year there's going to be a wide range of new products hitting store shelves with an exclusive look at what we should expect this October we're joined now by B and M Bloomberg's David George cos you've got a great piece on our website with all of these details but tell us what to expect so Canadians should expect a big laundry list of new products to hit the cannabis store shelves this October when they should be formally legalized a total to be exact of 17 new products and that ranges from concentrates beverages edibles and topicals there's a very long list I'm not going to say what every one of these 17 products are although we have something that you'll see up on our screen right there but this is going to really dramatically increase the scope of the cannabis market here in Ontario and we've been talking about for the past several months on the sluggish start there's been supply shortages there's been issues in terms of retail rollout but now the the actual amount of products we can disclose is going to expand fourfold from what we currently have on the market that's going to be great for producers in terms of sales figures and and the interest generated by that but it's also going to square up the legal market with the illicit market so there's been a lot of discussion how the illicit market the black market is still flourishing but once you're gonna have the same products that the black market already has in place these will be formally regulated you know great hopefully great products that will that we'll be able to squeeze out that black market player and and really generate a lot more revenue for for these cannabis producers I have so many questions please okay the first one is I understand a producer making cannabis and then selling that cannabis but when we're talking about chocolates and candies are the cannabis companies we talk about like all these hot stocks they know how to make chocolate sinan how to make candy they're learning - okay sure and and we've got facilities and they're doing that and they are yeah that's right one example I just want to bring up is Organa Graham which is a Moncton New Brunswick based cannabis producers one of the top ten in Canada and of their their capacity they've hired a specialty kitchen and they're building a special chocolate food processing plant for this particular product to have cannabis infused chocolates hit the market this October and that's just one example can't be growth the biggest cannabis company in the world is putting the finishing touches on their bottling line in Smiths Falls Ontario \u00e1free\u00e1 down in Leamington has a very high-tech automated facility to process a lot of these concentrate materials such as rosin and wax and Shatter descriptions you can read in my story I don't think we have enough time to really describe what each one of these are but but there's going to be the second wave of Canada's products it's going to be very exciting for the industry and now we have a little bit of clarity on what exactly these products are going to be and then what about the marketing like we did all this coverage around what the products could look like when we had legalization and there are some restrictions from the government on what what things can look like they're about candy and chocolate or like we're moving into an area where it's all about the packaging and the colors and the fancy titles what's the balancing act they're like well as it stands a lot of these packaging requirements are going to be that that we see for flour products are going to be set in place for these edibles and extractables nothing's really going to change as far as the proposed draft regulations go you're still going to have a very significant warning label as well as a very you know large warning sign that this is a cannabis product which is going to be bigger than the actual brand itself there is a lot of lobbying going on right now between these producers and the industry and the government to see if there's a middle ground that they can say look we get it we don't want to make sure that these products are going to be marketed to children however you have to be a little bit flexible in terms of how it can actually market this to the Canadian consumer this is a huge thing I think about I mean as much as there's demand for it I do have this fear about you know kids somehow mistaking this stuff the other question I wanted to ask you and I'm serious about this a lot of the CEOs have said they're not cannabis users are they trying these products because if taste is important now with edibles shouldn't they be like seeing if this stuff tastes good isn't that going to be the first thing the people who haven't tried edibles before think about when they're consuming this can of yeah that's tastes good it's like when you're the king and you have like a royal tester to make sure that the soup that you have is employees in there you want to make sure that so these are good so you know it's it's that's a hard question for me to answer I just they're gonna be out there they're gonna talk about how great their product is but if they haven't tried their product so so I did a story a while back for the BNN Bloomberg website we're about two-thirds of Canadian cannabis CEOs actually do use cannabis okay so a lot of that being said every one of these companies also has a very significant Quality Assurance Department where there's someone hired and their only job is to test all the cannabis products out there the company's own as well as their competitors yeah to make sure that their quality is up to stuff and as well that they're you know they're competitors aren't doing better than they are so there are people out there and making sure that what they what they're producing is actually good product I was going to say in fairness like we're talking about Tyson Foods earlier I didn't say does the Tyson's food CEO eat chicken or meat but I'm just curious about it", "lZVirid-jL0": "hello and welcome to lofty pursuits and public displays a confection in Tallahassee Florida I'm Greg and this is a drop roller a machine that makes drops that was made in 1871 in Philadelphia Pennsylvania we're gonna use this machine today to make some hard candy and the hard candy is a bit of an experiment in color and flavor this is about the fourth batch of the day and this is what I like to make experimental candy because the machine while it's a little stained with food coloring from the previous batches is also just right for making candy easily there is an old saying that you taste food with your eyes long before you taste it with your mouth the sight of a food or a color triggers a response which brings on the flavor and leads you to expectations and this video is about those expectations and expectations also take place culturally as we've discussed in other videos the United States sees purple as the flavor of the grape specifically the concord grape and europe sees the purple flavor and candy as the flavor for black currant so now that my hot sugars are 310 degrees i pour it out on my candy cooling table and I ask what flavor is this I mean it's not clear it could be anything and that's what this video is kind of about wondering what the visuals which you can see on the other side of the internet are and how they compare to the flavors which are on my side of the video camera these associations are well known by the people who make food and prepare food for you walk down the aisles of any supermarket and you will see the tomato sauce mostly in red and something that has blueberry in it will have a splash of blue the color is there to key you to what you can't see and can't taste outside the packaging and you are tasting with your eyes and this is okay it's because it's the way we were programmed if you think about it we must have developed food skills before we even developed language skills as a people because if you didn't know when the food was ripe or when it was dangerous to eat you wouldn't be able to you know process the nutrients you made so when something feels soft and even versus lumpy or picky when something smells nice or something looks nice you have expectations and the expectations are programmed into us earlier this year with a laundry detergent tablet we can see these expectations going the wrong way and I think this is a video about breaking those expectations let me give you an example there's something called the strip effect you see you can't taste or smell the candy across the internet but you can see colors and words just fine so let's have some fun with them and then try to apply that to candy so let me demonstrate how you're programmed with colors now I'm going to display some colors on the screen and as I display them save the color out loud for instance we're starting with orange will then do red green yellow blue pink red orange and you'll see the speed is pretty consistent when you do this remember we're saying the colors we don't really care about the words but here the words and the colors will match I want you to read these out loud left-to-right the colors that these words are we'll get back to the Stroop effect in a few moments but we're gonna go play with the hot sugar now and it's cooled off to a great consistency it's sort of the consistency of silly putty or playdough we're gonna put it through these brass rollers that'll cool it off a little bit and make it keep its shape if you'll notice we're making lots of drop rolled round candy here and an opaque red and that opaque red is gonna be important in a moment so now to get at what I'm demonstrating when I show you this next card read out loud the colors not the words but the colors and see if the delay is a little longer than last time [Music] if you did this experiment correctly and just read the colors you'll find the delay going on between when you see it and when you can say it because your body's trying to say or your brain is trying to say the word that's printed not the color of the word and flavors are like this too if you try a flavor that is red and it's colored blue unless you've been trained to recognize that like we have with blue raspberry you're not gonna end up saying or tasting in this case the flavor and that's what our experiment today is we're making drops in bunches of flavors but they're all gonna be the same color and one of the meeting I told everybody what we're gonna do they looked at me and almost as once they said that's madness and I realized our flavor assortment now had a name and madness it is and we're going to pack these candies randomly mix together so you should get some of all the flavors but what flavors some of them are going to be normal do you expect black berry in pink or would you expect an apple in pink we might have butter we're looking at doing a salty flavor and a hot flavor with chili pepper in it and other flavors with this and the fun part is we're gonna be replacing flavors as we run out so we're never quite gonna know what's in the assortment but there's always gonna be six or seven flavors I'm gonna aim for a salty and a sweetness sour and some other things in here and you're gonna have to guess the flavors it's an assortment of fun and love it's sort of combining spin the bottle and Russian Roulette and will give you hints online as we put them up so pay attention when you order but they're gonna change and we're gonna throw some wild cards into because you know April first is coming up and we're gonna have some fun with this candy thanks for watching our video if you liked it you can subscribe to us here on YouTube we have a lot more candy making videos you can

have two different Jolly Rancher items to try for you they show the Jolly Rancher a misfits two-in-one gummies do you think it's really messed up on the print one Jolly Ranchers sour Serge hard candy with sour powder Center it sounds so good to me I had to get those I'm thinking Silvia was the first one to tell me about this she sent me a picture which I always appreciate the misfits were only a dollar for 3.15 ounces but the Andrews were a dollar ninety eight six and a half yeah so for these four sixty calories Mon five or ninety this one has pretty bad yeah we'll try these first standards because these are those are hard these are you get three different flavors you have green apple and cherry you have blue raspberry and watermelon they look cheap nice and you have strawberry and lemon so there's three different ones so which one do you want to try first they smell like it is no good that's the blue Wow okay those are soft revenge tequila I was expecting talk about pulling your braces off I break simplified yourself this first thing I think of okay I didn't mind the flavor that I liked the flavor of it and you didn't like it at all de Jong I was done left the application

tooth to come out yeah one of these seriously it might work okay what are we doing this to one of you to nachos ah picked green apple and cherry there's two bill like the one screaming for his life while the red one takes him over mm-hmm I like that one oh yeah that one's a lot better mm-hmm they give you the most of strawberry and lemon in this bag you get a lot of strawberry lemon I think if you were the longer these are set out they've got a little echo I feel mom I like that green apple and Jerry did you all like that no there's a chemical fire but women you really taste the lemon [Music] I like Samantha I don't bomb that one a them bear like it because it sticks around for often you keep I think my favorite look like a boat out like a gas I think my favorite was the blue rice very alarming but I really do like that green m1g Rian's I like to have fun cheering and ain't no which one did you like the best ball carrier the one I just had to grab 100 in the car all right green apple and cherry so I didn't think it immediately killed that limit and I think that would last you a long time because they are so chewy I think you can put it in your mouth and just leave it on your tongue for a little while without you know it enjoys me a long time because in the beginning those would get thrown away all right Eggar what flavors are in this but we should we have does it say on the back no it's gonna be probably a blue raspberry and chariot and apples lemon it's still like from ball okay I can't believe it doesn't have so I hadn't grapefruit you can't believe it Israel what

power I didn't get the power but he got knocked out with this yeah I just think it's about the net cherry Viper was extremely sir I think it's funny that we're both hoping the pink one the pink one I

and thanks for watching [Music]", "kQuwgg6DNLU": "how to make awesome homemade lollipops hello everyone today I'm going to show you how to make lollipops at home using three different methods store-bought candy molds free form on a cookie sheet covered with a silicone mat or parchment paper or how to make your own mold using cornstarch making your own cornstarch mold is actually pretty easy all you need is a shallow container I'm using a baking dish that's kind of small but I was only making a few lollipops in there put in the cornstarch you're going to smooth off the top using a spoon or maybe something like a like a popsicle stick just drag it across the top to smooth it out you don't want the cornstarch to be compacted because you're going to be using a some kind of object in this case I'm using I'm going to use a juice bottle cap I'm going to press that into the cornstarch to make the mold cavities now I made a mistake here I dumped the cornstarch in what I should have done was sifted the cornstarch into the container and it would have been kind of light and fluffy and I wouldn't have the problem I'm having here when I was pressing the bottle cap into the cornstarch I had to press pretty hard it was sticking to the cap and made the bottom of my cavities uneven so sift the cornstarch smooth it out gently and then press in whatever object you want to make as your candy these are hard candy lollipop molds I bought these online because I couldn't find any locally I'll put a link in the description box if you're interested to prepare these you'll need to spray them a little bit with some cooking spray just so that the candy releases well now these are specially made to withstand high temperatures and are for hard candy making you could also make chocolate lollipops with these as well but do not try to make hard candy lollipops with molds the clear ones that are designed for candy melts or just for chocolate because they will melt nd I bought two kinds I bought just the plain round ones and I bought flower ones but there's a whole pile of different ones available okay so here we go on to the actual candy making in a large saucepan place two cups of white granulated sugar a quarter cup of water and two thirds of a cup of light corn syrup you can also use the golden corn syrup as well it'll just affect the final color of your candy if you can't find corn syrup where you live you may be able to find a candy recipe that doesn't use it you just might have to look around a little bit now to flavor this candy I'm using some orange extract I put in one at teaspoon they actually sales specially made candy oils for candy making you only have to use a little bit and if they have intense flavors I didn't have any in the house at the time so I just used the orange extract now you're going to begin to heat this mixture over high heat at the beginning you're going to have to stir continuously because you don't want it to scorch or stick to the bottom and at this point you can also add some food coloring if you want to change the color now I wanted to match the orange extract so I added some yellow and some red to make a nice bright orange color I'm using paste food color but you can use the liquid food coloring as well now you're going to need to stir this continuously until it begins to boil once it begins to boil you can stop stirring now I've seen some candy recipes that ask you to add in the coloring and the flavoring after you're done boiling the candy either at the beginning instead of the end and it still worked out okay so I don't think it matters so I'm a mixture has come to a boil now you can stop stirring and you need to continue to boil this until the temperature of the mixture reaches 310 degrees Fahrenheit now in order to be able to tell you've reached the right temperature there's a couple things you can do you can use a candy thermometer these are relatively inexpensive if you're going to make candy often go and buy one because they're really really useful if you don't have a candy thermometer or don't want to go buy one you need to heat your candy until it reaches the hard crack candy stage I'll put a link in the description box that shows you what that means now I turn the heat down just a touch from high to medium high I just made sure that the candy continued to boil until it reached 310 degrees once it reached the right temperature I transferred it into another container that had a spout on it just so that it would be easier to pour once you're done pouring the candy out of the pot into the other container do not scrape down the sides of the pot or the bottom just leave the residue in there and I'll show you how to clean that pot out in a minute now at the beginning you'll notice that your candy mixture will be very runny and I'm going to fill the hard candy molds up first with it you just pour enough in to fill the mold and try not to add so much as if they leak out into the handle or where the lollipop stick is going to go the lollipop sticks I'm using are actually paper and I purchase them at the bulk barn but you can also buy them at candy-making supply stores or baking supply stores so I just push them into the candy and there was a bubble there so I just burst it and push the candy onto the stick now I'm going to fill the cornstarch mold cavities with the mixture same thing just gently pour it in there now I'm very intrigued with this cornstarch method and I think I'm going to try maybe another video and try to make different shapes and this time I'm going to sift the cornstarch in to see if it makes a big difference but you can imagine how much fun you can have with this so I filled in all of the mold cavities and then I added the sucker stick or the lollipop stick I just put it in there gave it a little bit of a turn and then just gently press down on it to sink it into the cornstarch so that it was in the center of the lollipop now another variation that I actually saw on Martha Stewart website was it you can add sprinkles and decorations to these while the candy is still hot these are little fall leaves sprinkles different little maple leaves different colors and while the Candy's hot just sprinkle it on and just gently press it into the candy and let it harden and you've got these little decorated pops you can decorate for absolutely any occasion as you can imagine I had these little pumpkin sprinkles as well so I press some of those now for the freeform lollipops if you're making them freeform without a mold I suggest that you allow your candy to cool a little bit when it cools it won't be as runny and if it's not as runny it'll be easier for you to control the flow and to make nice little round lollipop shapes if the candy is really hot and are really runny it may leak all over the place and you'll get very very thin lollipops the Martha Stewart website actually suggests that if you're making them free freehand like I'm doing here you take your pot when you're done boiling it put the pot into an ice water bath to cool it down a little bit more quickly but since I filled all those other molds first by the time I got to the freeform method it had cooled down quite a bit so as you can see it's a bit harder to get the same size of same shape but it's the same idea you pour it on and then you add in your lollipop stick and you can see here just by looking when I was pressing in these sticks that they had it had cooled significantly and you can even add candies in this case I'm pressing in some candy corns because it was near Halloween time that I was making these and the cool candy had cooled quite a bit so I had to press them in but it still worked quite nicely now as far as cleanup goes when you're done with the pot put it immediately in the sink and fill it with hot water and just the hot water sitting in the pot will dissolve any of the candy that's in there the same thing goes with the rest of your utensils like the this measuring cup that had some candy left in it and any measuring tools you have like a spoon or maybe your candy thermometer put it in let it sit in the hot water and the candy will dissolve all on its own or you can even take the pot and put it back on the stove filled with water and just let the water simmer and you'll simmer away all the candy as well so you can see it's sat there for about an hour a lot of the candy has gone out of the measuring cup and all the candy has disappeared out of the pot as well so it's nice and clean so cleanup is not a nightmare if you just are patient and let it sit in some hot water so I refill but measuring cup with hot water and let it sit and give it a stir every once in a while and the candy will just dissolve right off your container so you're going to let those candy molds cool completely and then you're just going to pop them out of the mold and they should come out quite easily I did spray these a little bit of cooking spray first and they popped right out and they are just gorgeous I was very impressed with this first attempt using these candy molds so there are some flowers the candy stick is cold white adhered to the can you don't have to worry about it falling off and here are some of the ones with the little sprinkles on them and the lollipops are nice and clear so you can see them from this angle which kind of looks like they're floating in the ambi or you can look at it from this side as well pretty cool these are the ones I did free form and they should come right off the silicon mat you'll have a little bit of an imprint from the silicon mat on the back of the lollipops and here are this cornstarch lollipops just take them out tap off the excess and then you can wipe them down with a clean dry towel to get rid of more of the cornstarch and the core starts in the container you can reuse that for baking put it back in the container or you can use it for more lollipop making as well it's completely reusable now here are some of the completed lollipops it made about two dozen of them and they tasted great they tasted just like orange now these this is one of the cornstarch ones and you can see the back of it is not smooth and it actually looks a little like the surface of the Moon it actually holds details quite well which is kind of interesting here's another cool recipe it is for candy apple chips this video will be going live on November 4th 2013 so if you're watching this video after that date please go ahead and click right on your screen or see the link in the description box and if you're watching it before stay tuned for this great recipe thanks for watching", "AaGHDrI4EEM": "do you remember the old-fashioned candy with all the bright colors and cool images well I do and I thought they were beautiful to look at very Christmasy put you in this season but you know what they never really tasted that good these are handmade candies and it takes a lot of work to get those images in place seems like all they need to do is upgrade their flavoring and add some citric acid then they'd be delicious well unless you're making cinnamon or peppermint I don't know maybe I've only had the cheap kind because I'm looking in this magazine and these look fancy so I decided since it's my birthday month I'm going to order just random things that I wanted to try and I've watched this YouTube channel called lofty pursuits for a couple of years and it's always interesting to watch how he makes this image candy so I thought you know what I'm gonna order me a couple of these packages to see how they taste it took about three weeks for the package to get here and just when I thought they might have lost my order it showed up in my mailbox and of course I had to start digging right in because I was really curious about this package it's called Thanksgiving leftovers and it's supposed to taste like Thanksgiving food and that is very strange so I had to try it each 2.75 ounce bag costs $5.99 and they come with one of these fresh packets to keep the candy from getting sticky this package is the variety pack and I thought it was a good idea to get this one because then I can try all the different flavors and look at all the cool designs they come in different shapes and sizes somewhere kind of skinny and some are a little bit wider they start out hard in your mouth and then they dissipate where you can crunch them without hurting your teeth that's because of the air that is incorporated into a portion of the candy when he pulls it on the candy hook this one looks like a mug of root beer and I believe this one is a tutti frutti he adds citric acid to a lot of his fruit flavors and it really amps up the flavor and he won't know this one is called police Fox and it was inspired by Doctor Who and it looks like a little TARDIS inside this is a yummy raspberry flavor ignore my fingernails I teach elementary school and I just do my best these are black currant drops and I haven't tried black currant before I don't think but anyway these turned out to be my favorite it was the Thanksgiving leftovers that actually made me bite the bullet in order from lofty pursuits this time couldn't imagine how you could make Thanksgiving food tastes good in a candy so we're gonna try these he made a bunch of image candy and it was so successful that it sold out so quickly that he made it into drop form and he calls them leftovers to be sold after Thanksgiving this one was either cranberry or apple pie and it has sort of a cinnamon eat flavor there's also a merlot in there some I think this one was the buttered corn and it tasted okay it had a buttery flavor with a touch of corn this one I'm pretty sure was peach cobbler can't really go wrong with peach cobbler this one is honey baked ham and yes it tastes like you're sucking on a piece of ham and it sort of lingers in your mouth for a while too I didn't like it at first but it kind of grew on me this one has to be the pecan pie and it was really sweet and caramel II it was okay I guess but this one had to been the stuffing and I could not even finish this one I think it had garlic in it and celery powder I don't know if I got all the flavors that were available but I think this one was a sweet potato casserole and my husband recognized it right away and he liked it so that was kind of a fun little adventure for the taste buds I put them in a candy jar with a couple fresh packets and they didn't really last that long because we ate them pretty quickly so a big thumbs up for lofty pursuits these are fun beautiful colors and some wonderful flavors so I highly recommend thanks for watching", "3sOccQyYQxo": "[MUSIC PLAYING] SPEAKER 1: If you take a pot\nof sugar and water and heat it, the sugar will pass through several\nstages as the water boils off. Here I'm going to illustrate\neach stage and its properties, because these stages are\nuseful for making candy. The first stage is\ncalled the thread stage. The thread stage begins\nat the temperature 102 and goes all the way up to 113. When you take a spoonful of the heated\nsugar mixture at this temperature and drop into cold\nwater, it forms threads. Sugar heated to this temperature\nis good for making syrup. The second stage is the softball stage. Between 116 and 118, the\nsugar forms a soft ball when dropped into cold water that\nflattens readily in your hand. Fudge is made with sugar that's\nheated to this temperature. Firmball is the third stage. At 118 to 121 degrees Celsius, the\nsugar mixture makes a malleable ball when dropped into cold water. It will flatten if you squeeze it. Caramels are made with\nsugar at this stage. At the fourth stage, the\nhardball stage, the sugar will create a hard ball when\ndropped into cold water. This happens at 121 to\n130 degrees Celsius. It won't flatten, but you can still\nalter its state by squishing it. Gummies are a good example of\ncandies made at this stage. In the next two stages, as\nthe moisture content drops, the sugar will change its properties. At 132 to 143 degrees Celsius, the fifth\nstage, called softcrack, takes place. The sugar develops flexible strands\nwhen dropped into cold water. These strands will bend\nslightly before the break. Taffy is made from sugar\nheated to this temperature. At 149 to 154 degrees Celsius,\nwe reach the hardcrack stage. This stage contains the highest\nconcentration of sugar at 99%. Dropping this mixture into cold water\nwill create hard brittle strands that break when bent. This stage produces hard\ncandies, such as the lollipop. So there you have it. These are the six stages of sugar\nthat we use for candy making. It's not getting any better than that.", "CEzAOPIgfZk": "you are now watching a Lucky Penny shop product feature hey its Lucky Penny shop and we are doing a fruit slice lollipop now recently not too long ago maybe two or three weeks ago I did a green lime fruit sliced or green apple fruit sliced lollipop in a cotton candy video and I smashed it up yes this beautiful lollipop got smashed and we had someone in the comments uh wonder if we could actually make a video of those so we had the orange and the watermelon still and here you go here is the video now what I want to say is that we don't mention people's name in the comments for a reason because it just opens up a door of hundreds of people wanting their name mentioned but I will thank people in the comments so let's move on now so we'd have the watermelon slice and the orange slice and this was the green apple kind of look like that with a seed and the texture just looks so realistic on these the whole lollipop in general looks realistic now I'd say the watermelon looks the least realistic because it's so clear but they do add the seeds to make it look like you're eating a piece of watermelon Greenbrier international well let's open them up I don't put a bulb up and I'm gonna taste the watermelon I see breath Musti and I remember correctly and it was double wrap so this and each lollipop was wrapped and I will find out all right that into the case now look it's wrapped again once we get all the plastic off and we'll see how cool this looks in the light there you know reflecting and it seems pretty tough so I'm not trying to handle it carefully because it's pretty thick this is something to put it out so now I'm in see how thick it is so that is the watermelon let me get out and the thicker when your finger is where my fingers behind iku that's cool look like it was a color change in the actual lollipop look at the outside of the orange does that let me that's a different kind of material candy whatever you want to call it so that's hard also and look how thick it is there all right so what do you want me to try first let's see let me try the watermelon now am I in my initial instinct is to bite it but I don't want to bite it so this is hard to let me just give it a taste hmm it's good now I didn't get a strong watermelon flavor let me take a look at the orange now that one definitely has a really good strong orange flavor like I said I just want to bite that look how cool they look let me get these out of here so you can just see these and through them and the thickness look how thick the oranges it's even thicker than the watermelon oh I think I like the flavor of the orange the best now the green apple that we did in the cotton candy that was super tasty also overall I would say if you're a lollipop fan you would dig these now we got these at the Dollar Tree and I've seen them at different dollar trees by the cash register in the candy aisle and I think it's worthy if you get a chance to get out there to your dollar store to pick one of these up flavor is good and it's kind of unique isn't it the shape and the size so there you go it is the fruit slice lollipops if you want to see more candy like this look in the description for a playlist and as always search our channel and if you want recommend to these you know say it in the comments and I will thank you down there

"LMD5aAC9wAk": "hi welcome to diamond delight edibles my name is liz if this is the first time you're joining you're a regular subscriber welcome back thank you so much i really do appreciate your support i really do mean that i love you guys so today i'm going to show you how to do the sour version of a gummy uh gummy candy so this has got includes the gelatin and a cooked syrup candy syrup you combine them and we then apply the sugar sweet and sour sugar right afterwards so we don't have to wait for it uh to dry uh or to figure out when we need to add it we add it right afterwards and um all right so i'll just get right started we'll get into the ingredients the equipment that you're gonna need and then how to put everything together all right well thank you so much for joining and i hope you enjoy the video okay so this recipe is done in two stages well technically three because we cook in two different stages and then we combine everything so for the first gelatin for the jello half you're going to need three tablespoons or three envelopes of unflavored gelatin one box of your favorite jello flavor a quarter cup of light corn syrup a half a teaspoon of citric acid a half teaspoon of gour gum and a quarter of a cup to a third of a cup of your can of butter and for the liquid you're going to need um a quarter cup that we're going to heat up to boiling and then a half cup that we're going to be using to bloom our gelatin and you can use any liquids that you like i like to use these um kool-aid or the kool-aid jammers these ones are good because they're a water-based and they're clear so you don't have to contend with color and they're also half the sugar so again you're not going to it helps cut back on the sugar since we got a whole ton of it in it that totally up to you though you want to definitely stick to a clear type liquid those powerades if you like those type of things those vitamin waters if you like them i don't like them they do not add the greatest of taste but if you do add juices like with it have real fruit juice in it then you're going to want to use a mold inhibitor because mold will develop very quickly and if you want to add additional colors or flavors uh we can do that i'm going to be adding 2d fruity and so i'm going to kind of make it pink and purpley i don't know tutti frutti colors and if you want to have a nice solid uh background you're going to need white food coloring so that's for the gelatin part the jello side gelatin side for the cooked candy syrup you're going to need one cup of sugar a half a cup of light corn syrup and a half a cup of water so for the equipment that you're going to need you're going to need a double boiler so you can use any pot and metal bowl i like to try and use a thicker thicker metal so that it doesn't get too hot you're going to want something to disperse your candy i love using these bottles they work great and they've got the piping tip which makes it really nice or you can use an eyedropper now this recipe is a little bit thicker so i'm not sure how well an eyedropper is going to work with it you're also going to need an oops timber you're also going to need a smaller pot for your sugar syrup and a candy thermometer two spatulas you're also going to need a hand blender and if you're going to be splitting your syrup either by doing different colors or flavors you're going to need a measuring cup to split that out if you're just doing all one you don't need that or in in lieu of a hand blender you can use whisk in a very strong forearm so the first thing that we want to do is we are going to bloom our gelatin and we are going to heat up that other quarter cup um you may need a little bit more liquid if you do you can just add it in later on if needed so we're going to heat this up in the microwave for about a minute and 20 seconds and we're going to sprinkle three tablespoons of gelatin unflavored gelatin onto our half a cup of liquid you want to kind of evenly spread it and then you're going to mix it in so that it is thoroughly mixed and that there are no lumps so you want it to kind of look like light up you want to look like applesauce and then you're going to just set that aside for five minutes and we're gonna add our boiling liquid to our jello mix and you're gonna stir that oh and you're gonna start you're gonna put your heat on to the lowest setting we just want our water to get hot we don't want it boiling gelatin melts at just hot water so we just want a hot water bath and we're going to stir that in and we're going to add in our corn syrup that's our quarter cup of corn syrup and we're just going to stir oh sorry and we're going to add in our half teaspoon of citric acid and we're going to stir that i said until it's dissolved it takes about five five six minutes or so for all of that to melt and in order to get this stuck gelatin off the side you can use some very hot water and a brush and it'll just you can wash that off otherwise if you don't it won't it doesn't melt and then it you'll get bits and stuff in your jello then you also want to make sure when you're stirring is to rub your spatula across the bottom because the sugar and the gelatin can stick to it and you don't want that so you want to make sure you'll feel it you can feel it smooth on the bottom if there's stuff stuck you'll feel it kind of rough you just kind of want to work it off scrape it off then once your gelatin or sorry your jello is fully melted we're gonna add in the gelatin and what i do is i just kind of cut it up into smaller pieces just like this and just in she goes and you're just gonna gently stir that until it's melted and if your water is hot now if the um your pots nice and hot you can turn off the heat you don't gelatin required doesn't require much heat at all to melt and if it gets too hot the gelatin will break which means it's not going to have that it's not going to your candies aren't going to set that well and the sign that you'll know that it's too hot is if you start to see white foaming stuff white foamy stuff happening on the top of your mixture here on your syrup now that everything is melted we are going to add in the can of butter and our gour gum and the reason that we have to use gour gum is it is an emulsifier and it is going to allow your oil and your your water to come together as one as one liquid versus being oil and water you know don't mix together an emulsifier allows them to come together as one solid solidified unit in short it basically mushes the oil and the water together to live happily we're going to pour in the our can of butter and i've used a third of a cup so as you can see adding you're adding the can of butter or oil to our gelatin you can mix and mix and mix until the cows come home no matter what those two are never going to blend together now you might get the appearance if you kind of whisk really really quickly you have the appearance that it's combined right that kind of looks like that's all combined however if you go and you set that and if you want to set that up now all of the butter would raise to the top of the mold now if you've got one of these little strainers or a strainer it's great for doing the guru so we're going to use a half a teaspoon of gargum and you're going to gently sprinkle evenly sprinkle it over the top if you don't have a strainer you just want to make sure to try and get it evenly over the top there this will adhere to the oil and allow it to mix in with our with the jello and i'm going to let that sit for a minute and now we're going to get our trusty hand blender [Music] and you'll continue to mix that until it is completely all one color all one unified color you don't see any kind of streaking or any kind of any difference whatsoever that's when you know it it is fully blended and emulsified and you're gonna be how about that texture and once that's done we're just going to let that set to set aside and leave it on the hot water but turn off the heat and then we're going to do our candy syrup all right so for our candy syrup we're going so for the candy syrup you want one cup of sugar a half a cup of corn syrup and a half a cup of water you're gonna mix that together until it is blend till it's all mixed up and your sugar starting to dissolve and we're going to turn the heat on to medium-high and you're going to stir the syrup until it begins to boil so as soon as it starts to boil then you are going to stop stirring that's when we add the candy thermometer and we don't stir it again and then you're also going to want to grab a jar of hot water about whatever something of hot water and a brush so you can wash down the sugar crystals off of the side and that'll prevent your syrup from crystallizing once it begins to boil there we're going to add our candy thermometer i'm going to try to add the candy thermometer now if you ever wonder why i kind of have this weird looking thing the one that i have said it setting on it that thermometer doesn't always work for me it occasionally will fail um this i like the digital but the digital um doesn't have any way of holding on to it it's more meant for just kind of sticking it into checking a temperature and then i have to use the tin foil to protect the digital from the heat so that's why i kind of have this weird makeshift candy thermometer and we're going to cook this syrup to 208 280 degrees soft crack now you can go a little bit if you want your candies a little less chewy you can go a few degrees less you can go to about 275. if you want them a lot chewier then you can go to 300. i seem to find the 280 is perfect for it well for what my liking anyway so we're going to continue to cook that syrup until 280 degrees just remember to wash down any crystal any sugar crystals that may form on the sides just to let you know you're doing this at the medium high it will go fairly quickly so don't leave the kitchen normally you do the sugars at a lower temperature so you have a little bit of time this doing it at the higher temperature it will go very quickly so i'm traveling you don't leave your kitchen and then you also want to get a pot of just cold water or a bowl of cold cold water stand by uh we're gonna put the bottom of the pot in that to stop the syrup the cooking process so we're at 276 270 see how quickly it starts to go 278 279 280 leave the candy thermometer on because we want to bring this temperature down to 240. you can turn your heat off leave it in the water until the temperature starts coming down and then we're just going to set it on the side here until that temperature comes down to 240. so once your temperature comes down you can remove the candy thermometer and we're going to add in ow be careful the syrup is still very very hot you're going to get your gelatin mixture and you're going to have a look and you're going to make sure that you don't see any green or anybody butter separation now you might see a little bit of cut like see how that color there difference that suggests your jello that the air is coming out of so don't worry about that what you care is if you see any kind of green or oily looking so that's good we're going to pour this into this candy syrup and be very careful when you're stirring this now your gelatin is going to be a lot more liquidier than the liquid liquid ear i know i come up with my own words uh then the candy syrup is going to be thicker it's also going to start to solidify as you can see on the spoon that's why you're going to gently stir it and we're going to turn the heat on to bury it to the lowest temperature and you want to make sure to take your spatula and go all the way around the edges the syrup will has a tendency to stick along those edges see so i like to use the hand blender whoops to make sure that everything is fully uh mixed together and blended and emulsified [Music] and then you're just going to gently stir to make sure that it's all nicely mixed so now at this point is when we're going to add in our flavor and additional colors if you like or as i said if you want if you're not doing that you can just go ahead and put this into your bottles right now and get ready to distribute into the molds so i'm going to be adding one of my newest favorite flavors tutti frutti love this flavor i usually use about a cup and a half and again you just want to gently get that all mixed in now if you are going to be splitting uh if you want to do two different colors this is this point you're going to put it to the transferred over to your measuring cup and split it in half or if you wanted to do two different flavors then do that before split it in half add your different flavors but i'm just doing one flavor base two colors okay so i have got now whenever you look at a um a measuring cup always look at it straight on get down at the level and look at it straight on if you look at it from a down level you see you don't get an accurate reading that looks like two and a quarter cups however it's more like two and a third cups so for this one i'm going to do i'm gonna add some more red and i like to use the no taste red i hate the taste of red dye i can always taste it and everything so i like the no taste red the one thing about it however is it doesn't have quite the intensity of red that the regular does but i'd rather forsake a little bit of the intensity on the color versus the intensity on the flavor there we go that's a nice red and the other side i'm going to do purple i'm going to add in some pink i want a more pinky purple versus a dark purple and a couple drops of blue now mix that up see what we get now right now because we did i didn't add the white into it and it looks like it's a solid color it's actually it'll come out kind of still a little bit translucent so if you want to get a solid background and that it's not going to lighten up or get that kind of clear or translucent look you want that solid opaque then you need to add in the white so i'm going to add a couple drops into white on both sides so we have here when we add in the white it's going to dull down our color a little bit so that i'm just going to add in a little bit more of the red and add a little bit more to the purple purple i think i'm gonna leave i like that color but the red i wanna looks kind of orangey and see how much nicer that color is now it's a lot richer and gives you more that solid background makes it opaque versus having that translucent look to it and now i'm just going to get ready to pour it in the bottles and distribute it into the molds all right so now we're ready to distribute into the molds and you can go do half and halves now don't fill up your mold all the way to the top if you do it ends up leaving a sharp edge on your candy that dries out and it doesn't make your candies very pleasant so don't fill them all the way up to the top and it's also when you're trying to pour try and keep it to the middle and just let it distribute it out once you have your mold set up while all filled up you put it into the fridge for uh two hours sometimes it may take a little bit longer basically two hours or until they're set all right so it's been a couple of hours and our candies are ready to come out of the molds and we're gonna make up our sugar sour mix so you're going to add one cup of sugar and to that you're going to add a half a teaspoon of citric acid cut it and you want to make sure to thoroughly mix that in so you're going to get even citric acid on everything not just get like a big hunk of it on one candy that's kind of gross so you want to make sure to thoroughly mix it in now the nice thing with this recipe is as soon as we take them out of the molds we're going to put them right into the sugar this sugar mix you don't have to worry about waiting for them to dry or partially dry before we can add it and the reason for that is citric acid is water soluble so when you do the other gummy recipe when you just take them out they're still wet and gummy bears are essentially water and gelatin so as soon as there's any moisture on them the citric acid will begin will automatically begin to melt it doesn't do it on this because you have the sugar coating or the sugar candy syrup in there that helps protect the gelatin and that's why they don't melt as soon as you put it on and that's why this recipe is way better for doing sour or sugar coated candies now these guys are going to be a lot stickier than your regular gummy recipe so you just kind of pull it and they'll start to peel out and then you just work them out and then just pop them right into your sugar sour mix and as they warm up a bit uh they will start to get a little more tacky so no worries as long as you can pull them out of the molds they're good and they do stick to your fingers they do just kind of put it down into the sugar you can just kind of rub it in and it'll get them off that's nice once the your sugar or your sugar sour mix is on they no longer stick together see look at that and then you just put them on the rack to dry as per usual now what i like to do is i like to put holes in my parchment paper so that way you're getting air from both sides it helps with drying the other nice thing with this recipe is it doesn't take anywhere near as long for these to dry as the regular gummy recipes they're pretty much dry in a few hours to overnight now if they do start to get a little too warm and too hard to get out of the mold just put them back in the fridge for a little while if you actually keep a little bit of sugar on your fingers once they get a little bit sticky it'll help with them not sticking to your fingers a little aid with them coming off see if they stick they will fuse just pull them apart now if you're taking these out and they're just not coming out they're way too sticky um they're too gooey you can put them back in the fridge for a couple of hours or um and if you take them out and they're still not going to come out what you can do is uh put them in the freezer for about an hour take them out put them back in the double boiler on low re-melt them and add a half a tablespoon to one tablespoon of bloomed unflavored gelatin and that should add enough a little more gelatin there that'll fix that right up and if you find that they are too gummy oh sorry not if they're too gummy if they're too chewy they're like rubber bands again same thing just put them back on the double boiler on low remelt them and add a couple of tablespoons of um liquid to it and mix it all in until it's all melted recast them and that should take care of that problem if you've taken them out and there's um your butter is all risen to the back same thing just put them into the double boiler re-melt them add a little bit more gargum and re-emulsify make sure to use the hand blender or your whisk really really well like i showed you earlier so again if they're stuck like that uh check first to see just gently work around if they come away then you're good you can pull it out of the mold but if they're doing that they're not coming it's not coming away at all then they need to either go into the longer go into the fridge longer or to add some more gelatin to them they are a little bit more work but they are definitely worth it in texture and flavor in everything i've pretty much abandoned the other gummy bear recipe personally i just use this recipe now i'll just do either sugar coated or the sweet or the sugar and sour mix option is if um they are being really sticky um they are kind of coming out they're set but they're just really sticky um that can happen because it gets it picks up a little bit too much moisture in the refrigerator you can just let them sit in the molds for a couple of hours on the counter before taking them out that'll assist in drying that out a little bit now if you can stand your candies up it's a good idea some of them won't stand up though too small to whatever decides so if you can stand them up great if not you just want to flip them over every couple of hours until they're dry and as i said before this recipe and the drying time is it's a lot less time and that's it for them so just leave them out and enjoy some awesome sweet and sour gummy candies so that's my tutorial on sweet and sour gummy candies these are the little bad boys they haven't dried yet but you can see they're really nice they're little that little squishy now because they're still wet tastes awesome so i hope you give this recipe a try whether you want to do just sugar coated or the sugar sour it's a great recipe i'm sure that you'll love it if you have any questions at all don't hesitate to put them in the comments i'll always get back to you and i think that's everything i've got for you today well thank you so much for joining time diamond delight edibles wish i could get that straight um thank you for joining diamond delight edibles it's been a pleasure have a wonderful day [Music] you", "0g1Gn7OQk20": "[Music] okay guys we are doing the flourish gummies in the cub watermelon 100 milligrams of THC already how one of these had to he's kind of funny they're not delicious in my hair supposed to be in a bun but it's not delicious and good like the Caminos I kind of real strong marijuana taste to it really strong they don't taste like delicious but we're gonna seem to get a sign sir we're going to see if it gets as high so I'll be back about an hour to let me show you guys real quick the ingredients my father seen hold on guys you kidding me let me do this right you guys good morning this morning here like that and just won't come back too long ago we talked about those flourish gummies okay first of all I'm gonna be completely honest with you guys I took them and as they went on I literally forgot that I even consumed the gummies that's out but I forgot that I consumed the gummies and during the whole day I didn't really obviously I didn't feel anything really because I forgot that I even took um basically I didn't feel really much of anything maybe it's because of what I ate maybe because my maybe I should have a after maybe I know I ate after a wild learned later on that day but my shirt but time on how long I waited to eat but I think probably I ate too soon and I didn't make the hi I'm gonna make me hi didn't I bring the high up all the way but um I don't know I like some down on me because maybe I ate or I don't know my tolerance is too high I'm not trying to say that these gummies will not work for anyone else they just didn't work for me my tolerance is really high from marijuana you know so I mean like the next person they probably will work for you but with these do not work for me didn't taste that great they weren't delicious you're trying to get us give us someone that doesn't want but just basically if he gives us someone they know they're consuming marijuana because it tastes like it like there's no there's no hiding the fact that it's not and that's I hope this video could help so it out peace out toodles and happy trust all my happy trailers and just another thing to just because it didn't work for me does not mean I have to say this again it doesn't this because I didn't work for me does not mean that it will not work for you okay think about your tolerance I haven't stigma to this I hate staring into the actual like lens because my eyes getting it cricket but this is because I didn't work for me does not mean no will not work for you I hope this would help someone out peace out toodles and Happy Trails don't have patrols out there", "vLm9VAXFl6I": "and so I'd still take my life in it a fruit roll-up what's up guys welcome back today I have yet another gummy video for you guys and I'm very excited about this one because I think it's going to make a lot of people's lives a lot easier and it is going to be delicious today we're going to be doing a little experiment making gummies out of two ingredients store-bought gummy bears tincture or coconut oil so I just bought some gummies from bulk barn any gummies are fine and what I'm gonna do is I'm going to melt these down and I'm gonna add to some of them tincture and to some of them coconut oil and we're gonna see how they're going to turn out I think the ones with tincture will turn out amazing the coconut oil ones I'm not so sure about so let's try it out and see how it goes PS these are like the best gummies ever they're the Albanese brand you can buy them at a lot of places and they're so good they have like the best flavors the green ones and the white ones are my favorite so I'm actually not going to use them for this recipe so I'm probably gonna eat them while I'm melting them first step is to sort your gummies you don't have to smoke them if you don't want to but I want all my colors to be separate all right let's do this so I separated my gummies into yellow and orange purple and then my favorite ones just to eat while I'm doing this and we're gonna melt them and then add in our ginger and coconut oil and see how it goes I have no idea how long it's going to take us to microwave them so I'm going to start with like 15 second intervals and just check on them and then we'll find out how long it takes to melt them without over putting them I don't know so start with these great ones here there's a total of 13 gummy bears in here and they're just regular sized right there I mean they're a little bit bigger than like kuriboh gummy bears um but they're pretty standard so I was going bears and you guys can even see that okay so I'm gonna check on them in about 15 seconds and see how warmed up and melted they are so that's 20 seconds and they're starting to melt but they still need a little bit more so I put it in there for another 10 seconds okay so this is a total of 30 seconds pretty much melted and good to go I'm gonna add my tincture into here for this amount of gummies I'm going to do 1/2 a teaspoon of tincture so it's just room temperature you don't want to have it like really cold or frozen because it will affect the heat from the gummy so we'll just put that half a teaspoon in so there it is and let's see how well this stirrer is in if it doesn't stir it hopefully you guys can see that can you oh you guys can't even see that there we go so hopefully that stirs in well and if it doesn't we are going to add some lesson and lecithin into this to help combine it but I think that there's enough things and the gummy bears to start with that we shouldn't have any issues getting this to emulsify or combine or whatever you want to call it so that looks pretty good and then we're just gonna put these into a mold the same way you would with homemade gummies and let them sit and we will move on to our next batch so this is quite a bit thicker then they're coming mixtures so it seems like it's kind of hard for the little syringe to pull it up so that's one a little bit of an issue here so let's see yeah see we can't really soak it up so our options would be to microwave it more so it gets more liquidy or to add more liquid but I do not want to add more liquid so I am going to put it in the microwave for another 10 seconds okay so that was another ten seconds for a total of 30 are sorry a total of 40 seconds and I think they should be good enough to be able to put into our molds so I have about half in the mold then it's being a little bit trickier to put in that I thought it was going to be I'm having some trouble like getting the the dropper to like suction it up and that's because it is really thick so again I'm going to put it into the microwave for another 10 seconds and warm it up some more now if you had a lot more going there zero melting I'm like I did it this won't be as much of an issue because the heat will contain itself because there's a larger amount because there's such a small amount that's getting cooled off quicker and thickening faster and also like my dropper is like has a limited stuff to suck up so that won't be if you're doing a larger amount but it's not hurting anything by putting it in the microwave for just like 10-15 second intervals you just have to make sure you work kind of fast so let's throw that back in okay so looks a little different now I guess it just melted a lot more it's a lot more liquidy and put these interim moles okay so I put the purple ones into a molds now let's try some more but with the coconut oil let's do the yellow ones one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen so we'll do thirteen of them just like we did last time and then we're gonna microwave this I'm going to start it with 40 seconds okay here's our 40 seconds melted they're nice and liquidy still might be a bit of an issue with the syringe dropper thing but if you have like one of those bottles you can dispense them with that'll be like way easier but let's add in the coconut oil so I hope you know what nut oil is what I expect to be the most difficult but I think that there's already less lecithin in the gummy bears so the oil should be able to emulsify pretty good but we'll find out so let's have it half a teaspoon of coconut oil okay we got our half teaspoon let's mix that in so so far it's actually mixing in really well that's all something I do for gummy bears with tincture instead of coconut oil because they I think they taste better but I know that most people you should just have coconut oil on hand the texture is a little bit different with the coconut oil I'm going to put that back in the microwave for another like 15 seconds alright so I did another 10 seconds I thought 15 might be too much all right now let's put these in their molds it looks like it's a lot harder using these so I'm gonna use one of my squeeze bottles which will be a lot you hear well I guess I should say hopefully it will be a lot easier you can see that like the coconut oil's making it like that doesn't like stick to the sides of the bottle that much I'm actually very surprised how well the cup oil mixed in oh my god that's so hot oh god it burns okay so don't touch hot melted candy because it is really hot and it hurts okay and this is cooled off a bit now that I've changed the bottle so hopefully it comes out okay if not I'll put it until I got a hot bowl of water or something look at all that gelatin or gummies sitting on the top there and I gotta get him down I'm just gonna leave this to sit upwards to get this to come down guys it's just it's it's too sticky this didn't really work that well either I'm gonna take the metal cap off and I'm gonna put it in the microwave just like this hopefully that works okay I did it ten seconds in the microwave it still doesn't look like it's gonna come out like this No okay this is not working either see another way that we can get this into the mold I mean like it's still gonna taste delicious I'm probably gonna have to eat a lot of this like just peel out of the bowl and stuff okay my plan was to cut a hole and squish this through but I don't think that's gonna happen well let's let's try see oh it's working okay I mean it's a little hardened now Oh No okay this is not working very well okay so the melting of the gummy bears and adding coconut oil didn't work very well I don't know why it seems like it almost got like harder like I now I'm just wondering if I like I microwaved it too many times like I don't know it just it won't come out really it's too thick to come out of anything so I'm gonna make another batch with the tincture just to test that out um again and see it's like it's definitely going to work or if it's user error and I mean it still I'd still take my get it a fruit roll-up it still tastes good if you wanted to you just melt them and then I mean this is really good little easy to get through oh look but you could just melt it and put it onto like parchment paper or silicone and peel it off after and just cut it into strips it's like the same thing it just won't be in the molds the actual gummy product mixed really well - coconut oil it tastes amazing of course you just they just happen to make sure it's pretty making the mold so still work very good I'll be snacking on this later okay let's do some more with the orange gummies and let's put some more tincture and then this time 1112 where do we do 13 or 12 I remember 30 I think and you don't have to do 13 so it's just the number I'm doing I don't know just - just what it is I'm doing and yeah you can just use whatever amount you want obviously you're really good okay let's microwave this you've got 30 seconds we're gonna do double the tincture so one teaspoon instead of half a teaspoon see this looks like it might have been too much tincture too much liquid and they might not set but you could always add more gelatin but I have a feeling these will set they'll just be a lot softer but if you want them to be able to firmer you could just add a sprinkle of gelatin a little more liquidy consistency as will definitely be easier to put into our moulds hopefully this one works a bit better I think it will we just got to act fast I mean using a dropper I probably would've been fine I don't know why decided to use this because it's such a small amount coming out already there we go oh yeah that's perfect oh and also just FYI if you buy these bottles which are really great for gummy making when you're making larger amounts not like this much died by making the tape it comes with like this I don't know if you can see that it's really really small and the gummy mixture is usually too thick to come out so I just put a different tip that's a little bit wider on there to make sure it can get through this was really difficult to use with such a small amount that I had so use a dropper if you have one this is usually my go-to option to squeeze things into molds but because there is such little amount when I squeeze it it's not really doing anything whereas if there was like this much gummy make sure when I squeeze it the pressure would push it out but because I made such a small amount obviously it's gonna be a little bit trickier I will just eat this out of the bottle later I'm just going to put the gummies that I need into the fridge probably for like 20 minutes alright guys I'm back but it hasn't been 20 minutes it's been two days so I took the gummies Oh after 20 minutes and they were not nearly hard enough I couldn't even really get them out of their molds so I put them in the freezer for a little bit like about half an hour and once they were hard enough I popped them all out of their molds and just left them on some parchment paper but they still were a little bit too squishy and too like corn syrupy so I left them out for a day and they were still a little bit too squishy Tomo for another day which is where we are now so it's been two days and they are perfect so if you guys make these just leave them out on a piece of parchment paper for a couple days depending on how humid it is wherever you live it might be a little bit different like it's not very humid where I live at all um so they dry up pretty quick but if you live somewhere very humid they might take a lot longer to dry or they might even not work for you in the first place so I'll show you what they look like so both the purple and the orange ones turned out very well you can see they're sticky obviously because they are sticking to my fingers so they are a little bit stickier than like a regular gummy but they're they don't really stick together in the bag because I've let them dry out for a few days so the purple ones had half a teaspoon of tincture in them and the orange ones had double that amount so they had one teaspoon of tincture and I thought they were gonna have a lot of issues but they're totally fine yeah they turned out very well and they taste just like the gummies did before I remoulded them last thing just to clarify um my gummies with the coconut oil didn't turn out only the ones with the tincture worked for me I don't know why the coconut oil ones didn't work if you guys know why please let me know because I'm very curious so yeah guys these turned out fantastic I'm super impressed with the results I definitely am gonna use this method many times in the future um going forward what I would do is for every 10 dummies I would do half a teaspoon of tincture so you can just multiply that by however many you want to make in total but based on what I've seen with these with half a teaspoon and the regular teaspoon they both turned out so you couldn't probably get away with using a little bit more but if you're looking for a starting point I would go with ten nine bears and half a teaspoon all right please let me know if you guys try this out I hope you enjoyed the video and let me know if there's any videos you would like to see I hope you guys enjoyed this video please comment like and subscribe thank you guys for watching have a wonderful day", "PN4Aju8QUvM": "hello I'm Greg from lofty pursuits and I made hard candy and we're gonna test it out so let's start with some orange slices because we're talking about orange I think I mentioned I used to ship yo-yos these bags of candy are exactly the same size of the standard yo-yo package because I'd already got my shipping department optimized for you know you think you're supposed to be easy to open I guess so but I'm kinda having trouble getting just kind of it's all in the fingernails yeah yeah you know I trimmed them before I came here so I look good on video and just try to get a slice cuz you're gonna end up with a lot of candy so these are our em slices and an old iron slice roller that I dug up oh sorry you can take the whole bag yeah and I love the way it puts lines it was one of those rollers that were Kippy users anything you could use it for orange slices watermelon slices it was sort of generic they try to do as much with as little as they add and you can see the good citrus flavor you're tasting and this is actually gonna be lighter because I didn't put much acid in it because I wanted to keep it clear and we did this for a video which was about things that rhyme with orange because Tom Lehrer came up with an orange roller rhyme and I've been told endlessly by everybody on our YouTube channel that so did M&M which I find ironic because there was an M&M commercial saying nothing rhymes with orange you work that out okay so you started with citrus what do you think so this is a secret flavor that we got passed down from Elaine's candy store when we got the recipes or we've got the equipment that gave us the recipe for their nectar so if you hold it out you probably have to get groups there's one of those packs we talked about okay I need two or three of them here you go we see shell motif which isn't a roller from the malanez candy company want to get the the tradition the neat little shapes and it's one roller that makes all the shapes and what I love about some of these old rollers is how traditional they are because now you go to something like that video game candy crush saga and I literally have every shape from the video game in a roller from the 1800s which shows they did their research I've seen the candy crush saga but I don't know what it is really it's a little it's a little cell phone game it's addictive and silly and it's like anything else it's a derivative from a game that was called bejeweled which was one of the early games for our Palm Pilot and I'm delving into the history of video games instead of candy mm-hmm folks don't do this at home so what do you think about the nectar it's an interesting flavor the more you sucked on it it's kind of changes it's very good it's hard to place as a flavor yeah those are tasty okay then we're gonna go just to go around the block we're gonna go to these American flag candies that I made these are the ones that Craig was talking about and but because of the colors I would expect to be popular you know I thought it was more a decision of what is the flavor of an American flag and I felt they had a choice between canvas which I thought limited Marcus this is that a pretty pot that's these it's I did strawberry blueberry shortcake because that's you know yes exactly so I thought that was interesting yeah yeah I taste this is gonna go slower than yes something like the like wines oh yeah another one ray look blueberry strawberry shortcake if I did it right which I thought was good yeah oh yeah so you get a lot of flavor control you play around sorry there's a napkin over there I won't be insulted we're gonna be doing scandi spit take focus by the way I'd like to apologize here I left my hat in the car I don't know if you recognize me I'm Greg from lofty pursuits without the Hat you know who knows who I am you know what I'm going to give you a gift while we're getting stuff out I brought this stuff I know it's a little silly we serve breakfast also so I thought I'd get you a little lofty pursuits mug another thing we have to get these mugs yeah I'll talk to me about that later I'll give you my mud contact I feel like I'm the rolodex okay so let's try and did you try the flag candy mmm-hmm what's the word it should give you a good fruity taste did you bring me back taste yeah yeah so you should get that whipped cream feeling and maybe the cake feeling with a little almond in there yeah yeah and you should be able to get if I did if I balance it right should be able to get a clear strawberry and a clear blueberry depending on what you're doing okay you know it's like you think it was a joke with the with the everlasting gobstoppers and the original Willy Wonka no you can do this stuff with flavors you know this is why hard candies are hard because it's the flavor that counts and over soft candy is a lot of people say I don't like hard candies well when you're making a roll that has to retail for $0.50 and then wholesale at 25 cents and then be go to a distributor at 20 cents there's not much room for ingredients but if you can use the best ingredients in the world you can make absolutely amazing candy so tell me when you're ready for the next one rowdy you're ready okay so this is our peach candy and if I did it right you should get a little fuzz I don't mean that as a joke you got a whole bunch of them look at the artwork on it because that's an image candy and you can see the little peach chief Jen give me a spare one I'll pass along I don't need my readers very detailed and that's uh you hold it up to the light it'll even glow a little bit if you'd if I did it right oh I didn't get that one Jessica did she's getting really good peaches one of the harder ones but you can see how we are getting the flavors to contrast and a lot of that is with the balancing of the various ingredients great did you see I'm saying they'll loosen the peach fuzz gives you a soft back to the flavor is somebody's art you're right about that but it's out of a lot right people go I didn't want to buy it because I don't want to eat it God what am i madness score make one of the things I like about this art is a large early on that artists transitory in 1976 so I would have been eight years old my mother took me we lived in New York City my mother took me to the first big retrospective eff Alexandra called it who was a modern artist he did Mobile's he did stables but he made a lot of toys he made a circus that he played with and some of the objects were meant to be interacted with they were figures a Josephine Baker that were steel that were hung for the ceiling on Springs supposed to grab the hands and dance with them and they dated back to his his time in France and I think the 50s and there was a bunch of ceramic balls of different sizes that had a sponge ball hanging from the ceiling and would bounce around and chime and while I was there waiting to go play with the sponge ball thing that I never got to play with the word came down that Alexander had called her had died in the museum right while I was standing there now you know this was 76 so I was eight and that was a major it was like first thing I realized that an artist can be a toy maker and the second thing I realized is this is gonna be no more of this and I wanted a very long young age about the transitory nature of our art and I think that's one of the reasons I like the candy so much because the art is destroyed as you do it but you have to enjoy it in the moment you can't save it forever but you can also pass it on yeah you can but it has a finite time time you're teaching ethica oh yeah no no I'm teaching the skills the art itself isn't passed on it'll be her art and she's not the only one who'd gone through about 10 or 12 people he's done this over the years you know now the next one we're gonna do is apple the Apple should be a little bit harder I haven't tried this batch so I don't know if it was done right but it usually is it's got some good artists one a little flat it was made a little too hot they won't do it but you should get a real crisp flavor out of this one with your contrast with that peach which is a softer flavor and this is the interaction game that I'm playing with with the different things if you look at the artwork they're actually pretty similar mmm but they're not exactly similar you know one is a little dimple in it but one of the nice things about most fruits is they're round with bumps I like that this part Kenya gets it's not super hard that you want to bite into it like it's hot well that's because we pulled it so much we're actually pulling it a huge amount more than most people do and that does two things one it increases the flavor more surface area because while the bubbles makes the flavor dissolve faster so you get a more immediate shot of flavor and since we're cutting it it's not a drop it has all that exposed area in the middle actually if you suck on it the white will dissolve much faster than the other stuff so with things like the citrus it could really feel like a real piece of citrus with pith in it as the bits of the middle don't do it and or don't dissolve as fast and and because of that it'll connect the dots when you Biden it but I don't recommend anyone bites and hard candy please don't sue me if you chip your I am now officially telling you don't do it but you know it also means they're eating the candy too fast and I mean don't have as much time to enjoy so uh let's see what are we gonna do next I think I want to contrast this with banana I don't think I can get you to do any of them all by the way I bought you about a bag of madness this is our candy demonstration of the Stroop effect in other words they're all the same color but I can't tell you what flavors they are oh so because you taste with your eyes before you taste with your mouth and the mole object is to confuse you I try to keep the current list on the website but it changes faster they change them they go we change this what does this taste like and I go oh God yeah you try to do durian let's not put that in and we don't I'm still the boss okay you've had durian durian is delicious it's not what it tastes like it's what it smells like it smells like feet okay it tastes like it tastes like jackfruit which also smells like I've only had jackfruit as um barbecued uh you probably can't up here I have a friend who grows it in South Florida and brings it up once a year so I guess we do it up here Oh God yeah yeah it's like forty pound this much you can even a little top of it you get like a half pound of jackfruit a huge but most of its not edible yeah is it can you just cook it with barbecue sauce like in the slow cooker and pull up so it's like pulled pork that's interesting my a my friend my friend's father it makes jackfruit jerky every year but I've never enjoyed it he the jackfruit a few other things with us they also have he bought this farm that used to be an exotic fruit farm to put his bonsai plantation on it he grows trees this big and he doesn't need much room for that so you left the other trees going and he's a cat he has like a half acre Karen bolas you know I'm talking about star fruit and I've had star fruit but I've never had star fruit that ripened on the vine you know my friend John would go down there get two giant paper bags full drive it up when we eat it the next day oh my god it's the best thing I've ever tasted but the stuff you get in the supermarket is yeah I used to buy it occasionally just because I mean what are the other ones there's uh there's a wonderful they're wonderful varieties of bananas I can get in Florida that I've never seen anywhere else ice cream bananas but trying to get some seedlings because those will grow in my climate ah you can't peel it because it'll just mush you cut in half and eat it with a spoon is the consistency of ice cream Apple bananas which are just wonderful and my favorite is called the gold finger which is a red banana that is about this long the wonderful banana but unlike our commercial bananas it's only ripe a week a year so we're gonna give you some banana candy and this should come out softer and banana it's not as high in potassium I'm sorry that's good tell you you must like bananas a bunch to eat that many folks consumption that's bananas have ribs Oh God that scares me and feelings I thought I'd end this thing we have another one a drop I can go for that but I thought we'd do a citrus which is what we're doing tomorrow and I thought I'd do a different citrus we do this in wine tastings to folks we spit out well I'm trying to balance all these things out to give you a variety I got these specifically for it would you like to try a grapefruit lemon or lime you tried another orange before and I don't want you to do that until tomorrow wanna save the rest of this bags grapefruit absolutely I mean it certainly looks like gravy fruit a line okay hey I'll give you another country he their smell looks like you just kind of grapefruit and this is the pattern we're gonna do for our a so I'm gonna teach you to okay that's great yeah I love grapefruit but then again I got a grapefruit tree in my backyard just because it's Florida and I can get away with grapefruits next to me yeah but it was grown from a seed most aren't you know most grapefruit true so like six or eight feet or ten feet tall mine's forty I can get eight hundred grapefruits off in a season Wow there are wonderful and the neat thing that people don't know about grapefruits is the things called shine is if you live in on the tree they're gonna stay ripe for months so I got about four months to pick the grapefruits but when I didn't used to get him because I used to try to pick them all because they'd fall to the ground and the grapefruit tree because of its very nature keeps anything from growing under its canopy it's just ends up being sand well a rotten grapefruit is exactly the same shade of Tayna tan Assad and it still holds liquid that's now rotten in the inside and of course it goes flat too if you hit a rotten grapefruit with a lawnmower it is an experience you'll never want to repeat so the whole object is to get all the grapefruits off the tree so for years I'd end up with laundry baskets on the grapefruits in my store with little signs that said free to good home and I've learnt more ways to eat grapefruits I mean I 10 grapefruits will fill a gallon ziplock bag with a half gallon of grapefruit juice and I'll lay it on a cookie sheet in the freezer and freeze it and then I'll stack them up like records so I can defrost them later and but what I really learned to do that I love is I cut grapefruits in half and I sprinkle them with brown sugar and I put them under a broiler okay this next one is our berry mix and it should show you what the how the texture changes with the shape with the shape well actually no this is our madness I'm sorry but it's in the very rola this is the flavor we came up with for our our candy that should not be confused with a Procter & Gamble product we stopped making that logo but we did keep the flavor going because people liked it so much now this is air I thought I'd grabbed about thing of raspberries this is our raspberry drop roller but if you put it in your mouth you'll discover it gives you the it really does feel like a raspberry does that make sense yeah and it's an interesting shape no that's a flavor combination of multiple new fruit flavors Jessica mixes that and I've never asked her what she puts in it so I kinda like it but first she's a bunch of different ones and it's a great flavor combination because people got this joke candy that looked like a laundry detergent tablet and then they were shocked to find out how good it tasted he but you know so we made it for it we make a lot of our special candies for our week or two so if you want to get it you better get it now and I guess about four days into the video being up which is still on Facebook and not on YouTube we got an interesting call for the head of consumer safety from Procter & Gamble saying could you please take this down his name was Mark and it was really nice and it was like I'm gonna take it down on Sunday anyway only plan to put it up for a week and he went okay that's fine and we talked for a while and you know it boiled down to I was making a can't up candy that looked like a poison he was making a poison look like a candy never the twain shall meet no so he stopped making that design not to mention was annoying design to make I hate where I come up with a design I'm expecting to sell you know 50 bags of and then all of a sudden I saw 800 bags of it I'm spending a month making something that happened with the hurricane candy and with the madness candy some of these things are fun to make those two weren't though I make cotton candy when a hurricane MMO came I was a little concerned because was headed straight to Tallahassee it was a class-five it he's waving at the lights trying to they are the lights of that gun it was a class-five hurricane it could be a class-3 when I hit Tallahassee if it hit Tallahassee my power could go off I could have lost all my ice cream and food inventory I would have been down who knows how long I would have been down I thought I'd make a couple of batches of candy and ship it out before the hurricane hits I'd have some extra money and there was some I was sitting there actually that wasn't one thing I was just nervous talking with some customers we need some customers in the store who had come up from South Florida to avoid the storm they referred to themselves as immigrants and they were sitting there and said you should do hurricane candy it'll be great and we decided what come flavor it should be we started thinking about salt water so the thought the Hurricanes from the overhead videos look like the satellite photos look like cotton candy being made yes I did cotton candy flavor and people are going cotton candy flavor is Kim sugar already flavored like sugar and the answer is yes cotton candy has a flavor it's a variant of raspberry believe it or not and whether it's pink or blue it's still the same flavor and I made some candy and I did two batches and I put it aside and big buckets that are watertight in case anything came through the roof and I came back three days later because we were down for a bit and fortunately the eye of the hurricane hit 50 miles to the east of Tallahassee hurricanes are much more powerful on the east side so there are entire towns that were devastated I mean it was like the finger of God you'd go down the interstate there's just a section where there were no trees there were 20 miles wide and these old oak trees just went down and Tallahassee was spared we got some water we got some out I lost power at the house for four days because tree branches went down the store never lost power which was good Oh thankfully and uh it's a swamp it's Tallahassee we don't have snow we have our became snow so it came out pretty good I'm sorry I don't have any of that but I ran out of that ages ago so I think that's everything but the madness but since the madness is like a roulette wheel I think I'm gonna leave it to you and Craig to do that on your own with some beer or something honestly I don't want to do that it's a whole lot of fun and they're delicious but you know everything else I think you're all sugared up enough great thanks by the way I'm expecting to bring home chocolate tomorrow your thing is you do some shopping tomorrow [Music]", "seNQ8rexqKM": "[Music] untamed fruit flavor Jolly Rancher [Music]", "aSO-ZBoJ0DQ": "I am gonna be eating one of these very excited these are like hair

can make up one more batch those all air bubbles it's actually oil bubbles suppose from das orange they've already been added the Flavor Flav now the neat thing about this is I don't have to change the flavor all over the table he don't have to be a flavor saver literally a favorite shape itself that's what I call my mustache meet the flavor savor gosh did you save any flavor yesterday yeah what you save baby baby baby for later mmm-hmm one o'clock so there's tomorrow flavors be easily be done with this by I think you a330 hmm cuz then I can pack some up and put it on the shelf I just wish I knew somebody with a camera that could take a picture of that pile when it's all mixed up with a pretty cool shot and every batch is different so this won't be yeah and that the batch we're doing today will be different from the one we did we're like what two weeks ago one week ago this and usually yeah usually you guys only do one one day of hard job yeah and then it sold out in like what two weeks maybe less is the interweb people the interweb people I liked a lot but if you could take us still yeah that would be swell cuz you're the guy how'd you know I have a camera looking right at me see you had to take things are not moving pictures you take still pictures no I can't stand still for you well be accurate representational like all ours well you did that a purpose on purpose fishing for compliments we better try really hard then hey Brad to the bone I'm gonna take my stride how do you feel that I just cleaned these petals off to the tune of jingle bells okay let's see how much color I can get on the table this time choppers got month did this duck yeah you're right it will hmm I didn't wrong this time I hope so okay if I need any tech support did you get left and right sock

mean it oh yeah except for Saturday yeah that's already been oh yeah and then maybe like another day next but then that's it oh yeah are you guys still doing more peanut brittle okay then the only reason we didn't do more recently is because we don't have anyone to put it hmm don't have any room to put those big cases so we're gonna pack that up because basically we made three batches we solved that already huh so make three more but we knew we had to make more don't don't see chocolate-covered peanut brittle because then that's all they're gonna want cuz that's like the best thing ever it's true but don't talk about it cuz some think you should take it hopefully by the time you see this vid it'll be made yeah they're gonna want that for sure mm-hmm I bet last year normally we do like a half a batch covering chocolates to say 17 pounds ish this year we measure just do a full batch not mess around cuz if Craig does a video about it actually if you are out of town I'll just do an iPhone video yeah and what do I put that in the drop box sure email to me video will drive I think can hold up to 10 to 15 gigabytes and I think email isn't gonna handle that much well I think if you try to email it'll automatically sent to Google Drive if you try to do it through your Gmail account okay so Senate through G that makes sense because I already be on my iPhone anyway yeah yep until you do it and then I'll be able to edit it on my new laptop that's coming in today yep and when I'm out of town I can still work on the youtubes I love my job well I think you probably love your boss

it wasn't for them I wouldn't be able to do what I do that's true you'd have to go to work where you wear pants yeah you know hey I'm wearing pants cause it's cold it's only because I have to shoot a video and I'm just adding and why I'm not going anywhere today yeah that is a big strength you can make a two-tone snap that was plenty joke I don't think dad got it what he's ignoring it's kids busy working wasn't hearing was listening I wasn't listening for what I was hearing the size of this one is that supposed to go in the hookers the other one beside whatever Oh try to take it easy and you Steve do you make anything out of it any shapes I'm gonna try to do one live never done before squid start yes Wow the leg Patrick yeah that's a good thumbnail it could be a turtle - what do you say a ghost to be a ghost yes yes alright where I put them hmm that's fine I just wish I figure out you're gonna be on the hook yeah that's all Bolger wasn't ready yet you never gonna be on the hook all right so I'll go downstairs to make sure the none shall pass hey we're on the hook right now so once we get off the hook you guys can go pass the stairs oh you guys can come down here and look at it oh yeah we just we just can't go pass through here cuz the candy is very hot we don't want to burn you guys and we don't want to mess with the candy oh yeah we're shooting a video for the youtubes do you guys mind be annihilated and I'm 1 in 9 States oh my god so you do that by my hand I see a lot of they do it would like machines right here crisscross and stuff wow that's cool go at em machine the thing is what you're thinking of right yeah yeah we wish we had one yeah sure dad does especially right now right you got teleplay Brutus I'm gonna face cinnamon sniff the air oh yeah boy check the flavors in there yeah their most recent one yeah can you dance sentiment or some sort of spice but we did do a bunch of spices before this one this is a fruit flavor it's it's a flavor really okay I'll let you near the tablet orange cream maybe at orange yeah Ranjha - do you need a tap there Steve yes okay I guess I can take it off all right you guys are free to leave the stairs Stryper cute oh you guys some walk over here to whatever whatever angle you guys want to see from my gesture I just need a space to go on here just those things that doesn't carried away a little bit yeah thank you really he can't handle it anyway so you put one of them on the side and one of them kind of like on the point yeah though you always do know what you want Hey they do what they want yeah he's an adult allegedly very orange and getting the candy canes would be made the same way and said of a chopper you just use those scissors to chop it off and then you have somebody over here just make a hook I'm just gonna put it in to exit all that stopping it doesn't matter if they got mixed in with the other ones and try one in a minute it's a little bit hot you guys think would be more high-tech than this upstairs with like oh they're making candy downstairs Brenda go soon yeah you guys ever been down here before I have when I was like you guys come pick up school tours I'm sort of the school tour yeah

last the last of the batch that will hurt yeah Brad Ross over there first and strike I don't have a strike good work guys trackers [Music]", "luXEJcIAZpE": "hello and welcome to lofty pursuits in public displays the confection in Tallahassee Florida I'm Greg and I'm here to celebrate our hundredth video with a tour of the shop and some special hundred emoji candy so I've already added the flavour to the pot as I pour it and what's the flavor you ask while I'm doing two different flavors with two different candies for this assortment there'll be a brown wrapped candy which will be coffee flavored but it won't be a standard coffee it'll be a Kona coffee a Hawaiian coffee that Kahlua is based off it's delicious and the second one is gonna be amaretto because I like amaretto on my coffee and we're gonna do this with a hundred emoji logo and until I made this video I didn't know there were two versions of this emoji one is used by Apple and one is used by Android of course and the best part about this we're gonna give the candy away free with an order and we'll give more information about that later in the video these videos were actually created for two reasons I guess three the first one was to preserve some history in a public forum another one was to get people off the interstate were right next to i-10 and Tallahassee Florida and ten thousand cars a day drive by and I was a little offended none of them were coming into my shop so I thought I would tell people I was here I figured they'd want to come if they knew about me so I ended up putting up these videos and inviting people in and you know what you guys have come and I want to thank you so much mention in the comments if you've come by the shop in person I'm always interested in how many of these people who visit still watch my videos and number three of course was I wanted more people to experience the candy that I make I'm very proud of it you know so for the last 99 videos I made videos about history about candy making and I made sure that candy was the star not me this video is gonna be a little different because I realized a lot of you don't know the history of lofty pursuits this seemed to be the time to share it lofty pursuit started as a outgrowth of another business I had originally called gravity specific I started it with Jonathan Lyons that later became a firm called infinite illusions and we manufactured juggling equipment and shipped it worldwide I branched into yo-yos and eventually we need storefront and the storefront opened in 1993 on September 17th Here I am juggling in front of that storefront and we sold stunt kites and things like that we moved five times in the history of the business picking up something every time we expanded into toys with one move and board games with another and we eventually expanded into a scream and we expanded into candy making and lastly two and a half years ago we expanded into serving brunch seven days a week over the last 33 years one thing has become clear nothing stays the same your customers change every four or five years and I'm convinced if you don't change with them you get left behind so I keep on changing and I keep on figuring out new creative ways to do things and that's what lofty pursuits is about a reporter once called lofty pursuits a performance art project that happens to turn a profit that reporter might even be right I mean I don't have employee the month photos I paint portraits of my employees instead and the things that decorate the shop aren't like a Cracker Barrel where I'm always afraid of going into one and finding a photo of my grandparents on the wall everything is something special something that interacted with me or the store of the business from paintings I did four of the Creature from the Black Lagoon because it was filmed 20 minutes from here and I at one point ran the soda fountain out overlooking the springs where it was filled to things like the musical instruments which I painted that our marching band uses to circus memorabilia gifts I've been given things that I just find interesting and things that make me laugh and all of this with the candy and everything else on a background of a soda fountain where we use glass serving dishes and we have a menu with 52 sundaes because there are 52 Sundays in the year how many Sundays do you want me to have and the food that you may know from the videos is wrapped by our toy store the toy store we started with back in 1993 it's still here and it's bigger than it ever was we're known for a board game collection on our general toys that I try to pick out to make people smile once again and find things they can't find elsewhere people ask me what we sell here at lofty pursuits and I try to sell happiness that's my answer if I can put a smile on somebody's face it makes me happy and it makes what I do worthwhile and that brings me back to the YouTube channel and the YouTube channel now allows me to make people happy it seems around the world I can't tell you how much joy that brings and that's why I made a hundred videos and you guys keep getting the candy that I can ship because I haven't figured out how to easily ship ice cream I seem to be making you happy and it makes me happy and you know too many people don't worry about enough happiness in their life and I have a lot and you know that's good well back to the candy and the candy you can probably tell because I used yellow when I stirred in the food coloring is not going to be the coffee this is gonna be the amaretto and we're going to pull this on the hook for a couple of minutes and I'm pulling it here because I left the candy unfortunately cool on LY evenly and I need to fix my problem I'm gonna put it on my candy pulling machine and if there are hot spots when the Machine goes it'll tear where this candy is hotter than others bits and of course what I'm doing here is I'm folding in air bubbles and each of those air bubbles make the candy reflect light and that makes this candy white this is gonna be the white part of the candy now for certain candies it's either too hot or too heavy for me to pull unlock and I use this machine to help me but those few poles on the hook really made a difference to make this machine happy with the candy staying on it if you've seen a bunch of our videos this music is probably familiar to you this band is called bounce house and it used to be the house band of lofty pursuits years ago they split up and went their separate ways but we still love their music and I thought I'd bring it back for this video being that it's the hundredth video at all to make the hundred design we're gonna start by making one of the zeros and we're gonna do that by wrapping some white candy that we've cooled a little bit more than the rest with some red candy if you'd like to try some of our candy for yourself go to www.hawaii.edu and you place an order worth ten dollars or more we'll toss in a free sample bag of this candy which is of course a blend of the sama red oh you're seeing us mix and the coffee flavor I told you about and keep in mind we're only going to have this candy for a week or two but this video will be up four years so before you try the coupon code look at the date we posted this video and see if you think it's up and working now that we've built the two zeros it's time to build the one the one was tricky because I'm trying to hold a sharp corner and I don't want it to round out and I want the flat side to be round I accomplished this doing a lot of temperature control of course for colder candy stays straighter but if I don't do it right it won't pull evenly in the next step now we end up putting a spacer on the one and all that's left are the stripes that go under the one [Music] and now that the design is done it's time to wrap it in the white-hot sugar [Music] and lastly the outer wrap of yellow I [Music] placed the hot sugar on our batch roller this cool little machine from about 1910 and it keeps the candy spinning to keep the design from distorting and I'm gonna size it down from about a 7 inch diameter log of candy down to about a half inch rod of candy at this point the way the candy behaves is really cool it's a non-newtonian fluid you may have heard of it like it behaves like a thick version of that I can pull it out slowly and if the Hays almost like a liquid but if I hit it hard with the back of the scissors it shatters at a clean wide [Music] [Music] all that's left for me to do is to cut it into individual pieces on our little candy anvil and we have thousands of pieces of candy to send to you we're gonna blend this with the coffee flavor make an assortment make little bags and we'll include if you use our coupon code 100 just the numbers thank you for watching this video and all the others we really appreciate it we're lofty pursuits were located in Tallahassee Florida if you want to buy our candies for yourself go to WWE net and for the next week or two remember coupon code 100 and if you're over in Tallahassee we're right off i-10 on Thomasville Road in Tallahassee maybe four or five minutes away please come and visit we'd love to see you we open at 7 a.m. and we close at 10 p.m. we serve brunch in the morning and ice cream in the evening and it's a cool place with

right alright you guys so we went to prestige and they ended up being shut down so we're gonna go some but somewhere else maybe another smoke shop and maybe go home because I'm feeling [ __ ] - hi I don't like being out of my house when I'm this I I don't know about you guys but that's just me I'm probably at the our point right now you guys I'm just not feeling good I'm almost really kind of nauseous right now I shouldn't drink that much it was better when I just sipped on it throughout my day definitely do not take all that at one time I would say like what I'm feeling right now you guys is more of a body high more than anything you guys love the most intense crazy body high right now feels like when you're coming up on psychedelics it's just intense I don't know if you guys ever feel like thought on edibles but with me you guys it always hits me in my body super heavy cool wish me luck go happen bro you parked like [ __ ] damn bro how you feeling that for your boba cuz I think I'm

you guys about this one I'm already kind of over after drinking that full bottle to be honest and I already drank half of the other bottle so I'm ready like 1500 milligrams in this guy right here took you to the real smallest part that's why I spoke with Daniel part it means small part about whatever yeah I'm gonna show you guys I'll take you guys with me all right ciao we are here at the Kenya city of torez park you know we've got getting the whole in town I'm honestly never been to this part though well [ __ ] look look you guys real smallest part I don't know the last time I sat at our Park bench like this I don't get outside too often but I just wanted to update you guys a little bit on like how I'm feeling right now I'm feeling cold I'm feeling tired I wanted to knock out soon that's kind of what edibles do to me I have a hard time staying up on them I'm probably fifteen sixteen hundred milligrams deep first time in my life so forgive me if I don't finish it I might try my best to I just feel like if I finish you right now I'm gonna be knocking out way too early you guys I'm gonna be out out like 3:00 p.m. today but wish me the best almost done with this you ready to leave bro let's get out all right you guys stop watches at 53 minutes and remember how I told you guys that turned off so I said add around 30 minutes so around like an hour and 23 minutes right now and I'm really dreading this challenge I think 1500 1600 milligrams is already way too much you guys I don't know if I should personally take this 400 milligrams I'm way too high I don't remember the last time I've ever felt like this it it feels like drugs I know it's still kind of early I don't know what I'm doing I feel like I just want to go home right now but um yeah I'm tapping with you guys soon I feel like I'm flying right now you guys I'm only going 40 I'm so high so that felt so [ __ ] crazy I feel like I'm gonna die with this guy's driving right now it's not gonna drink the rest of this I hate the surfing bottom as a [ __ ] worst just trying to race right now damn I don't know about you guys the edibles to me feels like absolute [ __ ] tap I don't know why anybody takes them definitely not for fun I mean if I was feeling sick and I couldn't smoke or if I was an edible type of person I probably was just do it in moderation I would never do anything to it what I took today was 44 doses so pretty much one bottle is 22 servings when I ended up taking less 44 servings today you guys and I'm just feeling the effects of the first bottle right now so I feel like the second ball is still gonna hit me and I'm just gonna be floored we're on our way right now back to my pad we're about to run some 2k you know we've gotta go to Chipotle guys I'm hungry as [ __ ] right now

the burrito I'm definitely feeling better my stomach's starting to settle down the thing is this morning before I even did this challenge you guys I made sure I had a good breakfast how many sure I was hydrated cuz last time I was a hydrated so this time I didn't have a headache but hey you guys I'm just gonna have more of my burrito you know restore some of my body because what's happening

nap I might end up updating you guys one last time once I wake up if you enjoy this video drop a like drop a comment down below subscribe to your boy you guys aren't subscribed I'll see you guys soon", "SysslUhKwzE": "what is going on my peeps my name is David welcome back to this week's video god dammit my damn video now if you guys remember a few weeks ago when I made you this promise so it's gonna be between two to four plus videos per week yeah if you've been around here for any extended period of time you will know that I am NOT great at keeping the promises that I make sometimes although this one still has hope I'm just you know giving you a fair warning if I don't get two to four of this week but anyway some of you may remember that a long ways back I made jello Legos with these molds which did take me a couple of tries but they ended up looking okay and today I figured I should try to get more than one usage out of these $23 Lego molds I decided to take some inspiration from a tipsy bartender and all the other channels that have been doing shot glasses made out of Jolly Ranchers recently and use that same concept to make these Legos instead now there's a couple different ways that I'm considering doing these one of which I am assuming is going to come out the best but I will try a few so let's get right into it now if you are if you are out there that is more intelligent than the YouTube algorithm meaning that you have at least one brain cell and you make any amount of sense at all you would be able to assume that we need a whole lot of Jolly Ranchers for this project if this video gets taken down by YouTube you all know why but what I decided to do was to tump out the entire bag and to separate each of the five colors into their corresponding bulbs while also unwrapping each individual candy piece and this step is just about as fun as this time-lapse looks but once you complete that we can move on to the first method that I will be attempting and that is the double boiler method I've seen people melt down different types of hard candy like this before which is why I think that this might work so I've started with a few of the cherry flavoured because I tended to have the most of those and get even a while to melt down in the bulb and if you guessed that this was going to be a thick sticky mess than you were absolutely correct every single utensil I tried to use to stir this just did not work and got stuck everywhere the candy never really melts down completely to a liquid form it just stays really thick and the second you take it off the heat it thickens up even more so I tried my best to put the mixture in one of the little molds and let it cool down which as you can imagine was also at a C and a half but I guess when I took it out of the fridge it kind of worked a little bit but I think we can do a lot better for method number two all I did was stuffed each mold with different colors of the Jolly Ranchers I used four in each of these blocks which I'm hoping won't be too much or too little and once I had one of those molds completely filled I threw it in a 400 degree oven for about seven to eight minutes that's it for you if you're gonna try to make these things if you see a ton of bubbles in the top of the candy that means your oven is too hot or you left them in for too long but all you really have to do is just go in and try to pop them with a toothpick or a different sharp object just a little bit of extra work so avoid it is possibly but once I had done that that into the fridge for about 15 to 20 minutes until it hardened up and these look a ton better they still didn't take perfect shape of the molds they really didn't get all the divots in it and you can kind of see the crevice where all the candy is kind of melted together so I made one more batch like that and they came out just about the same the last thing I want to try with these though is to do the same method but halfway through the baking process put another different mold on top so that way the divots from the top mold will hopefully melt down into the candy so you can stack them together I did a few batches with that method and they came out even better than the last one so I tried to build some stuff with them I tried to make a nice little candy staircase and I guess that came out pretty cool I tried to make a YouTube logo which came out pretty crappy if you ask me honestly and lastly I tried to build a wall with an accurate representation of the theoretical integrity of Donald Trump's [Applause] one last piece of advice I do not recommend being overly aggressive with these or dropping them from any sort of height because they're kind of fragile and will chip a lot being that they're hardened candies they're actually almost on par with being just as fragile as a drama channel's YouTube career but I hope you enjoyed this week's DIY if you did let me know by hitting the

table we got uh between 100 and 110 what's on the other side the other side of the table 104 one same it's like 100 between 100 and 110 okay do you know what it was last time cold it was like 98 oh yeah and it cooled off really fast yeah so this time should be better yeah it's trying to be a little bit better we've got everything i guess hey sure i am watch your head oh screw this on the other side and the ball's not over there oh that's not important i'll do my best [Applause] that's good watch they're going to be perfectly even i'm going to feel kind of done with the air i'm just kidding i feel dumb it smells super banana right put a whole hand of bananas in here it already smells very behind me whoa gloves are going to smell bananas [Music] that's it you already put it all in i should have wished i missed it how many shots you have to put into that 1.75 and then max putting in seven and a half seven and a half yeah i guess that's why it's not as strong over here wonder why i totally smell strawberry yeah no i feel like it's not as strong as a banana which i feel like is extra strong well you know one of the one of the flavorings is twice as strong as the other one yeah i still smell strawberry though it's pretty well you guys haven't tried it yet have you joe did you try basically i had a piece yeah yeah how was it it's good nice juxtaposition flavors well balanced as all things should be we should take a temperature reading between the two and the kettles yeah i mean you gotta assume that the other one on the main stove is cooler but i mean warmer yeah i don't know for sure yeah oh that's cool yeah i'm pretty sure this one's colder yeah yeah i mean it'd be nice to have that on all this so is the the bottom of that double boiler not quite as warm as the stove then well it's that and um we lift this off and move it and that's still sitting on the cut the cast iron ring over there which holds a lot of heat yeah and uh the conductivity of copper is really really it's the most conductive metal so it cools off the fastest so when we take it off that and move it to there it's going to cool off quite a bit yeah by at least like one or two degrees i mean i don't want to get too difficult according to my calculations it's like 3.7 oh exactly every time oh wow no wonder we're having so many cooling problems do you believe me yes very believable oh what calculation stinking spoons that'll do you perfect [Music] do you guys think it is uh evenly split or uh not really probably no one's sure if they just just took more time to fill out and that's actually going to get there this if you look at that i think the table is not quite level because this end is usually thicker it's actually so i guess you guys could invest in like a scale to put underneath to make sure it's always well that's not that important also i guess you would also have to know how much the other one weighs because it's not always going to be the exact same yeah we could like fill this up dump out like exactly half of how much we put in and then mark the kettle but even that and the kettles are different weights too you have to take that into account it's a whole thing is it a whole thing or a whole kitten caboodle i like being alone it's fine just uh come out when you need a hug we'll find terry for you we know how much she loves giving hugs the people who don't know my mom that well because they don't know in real life i've seen my mom reject hugs from family members yep can you count them all oh no like i i've seen i've seen people ask my mom for a hug and my mind goes no [Music] she doesn't really dance around it just goes no yeah we mcdonald's we got pretty good at saying no [Music] um your kingdom look looks good yeah are all your loyal subjects doing your dirty work well i could still uh just bring this off but you're just bringing off stuff that looks clear so you can't really what to see much of anything oh you might be able to see it you see that one line disappear yeah cooled off a little bit but it's way better than it was before yeah yeah last time it was just i could see how cold it was even even me the guy who doesn't make any candy and his eyes are closed all the time yeah that sounds cold the last one actually did sound really cold though yeah you like you picked it up and you put it down the table is like yeah that one's coming together a little bit watch max open up i guess they can i almost said openers but he doesn't really want to use it i got to tell you okay have you ever did you ever play with legos when you were a kid never never ever not even your house with you yeah so so you wouldn't understand no do you know like it's like the gray piece and like you click it on it's got the two pieces you click it onto a piece and then you can bend it to get them up yes i never even used that thing like i i can't listen are they really yeah that's just not right lego i'm disappointed in you yeah remember those giant legos the what do they go clothes lego yeah oh sure he just loves building with him right next to the train set you know i guess wood it's kind of like legos for adults wood yeah yeah just make whatever you want although legos are also legos for adults dude i'm telling you every year for christmas i'm like well i hope there's a lot guys yeah logos are awesome yeah that was like my thing when i was growing up and uh i was subscribed to lego magazine same here yeah did you get the bionicles uh comic uh yeah i got a couple of them yeah yeah and i was trying to i think i remember telling my sisters and my parents that my animals because i was like they wouldn't it wouldn't say bionicle on here if it wasn't a word oh boy show me show me in the dictionary define bionicle these robot things it's a nickel that's made out of bios wow okay so just a heads up joe this this next batch the corn syrup is pretty soft so what's up the corn syrup oh yeah i don't know if that'll have an effect does temperature have much to do with that or that's humidity i think yeah but we've had some batches that are like wicked wicked soft and other batches that are you know you get the water really cold yeah yeah nice and icy and um i don't know if you guys do but i like to shake the excess water off too because sometimes you get more water on your hands or yeah for real yeah when it's sticky i put more water on my hands if um if you have too much water you form a layer in here and then that'll like eat away at the the invert yeah oh yeah yeah yeah yep all right so in one of the last videos that we posted somebody commented wait so putting water in your hands makes the corn syrup not stick to you but then you put water on the candy to make it stick to the candy yeah and they said how does that work i said magic we can put uh the kettle over there that we do for the banana and the lemonade that we usually do you can put water in that pour the candy before it's hardened into there and it won't stick to the copper kettle right this is madness joe it is madness water how does it work absolutely nothing who needs one again water's overrated it's about electrolytes it's what plants crave it's great all right i'll be back you guessing my age yeah i could never remember i know that you're always a few months younger than me and i'm 48.48 what am i younger than my dad yeah hey dad you got five bucks yes we'll give it to you later yeah this seems a little bit warmer than the last this is a little warmer than last time i was going to start with my caramel here oh i'm calling for a new carpal stirrer more sugar in candy this is the broccoli sugar so don't oh my god did you as soon as it touched it was like yep let's go find a scoop wow got even lighter hey steve hey how you doing buddy good you need a hammer yeah i got a little piece stuck on here how could i tell i because of the way it is oh that looks nice [Music] do you know why we hit the hook with the hammer why the vibration loosens it from the hook oh cool wow isn't that amazing i learned that from from the old country the science guy he will not be denied you've been in that room too long buddy humans i remember talking is it coming off no it's still stuck there come on steve work your hammer man i thought you were worthy okay little joe's getting tired dad yeah it's still warm it's a good color i'm thinking tired i got this i could do this all day long and that side [Music] there it goes i think you got it all right good you know one more one more [Music] oh i got a little bit huh so close [Music] that's not too much so are they about the same temperature oh no this one's a little warmer remember when we were pouring these out yeah and i said uh let's dump a little more i shouldn't have said that no they're about same size oh yeah if you kind of squint at it and turn the lights down they're like the exact same size yeah turn the lights off yes close your head you better turn a little less just believe what you want [Music] to switch for this one sure what do you mean you want to pull this one this up extra banana just the way we planned it get your hands up all i can hear in my head was get your fingers off of my butterfinger we'll probably put it up on top of this if you need it go back a little bit further i would i wouldn't put a lot of it but the bottoms would so yeah this thing's plastic yeah [Music] what do you think it does seem a little more strawberry right yeah yeah because it's a little bit cute yeah it just like pops a little bit differently yeah because a little see-through it seems almost like strawberry jelly is there anybody in the planet who doesn't like a piece of toast with some butter and jelly on it like strawberry jelly specifically not something that i ever eat but still delicious did this uh hmm that color difference it's not too different or it could just be the first couple pulls cause you know the car will change a tiny bit yeah uh when i make candy we have been going like every other like i'll first i'll throw it on the hook and then i'll oh yeah he didn't do all the hard work yeah yeah i see what you did there i understand i i am almost 30. yeah we had a lot of youngins next that's it he's only 30 since he's 26. right i've been almost 30 for 15 years dude when i was your age i was almost 40. all right so back off yeah i should be a little bit more understanding well when i was 40 i was 50. oh that he's been 40 and he's not even 30 yet yeah yeah you almost have two friends named bill and ted yes i'm going to pretend like i i i get i get it so like i've never seen that movie huh yeah where do you meet him um they're at a different school you have a girlfriend kevin yesterday [Music] so but people have asked us many times before where they get a candy cutter like that and we usually answer it saying if you find out please let us know because we don't know we just basically inherited these i think that they have friends yeah steve says we just talked about this yesterday because we made ken yesterday he said he always keeps an eye out for those things on the market the last time he saw one six years ago oh yeah he hasn't seen anything that's not burning yeah i mean i guess if you're if you're good with metal you could make one i'm sure i mean it's just like hinges and blades i don't know metal stuff but blades yeah i mean if you can fabricate i mean i'm sure that you can figure out most of anything it's not exactly like a modern model no different book dude you tape like six kitchen knives together you can make one of these at home and you can buy those from them like custom with like as many blades as you want different size spacers they've got those things where they mounted them on a like a table with a motor and they just kind of like push this whole giant tray through oh man it's an accident waiting to happen it's all it's like you know it's an industrial candy setting so they've got it all all the safety precautions in place most of them yeah it's it's pretty safe after like the 37 things that got caught up yeah we should put a guard on that imagine like going to work and you just ask your boss like so is that pretty safe like yeah so is that pretty safe oh so your birthday's coming up huh hmm you ever had banana ice cream uh made out of bananas made out of bananas yeah just frozen bananas blended yeah it kind of makes like a big cream okay but i don't know if i'm gonna eat ice cream bread yeah well yeah because if i'm gonna have ice cream i wanna have like cookie dough or oreo or peanut butter and chocolate i'm a stalker for strawberry ice cream i mean yeah like if someone offered to cover i'm not gonna i'm not gonna deny it yeah that's not my favorite choice yeah see i do like ice cream but i'm not much for like cookies and cream and all that well this is coming someone who doesn't like sweets you know what do you know about sweets yeah a little bit i've had ice cream before did this get smaller a little yeah i think it doesn't do that correct i think the heat might have melted it oh okay yeah yep oh can you see what you're doing real quick dad no no this is also a table too huh what's the temperature of the caramel 190. oh wow it's also because obviously that doesn't have to get tempered so it goes through the funnel right so it has to be like pretty hot to go through with them yeah cool stuff have fun brush turtles hey craig i'm not really sure that these are that sharp we just quickly yeah i'll give you a scale of one to ten how sharp i think it is the louder you scream the sharper i guess i'll take this this almost looks like um the first batch almost looks like a cheesecake-ish kind of color yeah see i i think they both kind of look cheesecakey yeah this one's definitely not good yeah it'd be a good color for the strawberry cheesecake though yeah yeah strawberry cheesecake i think would be great flavor like my mama i know was threatening to do cheesecake of all different types of pumpkin cheesecake yeah well i was just saying i think that would be good i figured the pumpkin flavoring was like the pumpkin mix or whatever i think that's why we don't want to do it outside of the season because we can't buy more pumpkin spice right but uh but yeah those were all really good yeah i think you know everybody knows that i'm not the biggest fan of chocolate but cinnamon over chocolate do it good work kids try our best strawberry first i flipped it over and got the

"4Bj6JmRUhHo": "hello and welcome to lofty pursuits in public displays the confection in Tallahassee Florida I'm Greg and me and Marky are gonna make hard candy today we're gonna make it on this drop roller that's dated from 1871 this is sort of a second part video our first part was video number 44 about black currant I discovered black currant as a flavor from you viewers mentioning it in comments it's a common flavor in Europe but it's an uncommon flavor in the United States so I wasn't familiar with it and it's the purple of Europe and the purple of the United States is great but if you ask somebody from Europe about our grape candy they're not gonna say it tastes like grape they're not gonna be quite sure what it tastes like and I wanted to figure out why I went down many dead ends trying to find this out and I did not have any grape expectations about having success but I ended up finding a wonderful story about the temperance movement in the United States about early 20th century flavor technology and about how a serendipitous moment in a mass transit like a bus or a train can change the world and I love that it took a train for me to get to Manhattan to meet dr. Nadia Bernstein she did her doctoral thesis on the history of artificial grape flavoring and she was nice enough to sit down with me for a few moments and tell me about it so far with this batch of candy we got the sugar up to 310 degrees we poured it on our candy cooling table and once it got down to a reasonable temperature we added citric acid and the citric acid will make the candy tastes more like a fruit as all fruits including grapes have some citric acid and for those of you who don't like us adding citric acid well I think that's just a case of sour grapes so I met up with dr. Bernstein and she talked to me about the history of grapes themselves it didn't occur to me that the need for a grape flavor is driven by the desire for grape flavoring or things that taste like grapes and I'm really glad she talked to me about this because this would have been a missing part of the story and it really would have left me in a jam to understand the history of grape flavor I think the first thing we have to do is is figure out why people were drinking grape juice in particular in the 19th century it was uncommon for Americans probably people in most places in the world to be drinking fruit juice if people were making juices they were usually in the 19th century especially the beginning of the 19th century they were usually making juice as a first step to making hooch Thomas Welch develops a method for making essentially what he calls unfermented wine which is which ends up being the drink that we all know now as Welch's grape juice this grape juice which is a kind of mass-produced product kind of rides into popularity on the coattails of the temperance movement and you start kind of seeing it as advertised as a wholesome and sound beverage people start drinking this on fermented wine and grape juice so Thomas Welch a name that we all know because it adorns grape juice and jams here in the United States was a temperance movement member in other words he was part of the movement that later led to the American prohibition on alcohol and he created something to compete with wine that was non-alcoholic grape juice this juice was associated with health and healthy and fresh things and he created a popular movement that created a demand for grape juice and in turn and grape flavoring if you want to try this candy for yourself please go to our website www.theatrefolk.com patreon we now have a patreon page if this grape drink is grape juice why doesn't it taste like grapes to people outside the United States Venice Larissa grapes which are the kind of grapes that are native to the United States so some of these varieties are concord grapes in the South Scuppernong Delaware Catawba essentially they they differ from what we think of as European grieved European wine grapes or the kind of California red and green seedless that are most common now in that they have this particular flavor which the technical term for it is boxiness so next time you try a Concord grape or a grape Jolly Rancher the technical way of describing its flavor is foxiness so that's a boxy Jolly Rancher you got there or other kind of grape flavor candy so the reason why this doesn't seem like a familiar grape flavoring to people in Europe is the grape that it's based on does not grow in Europe it's an American original and concord grapes which you grow up in upstate New York are not available across the United States but a couple of weeks a year and they're not just used for jellies and juices but here in the United States because back then they couldn't get any other grapes they've used these grapes for wines so now that we understand why the demand exists and why the flavor is different the next question is how did they get around to developing an artificial version of this flavor so how did this foxie flavor make its way from legitimate grape juice legitimate legitimate grapes to artificially flavored grape soda and grape candies what I found in my research was a kind of incredible story of a young man with a degree in chemistry he lived in the Annapolis his name was Gilbert hurty and he had founded a carbonated water company that also made flavorings of various sorts so he's writing the Indianapolis streetcar sometime between 1909 and 1912 and there's a woman standing next to him on this crowded streetcar and she smells exactly like grape the compound that's being used in this perfume would be the perfect chemical compound to to use in in a new grape flavoring which is which he'll produce right at this moment when grape juice is starting to have its heyday and he finds what the chemical is it's called methyl and framily and he uses it as the basis of a grape flavouring mecklen translate what's that why is it in this catalog well it turns out that in the late 19th century in the 1890s in europe and germany wears perfume companies are trying to do research to to figure out how to make artificial versions or synthetic versions of some of the most popular floral perfumes of the day their chemical analysis reveals that methyl and Thranduil it is the key component of neroli oil neroli scent they market it as artificial neroli and that is how the hurdy comes across it in a catalog and makes the connection and realizes this is the thing that smells like grape it didn't smell like grape to people in germany why because they didn't have the Venice lovers degrade it kind of took this material that entered the marketplace as a precious synthetic floral perfume in the United States kind of finds its new identity as a great flavoring and now we have our sheets of grape candy out here and we have to break them up into individual drops and I may not surprise you that the reason they're called drops is because we drop them [Music] so the artificial grape flavoring that we all know came about because the gentleman was on a trolley and he saw to hurt it to the grapevine from this lady that neroli oil or synthetic neroli oil smelled and eventually he discovered tasted like grapes in Rowley oil if it wasn't clear is the oil that comes out of orange blossoms and since I like grapes a bunch I thought

here's what you're going to need some gushers eggs to put them in tincture and a syringe needle all you need to do is use your syringe needle to get some tincture and put it into each of your gushers now if you measure out your tincture in advance you can know approximately how much is in each so if you do a tablespoon of tincture you can divide it by however many gushers you end up filling and that's how you can figure out how many milligrams is in each gusher i have not yet tried this with coconut oil but i believe it would work as long as you melted enough so the syringe would be able to

at another edible this time the wonka gummies instead of the wonka uh chocolate bars we looked at not last week i think the week before um anyway lab tested i don't know about that lab tested for quality inconsistency confused with solvent free cannabis distillate [Music] so these are like a black market edible pretty much they have a bunch of different flavors i guess or types of gummies these are peach rings i think um there's some a nice nice government warning for you don't mind my dog complaining um but i like to like i didn't even notice this before but the rainbow finish on it i don't know what exactly that is but it looks fire 500 milligrams no children's california wow if we take a look on the back there's an actual nutrition fact section um no serving size or anything just

ever get these they will be sealed but even if they are sealed you can kind of tell they've been like tampered with like heat sealed you know what i mean so it's always a risk when you get something like this um it could be very very good but also uh could be very bunk but these ones i got pretty lucky because these ones are actually pretty gas for what they are i saved one of them so we can take a look at it let me take this bad boy out and there we are your basic candy ring and says these are infused but uh you can really really taste it on like the outside so i'm assuming these are sprayed

chewy buttery caramels now this is a great recipe because it rme the recipe calls for one cup of butter so it's wonderful because you can use different amounts of cannabis cannabis butter depending on how strong you want to make it so for myself today I'm going to be using 1/4 cup um however you can go half a cup three quarters of a cup of can about this canna by no cannabutter and and then you just use regular butter to make up the difference so as I said today I'm gonna be doing a quarter cup of can of butter will do 3/4 a cup of regular butter and it's a really simple recipe and I'm looking forward to showing it to you as well as I'm going to show you how you can make turtles so you can just have the caramel pieces or you can turn them around you can make some turtles for for yourself or for the holiday season alright so we're just gonna get started and thanks for joining is a heavy a medium heavy saucepan and what it means by a heavy is it's got the heavy bottom this allows for even heat distribution to make sure that your candy cooks properly and evenly a rubber spatula or wooden spoon and a tray what I did is I just made a tray from a wooden frame and lined it with parchment paper obviously you can use any kind of baking tray line it with parchment paper a little trick that I do is to make sure to get it to fit in properly as I make a little slit into the corners and that way they can do it you just they're able to tuck in nicely you just tuck the corners in and that way it sits nice and flat and you'll also need a candy thermometer and so I'm gonna get into the ingredients and we're gonna start cooking you're gonna need 1/2 a cup of brown sugar packed 1/2 a cup of white sugar now I've used I said 1/4 cup of my can of butter and three coins three quarters of a cup of regular butter make sure get it all in there don't want to waste any and you're gonna need a one can of condensed sweetened milk not the regular milk not the regular evaporated milk it has to be the sweetened condensed milk you plop that in there and one cup of light corn syrup now you should be able to use the regular corn syrup I've never actually tried it with it I prefer the light corn syrup mainly for taste I don't really like the molasses taste in regular corn syrup but in this recipe I can't really see what difference is gonna make other than making it a bit darker as I said I haven't tried it so I'm not sure so you want it to start to mix all the ingredients mixed together here now is very important was doing this recipe is once you start cooking is that you never stop stirring you can't stop stirring for even just a minute or reduced even a couple of seconds because it will start to burn and you'll start to see little brown flecks appearing in it so you said the whole time you've got a stir so you're gonna be doing about a half hour of stirring time you're gonna turn your heat onto a medium and a medium or medium low and you're going to continue stirring until the bitter end so we're gonna be cooking this to a 234 to 240 so 234 is gonna give you a nice chewy but a very softer caramel the 240 is gonna give you that that chewy but really stiffer caramel so depending on what texture that you particularly like is the temperatures are gonna go to I'm gonna be cooking it to 237 because I wanted a little bit firmer than that really soft but I don't want that really really firm almost break yourteeth firm caramel so 237 is what I'm gonna be cooking it to and you're just gonna continue to stir clean off the sides of your pot and yeah enjoy put some tunes on and dance away so continue stirring until everything is nice and melted and there's no more lumps and everything is nice and smooth and at that point you can add your candy thermometer and then I said you're gonna cook it to between 230 to 34 to 240 and don't ever stop stirring so we've been cooking now for about 10-12 minutes and you're gonna see these candy the caramel is starting to darken up getting more caramel looking and it's also getting thicker you may not be able to see it but trust me by my arm it is getting a lot thicker and we're almost a temperature and so as I said continue stirring until you get to do your desired temperature alright so we're just coming up onto the 234 so at this point if you want that softer chewy caramel you would pull it at this point submerge the bottom of the pot in cold water that's what I've got sitting beside me there and to stop the cooking process right away otherwise so the heat will continue to rise for another moment a minute or two making it a little bit firmer than maybe what you'd like so if you want to stop the cooking process right away somewhere at the bottom of the pot in some cold water alright so my temperature now is 237 I am going to pull out the candy thermometer and submerge the bottom of the pot into cold water beside me to stop the cooking process so as I said you just want to stop put it in the cold water to stop the cooking cooking process and then you're going to immediately pour it into your pan that you've set up with your parchment paper earlier all right so for this I'm pouring half of my mixture into my pan there so that I can make caramel pieces and then I'm gonna be poor than the rest into a funnel so that we can make the pecan clusters or Turtles whatever you like to call them and I'll show you how to put those together now we're gonna put our turtle together so just get a whole pecan break it in half and that's gonna be the main body part and you take the other half break a piece in half and that's gonna be the front legs and then get another half break the break it in half and that's going to be the back legs and then you're just gonna take your caramel with the funnel and you're gonna plop some caramel right on top in the middle and you're gonna do that for for all of them or if you don't want to make the little turtle shape which I wouldn't really bother with because by the time he gets a caramel in the chocolate you don't really see that it's a turtle so I just make some pecan clusters and top it off with caramel and then we are going to coat them up with chocolate once the caramel sets so it's gonna take about 20 minutes half hour for the caramel to firm up enough so that we can coat them with the chocolate so at about the 10 minute mark while they're still warm what I like to do is to form them into into more of a ball because they flatten out when they're warm and you poured the caramel they're kind of flat so what I like to do is kind of push them together so that it creates more of a I'll be it more of a shape that you want more of a cluster instead of it just being flat so I've gone ahead and I've already melted out my chocolate I've got that ready I like to use the candy melts they're really simple to use and there I just call them pretty much idiot-proof you melt them you dip them they dry it's great so you just take your cluster and you dip it into your chocolate and use a fork to be able to get off the excess chocolate so you just want to tap it remove any of the excess chocolate and then you're gonna place it on to the wire rack and I'll let it dry and what you want to do is to put a piece of parchment paper underneath your drying rack to catch any of the excess chocolate that drips off so it's not dripping on to your counters [Music] [Music] I've taking my um Turtles out of the refrigerator after 20 minutes if they're a little bit stuck to the tray don't worry just use a flat knife there to pry them off or if you just let them cool warm up a little bit they'll come right off and there you've got it PK clusters or Turtles your friends and family are sure to love these for the holidays they make a great gift idea sark caramel now is completely cooled is about two hours and we're just gonna remove it from the parchment paper so just take it out of the pan and remove all your parchment paper from it comes away really easily and just remove any little tiny pieces that may be remaining now I had a little wet spot for some reason in my mold so I'm just gonna cut that out and what I like to use for cutting is I like to use a pizza cutter you can use you can use either scissors or a butcher knife is really handy as well now usually I use a ruler but I couldn't find it today so I'm just gonna eyeball it for us here it's not gonna be very accurate but it's gonna give you the idea and I'm using a piece of parchment here just to be able to hold on to the caramel while I'm cutting it cuz otherwise it's slippery and I don't want my handprints all in it so you just press down and firmly roll the blade through [Music] once you have them all cut up into pieces you can wrap them up in parchment paper or wax my backs paper I prefer wax paper I don't have any today so I'm using parchment paper as you can see it's not the easiest to work with but the caramels not going to stick to it so I kind of wrap it like a little present just tuck the ends in and if you want you could add attack a little piece of tape on but as I said if you use wax paper it's great it just wraps up really nicely [Music] [Music] [Music]", "8D__KieWACI": "what's up everybody welcome to the channel today we're going to be making cannabis sour skittles so let's get into it the ingredients to make

today I'm just showing you how to make infused super sour candy spray is so good I'm so obsessed with it and I'm so excited to show you guys how to make this these turned out so amazing they're so delicious they literally my favorite thing ever my favorite thing I've made my everything empty so they're just like they're just so good so I'm doing a couple different versions including some sugar-free and so much sugar I thought this sugar-free one might not taste as good as well as sugar because of course it's sugar-free but I honestly cannot even tell it's like it literally tastes like real sugar which is weird might be because of all the sour in there it kind of like throws your tastebuds off or something but it's absolutely amazing and it has no calories except with coconut oil yes actually and I'm going to show you guys how to emulsify coconut oil into a spray and they stay like this they don't um separate now if you don't want to follow the instructions for the emulsification of the mixture you don't have to you could just do the flavoring with coconut oil um and just shake it every time you use it it'll still work but if you want to keep them so they look like this all the time I'll show you guys how in the video the texture is a little bit different for the one with the sugar versus the sugar free the sugar free one is more liquidy and the one with sugar is a little bit more like the kind you get in the store so it has more of a syrupy texture I mean that one extra sourdough made then I did use coconut oil in mine but you don't need to I just added to help with the absorption if you choose not to use coconut oil just try to use your spray when you're eating something fatty or take like a soy lecithin pill or something along those lines here's what you're going to need a variety of drink flavors or flavor oils some infuse coconut oil or regular coconut oil tincture if desired water granulated sugar citric acid potassium sorbate mixture exams and gum and some spray bottles start by taking your infused coconut oil and melt it in the microwave until it's liquid our first step is to make our base for our sprays so we do want to add some fat to our sprays but unfortunately oil and water do not mix so we're gonna make an emulsion using water exams and gum and infuse coconut oil you could also use regular coconut oil but if you can up the infusion for this I say why not so we have 1/3 of a cup of water and 1/4 TSP of exams and gum this is what the exams and gum and water mixture should look like after blending it now I'm gonna add in two tablespoons of my melted infused coconut oil and then we're gonna blend that together alright here's how it looks and it's too thick so I ended up having to add it some more water to this so I added 1/3 of a cup more water and left everything else the same so if I were to do this again I would do 1/3 of a cup of water 1/4 teaspoon of example gum or possibly maybe just 1/8 of a teaspoon but I would only do 1 tablespoon of coconut oil now that I added water it definitely looks a lot better I'm just gonna have quite a bit left over now I'm gonna add 1/4 teaspoon of potassium sorbate mixture which I will link how to make below and this is going to preserve your sprays so that they can last for months now I'm going to pour my mixture into my little spray bottles I believe they are 30 milliliters spray bottles and I'm gonna just fill them about less than half of the bottle I mean you can play around with how much you want of this it just kind of affects the texture but if you added more that would work as well the amount of mixture I have is enough for probably six or more bottles now we're going to start with our first spray which is the sour blue raspberry I want mine to be extra strong so I'm also going to be putting some tincture in here I put about 10 of these syringes I don't know but I think equals about a tablespoon you can add more you can add less you can add none it's up to you I could have added more but I didn't want to have too much of an alcohol taste now we're gonna add in our flavoring I'm gonna be using these kool-aid sugar-free flavor packages but you could use regular kool-aid or you could use a flavoring oil it's really up to whatever flavor you would like I'm just using one package but you could use more if you want a stronger taste now to add our citric acid which is going to make our mouth spray sour I'm only going to be adding in one teaspoon of citric acid because this drink mix already has citric acid in it you could use as much or as little citric acid as you like but I would recommend not using any more than three teaspoons of citric acid as I think that would be too sour even for somebody who really does like sour and as you can see I'm really struggling getting the citric acid to go through the funnel and that is because it is wet so I suggest either cleaning it and drying it before you pour anything through that's powdery or to put the citric acid into your containers before you use the funnel with any liquids now I'm just gonna fill the rest of my container up with some water and as you can see I over fill it so just keep a nice eye on how much water you're adding there to add less than have to add a little bit more after then you can shake it all up until everything is all mixed together and you can see it has perfectly emulsified oh never mind there's some clumps in there so with the clumps if you guys can see them on camera I tried to be able to get them but they weren't showing up very well if you get clumps in there it's because the flavor packet was not dissolving properly and that's likely because I use cold water so I just do this in the microwave for about 30 seconds with the lid off and as you can see it's perfect I have a very smooth nice texture now our next one which is the sour watermelon I'm going to be using this Jolly Rancher watermelon drink packet of course you can use a regular couid packet flavoring oil like I said you can really use anything that your heart desires now we're going to add our 1 teaspoon of strick acid as well as the flavoring packet then I'm just gonna give it a quick little mix and then I am going to add some more tincture to this again you don't have to add tincture this is just a personal choice to make my spray stronger now we're just going to fill the rest of the bottle up with some water this time I use warm water and then we're going to shake it up real nice and that's it this one is done and ready to use so now we've made our sugar free watermelon and our sugar free blue raspberry now we're gonna make one with sugar which is going to be our sour green apple spray the first step to making the sugar spray is to mix equal parts water and sugar so I have 1/4 cup water and 1/4 cup sugar and I'm going to bring that to a boil and once it comes to a boil I am going to let it cook for another 2 minutes about and then I'm going to take it off the heat once it's off the heat I'm going to add in my flavoring and I am using a kool-aid package I didn't really know how much I was going to need so I just threw the whole pack in there you could use more you could use less again all down to taste but the 1 pack works well for this and of course you could also use a flavoring oil instead then we're just going to mix that all in until it's nice and smooth and evaporated absorbed I'm not sure this is all this the word that I'm looking for so you're going to stir this until all of the powder has been dissolved you can also add the citric acid in at this point I didn't I don't know why I just didn't but it would be easier if you added it in at this point then you can add in your sugar water kool-aid mixture into your jar with the base mixture of coconut oil water it sounds and gum so yeah just pour that right in and then we're going to add our teaspoon of citric acid and like I said it would have been easier had you just done this and while it was still in the pot but that's the really nice thing about making these sprays as they're very very very flexible the only thing you want to be a little bit careful with is making that emulsion mixture that is the base of each of them to bind that oil and water together now I'm just adding some tincture in here it is a unmeasured amount I'm just going for it here now we'll give it a nice little shake and mix it up until it is all finded this one you can already kind of tell when shaking and it has a bit of a different texture from that simple syrup sugar mixture speaking of which you could also use a few simple syrup in this recipe so you can see there's so many ways to do this so I tried it and it was super tasty but I felt like I wanted it more sour like I like it so sour that almost hurts my face so I added in a another teaspoon of citric acid and it turned out perfectly it's so sour and so delicious and the sugary taste of it is like even better than the other ones not gonna lie so I want to show you guys what they look like when they come out and the difference in texture between the sugar-free and the not sugar-free so this red one here is a sugar-free one and it tastes really good I was worried that the sugar-free ones were going to have a like meth taste because they were sugar-free but they were like really really good I almost wouldn't know they weren't sugar-free if no one had told me so but the sugar one has a very different texture and it's more like syrupy a reminds me of when you buy a sort of a candy sour spray from the store it kind of has that same mouthfeel but they're both very very good and I'm not gonna lie to you guys I have to suck this out of a paper towel after I just couldn't waste it thank you guys so much for watching I am so excited about these they're so good please tell me if you make them because I want to hear what flavor combinations and everything that he did and also thinking of doing a mint flavored one without sugar obviously it's better fruity and I don't know like maybe like a Mexican maybe like a spicy one I don't know what do you guys think what would you like to see it we got there so good I'm gonna dicted to this I named a green apple one of my favorite but I love a green apple thank you guys so so much for watching I hope you enjoyed this video if you did please give it a thumbs up leave comment and subscribe thanks guys [Music]", "4MD06UCMUd8": "hey guys what's up this is recreational 420 and I know I'm really close but there's a reason for it I'm gonna do an edible review and this stuff is the fat Panda or hot sugar Panda candy green apple powered by you fuse and every other brand that they like to throw in there so this is what it looks like this is just a one single serving ten milligram candy kind of like a it's supposed to be a soft chew so I'm gonna go ahead and open it like I said single piece I didn't you know just a single package I didn't get like they're ten pack that they have but there we go I'm gonna go ahead and open it up this is what it looks like once you open it just a weird little looks like a little turd kind of so look at me getting all smart using scissors now so that's what it looks like it feels exactly like if you if you've ever been a child airheads that's exactly what this feels like it's got that same consistency whoo it's got that same smell like I said this is green apples so I'm just gonna shove this whole thing in my mouth and enjoy it oh my god so as far as the flavor goes you guys are gonna hear me too it's fun all right so the flavor is actually really good I have it on the top of my room I like my mouth right now I've gone so the flavor is amazing I'm gonna have the other one right here in a second this was just a 10 milligram candy and yeah I'm gonna see how this reacts and I'll be back with you guys in a couple days to let your w tomorrow and I'll let you know exactly how this one hey guys what's up so I went ahead and tried those watermelon candies as you guys know that obviously I ate it in the video so about an hour and a half to two hours later completely spaced the fact that I'd had an edible hadn't smoked yet and was sitting on the couch and I look over to my girlfriend I was like babe why do I feel so hot she looked at me and just started laughing and she was like oh yeah the watermelon candy you duh so yeah this thing even for just having had the 110 milligram candy it was enough to like send me into that edible hi I felt it I got tired I got a little bit of like the haziness and this was all by 5 o'clock so if if you're new to edibles this would be a great one because it's gonna give you like just enough of that like effect that you're gonna feel it and get you know the base knowledge of how it in edibles going to like a react in your body so all around I would and if you're more of like I guess a more seasoned user you can take 2 to 3 and have a great night either way these are awesome so with that I think that's it this has been recreational 4/20 if you guys have any questions or anything leave it down in the comment section if you like these videos go ahead and hit that sub button trying to get to a hundred before the end of this month and I'll be back again with you guys soon [Music]", "CwdlzTpUk48": "TWO WHO WAS NEXT IN LINE TO

on Fahrenheit stuff medium hot tincture boiled down beforehand approximately 20 minutes very low simmer till it's just barely juicy this is sat it's a little bit dry use a pot scraper to get it out candy trays lightly sprayed with Pam small packet of jell-o ready put some in the sugar as it's boiling not all of it just some pock scraper is very effective especially in the stride out state do not lose the pot scraper I have a rata added the first amount of tincture that I showed you the other amount is waiting just gonna do some bubbling and boiling you don't have to stir it constantly but it's a good idea to stir it regularly already at 2:26 this candy thermometer has a cover that has a guide on it candy on the right hard crack 302 Fahrenheit I was previously only going to 250 275 which got you somewhere between fall and soft crack the fall is going to be chewier the hard crack is going to be just like a hard candy it'll start looking a little bit frothy that's alright it's normal just keep doing the stirring a little bit we're already at 236 within a couple of minutes try to scrape the edges every once in a while to keep it all incorporated it's going to get a little bit thicker keep going we're almost 300 first put the teacher in still won't but it'll break down with stirring it turn down a little bit we got a little too hot out of jell-o try not to fling it around in the pot that's pretty much what you put on the sides you're not going to get off keep it on the heat you can lower the heat a little bit keep it on the heat so that you can keep stirring the jello in just be in the pot looks like like super sure to get all the edges and top bottom so you know you got all your jello and your team's you're mixing okay scoot over you did hurry to try and get as much of it out of the pot as you can before it starts doing the stringing crap nothing but once it's in the tray let it cool a little bit where you start spreading it other ways you get that so it's best to try and pour it across this mold as best you can so you don't have to mess with it a lot still a little warm spreading that as it gets cold or cooler it's easier to just push around where you want places where it slowly I'm just kind of try to get rid of the lines these are it's not a big deal for your personal use but if you're gonna sell it these are harder to deal with it's not square it's harder to make them all level just don't look as nice but if you're starting with this tray you will probably get closer to looking nicer like that rather than the partial pour where you don't really know how much fill of your mold you just on a poori so these are a little bit thick and sloppy looking you try and mash them down but as they get cooler they're just gonna snap off Chrome's like that", "7sbBD0UQ7BQ": "was weird how your life changed but it's all right man started smoking weed so i thought about my life man [Music] hi guys welcome back to my channel if you're new welcome to my [ __ ] channel if you guys are new this is a great video for you guys to start with we are making as you guys seen from the title thc infused firecracker grapes i think they came out pretty good if you guys want to see them you have to stay tuned before we get this video started stop what you're doing make sure you subscribe make sure you turn on your post notifications so you're notified every single time another video like this uploads also just let me know down below if you guys want another video like this because i do have one other in mind and i think that i might just start doing cannabis infused foods and videos like that so let me know down below if that's something that you guys would like to see again without further ado let's get straight into the video but first it wouldn't be a video of mine if we weren't smoking all right all right all right welcome to my [ __ ] show and tell y'all okay so we're just gonna get the voiceover started bear with me i've never done a voiceover before but we're just going to hop straight into this so basically this part is optional we just wanted to take all the jolly ranchers out in one session so we could just throw them in the baggies that i'm about to put them in so that's what we're doing here damn okay so once you're done unwrapping all the jolly ranchers you want to throw them in a baggie if you don't have a food processor i'm just ratchet as [ __ ] and i didn't have a food processor so i decided to throw them in a baggie um double bag it triple back it and then use a hammer to basically hammer the hard candies down into a fine powder you really want the powder to be as fine as possible and have less bigger chunks of the jolly ranchers because it's a hard candy and it's not going to be really enjoyable to eat if there's really big hard crystals on the grapes yeah i'm saying it just doesn't make sense so crush those [ __ ] down make a little powder out of it or whatever now the powder is what it should look like those hard crystals i actually went back in and actually crushed them up finer here's the pot i'm gonna put half a cup of water half a cup of this cornstarch right here also sorry for the mess you know and just ignore that anyways so yeah so equal parts water and equal parts corn syrup and then you want to do two cups yes [ __ ] i know that's a lot of [ __ ] sugar two cups of sugar you want to mix that around i didn't turn the heat on until after so i can get all the ingredients in the pot and it won't start boiling i do recommend starting on like a medium heat and don't get into the hot heat yet here i am putting a lemon in the pot just because the recipe that i said the recipe that i listened to needs it said to put in some kind of citrus so i added this lemon here is the wax that i'm gonna put in each of these containers is 620 milligrams i believe and i basically put a little bit more than one and a half so it should be a pretty potent this is my regular ass broke ass thermometer your girl didn't buy no candy thermometer because [ __ ] it i was just gonna eye it so i was done with the thermometer it was not working now you see it start to boil it starts coming together you're gonna leave it boiling for a while i'm just mixing it up so it doesn't settle at the bottom and to make sure that all the sugar that's in the mixture is getting dissolved now you want to add some food coloring you want to add some food coloring when it hits about 250 to 260 degrees if you guys have a candy thermometer you don't need to stir the food coloring in because the bubbling itself is actually going to make the red color go throughout the pot you should see a red orange kind of color like this if you're doing it right [ __ ] if you're doing it right also you can use any food color you want damn [ __ ] come on what the [ __ ] is taking so long my mom wanted to try a grape without the thc so that's just me digging my little fingers up in the syrup so i can get her grape before i add the wax into it god damn i'm taking another hit so here i'm scooping the wax out of the container and just throwing it straight into the pot you can use waxy i think you can use shatter i think you can use distillate honestly the mixture that is boiling is going to be so hot that is going to melt the wax just remember to use a dab tool to get all the wax out of there put it in the pot stir it around so it's mixed in there nice and good and it gets evenly distributed oh guess i have to cross it oh a little bit more oh oh that was a big chunk yep we're just stirring stirring stirring so because i don't have a candy thermometer you're supposed to be done at about 300 degrees you're supposed to let it start to cool a trick is if you don't have a candy thermometer get ice cold water and take some of the mixture and put it in the cold water and if it hardens then your candy is done this was difficult for me i think i ended up messing up on this part so don't listen to your girlfriend go get yourself a candy thermometer i swear but it didn't turn out too bad so i actually turned the heat off which is why you're seeing the bubbles start to go down we are almost done with our [ __ ] firecracker grapes y'all so i just took a um a skewer you can find these like where you barbecue or anything like that um i poked the grape put it in the syrup and now i'm just dipping it all in the jolly ranchers you do like such the jolly rancher mixture might get hard just continuously mix it with like a fork um and you maybe want to do like two different bowls or something when you do the jolly ranchers because it does get really hard especially once the candy syrup gets within the jolly ranchers it was quite difficult but you manage you manage you'll get there so just get a lot of syrup on there and start throwing all the powder all over your grapes and it should stick they should taste very very yummy oh yeah also you guys see the napkin because when you take the grapes and you wash the grapes you want to pat them dry before you take them you put them into the sugar mixture so that the sugar mixture sticks to the grapes that is very very important they will stick to the grapes without you doing it but it's gonna stick a whole lot better if you just dry them off first damn look how [ __ ] bomb these look i've been watching this like damn these look real good i better go in the house and have me some and that is it you guys thank you so much for watching this i can't wait to try these grapes and let you guys know how they tasted and if i got high or not i guess that's the question of the night since we did almost put i think we put about a thousand milligrams so we'll see how high they get us i will definitely let you guys know in the next video so make sure you subscribe make sure you hit the bell until you post notifications and i'll talk to you guys in the next one thank you for watching my video bye guys", "4h8sTpIMn10": "what's up everybody so this is something I want to say real quick about these way there's another review of doing about about the sweet and sour candies I wanted to do this one these are called watermelon candies and they you know they taste like watermelon varying got very sugar-coated type stuff you know comes with the standard thing they will tell you what kind it is indica oh I forgot the other one was indica - these ones are absolutely delicious these tastings is like watermelons um you can taste the cannabis taste in it but I don't care because medicinally holy crap these are awesome I need about four of them and I was doing pretty good I'm not gonna again again I could ate more and got completely medicated but it was okay um it just proves that these are pretty consistent pretty strong I always kind of liked the small touch this is why I'm talking about this company here I'm not sure where they are um everybody always says the bay but that's probably good chances they're from around the Central Valley or or one of those areas so I just wanted us a quick review on this one is that these are absolutely freakin delicious the watermelon candies I love them additionally they're freakin awesome the ingredients unfortunately the number one ingredient is corn syrup right you know again a lot of these sweets there's not much you can do about that the second one is sugar but the third ingredient is cannabis so that means that's a good thing as this there's more cannabis in this thing then there is a gelatin which is pretty awesome because that's what the mainly made of I'm just supposed to contain about 13 to 15 milligrams per candy I ate I can eat eight five and was doing pretty good again usually when I eat them it's between three and five and that's again if you really wanted to get you know screwed up I guess this is the word for it then seriously medicated then yeah you can get a whole bunch of them and you'd be doing good the consistency is pretty awesome every time we've gotten these is my good these are 30 bucks a bag for this I'm sure through the distributor they don't cost that much but that's usually what the price of going through a co-op is or dispensary but anyways for sure check out this product if your co-op your dispensary has it this is pretty awesome so again share subscribe and do all that other good stuff

much just like melting your novel it's amazing hey guys welcome back today I'm gonna be showing you how to replicate and infuse my favorite chocolate bar from Purdy's I don't know if there's a party's in the States but in Canada we have lots of them and they have really good chocolate and they make this amazing chocolate bar that's white chocolate with sprinkles and pop rocks and is so good it is like the best ever only difference is that ours is going to be infused with coconut oil here's what you're going to need white chocolate sprinkles pop rocks and the most important ingredient coconut oil so this is the mold I'm gonna use for my chocolate bars and I'm not sure how much chocolate I'm going to need to melt so I'm just gonna have put my little chocolate wafers in here to kind of like visualize approximately how many I'll need so I think that looks about good I might need a little bit more a little bit less so we'll find out but I just don't want to melt too many if I don't need to since this is the only mold I have for a little chocolate cute little chocolate bars so I'm just gonna put the chocolate into my Pyrex measuring cup but a bowl or anything is fine I'm just shooting to use the pirate so that I can pour it out after so I'm gonna put this in the microwave for about 45 seconds so 45 seconds is third melting a bit ruin and stir it we don't want to over melt the chocolate or it will get like chunky so you just have to melt it slowly and then stir it melt a little bit more so I'm gonna put it back in for 20 seconds that was 20 more seconds and it is perfectly melted now and then we're going to add in two tablespoons of our coconut oil so my coconut oil is just that partly room-temperature partly melted it would be best if I had this sitting on the thread shows fully melted that way I could put it into the the chocolate a little bit easier and measure it out but I just scooped it I was fine too now I shouldn't have to microwave this again because the heat from the chocolate should melt the quill but I might not do it we'll find out just keep stirring it a bit to just warm it up and melt it so I think it keeps me melted a little bit more so I'm gonna put it back in the microwave for like ten seconds and I do want to make some of my chocolate bars Oreo so I'm gonna have like a mix so I'm just gonna bring up some Oreos and add them to some of the moulds okay there is our ten seconds and you can still see little coconut chunks but I'm just kind of stirring them in and pressing my spoon against them to melt them there's still a little bit of Trump so I'm just let this sit here and melt a bit more while I put my Oreos into my bowls just gonna break them up and put them right into the mold I think that I don't know like should I do them with Oreos and sprinkles like these ones over here all gonna be the sprinkle and pop rock ones but these two I want to be Oreo but it just like should I also have sprinkles I don't know okay we'll save that to add on top okay so that those little chunks have melted a bit you can mix that in and I feel like we're probably gonna need a little more chocolate like that doesn't look like enough for all these but before I add in my sprinkles and my pop rocks I'm just gonna fill up the Oreo ones now maybe a little bit more Oreo on top I'll crush these ones a little bit finer those look good it's like cookies and cream I wish I would have crush the other ones this small kind of looks a little bit better mmm it smells like cookies and cream okay now for the other ones that I'm gonna do top rocks and sprinkles I could mix it directly in here and then pour it in but I kind of want to pour it in and then add it so we'll see how this goes I think I'm gonna have to make more anyway and obviously you can use any fillings you want like you could add any sort of like cookies you could add mint flavoring you could do like marshmallows oh you can do anything you want okay I do need a melt a little more this will just be like a mini one maybe just like those like Hershey bars you get a Halloween okay now I'm gonna add the pop rocks cotton candy how good is that gonna be with this is anybody else is just like love cotton candy flavored things like what do you have flavor is cotton candy I just feel like it's sweet flavor okay it's open these up let's see what color they are okay so they're pink I would have liked it they weren't pink to be honest because like I really want to see them but they might blend damn with the sprinkles so we should probably be fine today I'm just gonna kind of like mix them in like how much do we want it there you'll see a man sprinkles now sprinkles are the best part I like lots of Franco I like the crunch of them in there and we're just gonna mix them in again my god this looks so good so I filled up my molds with chocolate and put my toppings in them and then I'm just gonna put them in the fridge for like I don't know 20 minutes 30 minutes we'll find out how long it takes alright guys they've been in the fridge for about half an hour and they are ready to come out so we're just going to pop them on out of their molds but we're gonna do it gently so we don't break the chocolate while it's coming up guys they turned out amazing look how beautiful they are okay the best part tasting them ah mm-hmm-hmm oh we have the extra sprinkles hmm yes oh these are so good they're almost better than the one from Perry which is weird cause like I use pretty cheap chocolate but I'm thinking the coconut oil being added like smooth it so much just like melt in your mouth is amazing thank you guys so much for watching please leave a comment give us a thumbs up and subscribe and I hope you have a wonderful day [Music]", "5-o1BEb8eek": "now speaking of getting high yeah you know not all highs are good highs sometimes there are bad highs yeah do you have a horror high story of that experience while you were high I'm sure yeah so I was in Jamaica and my friends there was like 15 of us got all guys we decided to take brownies one day and like the crew range from guys who smoked weed everyday to guys who had never smoked weed in their entire lives but everyone was no pun intended pot committed to taking these brownies they're like this big I took one we all went to the beach and then like all of us were hit with this ridiculous wave to where everybody was I can't even like astronomically high like I wa I couldn't even cross the street like I was trying to cross the street at this pizza place with my two friends and I couldn't I kept backing up and I can I finally sat down and got food and then we ordered buffalo chicken pizza and I was enjoying it and then my friend said like ma'am I've gotta get out of here like I think like the walls are like coming in and his friend was like a very like he was like the guy who would get so drunk and not feel it like he was like the big type of dude who wouldn't get freaked out and he got freaked out to freak me out then all of a sudden I just woke up and what happened was apparently I woke up on the ground with like ten Jamaicans standing over me and my friend said that my eyes started wrong in the back of my head they thought I was joking they slapped me in the face and I fell off and like I guess essentially having a mini seizure and since then I haven't taken edible it was the only time I've taken edibles and I just have I mean the ruined edibles for me I'm not doing it man it's crazy we went to bed at 4 p.m. that day it was a complete waste of a spring break danger you", "UcQnm95hO0o": "[Music] hello what's up today I'm going to be doing an edible haul because I just stopped up like crazy but first a DAB or three probably three [Music] this is actually one of my favorite strains it's called the green crack the flower is super good it's a set to you but I think right now it's a whack so you can't see it sorry [Music] [Music] I think I'm gonna do one more because those last few hits sucked okay now I'm ready I just look like that meme have y'all seen yet the cat where they said that's how little kids cough because that's me that's how I cough anyways onto the hall so this is our little goodie bag actually this is a really big goodie bag and then we're actually gonna start on this cuz this didn't fit in the bag it's called give me some mores it is a marshmallow a chocolate-covered marshmallow with graham crackers on it it's by hon ooh there's ten pieces ten milligrams each so 100 milligrams total those are hopefully gonna be good I'm not a big fan of chocolate really or at least THC chocolate just because I feel like with like brownies cookies and chocolate you can taste the weight a lot more and when I eat an edible like of course I want weed in it like THC but I don't want to taste it I want to just be like I'm eating a snack I think that's the point of an edible or maybe not I don't know that's not the point of it but they're better to me when I really just taste like a regular food but then [Music] it's you hard anyways I wanted to try belts for so long I don't eat candy generally but I really love those sour airheads the belts are the strip's whatever the extremes I think is what it's called are having out of it forever but those are my favorite candies and I found these I don't want their sour but these are mango belts there's ten pieces two milligrams each oh they are sour sour ribbon candy and then I got the rainbow belts which hopefully are similar to the extremes lemon strawberry and Apple and these are by Flav I've never had this brand so I'm gonna have to look them up but excited and then I don't know if I mentioned the chips that I got from blue roots cannabis but they were nacho cheese and they were so good they taste a lime Doritos they were better than Doritos and I got him again they had four different flavors BBQ sour cream and onion ranch and nacho cheese and all four they were a 30% off they were only like four dollars I got yeah I got to barbecue these are a potato chip let me read what it says potato chips infused with barbecue seasoning sauce and a Southwestern mix of herbs and spices the nacho cheese ones tortilla chips seasoned with cheddar cheese and a zesty blend of Latin spices and herbs the reason I say that they're better than Doritos is because they have these little spices I don't know exactly because it just says Latin spices maybe it says yes chili pepper paprika and cayenne pepper is probably what makes them taste better like I said in my video about me I like spicy food so maybe that's why I like these more than regular Doritos these are the ranch these are don't eat chips seasoned with a blend of ranch seasoning paprika salt garlic and onion delish I bet these are like Ranch Doritos cuz they look just like it then the last ones are sour cream and onion potato chips with the dollop of sour cream and dusted with savory onion and garlic seasoning these all look pretty good the nacho ones like I said 10 out of 10 I keep talking about them but I can eat those as a regular snack and not know that they have lead in them [Music] they have a little kick whole bag is 10 milligrams so it's sort of a lower dosage because you got to eat like all the chips but they're good then the last atta boy I have in the sugar packets these are by hot sugar which is a fat Panda company fat Panda is pretty known over here they have like edibles flour all of that there are 10 packets 10 milligrams each the guy at the pawnshop said you can put it on peanut butter and jelly and your coffee and your juice really like anything so I'm excited to try these I don't know what I'm gonna use them with but I guess you'll see the retie about all of those edibles is because me and my husband are going to Cape Flattery which is the most northwestern part of the continental USA so that's exciting we have to take a ferry and everything it's going to take us about four or five hours to get there so as you can tell by the title of this video I am going to eat twenty ten milligram edibles I have ten packets of the sugar which I'm going to put in and then I'm going to taste test the other ten edibles that I got in that hole [Music] [Music] I actually just realized I forgot how [Music] [Music] they live [Music] [Music] [Laughter] crack cocaine [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] to collect you [Music] [Music] really excited to try these [Music] [Music] [Music] as I said before I took 20 edibles ten where the THC sugar packets to chips for of the rainbow sour belts two of the mango belts and two of the chocolate marshmallow things my honest opinion on them was that they were really good none of them really tasted like weed so that's a big thumbs up on them on all those brands both of the chips were really good because like I said before I would eat those just as normal snacks definitely recommend those as a lower dosage of edibles to start out with the sour bills were good the main goal lines in the video you probably saw me make a really funny face it has a weird aftertaste but the mango ones do taste like Mexican candy so that's good it might have just been the taste I was in my mouth at the moment but I don't know it was really bad the rainbow ones were good they tasted just like the extremes the chocolate-covered marshmallows were super chocolaty I had to wash my mouth out with a lemonade really good because it was a lot of chocolate which I personally don't like that much but it was pretty good the THC packets I really couldn't taste them I just felt like I was drinking a regular old toasted white chocolate mocha as far as like what I was doing we were in the car for almost five hours so I just played on my phone I played a fun run I talked to my husband I was really sleepy then once we got to Cape Flattery we did the trail which was about two or three miles I really don't remember but it was fine the view was really really pretty [Music]", "LZJbqRUlzRA": "[Music] uh what's up guys welcome back today we're going to do a little experiment with gummy worms and tincture so i just bought some like these are from walmart just walmart brand gummy bears or gummy worms this should work the same for gummy worms gummy bears um anything with this type of gummy texture um so we're gonna do an experiment and we're gonna soak them in tincture i don't know how long it's gonna take i don't know if it's gonna be like a few hours that we're gonna need in there or 24 hours but we're going to see how that's going to turn out all you're going to need is some gummy bears or gummy worms and some alcohol-based tincture [Music] so here i just have some gummy worms like i said they're just the walmart brand i have my tincture and then a little container that we're going to put our gummy worms into now i'll just line up the gummies trying not to overlap them too much and then i'm going to pour my tincture over them just enough tincture to cover them all or at least the most of them and then whatever tincture isn't absorbed you can just pour back into a jar and use it as you would have previously so as you guys just saw i pretty much just pour tincture over these gummy worms i did add one or two more because i was taking a thumbnail for it but that's how they look we're going to leave them uncovered and we're not going to put them in the fridge we're just going to leave them open on the counter and then i am going to check back in when i feel like these are ready so we'll see how long that's going to take and we'll see if they work out hi guys so it's been about 24 hours a little bit under and here is what the gummies look like so they don't look that much different so far but it's kind of hard to tell they might be swollen a little bit um but yeah so i'm just taking these out and i'm gonna set them out to dry and then once they're mostly dry but not completely dry we're going to cover them with some sugar of course that's optional it just because extra sugar is nice and then plus the sugar on the outside will help with that tincture flavor like as soon as your tongue touches the gummy now that they've dried so they're pretty much completely dry except for a little bit of stickiness i'm gonna cover them in sugar so i just have a little container with just plain sugar you can add citric acid if you want but if you use citric acid just please use a small small amount like one quarter teaspoon for like one cup of sugar type of thing because too much citric acid will draw out the moisture and then they'll get wet and they'll never dry so yeah so i'm just shaking those and it's kind of weird how um they're coming out not completely coated in sugar or at least that um orange one did but then this one here is only like parts of it picked up on the sugar so i'm not sure what's going on there um but here is how you want them to be sticky wise so if you put your finger on it it like kind of sticks but you can pull it off pretty easily still and that's a good consistency for it to be when you're adding sugar to it um but yeah so some of these the sugar attached properly and then some of them they didn't and i'll show you guys how we can fix that though it's not exactly the most efficient way but i mean you got to do what you got to do when you're playing around with these things i'm thinking for those spots that aren't filled with sugar i'm just going to use like a regular paintbrush i think this is just from the dollar store whatever it doesn't matter um and then i'm going to dip it into the tincture which i should have got a separate container for my tincture so the sugar wasn't going back and forth but um and then i'm just going to lightly wipe it on the areas of the gummy that didn't get any sugar attached to it and not too much you just want like a light light coat and then i just put it back into the container of sugar and shake it up and then take it out and leave it to dry and it came out very well it was all covered it just would be time consuming to have to do this for each gummy [Music] and i'm going to try one of the gummies that we're soaking so far they don't look like they've soaked up that much like they don't look much bigger than how they looked before so just doing a comparison here the ones on the parchment paper are the ones that were soaking and then this one my hand was not soaking so for size difference it looks like the soaked one may be like a millimeter bigger but i don't i don't know it doesn't really seem like it um and then with this one over here um which one is bigger the soaked one definitely looks bigger for sure but also looks skinnier and the other one looks wider so it's hard to tell i'm not sure if the gummy bears maybe just aren't all consistent or sorry the worms okay and then for this one the one on the bottom there is the not soaked one and it's significantly bigger than the soaked one so that leads me to think that the gummy worms are just kind of have some variance in size and that they didn't look like they've gotten bigger and expanded or absorbed anything so let's let's try and see how it tastes and see if we can taste the tincture you can definitely taste like the strong tincture on it right away i kind of got like weird texture on it it's like from i don't know if it's just the brand of dining rooms that i use but like kinda like slimy i don't like that well i don't not like the gummy worm i just don't like the slime it's kind of like a weird texture so far like but i don't know i feel like that you're i can only taste the tincture on the outside i don't feel like it actually soaked up anything so i'm gonna try it rinsing one off and like washing wiping it down really good with some water so that if the if it is just tincture on the outside then we'll be able to find out because if i rinse off water it should still taste like tincture on the inside right so i'm gonna go do that and i'll be right back and we'll try and see how that tastes okay so here's the gummy i just rinsed very well i taste exactly like the original gummy worm did so it does i have no taste of tincture in it at all which is proving that it didn't soak it up which is really weird because if gummies soak up alcohol to make alcoholic gummies why wouldn't it soak up tincture so i'm very shocked and i'm like wondering if i did something wrong like why didn't they soak it up i wonder if it was the brand should i try this same thing on a variety of different brands of gummies like buy a bunch of different brands of gummy bears and see which one soaks up the most would you guys be interested in me doing a video like that but yeah since um essentially they didn't soak up anything it's kind of a waste so i think a better way to be going about it is to just put some tincture on them like put them in a container and mix it up or something and then set them out to dry a little bit and then cover them with sugar i'll try that and we'll see how that works as well so here we're just gonna place some fresh gummy worms into a jar of tincture then we're just gonna close the lid and shake it up so that they all get covered in the tincture and then we will take them all out with a fork trying to be careful not to waste too much tincture um from holding them from the jar to the drying area so just kind of shake them off a little bit so there's not too much dripping and then just leave them to dry until they're just slightly sticky and depending on how much airflow you have it can take anywhere between 20 minutes to a couple of hours so once they're not wet anymore and they're just a little bit sticky you can put them in sugar you don't have to but it's nice so that you're not having that direct tincture on your tongue so i'm just shaking these up and then i'm gonna put them back out to dry but these were not dry enough when i did this so you guys are gonna see what happens so i could tell immediately as soon as i opened it you see how the sugar is almost like chunky on there i don't know if you can really see it but um so it chunks up in i kind of shook it off there but you can still see it's like the sugar crystals gather together so that's what happens when there's too much moisture and these are not going to dry so yeah they're nice and chunky um even i can try leaving them out but they probably will very likely not dry they'll just keep pulling out moisture so you guys can see this is what the sugar looks like because now it's been contaminated with moisture i guess you could say so you can see it clumped up immediately just from that little bit too much of moisture and i'm gonna get some regular sugar so you guys can see a side by side of what it should look like so there's a regular granulated sugar and then i'm gonna pour the one that had a little bit of moisture in it and you can see those clumps that it's made and how it has a less fine of the texture so just when you're making your gummies make sure that before you put your sugar on they're fully dry because this is a very common thing people their gummies get all like wet and moist and it's because your gummy was too wet when you coated it in the sugar so here's one of the gummies that was coated when it wasn't wet and just only slightly sticky and you can see the sugar looks perfect there's no wetness and it's not clumpy and then if we pull up one of the ones we just did where it was too wet you can see the sugar is starting to pull out the moisture and the whole thing is getting that wet look and i'm just gonna continue to keep doing this um in this case i'm just going to eat them like that because they're not really salvageable because rinsing them off will remove the tincture that we dip them in so you want them to be just sticky like this so they're not wet at all just only a slight stickiness we're not going to use that sugar that's been contaminated with the moisture because it's going to not give us nicer so i'm just dipping these little sticky ones into a dish of fresh sugar and then again leave them out to dry and it'll probably need about 24 hours to fully dry before you package them up overall i think the best method for trying to infuse store-bought candies is using my sour patch method um i'll post a link for it in the description box and i'll try and post one on the video as well um but yeah check this out this is a lot easier they're gonna be a lot stronger it's just an all-around better option the only difference is that you definitely need a candy that already has a sugar coating on it thank you guys so much for watching this video i hope you guys enjoyed it please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe i hope you have a wonderful day", "xFUysDX_TWI": "hey Kenan mommies I'm just checking in I had the other B H oh but I think it's what it's called I can't remember this very moment yeah so no I overlay my favorite it was really really really chewy like it was a hard candy than a soft candy which I mentioned before is not my favorite which if you're into her candy she might be your thing but as some of us mentioned it even look kind of awkward when I was eating it like it was definitely a little big for my liking overall the medicated aspect of it I mean I didn't really get a lot out of it I don't know maybe if her candies are not my way to get medicated it seems that the brownie has been the only thing that's giving me a really good kick yeah I also have a really high tolerance I've noticed so that could be the other reason why but if you ever lower lower tolerance maybe these could be something that you could try and let me know if they work for you because they definitely didn't really work for me whatever reason but I'd love to hear your feedback on it and if someone else had a different experience maybe let me know I don't know very odd it's not even like I was eating a whole bunch before that they would maybe get absorbed I did also mention that I am on my period so that has been known to have a little bit of an effect with females well a lot of effect apparently because apparently we need to smoke a lot more and consume a lot more when it is her time of the month for whatever reason thank you mother nature but yeah overall they were bad I went about get them again no probably not um as I said I'm just all about the soft I just keep saying brownie I really wanted to be a brownie apparently it's the fudge I really really like the fudge so far that has been my favorite but yeah I have a few more things to try so stay tuned and hopefully I'll be able to get some more stuff and keep reviewing I also do have another exciting interview coming up possibly later on early next week I'm in the process of kind of putting together that review because it's a little bit longer and I'm kind of getting that one together but I'm first gonna do an unboxing of it yeah stay tuned and if you have any questions or any concerns or if you aren't sure of words or from it is on the announcements on the kanima means

okay ladies see you", "KEnZsZtKPK8": "[Music] hey everyone I'm showing you something today that I actually wasn't sure that would work out but it worked out perfectly so I thought it would be cool to use a OS capsules to move Jolly Rancher I don't know ring pops you can cover I don't know what you want to call them cos ring pops so I bought a bag of Jolly Ranchers I have four different color cos capsules here so I'm gonna try to make green I guess green apple right there I matched up with the three EOS it will be delicious then we're gonna have watermelon blue raspberry and grape dee-licious so before you do anything you want to make sure you have your capsule ready because once you heat up and I use the microwave your candies it hardens very quickly you want to make sure that you snap it back and then I'll keep in okay and I used five or six candies you can probably get away with five maybe before if that's all you have but for sure it's better to use a little bit more than a little bit less obviously and then I put them in the microwave for 10 seconds at a time you could probably go over 20 the first time if you felt comfortable but just really really watch it because it does melt quite quickly actually maybe a total of 30 to 40 seconds so watch the ball might be hot here we have melted Jolly Rancher green apple flavor carefully carefully carefully pour it into your capsule and again it does hard it quite quickly the stuff in the bowl is already getting sticky it's hardening is you want to make sure you try to go as quick as possible if it does harden you can always microwave again and then put the remainder in your capsule so once you have that put it in the fridge or freezer and you should be good to go so when I went to go make the purple there was only three grapes my package which I tried to make work but it didn't so what I did is I melted the grapes so the three grapes that I had I poured it in and then you'll see that it actually melted two of the cherries because I had about 20 cherries that I wasn't using I guess Jolly Rancher things with everybody likes cherry I don't know so I put two extra cherries on top of the grape and then you'll see that I have to do that for the blue raspberry as well because they only gave me three blue ones so again I use some extra cherries and put them on top [Music] [Music] [Music] okay so I am so happy with how this turned out it's still the perfect POS shape just like hope for [Music] the feature the extra little plastic that came off supposed to be but that's fine just pops right off put it back on the lid and breathe out back here awesome a Jolly Rancher gos repot can you see their face [Music] thanks for coming to watch our video you guys this is super easy and it's really quite dummy at the end of it so I hope you guys can try it please come back to watch more of our videos make sure you subscribe like and share and if you leave a comment or get back to as fast as we can right

got a cure seed oil will open and the sec that's haunt your culture in the cup it's coming in a seventy seven and a half percent THC so we got a camp just spray the mold Nestle Tollhouse the chocolate morsels we have our finalists yeah yeah this is an optional ingredient that last minute anyway you also got like a little pie [Music] kappa chocolate chips [Music] [Music] okay so now puron THC oil [Music] Simon goes next tutorials chocolate chips I'm gonna use about a cup of a cup of chocolate chips 1/2 of a milliliter oh no leader walk around so he's my super super strong super super powerful it was a lot so I wind up doing three quarters of a cup instead of a full cup anyway down [Music] [Music] [Music] oh yeah okay so now [Music] okay so now you're gonna add a little drop on the best thing you could measure me but I would say like I have half a milliliter a half a capful Oh quickest drug that you can do because this stuff is just make sure you don't want no more than that that's the perfect amount stir that in there mix in there first before you put your concentrating in writing down turn down the heat all the way too low make sure we're making this you be patient because you want to make sure you strike you know concentrate in chocolate at the right temperature so it can go into the mold and a perfect temperature so you're concentrating don't it's like they're so careful two minutes okay so now I think this is at the right temperature and we have our concentration different prices different purities [Music] the glass is not everybody is D car now let's say you can you guys can your shadow because just the way you can use wax butter whatever make this stuff we could use rising chips now and don't make the boy yourself with MCT oil but you got to make sure that when you make it you just come decarboxylate whatever type of format [Music] start blowing the molds okay it's filling up there [Music] they see me I don't have patience for this it's easier to pour chocolate into the mold so the chocolate doesn't start stiffening up on I don't know how many chocolates wasn't gonna get starts in the next one we got it like those settle down let's see what we got there it's making more than me expected you really use the rest of this to make sure [Music] [Music] you take this some - off and added something - so this is like the neatest job do you know what made me think that is is because everybody likes camisa so why the gummies was very like such a hick like a big hick when you get this right when you get the edibles right data almost like the best ways [Music] so so cuz I'm out of that big one over there anyone that means we should be the main thing guys is you wanna make sure [Music] even now we still have some leftover chocolate so you scrape that in last one this is how it looks out the freezer so like I told you guys the oil would go away and we definitely needed it things in a condo so let's get our chocolates out face [Music] [Music] hmm goodness gracious its taste so good I would not believe it so all together we got one two three four five six seven eight nine so I got twenty-one chocolates each chocolate is about 70 milligrams

just go on the EMF study or any a very bad scores as well one and Bray wig low and one along my rod if you come to the long run or do you get greeted by a happy small man on the door so thanks very much", "p7h1qlhCdig": "what's up cbd lovers welcome to i love cbd today i'm doing a review on some cbd edibles this baby right here this is um cbd gummies it is by a company called smokies edibles um this flavor is the sour watermelon cbd gummies and this package right here contains 10 servings so each serving is pretty much like a gummy i'll show you what it looks like um here we go this is a a pretty little pinkish radish cube very tasty by the way it tastes really good um each one of these gummies contains 25 milligrams of cbd now this product is not full spectrum this is cbd isolate um cool thing about this product or the things that i like about it um first of all it says on the front it's high clarity hemp extract right here so it's high quality uh it's gluten free it's dairy free it's vegan it has no high fructose corn syrup which is good healthy you don't want to consume anything with high fructose corn syrup because that stuff is bad for you anyways um and for my concern you know i don't consume any gelatin products this does not contain indian gelatin which is rare for gummies and you know that kind of candy so that's something that's a huge plus for me because if i had gelatin i wouldn't have even tried it um ingredients uh it's got sugar corn syrup pectin dextrose citric acid sodium acetate natural artificial flavorings you know some colorings and hemp extract cbd isolate so um this is very good and you know if you're concerned about any allergies or anything this product is manufactured in a facility that uses tree nuts so i always review your ingredients if you have any allergies or if you're worried about this containing anything that you may be allergic to uh but definitely for people that are concerned about uh thc they don't want to test positive for thc or they wanna they don't wanna consume anything with thc in it uh this is what you wanna go with if you're using if you wanna use cbd and not consume any thc so this has no thc in it it says right here it's isolate and each one of those gummies has 25 milligrams now the recommended dosage or the serving size listed on the package is 25 milligrams so that's what i tried out the first time however i believe my tolerance has gone up uh because i've been using some 50 milligram capsules and uh the 25 milligrams gave me like a very mild effect so i wasn't really able to judge it so i decided to take two gummies which would be 50 milligrams today and i tried it out and i definitely felt it um i felt the effects were really good i was very mentally relaxed very physically relaxed i had a little bit of strain and back pain in my lower back my pain wasn't gone but it eased my pain a bit for sure uh helped me with a little bit more mobility and you know i wasn't in pain every time i moved or sat down or got up so i definitely felt the effects uh there was some mood enhancement as well uh kind of gave me a little bit of a lift i was not sleepy at all still still awake uh i took it i think uh probably about four hours ago so i'm not not sleepy but i do feel like if when i do go to sleep i'll probably sleep good tonight and um yeah i like the stuff it tasted good i think it's a clean product um i found it online for 22.99 i will leave you guys a link in the description i'll probably put a link up here on the video somewhere uh make it easy for you if you want to check it out or if you want to try it out you could go to this website which i found and they have some pretty good deals and they have a huge selection of cbd products so i'm gonna start uh referring them uh or referring you guys to them uh in case you wanna try the products or any review that you see a product on and you wanna check it out instead of having a search and look all over the internet for it you could just find an easy link so you could go and try it out if you want to all right uh this is all i got for this one um i think i would have to give this a five stars uh five five-star rating um i think it's a good product um i also like the bag the bag has like a ziploc thing so once you open it it you know one thing i noticed is the bag wasn't sealed like i was looking to see if there was a seal or somewhere you could tear and there's nothing i was just able to open it up but it has a zip lock on it so once you open it up you could you know zip it back up and it will keep the gummies fresh so they don't get stale or dry up inside and become really hard uh so yeah five stars for these smoky edible smokies edibles um i think it's a good product i would definitely try it out especially for people that are not looking for full spectrum or like looking for thc free cbd all right i want to keep this short as possible and that's all i got for this one um i hope you guys find this video helpful or useful and if you like it give it a like if you don't it's okay it's okay it's okay maybe the next one um and if you like cbd like we do subscribe and you will stay updated with

nostalgia my vivo and my gold medal whirlwind so we are going to get started and see how this cotton candy turns out i'm using three different kinds of candy today i'm going to use some peppermints some sugar-free caramels hard candy caramels and some jolly ranchers i really wanted to do some sugar-free for you guys because i get asked a ton if hard candy that is sugar-free can be used in these machines so i'm going to put it in two different machines today to show you that it works and it works well all right so let's get started first i'm going to crush my cotton or my hard candy okay so i've got all of my candies crushed up so we are going to try the sugar-free first because i just know there's so many of you that are super interested in that so i've got my sugar-free caramels i am going to put them first a little bit in the nostalgia to see how they do in there and if you guys are liking this sugar-free cotton candy being made up for sure be sure to like and subscribe the channel so we're just gonna make a mini one today but you guys can see it would the nostalgia i really do prefer to use paper straws instead just to make mini puffs instead i just think it works so much better with the nostalgia to make the mini puffs because of the size of the machine and the output that it gives each time you put sugars in it but you can see that it made really pretty yummy cotton candy it tastes delicious it's sugar free what more could you ask for so that was from the nostalgia i want to show you guys that the sugar free also works in another machine as well so i'm going to throw it into my vivo and as you can see like right away gorgeous sugar-free caramel cotton candy you could definitely do this with any sugar-free hard candy they make sugar-free jolly ranchers now there's so many options in the sugar-free candy world and as you can see it also made beautiful really tasty sugar-free cotton candy so that is our sugar-free all right so i'm going to try some jolly ranchers next i've got my whirlwind up and running as well heating up we're going to try the jolly ranchers first in the vivo and as you can see already gorgeous cotton candy it's like instant i love it oh it smells so good you guys if you love jolly ranchers you have to try this it's pretty tasty stuff smells so so good so i didn't put a ton in there so i'm just going to do a little bit more just to make it a little bit bigger and as you can see again totally instant totally beautiful it smells so good you guys i wish you seriously i wish you could smell it there's not much better than like delicious jolly ranchers turning into delicious cotton candy seriously and i'm just going to take a taste jolly rancher literally on a stick what cup more could you possibly really ask for so fun and it's pretty much instant with the whirlwind as well and you could do this with any color of jolly ranchers any flavor hard candy is just so much fun in the machines i'm so excited that i got to show you guys today how to use hard candy in the cotton candy machine so there you go jolly rancher cotton candy worked beautifully in both my vivo and my gold medal whirlwind and our last candy we're gonna do today is our peppermint heart candy i am going to do it in the nostalgia and i'm going to do it in the vivo both so you guys can see so i'm going to do it first in my nostalgia just grab a cone it smells so yummy i love peppermint you guys if you've worked with me at all and you order our sugar floss you know that peppermint my peppermint sugar floss is my hands down favorite so naturally peppermint hard candy is going to be a win for me as well the nostalgia just makes such a little amount at a time i really do prefer paper straws i know i said it just going to remind you guys paper straws are just they're perfect they fit in the sides of this machine so much better as well so i do highly recommend a little tiny it looks like a little dr seuss creature and i am going to throw some of the peppermint again crushed cotton candy into the vivo so you guys can see that as well it's making gorgeous cotton candy the texture with the hard candy is beautiful it's fluffy it's light each machine does create a little bit of a different texture with the hard candy but they're all really nice and really pretty and this is so delicious peppermint again if you've worked with me you know it's my ultimate favorite so just refreshing and delicious i love it so here is all of our yummy treats we made today again i did sugar-free caramels hard candy i did peppermint hard candy and jolly ranchers i did this was cherry jolly ranchers all turned out delicious we tried different machines everything worked perfectly in all of the machines so get out there go make some delicious cotton candy and whatever machine you have with some yummy hard candy and as always keep it sweet", "5gHdJR6DuXY": "[Music] hey guys it's angie from the squishy monster column and today i'm going to share with y'all something very exciting I don't watch any TV at all but I will make an exception for the Walking Dead and Breaking Bad which is premiering this Sunday and I wanted to have something fun to accompany me instead of Junior Mints or the conventional popcorn I'm going to tap these in my purse and snap on them throughout the night watching this premiere it's going to be shattered blue hard candies so hang out with me and I'll show you exactly how to whip this up these are the only ingredients that you'll need so it's super simple very easy and quick so you'll need some sugar I have some regular granulated sugar and then drip in some corn syrup and if you first spray it with a little bit of cooking spray it'll slip right out just like this and then third and clean after everything is cooked together and bubbly you want to add in a little bit of color and it's not important like with buttercream to use gel because it won't really affect the consistency so you can use your inexpensive blue water color in this instance then you just want to go in there and give it a nice whisk and you're going to add in that blue color in that tin after it's bubbly so just mix it's going to be clumpy it's totally fine and then when it's all mixed together you can add in some chili powder I'm just kidding but you can add in a little bit of salt to kind of balance out the sweetness from the corn syrup and from the sugar so I'm going to pop this in the microwave covered with plastic for about three minutes and different microwave temperatures will vary depending on how strong it is but you can also do this over the stovetop if you like but how easy-peasy is the microwave you just pop it in there so I didn't forget it just taking out my cup at the three minute mark and it'll be a light amber color and you want to be careful and slowly take off the plastic because you're going to discard this one and put a new one on top because you don't want that condensation to kind of beep in there so take that off you don't want to stir and you want to cover it with the new plastic and pop it in there for an extra three minutes and just keep your eye on it because you don't want it to be an overflowing sticky mess so just be near and make sure the vessel that you filled your candy in is large enough to kind of hold it all together this is the part you want to work really fast you want to uncover the plastic and then drip in little drops of your blue color and now you can start be very quick about it this is all and if you want to you can put some flavorings in here at this moment as well and I have some parchment or some soap at standing by because I want to pour it on there and let it harden so be careful because it is hot sugar and just pour it onto your prepared surface look at that how cool looking is that this would be really cool to do with your kids as long as you're watching them after about 15 minutes time cooling in the refrigerator it is now ready to smash into a million shimmering pieces so to get those little pieces you want to shatter them with I'm using a mortar pestle just that part of it or you can use the bottom of a dull knife or really anything you can use a rolling pin and just kind of crack over it but now comes the fun part you can just go in there and smash what you end up with are these blue sparkling sapphire pieces like this and you can put them in little glass pane or little candy bags or whatever you want to serve them in and they're really fun and perfect for breaking bad [Music]", "VY8q0hN6KwA": "so I'm rich are tell on professor faculty member here at the University of Wisconsin huge candy signs so we make some heart candy today this is a mixture of granulated sugar you can see the white stuff here we have corn syrup in here as well and then we have water to help dissolve the sugar we're just gonna dissolve all the sugar and make sure that there are no sugar crystals in here because eventually we're gonna make heart candy which is a sugar glass so we don't want crystals so we've reached the boiling point now and so essentially we're gonna follow the boiling point elevation curve up so in making hard candy we're going to boil up to what's called the hard crack stage where temperatures are on the order of 300 degrees Fahrenheit and water contents are down around 2 or 3 percent so we're now at the 233 degrees fahrenheit range and and this is where we have the thread state and what that means is the viscosity is high higher that high enough that when you pour this into cold water it forms threads as it falls through there but the viscosity is still low enough that those threads dissolve fairly quickly so we're now at about 240 degrees and this is according to the candy thermometer where we find the firm ball state and so we boiled enough water that that when you pour this into when you drop it into cold water it forms a coherent mass that you can take out and form it into a ball that can still be manipulated so it's plastic enough to be malleable but it's still a firm ball I can hold its shape okay and we're at about 298 now and and so I'm going to stop it and take it off the heat so we're now going to take this over to the cold table and pour it out and start the next stage of the process so at this point we've poured it onto the cold table and it's starting to cool you can see that as it cools it becomes more plastic more firm we have some color granules and we'll add those in here some flavor so we're gonna add a little bit of lemon flavoring to this and then we're gonna add a little bit of acid as well so right now we're in the stage where it's becoming a plastic mass and we're just trying to get it into a shape that it will go through the rollers it still has enough heat in it and the viscosity is low enough that it starts to flow so far to form it now it would form but then it would quickly deform just like it's doing here so this is just about at the point where where we can form it it's viscous enough that it's not flowing very quickly yet it's still plastic if it enough that we're going to be able to get it through the the rollers and and turn it into a nice candy [Music] so as you can see we're sending this plastic mass through these drop rollers they fill into the shapes and make the drop shaped candy so now our lemon drops have solidified enough to reach room temperature where now they're in the form of a sugar glass so this is just like window glass except it's made of sugar molecules not of silica but now because it's in a sugar glass I can drop this onto the tray and it's going to shatter it'll shatter along the webbing here or leaving behind some intact lemon drops so at this point we have lemon drops but they have all these sharp edges on them still so the next step in the process would be to put them into some kind of tumbling drum to smooth out the edges [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "lC7spjFs2RY": "hey Pennsylvania patience it's me Medical Mary and we're gonna have an RS snow day the first thing that you have to do is learn how to open one of these packages so there's usually place right up here where you squeeze it and boom there it is microscope packaging is a little different so when this is closed you have to pinch it and then squeeze it open so a lot of the irises are a little thicker and you don't want to break the packaging so I soaked them in a cup of hot water for about two minutes the Terrapin click cartridges can be a little tricky to open you have to pinch and pull and it's real easy because you just dial it up to pull it anything out so what do we put that stuff in a lot of people bake with it but I have a little trick package of starbursts take them flatten it out kind of like this you take the RSO you click out the amount that you want and you just put it on there and roll it up in a ball the Crisco dispensers are a little easier to use but harder to dose see you twist and pull on this and with the plunger you have to push out but not too much make sure you put the dose right in there put that right back on there and then that you have your starburst you roll that up into a ball and there's your nose from the road so that's my little trick on how to make one day with 2dos fine doses to carry with you why did the cattle keep coming back to the marijuana fields it was calling the cattle back that's my easy trick to make as many doses of RSO as you want and why did the cattle keep coming back to the marijuana fields it was the pot calling the cattle back you", "p6oKnG_sEwc": "[Music] hi welcome to diamond delight edibles my name is Liz if this is the first time you stopped by and for the rest of you guys welcome back thank you so much so somebody asked me a few weeks ago if I could do nerds ropes and to be perfectly honest had no idea what those work so I googled those little puppies and found out that they're a gummy candy covered in nerds who sew off my kitchen I went a little experimented little tickety-boo and look at what up I can make your it's ropes so I am going to bring this recipe to you so without any more in further babbling here let's jump right into those ingredients what we're going to need and then let's get these guys made alright so the ingredients that we're gonna need for our nerd candies so this recipe is basically my W candy recipe with the cooked syrup and the reason that we're using the Kochs syrup is is going to help with those candies to stick better than just using the gelatin one so with that set you're gonna need about three or four boxes of the large nerds or about seven or eight of those small ones that are the two flavored ones you're gonna want one to two boxes of cornstarch and don't worry you can reuse it we just sift it up and you can reuse it over and over and it doesn't go bad so not a problem plus it's not expensive you're going to want two boxes of the small gelatin the three amps or the 85 grams two of those want three tablespoons of unflavored gelatin or three or three packages of the Knox a quarter teaspoon of kaurav cannabutter and we're going to melt this 1/2 a cup of either kanna syrup corn syrup or you can use inverted syrup if you don't like invert sugar if you don't like corn syrup and we're going to split that quarter in our gelatin part quarter in our candy syrup we're going to need 1/2 a cup of we're going to need 1/2 a cup of liquid so I like to use the kool-aid jammers or the kool-aid waters ones because it gives it extra flavor than just using water and it's pretty much like using water so you don't have to worry about things going bad so these are great to use so I'm going to use use a half a cup of this to bloom our gelatin and a half a cup for our mixture then for additional flavoring I know I feel I know these could be a little bit difficult to get is I use two tablespoons of drink crystals so I get these at the bulk barn Jurek from spring onwards they have me during spring in the summer during the winter they don't carry them or other box stores the stores may carry them otherwise you can just use the Lorena's oils if you want to add some additional flavoring but it's not really required because of all the nerds on it so it's not that big of a deal and that's everything that we need for the gelatin part for our cooked syrup we need 1 K 1 cup of sugar and again if you've got candace sugar you can divide that up a quarter cup of can of sugar to three quarters of a cup of regular sugar as long as you equal one cup of sugar it doesn't matter a quarter cup of water and a quarter cup of our corn syrup and or kit canister that's it for our syrup oops sorry and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid goes into our cooked syrup as well then for the glue that they that they used to stick on top technically they're nerds the Nerds use confection confectioners glaze unfortunately being in Canada wasn't the easiest for me to get but an alternative for an edible glue and glaze is to use tylose tylose powder and water so I'm going to show you how to do that and this is what you're going to need to this stuff a day before but it's super easy it just happens that time to do whatever it needs to do but it works great if you can't get the confectioner's late and for and then to make our clear to make our edible glue we're also going to need one cup of water that is all the ingredients that we are going to need let's get into that equipment there so there's a little bit of equipment this time so let's get into that equipment and then let's get these made alright so the equipment that we're going to need is a double boiler if you don't have a quote double boiler you can always just use a metal bowl that will fit securely into the pot and has enough room on the bottom for water without touching you're gonna need another small or saucepan a small medium saucepan for our syrup point you need a candy thermometer digital or the one that you hang on doesn't matter a couple of spatulas gonna need you're gonna need a pastry brush and I'm gonna use a funnel for putting it into our molds you can get these candy funnels or if your pot has the little specks on it and that will work as well or you can always put it into a measuring cup or something with a spout anything to make it easier to pour cause we gotta pour into some skinny guys offset spatula is something to be able to smooth out our corn starch and you're going to want to get some dowels so I got these at the dollar store in the craft section they're 12-inch by just slightly under a half inch size dowel so you want about half inch sized dowel by about 12 inches as I said dollar store craft stores usually how these pre-cut like so otherwise you cannot just buy one of those read it on once and cut up your own so we need basically one if you can is many has many dowels as you want to make ropes now this recipe probably makes around 10 to 12 I'm only going to do part of that today and the rest of the stuff I'm just gonna make regular gummies and I'll explain why when we get to making them all so if you want a bunch of those dowels a cookie sheet or doing them on and you want to line it with parchment paper another pan that we can use to press down the cornstarch with or something flat that's that's kind of heavy a drying rack and then another pan or something that you can use and we're going to put Phillip put the skittles in to cover them up later on once we get the glue on them so it makes it easy if you've got some kind of pan like that so basically all our equipment you know me I always forget something but let's jump right in and let's get these made so if you go and I'm using the tylose powder as your glues your edible glue what you're going to want to do is to bring one cup of water to a boil once it's come to a boil turn the heat off and then we're going to add in three-quarters of a teaspoon into into our boil water you're gonna whisk that around and you're gonna see it's gonna lump up and it's not all gonna dissolve it takes about 15 to 20 minutes for it to fully dissolve all right so my water's come to a boil I'm going to turn off the heat gonna remove that oh remember that thing that I always tell you I forget yeah it was the whisk one whit so we're gonna add in three-quarters of a teaspoon these are quarter teaspoons you want to kind of story sprinkle it around like so and then you're gonna whisk it and it's gonna stay lumpy a little bluffing like that for a while and every couple every two three minutes you're gonna come back and whisk it around and you'll notice every time you come back more and more will be dissolved and as I said it takes about 15-20 minutes for it to fully dissolve once it has you're going to put it into the refrigerator sorry you're gonna let it cool first then put it into the refrigerator overnight and the next day you're good to go and it lasts for up to six months so you can use this over and over not as well as for your any other projects edible food products projects that you have that you need glue fork so I'm just gonna continue to do that to stir that I'll show you once it is clear and next we're gonna make up our starch molds alright so here's my tylose my edible glue all clear now and dissolved so just gonna pour it into a jar and once that's cool I'm gonna cover that up put it in the fridge overnight alright so now we're gonna make our starch folds and starch molds are what they use in candy manufacturing so there's not a whole bunch of people on the line pop and they've silicone molds they use these huge place with corn starch they stamp in the pattern fill up the molds once they set the plate opens all the candies fall in Iraq all the corn starch falls to the bottom and they reuse it so we're going to make our own makeshift version at home so as I said you need about one to two boxes depending how large betray your you see because you do want it almost look for sickness of your cookie sheet whatever lip on that so carefully pour it into your pan and you want to do it on parchment paper because it's going to make it a lot easier when you need to put this back into the box as well as to get it thin too sifting and again you want to be very careful otherwise it's going to look like Scarface's come through your kitchen this stuff it gets messy again you want to carefully move it an offset spatula works really well so that you can move it and spread it out around your pan evenly so I'm just moving it around here so that is all trying to get it relatively all even so that our moles will all be about the same size and you want to have enough room as I said to be able to make them a little bit deeper there and you don't want to be going all the way to the bottom so once you've got it relatively smooth out gonna Mimi and stuff everywhere so what we want to do is to take another little piece of parchment paper and you want it to be able to fit over top doesn't all stick to our pan place it down on top and then use your pan to press down don't press down too firmly but a little bit just to get that compressed and the parchment will stop of the cornstarch from sticking to the bottom of your pan in defeating the purpose of trying to make a flat surface carefully pick this up so we're good like that there so now you want to take your dowels and that's why I said you want to try and have as many as you as you were going to make because your we're gonna press it down so you take the one with a your dowel and you press one down and rock it back and forth so that it makes a little bit of a wider crevice here or so it makes a little wider it up a little bit wider of a trench and then just leave it and then use your next one just go over a little bit button in half an inch or an inch and again you're gonna do the same thing gently press and work it down so the reason you say you want to use multiple dowels is if I go and I take this out if I took it out and push the next one in it pushes some of the cornstarch into the one that we just made so the multiple dowels will help you from avoiding that problem so I'm just gonna pull the camera in over top here so you can actually see it up close all right so it's that you just go over a little bit here from the other one about an inch is good and just gently roll it into place now if you don't have as many inch you're going to like you can see like I'd oh I'm now gonna take my first one so grab it from end to end with your fingers like so so that you don't interrupt your Bowl and now I can move that one there without interrupting that one and then the same thing carefully take this one and here how're we gonna get one of our box the Nerds I've just put them into a bowl or something for you to make it easy we're gonna fill up our little trenches here with our nerd on here a bowl here no jar from a bowl today and just grab some with your fingers and gently drop them fill out the trench chair you just gonna drop them along the bottom don't fully fill it up we just want to line the bottom of it and then anywhere where there's naked spots that we miss don't worry cuz we're gonna glue glue bunch on afterwards so going along do that my trenches removing the dowels grab them use your fingertips in the end to gently pull them up then once you're done filling up your molds there with nerds you're going to carefully place the tray into your freezer so we're gonna make our mold nice and cold nice and cold so when we drop our candy syrup it's gonna start to solidify and grab onto those candies really quickly but you want to be very very gentle because it'll fall easily and yeah you don't want to do this all over again so first case scenario you make a mess him if you have to redo it just to sift out your cornstarch and your nerds and just redo the process so the first thing that we want to do is bloom our gelatin so I've got 1/2 cup of and this has got to be cold but liquid needs to be called 1/2 cup of our I use the kool-aid jammer and then you're gonna sprinkle evenly on your gelatin all over the top and this is to prevent clumping and then you want to mix it in until it's all dissolved and while you're mixing it'll start to bloom and it should call right automatically kind of go to the texture of applesauce if it doesn't your gelatin is not is not very good it's lost its Jo so you don't want to add a little more or get new stuff so we're just gonna set that off the side until we need it God needs about five at least five ten minutes to bloom so the next step is going to be our gelatin side that we're gonna do you're gonna turn your heat on to medium low you're gonna boil a half a cup of your liquid so I used a half a cup of the cooling water pour that in and you're gonna stir to dissolve your jello and then just note for your double boiler don't forget to put your water in and also you your water should never touch the bottom of your pot so I said you just gonna stir this up until that just starts to dissolve and if you're using flavor drink crystals I this is where all added in as well so it can dissolve at the same time I add about two tablespoons as I said if not you can use the Lorraine's oil and you add that more at the end so we just stir this until it's all dissolved until it until it starts to dissolve then I'm gonna add in our corn syrup and our citric acid now that my syrup is mostly the sugars not have mostly melted I'm gonna add in 1/4 cup of my can of syrup or as I said you can use corn syrup or inverted sugar and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid and the citric acid and the syrup they are both for preventing crystallization well the can of syrups add a little extra but regularly corn syrup or the inverted sugar is to help prevent crystallization so again I'm gonna mix that stir that well until it's all combined and everything's melted together in the meantime make sure your can of butter is melted and you're going to get your hand blender ready to so we're gonna need that shortly and you're gorg um so now that our syrup our gelatin and that everything's dissolved now it's time to add in our can of butter and our corn gum so you're gonna take your melted can of butter throw her in mix that around just a little bit then we're going to use each ordered teaspoon of fargo and you're going to spread gently sprinkle it try and do sprinkle it evenly over the top please let it sit for just a moment get your hand blender and we're going to blender up [Music] so you're gonna let that blend that up for about probably about two minutes you want to make sure it's something it's a really wild ball supply then once you're done just let it sit for a couple of minutes for about a minute or two and see if any oil comes to the top raises to the surface and you'll be able to tell that the air the bubbles will start to dissipate and if there's any oil if it's not fully emulsified the oil will come up to the top and you will notice kind of little oil slicks if you do see any kind of little oil slicks just add a little bit more Gorica no more than about an eighth of a teaspoon and re blended with the hand blender until that's gone so you should have one uniform texture and then just turn off the heat on your gelatin mixture here there is enough warm water in in your pot here to keep your mixture liquefied now on to the candy side the candy syrup side so for our cooked syrup you're going to add in your one cup of sugar or I said or your mixture of sugar and can of sugar get add in a quarter cup of our can of syrup or corn syrup as I said use that inverted sugar and our quarter cup of water and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid mix those together and you can turn your heat on to high heat so you're just going to continue to mix stir this until it begins to boil once it starts to boil you're gonna stop stirring that and we're gonna cook it till two hundred and eighty degrees so now that it started boiling just do it's just start it just around the sides here I'm gonna stop stirring at this point and then I'm just gonna check my temperatures every once in a while till we hit two hundred and eighty degrees so I'm gonna need to check it right now because obviously we're not going to be there I'm gonna let it boil for a couple of minutes and then I'll check its temperature so I start my syrup has been boiling for a couple of minutes so I just want to see where it's sitting right now because we only use a quarter cup of water and we're cooking a high temperature it will get to the 280 very quickly so already at 270 almost there just after 2-3 minutes 280 once it hits your temperature pull it off and allow it to cool for until it hits about 240 so why I like to set it on a stone on natural stone like granite or any natural stone it helps to pull the heat out thicker or if you've got a trivet that helps as well so said just let that sit until it hits 240 all right so my temperature my syrup now is at the correct temperature it's down below just below 240 so now I'm going to and the reason you want to do that is if it's higher it's going to break your gelatin so we don't want to do that so now we are going to pour our gelatin syrup into our candy syrup if that well mixed well together and if you found that your candy syrup has solidified on the bottom or along the sides you can put it on to low heat just to melt that so you're just going to mix this for about a minute or two till they're both combined and make sure to get right on the sides it does like to harden up there see and once everything is all nice together and all melted well together we're going to treat our unflavored gelatin and I recommend kind of break it up into smaller pieces if you can plop her in there see this way again your syrup is not going to be too hot to break your gelatin and this way we get the gelatin all through everything kind of binds there both of those together so you're just going to gently stir that until the gelatin is completely melted so now here's a way that you can kind of give a kind of little pretest to know if your syrup is going to gel up well because on gummies were okay because we can always read about those but these a little harder having all the Nerds stuck to them so we want to get it right the first time just take your syrup take your spoon and allow it to drip off if it starts to solidify in midstream like it'll start to solidify and gel right up while it's dripping you're good to go if it continues to drip like mine is it's going to need more gelatin so what I'm going to do to make sure that that's going to work is I'm going to add another tablespoon of blooms gelatin so I'm just going to go bloom another tablespoon of gelatin in a quarter cup of liquid let that bloom and then add that in and that will take care of that problem there all right so I added one tablespoon of unflavored gelatin to a quarter cup of my cooling water and I bloom that for about five minutes and added it in and now you can see how much it's thicker and how it'll start to solidify find a mid stream and it'll it'll hold there that's how you should that's a kind of a quick test for you to be able to see if it's going to gel up correctly in your moles before you actually cast them so now we wait to pour it into my little funnel here well shoot and then just line up with your trench and you're just gonna fill up the trench I have to say this funnel makes it really really easy well I needs you then try to free pour it let's go just go along you fill up all your little trenches little cavities and then you take your Nerds actually found it's easier to pour and break from the box so don't bother putting them in a bowl it's just easier to pour them from the box just take off a little lip there so it doesn't get your way and just kind of squeeze it together so you have a little bit of control it'll all come flying out and then you just fill up the box alone and you just want to be gentle with it go easy because otherwise they'll come flying out and don't worry about all the excess that goes off into the cornstarch there we're gonna sift the cornstarch when we're done and we'll be able to retrieve all those I just give it a very very gentle pat you don't look like literally just feather touch it down there you go so we've got our ropes like that so you're gonna put them into the fridge for them to set up anywhere from about a half hour to two hours it can take for your gelatin to set now that our candies have set you're just gonna take them out of the starch mold here and just lay them on to a harsh line drying rack parchment paper drying rack and you're gonna set those out to dry overnight and I'm putting the start my topside is good with the amount of candies and stuff that are on it so I'm gonna I lay them with the starch side up and that's the main side that I'm gonna add any additional candies to that they need you the sec so I'm gonna let those set stay out overnight for them to dry before we apply our glaze all right so now why are candies for setting so you don't want to waste all that cornstarch and all those nerds that are stuck in there so you grab your um your corn starts with your parchment paper inches pull it up like so take a strainer take a strainer and pour it in a little neater than that and you're gonna slip your parchment paper paper back underneath and sift it back onto the parchment once you got all that all the cornstarch sifted through just drop your candies off into a hole here and then you can get your cornstarch box add your parchment again or back in the box and you're cute most of it and once your candies are dry take them off and just slip your parchment paper underneath it's just gonna catch the excess gonna catch the excess glaze so I've done this recipe a couple times using the tylose so I would recommend out of the two I would recommend going with the glaze and the reason is the tylose because we use water it makes them very well make sure candies very wet it does dry completely and that's not a problem but they are very wet they're very sly mean it makes them difficult to kind of work with and sticking the extra candies on so I think the glaze would be a lot better this you can definitely use if you can't get the glaze but I think they set the glaze would be better so a little bit so what you can do is you're going to grab your pastry brush dip her in and just kind of take off a bit of that access and you're going to go along and you're gonna dab it on your candies on your rope and you want to dab it you don't really want to brush because it will take the color off of the nerves their wallet water soluble so I think again using the glaze would help that with that issue once you get it get it blazed on you can fill in the little spots that are miss then just gently put them on and don't try and bustle it too much because I said it'll just kind of slip and slide off but just leave them like so and again we're just gonna dab that on and you don't get one they're wet you don't want to move them because if your ropes can fall apart they can break apart so but I said once they're dry they're really they're good so I know before I said okay we could use a pan to roll them in I found that method didn't work so well because I said after one or two it gets really wet and it makes it difficult to roll in so I found just pouring the freight from the box but is not the best method once you're happy with that that me and again you're gonna let those dry probably about 12 hours to overnight once they're dry they're good to go do not store your candies in ziplock baggies if it's especially for gummies it's not good you either want to store them in glass jars or in cell bags or the miler Ziploc bags those work really well so instead I'm gonna let those puppies dry overnight and I'll show you the finished product and here's our finished product so check them out look I hope they look just like the real things as I said we don't have live here so I don't hundred percent sure but looks like it from the pictures it looks like a lot of fun alright guys so I hope you enjoyed that recipe if you have any other questions or comments please don't hesitate to put them you know where and thank you so much for joining me today you have an awesome rest of your day [Music]", "vlLo3VBV9X8": "hi everybody and welcome to Baker madness I'm chef Scott and this is a cannabis friendly cooking and baking show where we sometimes cook things and sometimes we no but at least once a week I eat some edibles from one of our Washington state dispensaries something that I wouldn't make in the house something that's probably more industrial then I might have the tools to do so we're gonna get started right away with today's friendly panda candies by hot sugar hot sugar is a subsidiary company of the fact and a company you need to go to their website fat Panda there that's fun I've already eaten a few of these these are our Panda candies these are the caramel apple flavor they have a bunch of flavors many many many not for kids this is THC infused tetrahydrocannabinol okay I'm not sure what the regulation is because this is a really new package as a matter of fact this package that you see is a redesign of the package WIC in the past I don't know six months but this is a new look whichever I like it's really aggressive in there I like that but this package doesn't have any of the nutritional values of anything whereas some of the other ones really do they have act it looks like you bought it at the grocery store it's got all the nutrition and the sodium and the all the stuff so I'm not really sure it must be a voluntary kind of a thing I wish cannabis companies are you listening please put the nutritional values on your products you see these words how tiny can you see the tiniest words ever so I wrote them down over here so he's sharing with you easier I'm gonna read some stuff here and you'll be able to tell from my face how I feel about any of it okay the following pesticides have been used to grow the cannabis that helped create this product Newcomb botan Agard max safer brand three-in-one liquid sulfur Zehra tall regalia PTO gannett role and as a guard which I think sounds like a place that Thor lives as a guard as a guard anyway that's one two three four five six seven eight different pesticides used on the cannabis on the flower the stem portion that's a lot of pesticides in Washington State you have to declare what pesticides are used if any so we have some other companies that we use a lot of flour from that are organic the cannabis was extracted using a proprietary blend of hydrocarbons winterized with ethanol and then molecularly distilled leaving no residual solvents I don't know what any of those words mean but it is forcing me to believe it sweetie okay all of these words are printed on that little half inch tall paragraph okay this is not necessary here are your ingredients today isomalt we're gonna talk about that in a minute pure cane sugar corn syrup vanilla beans cannabis can't can't cannabis oil propyl paraben artificial flavor with the brown color which is six colors like a [ __ ] Crayola box okay corn starch vegetable gum citric acid sodium benzoate potassium sorbate potassium sorbet really caramel flavor and a natto and a natto is just like a it's a vegetable color it's no problem isomalt let's talk about that that's the number one ingredient in this product isomalt is a sugar alcohol and if you're not a baker if you don't work in the food industry you may not know what it is if you go to Vegas or you go to some fancy place and they have those big gorgeous sugar sculptures and it's just tall and beautiful and sculptural and architectural that's made with isomalt sugar real sugar your table sugar that you guys are using right now is known as hydro scopic that means it pulls all of the water near it to it that's why if you leave should sometimes it'll get all mushy especially you live in Florida it'll get all I mean you can you know I mean I so melt on the other hand is not so in the pebbles candies they use pure sugar and corn syrup and those candies as they melt in your mouth they become pliable and kind of bendy isomalt does not these candies do not ever become bendy they get smaller smaller smaller smaller until I usually get bored with them and crunch them to death which is probably terrible for my teeth but I do it anyway because I have no control isomalt is really low on the glycemic index that means that it does not trigger an insulin response so it is not as sweet as real sugar but you can use it like real sugar it is granulated and it melts like sugar it acts exactly like sugar it is not hydroscopic so it's very firm that's why they use it you know to make stuff there is a national prohibition on cannabis so companies that operate in Washington state that also want to operate in other states or want to have their product in other states have to open separate companies separate facilities separate grow houses all separate if they want to for example fat Panda is the company that it originated here and it is also you can get it in count in Canada they have fat panda in Canada as well and here and I guess just recently in California what I but it's coming soon to Oregon Michigan Ohio West Virginia Florida Arizona Nevada and more to come caramel apple delicious first of all you get a sticker whose love a sticker [Music] all right I got this is what they look like this is ten milligrams of THC this is a caramel apple caramel apple flavor I like these because they're stupid packages really weak it's supposed to be childproof but clamp doesn't seem like it yeah [Music] but the flavor you guys super flavorful also the distillate that they're using is really front like I can really I can feel it on my tongue yeah it's really good hmm yeah yummy that was really nice okay I promise to set this one okay I promise chimera Lamia I will zoom it [ __ ] [Music] so the Panda can be worked I already know worked I didn't worked but it really works good so let's do a little let's do a little test now let's see I'm gonna mix these up these are some of my tarot cards I will do a little tarot card reading for you right now mmm tarot cards so special so maybe tippy do so magical oh so controversial pick a card any card to pick a card one pick it for you let's talk about this dope shall we oh my god yeah so these Panda candies I don't know what they're using how it works this the strength of the stuff if you call a few episodes ago I told you it's 10 milligrams per candy but they don't tell you what strain they've used or how strong that strain is so 10 milligrams of one kind of weed can be really much stronger than 10 milligrams of another kind of weed seriously the way they make these I feel them almost immediately this is one of the only candies is one of the few candies that really just I seriously I feel it within 30 minutes two or three of these are some kind of strong ass [ __ ] okay so on my scale let's give him four tastes an eight I'm gonna give him a 7 they have you can really taste the distillate and I mean the caramel apple flavor is good but you can still really it gets overpowered so a7 what I say think of it 7 and for efficacy a 9 and for price an 8 they were good plus no my Wizards discount love that ok so we've picked a card you picked a card - Jeff you picked a card this would be 10 of cups the 10 of cups now if you don't follow Tarot this is a great card oh gosh so family unit everybody's happy they got everything they need often the distance is their house it symbolizes family and stability and the river of emotions flowing through the promise from the divine through the the rainbow everything's gonna be fine so hold tight you guys find the people you love if you're not close to call them and it's gonna be fine we'll be fine see you next time on Baker madness [Music]", "RYA1Mg_bUpg": "welcome to baking with saucy treats let's get to it [Music] before this video start let's hit that thumbs up and I'll get to subscribe okay just a few things you need before you get started for Court hi a couple of measuring cups what is phone another those phone the start temperate candy molds if you get the clear plastic the high candy will melt straight through so make sure it's this type of plastic I'll select they're two different types of loads parchment paper good for easy clean ups today I'll be making green apple infused candy so I chose Amsterdam apple liqueur then you'll need grain full color actually this is the gel type some people use a liquid depends on whatever works best for you okay then you'll need your apple flavor II this is by lorry and oils this kind is very strong so only a couple of drops you'll need then you have your candy thermometer it actually tells you on the side here which degree you need to have it at for like soft crack hard crack hard ball fudge chocolate sauces and also you need your corn syrup sugar powdered sugar this is good to coat the candy whistling don't stick [Applause] another measuring cup good support a hot candy in if you don't want to use one of the other ones then you also have a choice of this temper little cork up thing you can see that so you afford your high candy into here and it's temper so that it could be happy as you want it so you need 2 cups of sugar - two cups of sugar 2/3 of hornacek 3/4 of water ok so now you have your water and your sugar now you want to add your coarser 2/3 and just to get the rest of it out you want to use like a spatula or something just some tires of your car insert after this step your turn your stove on to medium high stir until the sugar is actually dissolved and I'll show you that in the next step okay so now you have your corn sir the water and your sugar you want to

thanks for watching and making the saucy treats please subscribe and hit that thumbs up", "H_vVwcXn3Q0": "oh what's up easy bakers so today i'm going to be showing you guys how to make your own diy infused nerd ropes so if you haven't already follow me on instagram at daverny freeman i will be doing some giveaways so you want to follow me on instagram that's where i announce all of my giveaways and if you want to be a young young young young guy go ahead and hit that subscribe button and the notification bell so let's jump into the video so this is everything you're going to need you're going to need some heavy duty aluminum foil it doesn't really have to be that heavy duty you can go get the 99 cent one whatever fits your grip baby so i'm gonna use some aluminum foil and with my aluminum foil i'm just gonna place them on a flat uh surface and you you will be putting this inside the refrigerator so boom pow now what i'm going to do is i like to create my own little mold i don't know if you guys want to go on amazon to see if they have these molds but i know a lot of people were saying they could not find any nerve rope mold so you really have to do them by hand so this is what i'm doing now i'm just making my own little molds which is just popping the aluminum foil up a little bit so it can have this barrier in between the two i'm doing that on each side so that's what i'll be doing right now [Music] and you guys do want to be careful when you're making your little liners because this is aluminum foil and it's easy to kind of tear through them [Music] so you guys i prefer to reuse these package this the packaging that comes with it so i ain't i'm not gonna buy normal packaging y'all don't play with me we're just gonna reuse these packaging what you do is you take where it's sealed all at either end of the rope and you kind of open it up like you will a bag of chips it's very easy to tear so you do want to take your time to open up the seal and once you open it up there should be a like a little cardboard against against the seal and you put your fingers in between the cardboard and the foil and you gently slide your fingers down in order to tear the packaging apart so that's what i do i do that then i set it aside and i take some nerds now this i do this all the time so i have additional nerve ropes and nerves in there and i like to take the nerves off of the rope which is very easy um so i don't have to buy a thousand boxes of nerve ropes yeah i mean i'm nerves when i could just use this now that you have separated your gummies from the nerves you're going to place them in a heat safe microwave safe bowl and place them in a small one i do recommend doing small batches at a time because if you do so many it's going to be kind of hard to control it so now you want to take your infused coconut oil i like to use liquid coconut oil instead of the coconut oil that goes back to solid and you want to use your tincture i'm using my eva clear tincture that i already infused with your cbd and they're going additional box of nurse just in case i need them but i don't feel like i will it's just whatever floats my boat and you also want to get yourself some type of piping bag or you can get a a condiment um container i think a ziploc bag is cheaper well not really cheaper but it's it works for me and i do reuse these so it's not like i throw them away because i know i hate plastic now i'm taking my coconut oil and i'm just coating this ziploc bag with the coconut oil if you do not want to use your infused coconut oil you can definitely use pam to coat this bat this ziploc bag but i'm saying if you're going to infuse something why not have everything be infused you get what i'm saying you're going to share but yeah so i'm going to do that and i'm also gonna do the same thing to my aluminum layers that i made my little molds because if you do not it will stick i don't care what anyone says in my i've been making these for forever in a day and they will stick if you put them in the freezer you put them in the refrigerator you will have pieces of aluminum stuck to your gummy now you looking at like a food like you're in third grade with goat with with aluminum foil in your mouth like it goes so yeah that's what you want to do just make sure everything is evenly coated then move on to the next step [Music] all right you guys so to my two rope gummies and six additional gummy bears i add half a tablespoon of infused coconut oil just to give you guys some type of starting point but this is definitely a trial and error type of situation so as you guys i have my tincture right here and i'm going to use five milliliters which is a teaspoon of t-shirt and i'm placing it to the side in a condiment disposable condiment container because i wanted to be you know on hand and you guys also saw that i had my liquid lecithin next to me just in case i'm going to need that as well so you want to take your rubber spatula or you can use anything that you're going to throw away i like to use this silicone rubber spatula because i could just wash it off and reuse it now i'm making sure that everything is evenly coated and i'm going to put this in a microwave for 10 seconds and it's going to look like this now i'm just stirring this around to make sure that my oil and gummies are combining together i microwave it again bring it back out stir it around and as you guys can see a little bit you see how they're the gummies in the oil is not coming together so what i'm doing is just trying to stir it a little faster and a little harder just putting a little bit of elbow grease into it to see if it's going to combine together and once it does as much as i would like for it to at this point i'm going to add my tincture to this i only add a half of the teaspoon into this at this time because you can always add more you really can't take it away so that's why it's super important to do this in small batches so you won't gotta worry about anything but as you guys can see the oil really did combine well with this so now i'm going to go ahead and add that t-shirt and do the same steps stir it around kind of be careful because it will splat it out okay y'all see what i'm saying i told y'all it'll splat out and that's nothing but my tincture splatting out honey that's why i'm like uh um let me let me try to put you back on in there girl then i'm stirring it around again just just to make sure that it is fully incorporated because if you do not do this you will have it will be set like oil and vinegar separate yeah this that's exactly what this will be baby your gummies will be to the right and your tincture will be to the left so you want to definitely make sure that it's fully incorporated microwave it again then you're going to place it in your ziploc bag or your piping bag remember this ziploc bag is already all uh down so i'm trying to give you guys a good angle but this is hot girl i'm like oh i'm about to stop the camera this is hot so you want to go ahead and pour that into there i use i try to use my rubber spatula to get the rest of it out but do what you can because it will kind of become you know it'll cool down a little fast so you will be working very quickly boo boo so once you get that together you're going to just whatever side you're going to cut it out you're going to cut it away from your workspace okay i cut it on the ground so you're going to cut it away from your workspace line a little bit of nerves just a little bit unless you want it real thick to the bottom of this pan and we're going to pipe on our gummies [Music] [Music] so you guys i am starting off with a thin layer i like to use at least when it when i like to make beans nerd robes i'm showing you guys how to make one and a half so with the measurements and things that i will put in the description box to my preference it makes one long nerd rope and kind of like um a quarter of one as well so what i'm doing now is i'm just going ahead and piping out my gummies and once i get done piping out the gummies i'm gonna take some additional nerd rope and sprinkle them on top of the gummies so they can have gummies on both sides i um really do this as a preference when it comes to how many nerds i'm actually putting on the rope so like i said this is really trial and error for some people you guys gonna have to figure out what what you like and what works best for you [Music] so all of those nerd roasts that you put on the side or if you're using a new box you're just going to go ahead and sprinkle as many nerves on this as you want to help you out you kind of want to make sure that all of the gummy is covered and go to your next step [Music] so [Music] all right so now you want to just go ahead and put your nerd roads in the refrigerator for several hours and once they harden up you're going to come back to them [Music] all right so now that it's been several hours i'm going to get my packaging my flat irons i don't use them on my head but i should use them for this okay and i get my nerd rose as you guys can see that it was covered up so you don't have to worry about anything getting on them [Music] now this is why it's super important to spray down that aluminum foil you guys see how easy they're coming out of here i'm definitely being gentle because i don't feel like anything cracking breaking or anything like that or in between boo-boos so you see how easy they're coming out but i'm just plopping them out ever so gently and now once i plop them out i'm going to put them on the cardboard that every nerd rope come with and i'm just going to place it on there and we're going to go ahead and package them so that's just what i like to do [Music] so now what we're going to do is i put them on my cardboard liners i'm going to flip them over so that the cardboard is facing up and i'm going to get the two ends of oh sorry you guys then we're going to get the two ends of the aluminum foil kind of put them together where where nestle had the glue already there so i'm just going to line them up as even as i can and we're going to heat seal them with our flat irons with my flat iron they go from like a one to a five and i believe i have them on a a two maybe a three i just want them to get hot enough so when my hand touch it my hand is not burning and i can kind of just like close it all together so heat sealing something together is really really easy you guys and that's just pretty much it you just heat seal them together and you will be all done with your diy infused nerve bros thank you guys so much for watching this video if you guys want to see any other type of infusion definitely put a comment down below and i really do appreciate you for watching this video i it means a so much so here go the little small ones that i did as well now this one i'm going to just do the same thing that i did with the longer one i'm just going to cut the nerd box so it fits this size you know what i'm saying so or you could just put them in your odorless airtight containers but you guys see how i have the little miniature one right there in front and that's pretty much all you do sorry for the noise you guys brandi and devin are outside playing tug of war with a stick yeah yeah yeah talk to you guys on my net video", "mju1to0xOfM": "my hard grandson has made me to test this Japanese Cola candy so I don't know if it's hot I don't know what's gonna happen but here goes opening the candy packet oh my gosh it's a

bit of a sourness to it this is horrible i don't think it's horrible if you're not used to artificial peach flavor i guess not here kid try this um it's not fantastic but it's not terrible it's just a bit sour it's kind of good it's gross it's not bad but yeah it's not bad again artificial to me i'm gonna give it a seven yeah seven it's a bit sour five and again it's a bit sour wait did i just say that twice it's a bit sour and it's a bit artificial is what i need to say um i don't mean to say it's sour sour sour i mean to say it's sour and artificial but anyways um i feel like i want to repeat groundhog day um but no that's i hope you had fun watching me act like an idiot gross that's not that bad but you gave me yeah let's play it out it's not bad again it's preference i say i prefer a real peach it doesn't taste like but some people like the artificial peach flavor which is fine i mean it does taste like peach yeah it does but it's more like the art you can tell there's an extent where you can tell it's not peach and that's where the artificial light comes in so it's not bad um this is my favorite jaw ranch i've ever had probably not but he's making it rain and jolly ranchers i guess [Music] anyways um go dodgers um i hope you enjoyed this video no you're wasting the jolly ranchers like that okay i hope you enjoyed this video and i'll have more content in the near future

the thing I can't do anything about it because I don't have my tripod my tripod broke I try to get a tripod the other day and they didn't have any for some reason so I'm guessing I need to either order one online or just somewhere else I don't know what to really do about it but right now you're just gonna have to kind of deal with this I couldn't move it but then I'm gonna be like up here to video so I don't know what you guys would prefer see I'm saying like I just don't have any like flat oh that kind of worked okay okay we're gonna roll with it anyway so today I'm doing a quick little review on an edible eye balm I love edibles I mean I love him but at the same time they're deadly to me they're strong girl I took a edible for 4/20 it was the la familia hot chocolate one I took the whole thing and that thing smacked so today I didn't really want like a chocolate or like a brownie I wanted something like more candy like so I got the Smokies edible and these are in the sour blueberry fruit shoes basically so it's a hundred milligrams there's two milligrams of CBD per not per actually the whole bag is I guess that's what it is now per serving it's 10 milligrams of THC so per gummy and then 2 milligrams of CBD in one little gummy so I'm not gonna do the whole thing and by the way you guys this review is going to be really really [ __ ] forward really honest I'm gonna tell you guys about the taste I haven't opened these or anything yet so I want to record like my reaction of like the taste that I get instead of like trying them and then coming back and then you know my thoughts would be kind of you know what I mean so yeah anyways these are vegan this is a vegan uh thing not all of them are weakened from this brand so if you are vegan and you know you stay away from Dairy and stuff so I'll definitely ask them which one is the vegan one because I know not all of them are vegan but I know that their dairy they're gluten-free all of them are gluten-free but not all of them are vegan so I just got this because of the flavor you know what I mean so I'm not vegan so it doesn't matter to me but it's a good thing that it is vegan so I don't mind it and I don't really care so yes so the ingredients on here is just sugar corn syrup pectin I don't know what that is but it is citrus acid natural and artificial flavoring FD&C blue one which is probably like the color of the candy soy let union I don't know and then cannabis extract so the weed basically you know so yeah the sugars in this is four grams I'm thinking yeah per piece it's four grams so if I'm gonna have three of them for 12 grams of sugar when you do the math it's kind of a lot so these are sour they're Fruit Chews had crafted gluten free vegan and so I watched a review on these and people said that only 40 will do the trick I'm gonna try 30 just because I want to see how I feel and if I don't feel it as much I'm so sorry about the [ __ ] Sun oh my god but if you don't feel it as much then I guess well if I don't feel it as much because you're not going to taking them I am but if you don't feel it as much then I'll take then I'll take another one pretty pretty much but I know how adipose are they sneak up on me I keep eating them like I eat them and then I keep eating them and then boom you know so these were $21.99 okay before attacks at my dispensary so I think with tags and all the little bag they charge me for because I've got to break minds it was like $25 so basically it's really easy to open I just rip this up hopefully it's easy to open it cuz I haven't even opened it yet already strong it's kind of like this there's like a little this in here and I'm guessing you pull that apart and they open up they smell like blueberry literally like [ __ ] they smell like powder aid okay you guys the blue powder right that's what they smell like I totally spot on that's what I'm getting and they look really cute and like flat and big oh they're soft they're like super gooey look at all that little sugar let me just you know I'm saying basically they're just coated in sugar they're sour they're pretty big I would say they're like as big as a [ __ ] let me see some money up in here so this is a quarter and then they're a little bit bigger than a quarter even so okay you guys so I'm gonna try one and I'm gonna see you in like a week [Music] mm-hmm gather my thoughts okay so I'll say this they taste really good they have they're sweet they are sweet you know I'm saying like I'm not really like a candy person but I like gummies and like sour stuff so I can make an exception but they're really good I had one of these they don't taste like we do know what I'm talking about you know when you take some edibles and they have that weird like nasty aftertaste of the weed you know you can you feel on the back your throat and all that I don't get it with these ones so I'm gonna take another one this is gonna be my number two you know I'm gonna take the three in front of you guys so you guys know what's real and I'll check back in with like in an hour and two I got some laundry to do so I'm gonna be a little bit busy and then they're just gonna hit me like a truck and I'm gonna be gone you know what I mean I don't know I hope so I hope these are strong they were saying these were strong so they better be so this is gonna be twenty you know what I'm saying these are really good you guys like even if they didn't have ween in it I would probably eat them they're kind of like okay they're like a sour patch kit all most like they kind of remember that but they're not as sour they're like they're like up from sourness it's like a good five it's it's the perfect amount it's honestly good with this week and see what I mean so I'm gonna eat one more you know I'm saying well you know we get lead tea today [Music] he was a [ __ ] fly in here anyways these are really good I wish they had like a pack where they had like all the little flavors that would be really dope like you know they had blueberry rhinos berry that would be mom like a little mixed assorted pack but yeah so I've had if I'm gonna have three out of like seven left so that's 70 grams seven milligrams so basically I'm ready to eat another one this is gonna be thirty and I will check back with you guys and an hour or I think on the back it tells you yeah wait two hours so I'm gonna wait two hours and I think he's gonna give me pretty lip but I don't know because I'm not smoking at the time maybe I will smoke a bowl but I'm not gonna like smoke because I feel like when you smoke weed and you take edibles it's both of them combined and it's just too much so I'm really trying to see how strong these are going to be just with 30 milligrams and if you guys the real tea on this you know I'm going to eat the last one and then I'm gonna go and go do my little [ __ ] wash my drawers and then I'll be back and then I'll tell you guys how they are so yep sure yeah of course chuckles you guys but I told you guys I did a little bun you know what I mean it's like a tank guys so it's like eight o'clock now I took those three edibles at 6:00 it was kind of like noise in there but anyways there's six it's been like two hours I smoked a bowl I'm not really feeling it all that much so I'm gonna wait until like 20 more minutes see if it kicks in and then if not I'll take another alignment so then I'm gonna give it the complete fill out two hours so you know it's good at all so we'll see but if not I'm gonna take one more or maybe two more to see if it's gonna hit me later but yeah that was 30 milligrams and it's been like an hour and 40 minutes I don't really feel anything but I'm gonna wait 20 more minutes because you know how they are they hit out of nowhere so I'll be back with you guys I'm kind of talking fast I'm not trying to but it's just a quick update you don't even a brief summary so I'll be back and I'll see you in a bit hey y'all so it's an update it's been I think a day or so two days I don't know when I recorded that video but basically I'm here to give my initial and final final thoughts you guys about that edible the was it the sour blue raspberry by Smokies the gummies the Fruit Chews to be exact you guys they were [ __ ] smacking okay when I had the 40 milligram that night oh my god was I gone was like on I kept [ __ ] eating I didn't really felt them like hitting me like instantly instantly but I felt like they really creeped up little by little and I also feel like it took a little bit longer for 40 milligrams to hit me it took like I would say to and I have hours and then I was just like Munchie [ __ ] madness you know I was eating anything I was just eating chips food I ate even after my dinner like have some snacks if you're gonna eat some edibles because trust you're gonna need up and then what's getting pulled in here okay and then I took 50 milligrams that I think the day after okay I took 50 milligrams and that actually hit me a little bit sooner I would say that one they fit me I don't know why maybe like maybe because the timing that I took them at I feel like the first time I took the 40 milligram I took it at like 4 to 5 so it was like kind of late afternoon already so you know it girl was tired she was doing her SH and she was tired but the second time when I took it I took it earlier in the day I took it out like 2 o'clock because I wanted to be like awake and [ __ ] at least enjoy my high you know so I took the 15 milligrams and on this sweet so I took him I took him I'm chillin literally I would say two hours later two hours and ten minutes later it hit me I was at Walmart I was grabbing some things and that [ __ ] hit me like a brick like oh my god I was literally in one of the aisles and I was just [ __ ] dying you guys and I know you guys don't really care because don't everybody feels that way but I was legit like [ __ ] dying like over nothing and I was just like the [ __ ] but I realized that okay the edible so I know decided it's my cool I left Walmart and then even when I was home after that my boyfriend looked at me and he was like you're [ __ ] what did you do like I guess I was that [ __ ] high guys but I was like I just knew what it was you know to me that I didn't feel like I looked that [ __ ] high but I guess to somebody that you know from their point of view they would get it but um yeah to me I was really [ __ ] high but still productive so I would recommend taking them on like a very like good day that you're not gonna do [ __ ] you're gonna be eating a lot you're on your own time definitely don't do it if you're gonna go into work or something like that it's noticeable if you're high you know what I mean it is for me so my eyes got a little they got sleepy they got a little low they got red so you know but you guys the edibles smack I totally recommend them I'm going to try other flavors you guys I'm gonna do more reviews on this monkey's fan because I think it's probably one of the good ones okay really good really good so I've been totally gonna recommend to you'll I haven't tried other flavors but I definitely like the sour blue raspberry because I'm a sour person so you know I like sour candy so they were really my cup of tea so if you guys are into that I definitely recommend these edibles so that is my review you guys I don't want to keep going on and on and on but the same thing basically I rate him a 10 the taste is a 9 out of 10 the potency is a 10 out of 10 because I was gone with 40 so that's good because you can literally take 40 40 and then maybe the other two before work because it's like okay they're not gonna hit you as hard at vicious 20 milligrams you know what not as me as hard but like so like 42 like 60 it's like the perfect range for me yours might be a little different so I don't know so be careful but your dosage and all that dogs barking so I'm just gonna go and yeah you guys have a good day I'll see you on my next one bye bye", "b4tD1jFpTPo": "hello everybody and welcome back to kj steve i hope you guys are having yourselves a wonderful day enjoying ourselves all that wonderful magical good stuff and for today's episode we're doing another edible review since you guys like the sour patch one i went out and tried to find myself other edibles i think would be interesting for you guys and for today's episode we got we got the little trillium edibles edibles i don't know if you guys have seen these before if it'll focus yeah so they make all different types of making of the sour patch to make the little watermelon ones all kind of different ones but since my personal favorite candy is trolleys i went out the way and found these and yeah so from what i can tell these are 300 milligrams in each packaging thc obviously and from what i've heard this brand is really good it's really high quality hopefully it's better than the sour patch ones which i hope it is so yeah before we get into it guys please like subscribe comment all that wonderful magical good stuff and without further ado let's get into this [ __ ] so real quick just in case you guys are out here trying to get your own and all that stuff please be aware when it comes to edibles cards all sorts of [ __ ] packaging like this can easily be bought off ebay amazon off the internet and people can be you know [ __ ] with your [ __ ] but just as a little reference in order to know that these are real each little metal packaging will have like the certain color coordination on the dip part so if this trolley is going to have the blue and red if it's sour patch it's going to have the green and so and so and also where it says the thc part right there if you you guys probably see it'll focus for you there should be like a little very gray doctor symbol on the back so there's that too so yeah so let's open this [ __ ] and let's get it so it smells like you know what you would expect gummy worms to smell like but it has more of that gourmet kind of snow and you can still smell a little bit of the weed is not too crazy so you know you can have these out and it wouldn't be noticeable get these [ __ ] out this is pretty much what they look for they're nice big worms they're not like i thought they're going to be more like trolleys like the actual smaller ones but not either pretty solid big so because of that there's only there's six in each bag which isn't bad so normally for someone who has a lower tolerance i would say go for three but if you're like me someone who has a higher tolerance or just naturally prefers to be higher and likes being high i would say knock all sticks down the 300 milligrams it's a nice steady high well we'll find out soon so we like to send [ __ ] in this channel i'm gonna go ahead and eat all six we're gonna eat a little part just to do a little taste review see how it [Music] this is hit say and they do taste like what i would say gourmet gummy warmers would taste like like if you go to a dollar store or any grocery store and they normally got like you know they got the trolley brands and then they got like the market brands it tastes kind of like the market brands but of course it also has that hint of wheat on it and what i do like about these compared to the ones um compared to the sour patches i did earlier the weed taste on this is a lot more subtle than it was on the sour patch one yeah it doesn't hit you in the face like you're eating it you merely taste gummy worm not you know wait so that's a good part on edibles so does it take longer to eat or are you just going slow this is a big gummy worm the regular gummy worm colors the blue and orange green yellow and the [ __ ] red another one sorry they are solid if you do start throwing more in your mouth you are going to get a little bit more of the wee taste but of course that's because you put a lot but yeah tastes good packaging is good six in each thing it's not bad it's a nice solid high i would assume and i would hope it would take you know just an average 30 to an hour to hit and hopefully since these look good they taste good hopefully it'll be a nice long lasting high oh again guys please like subscribe all that good stuff and you guys have you know any specific edibles you guys would like to do review on any glass any cards anything specific and he's trying to weed please let me know down below and i'll try my best to get my hands on it [Applause] but yeah just finished eating this and i would assume it'll take 30 minutes to an hour so i'll check in with you guys in about an hour or so to see how these are pretty much hit me so i hope you guys enjoy eating edibles too or just smoking along i'll be back with you guys hello everybody welcome back and we are about what i would say two to four hours deep on these edibles so it took about an hour to hit you know normally able to take and they are doing their magic they're great it's a nice body and head high and you know yeah it's what i would say if you've experienced edibles before you know saying your first edible you know what a good edible high is this is a very good one i would highly recommend yourself to get a metals if you can but yeah aside from that it's a great thing if you can try to get your hands on them you can try them out i don't know if they're all the same i'm gonna try to get my hands on some sour patch ones or some different ones but until then we'll see so yeah i would rate it you know 10 out of 10. if you guys get your hands on it you should try it so yeah that'll be if you guys have any other edibles again please put it down below i'll try to get my best i'll try my best to get my hands on it and yeah like always guys please like subscribe all that wonderful [ __ ]", "J-CQhL5uCwk": "Hey number of you have asked me how I go about making these candies that I post on to Facebook so I thought I would spend a little time here and make a video of me making the latest batch of candy I'm making a Japanese pinwheel design and the flavor in this particular batch is pomegranate that you see me adding to the hot sugar the sugar is about 310 degrees so it's pretty warm it will burn you severely if you're not careful so you gotta be cautious you'll see that I awesome now adding citric acid bring helps bring out the flavor in the candy you don't taste a lot if you don't have some kind of a acidic additive into the sugar now I'm pouring out what looks like four equal pools of sugar the point here is that I want to make four different colors I'm dividing it all up of course they're all have the same flavor in it because I entered it before this step and you're gonna see me go ahead and start to make the colors and I'm gonna use in this particular design this is red adding a little yellow a little blue for my primary colors a little white that's going to be used for it's sort of to reflect and help enhance the colors I'm gonna mix them all here and you'll see that it's boiling a little bit or steaming and the purpose of that is to try to drive off any water water and hard candy is quite the enemy and you're always trying to avoid adding any water or working in humid conditions it turns out this is a nice cold day today so it's a nice day for making candy I mix in the white now it turns out you don't really have to add white coloring if you use white if you just take that amber sugar and pull it long enough it will turn white as it incorporates a bunch of air bubbles it to alecky do with a taffy machine and now what you're seeing is I'm slowly peeling up the sugar is it cools on the edges and moving it into the center of each puddle if you will and that helps even out the temperature and eventually will make it easier for me to mix the colors in throughout each each grouping here you'll notice I've sped this up quite a bit and it's just an effort to make this video go a little faster all in all it's only about 10 minutes or so still pretty darn hot probably up in the mid 200s so it's I am wearing gloves under the blue gloves to help with the heat and you'll see me occasionally just set my hands on the table and that's just to try to help them cool off a bit they get pretty warm you'll see people often wear a really heavy gloves like welders gloves it's tough when it's this hot but I can work pretty quick here and then don't need it now I'm mixing the colors I'm not going to pull them too much I want them to maintain a transparent quality to them and you'll see at the end why that is but you can pull them quite a bit and actually in this case a red weed almost turned pink it would pull enough white into it from from the air bubbles that's incorporated from pulling you see the folks we've worked with a lot of white color they put them on essentially a taffy puller and help drive out or to drive it air bubbles and really generate a nice bright white crisp color in this particular case I mean it'd be that overall bright but I do want to be nice and opaque enough to help reflect the colors I'm gonna use in the design so it turns I don't want just three colors I want six colors and the nice thing about making the three primaries here is if you remember in art school or in high school in art class you can mix your primary colors to get just about any color you want so I'm dividing these into fourths because I'm actually gonna make six colors I guess I'm gonna cut them up here and if you remember of course that when you mix your red and yellow you get orange when you miss your red and blue you get purple and your blue and yellow to get your green and that's what I'm doing right here again I'm just trying to pull it enough to mix the colors evenly you know it's hard to see but in front of me there is a it's actually a pancake griddle I use as a heat plate and that helps slow the cooling down a little bit helps me control temperature the whole art of working with with hard candy is to maintain temperature gives to hot of course it melts you can't do anything with it if it gets too cold it gets brittle and you're done so we work to keep that sort of clay texture or state now I'm going to take each color and I'm gonna make essentially a long a triangle each one a there's going to be a wheel of the pinwheel and on each edge I'll put a little white and that will help divide the colors up when you when you look at the candy of all assembled so I'm gonna go through each color and do this I use this little spatula to helps me make a little nicer cleaner as you just edges almost there you see me occasionally rotate the sugar or in this case I may be taking it off the heat plate because it's getting a little too warm and I'm starting to lose the structure of the triangle and so I can take them off the hot plate and cool them down this way a little bit right now I've got my six triangles I'm gonna start putting together my pinwheel by adding each of the colors together I will give you my design as long as I'm working with them with their hot like this they'll stick together pretty well even if they cool off a little bit you can just run a little bit of water like on a damp cloth across the side of it and it'll act like glue and piece them together but I'm tending to work pretty quick so they're they're still pretty we're pretty good at hue so quality to them all right so now I've got my master role together here and so I'm moving away from maintaining temperature to maintaining structure of the design and I want to keep this round cylinder and first thing I got to do though is make them sort of bite-sized and that's what I'm doing now by stretching the the cylinder out a little bit and that design will be maintained whether it was letters or colors or shape or whatever throughout that whole structure or throughout all those little rods that are being pulled out they're also hot and if they sit too long and they'll go flat so you'll see me constantly rolling two cylinders to keep them from are the rods to keep them from going flat and maintaining their circular structure and that's what I'm doing now this takes a little while because it's going from a pretty warm temperature to you got to get them to they're essentially cooled down so you can crack them lifting it up shows you they're still not quite ready yet cuz they're uh they're deform now I'm getting ready if you kind of cut it out there but I did that for about 20 minutes off and on so now they've pulled down quite a bit I'm going through the process of breaking them into bite-sized pieces you can make these at different sizes I like this size it's about a half an inch and it's a nice bite-sized piece you can of course stretch the cylinders out or the rods out longer and thinner and you get smaller pieces or you can make different sizes whatever you what do you pretty like but this seems to work pretty well and that pot table you did admit of course it's sat for 20 minutes so it's actually cooled down now but I need that hard starch surface to cut against so the pieces essentially crack off and smaller pieces [Music] I'm getting them nearly finished as you might guess the rods that are in the middle of the thing looked the best some of the ones on the end or a little more deformed one way or the other but they all taste great and so he just tend to mix him in and nobody seems to carry to worry too much about it if it was something important I guess she could weed them out but the more careful you are the more uniform your structure is throughout the whole the whole sample set I'm getting to the end we'll cut the rest of these out and I'll let them cool a little bit longer roll them around little bit to kick get any sharp edges off and then I'll pack them up and hand to my friends and family and hopefully they enjoy them and it is a nice flavor and they do seem pretty pretty popular getting towards the end here here is the finished product as they lay it on the table but I really like a bottom though is when you hold them up to the light they really pop have a nice color to them in the light you know hold them up to the Sun or what have you oh that's about it I hope you enjoyed it I hope you have a chance to get some of these they are good I hope you enjoy it let me know I know thanks bye", "UfrwAQbhHC4": "[Music] hello and welcome to lofty pursuits and public displays a confection in Tallahassee Florida I'm Greg today's candy is gonna be continuation on a project of making candy out of beer like we did with the chocolate stout but this time we're gonna make it out of Corona Jake comes with a hot pot of sugar it's just hot sugar in Corona at this point and it's gonna go on the table the cooling table here was made about a hundred years ago and it's gonna drop the temperature of this candy dramatically it's gonna take it from its 310 degrees and lose about a hundred degrees so we can manipulate it and sculpt it today we're gonna put a crown on every piece of candy because Corona of course means crown we've started to experiment with alcohol in candies to use it as a flavor in this case we used bottles of Corona in other cases we did chocolate stout for our st. Patrick's Day mix vanilla whiskey for it as well and those are up for sale on our site we've also done in the past tiki drinks we had a lot of fun with different series of this and we thought what could be better than Corona mind you we were thinking about doing this for Cinco DeMayo this year but why wait we actually wanted to make this last year but time just flew by but the way this contains no alcohol alcohol is a much lower boiling point than water and we boil off all the water and the alcohol goes first there's even water in the food coloring and shake and I by stirring it in boil off all the water in the food coloring we just use the hot candy as their heat source the cooling table has cooled the candy and it's now ready to cut into our pallet we have a clearish yellow section a blue section and of course the gold for the crown [Music] the part of the candy that touched the table cooled down much faster than the rest leaving a liquid pool in the center by dripping off the hot candy we're able to even out the temperature and to help turn candy into something that feels more like clay we have yellow candy we have blue candy and we sort of a transparent amber candy now we want to have white candy instead of amber so we're gonna transform this candy from amber to white naturally without adding any food colorings we do this by putting this on a machine called a sugar puller but some people call it a taffy puller it's a mechanical machine that will fold air bubbles millions and millions of them into the candy each air bubble will reflect the light and that reflection will be white and make the candy appear white so it's an illusion of white in amber candy it's doing the same thing the head of a glass of Corona beer does when you pour a glass you have bubbles on it and the bubbles are white but the beer is amber what it's doing is these round bubbles are reflecting light and making it white we're just taking the head of a glass of beer and trapping it in time which is so appropriate for Corona flavored candy if you want to try this candy or any of our other candies for yourself we ship worldwide you can just go to our website which is www.hyken.com at Thomasville Road about five minutes away and we'd love to see you Corona means crown and we're gonna build a crown on this candy they have their own crown but we haven't asked for permission to make it so we're gonna make our own crown and I'm gonna build this crown carefully because my mother used to warn me she'd say Gregory you stop that you're gonna fall and break your crown instead I'm gonna cut all these little crowns into neat pieces [Music] we're gonna start by building the crown and building the crown is gonna be easy because it's gonna be made out of four identical parts just switching directions this will allow us to make just one part and duplicate it using candy multiplication if you think of a crown you can sort of do vertical lines between each of the points and you can see they're triangles going out of the direction the center point can be cut in half - and that'll leave you with four identical shapes so what we're gonna do is we're gonna do one of the shapes out of this yellow gold we're gonna shape it with the point and then we're gonna add some white to it to squirt back off to a rectangle rectangles are easier to deal with the one pointed candy with the white hidden inside it it's been stretched and we're gonna cut it into four pieces then the trick is to line up these seams precisely and we sort of roll one piece of candy onto the other to do our best and lining up the bottom of the points now we're gonna use that pulled white we've been saving and we're gonna use it to wrap around the crown and provide a nice spacer and of course the air bubbles on the white don't just serve to reflect light they also provide more surface area for the flavor and we want the flavor to come through because this is a weird flavor we're putting sweet in with beer and it's come out great and it's got this weird delay you take the candy and you taste sweet but the beer flavor comes after by several seconds it's wonderful and a little disconcerting we decided to do the outer stripes and colors blue and gold reminiscent of the corona beer that went into this candy and once again we're gonna use candy multiplication we're gonna make one set of stripes stretch it cut it and we'll end up with three stripes for the final product we just have to size the candy down and we do that by pinching off one end this end gets sold in the store under the name unicorn droppings and no we don't sell them by mail order we only sell them in the store so there's a reason to come I mean it's a reason to come besides just saying hi to me I like people to say hi to me we now have a giant log of candy and that's not gonna do any good as much as many people would like to eat it especially being Corona flavored it needs to be sized down into about 5000 individual bite size pieces and we start this process on our batch roller this hundred-year-old machine spins the log of candy and keeps it warm so we can taper it down into individual rods the rods then will cool and be cut up if you liked this video we have lots of others and you can also subscribe to us here on YouTube please just ring the button that says you want to get alerts

originally to keep flies out thank you for watching you can get our candy at wwp d net be good folks be safe and keep things in perspective it's not like we made candy type odds here you know it does occur to me that cough drops are part of the hard candy history they made it with wonderful materials like slippery elm bark honey and marshmallow root what do you think of me making those", "u8wGR-88vrc": "hey gonna show you how to make cannabutter hard candy what you're gonna need is 3/4 cup of sugar 3/4 cup of cannabutter a box of jell-o and a half a cup of corn syrup what you want to

the candy mixture until your candy thermometer reaches 275 when your candy thermometer reaches 275 you take it off the heat and quickly stir in your box of jell-o whatever kind of jello you want but work quick stir that in mix it really well and then you can pour it in your sprayed candy molds spray them really well or you can lay it on a cookie sheet and make it like rock candy just spray your cookie sheet down with nonstick cooking spray and then pour your candy on there when you're done let it cool crack it add powdered sugar so it don't stick together same thing with your candy molds when it's cool take it out of the candy mold sprinkle it with powdered sugar I got my candy going right now I'm gonna show ya I'm gonna use raspberry jello getting it to the 275 time almost done", "cFwlIAzxTGc": "[Music] hi welcome back to Diamond delight animals my name is Liz and this is the first time you're joining and if you're a regular welcome back so today I am going to show you how to make these awesome Jolly Rancher gummies from actual Jolly Ranchers that's right so I make these with canister up you can also do them with the can of sugar if you want to know how to make those I do have videos they're made from textures there is a specific one can of sugar and then the other one for the can of syrup is can of flour powdered sugar and syrup not well show you how to make the syrup if you'd like so from the actual gummy art from Jolly Ranchers I've made these gummies and I'm going to show you just how to do that so it's usually I'm going to jump right into those ingredients and what we need to put that together and get it all put together for you so you can make these awesome candies well one thing I did I want to tell you so in the recipe I used three and a half tablespoons of unflavored gelatin I would recommend using four tablespoons of unflavored gelatin to the same three quarter cups of liquid so I I will put the correction in the ingredients in the comments I do sorry I'm they turned it a little bit softer than probably what I like so I would go with four tablespoons of the unflavored gelatin all right so now we'll jump into those ingredients and get right to her alrighty so for our Jolly Rancher gummies what we're going to need is about twenty of your preferred flavour of Jolly Ranchers so I'm going to use the blue raspberry and peeled of course take off graphics you're going to need a quarter cup of can of syrup that we're going to mix with this then for our candy syrup we are going to need one cup of white sugar regular sugar and 1/4 cup of can of syrup and a quarter cup of regular light corn syrup 1/2 a teaspoon of citric acid and a quarter cup of water for syrup then we're going to need three and sorry three and a half tablespoons to four so if you've got the packages of the gelatin you can just use the four packets they got a little bit off one you'll be good and 3/4 of a cup of water for your gelatin cold it needs to be very cold and then for our equipment we are going to need a candy thermometer a double boiler if you don't have a double boiler just use a pot where another heat safe Bowl will fit on top and that will suffice another pot for your candy syrup a couple of spatulas and then your bottles if you've got the bottles for dispensing your syrup if you don't have these guys these are great things if not you just use your eye droppers you've got those and of course your molds and that's everything we need to get started so let's jump right in and get it going alright so our very first step we want to do is bloom our gelatin so you are going to take your three and a half tablespoons and you're going to sprinkle it over your liquid you want to kind of get it all mixed around and then you're gonna get that you're gonna mix this in your gelatin into your liquid so you don't have any lumps and while you're mixing this this is a good yet to know whether your gelatin is a good strength or that it's not too old while you're mixing this it should already start to gel and while you're mixing it it should how to get turns to about the consistency of applesauce and that's how you know your gelatin is good and then we're going to just put that aside to bloom or total ready to loot till we need it now we are going to melt our our Jolly Ranchers and our corn syrup so we are going to melt our Jolly Ranchers and a quarter cup of our corn syrup all on our double boil just don't forget to put water in your bottom of your double boiler I've done it how come I plug it in hold on alright so we're gonna turn our heat on to medium medium or medium-high and we're gonna get our candy put your Jolly Ranchers into the pot mine got a little stuck in the bowl here got a lot of humidity too don't want to give it up gotcha and we're gonna put in our quarter cup of corn syrup our can of corn syrup and that eats up everything will begin to melt the Jolly Ranchers will start to melt you just want to try and get the candies covered and covered in the syrup just start getting things moving around but just going to continue to stir and this until the until your candies though the Jolly Ranchers are completely melted so it does take a while for the candies for the Jolly Ranchers to melt just be patient it does get kind of goofy and glumpy don't you can see that but just be patient it will all nose what I do is I let it sit for about a minute or so let it get heated up and then I stir it around breaking trying to break it up mush it down you just don't want to really overwork it does that just continue to do that your lumpy mess will turn into a nice syrup will see very shortly all right so now my candy start my Jolly Ranchers are all melted so you can see that a little better so we're just gonna set this off to the side for about five minutes to let that cool down before we add in our gelatin because if we add in our gelatin now it'll be too hot and it can break through gelatin that's a lot of problems that happens with with it so the next stage I'm just gonna let that cool down and we'll add in our gelatin and get that melted in and then we'll make that by the candy syrup and get it all put together so now that my syrup is cooled down it's time to add in the gelatin and I like to just do this and cut it up into smaller pieces and then we'll just plop we're all in and get that melting now you'll find if it's not melting you can turn your heat on to low put it back on the double boiler auctioneers probably enough heat from the water still from the double boiler to to melt the gelatin if it's not hot enough right still Cece was started melting because we have the cold temperature and the warm you can kind of have a separation here but once everything comes to the same temperatures and everything will mix together so you may find that your candy is kind of is starting to solidify getting a little clumpy well the gelatin is not really is not fully melting if that's the case then turn your heat on to low or just want to gently heat the reheat that up you just have to be patient with this because it is gonna take a few about five or five minutes or so for everything to come together properly you might think oh no it's not working but don't worry be patient so you're going to continue to gently stir this over the low heat until everything your Jolly Ranchers and your gelatin of all melts together in one even uniform syrup and there's nothing sticking to the bottom of the pot yeah once everything is melted together and everything's one uniform texture and color and there's nothing sticking to the bottom and now if you find here you may want to add a little bit of additional food coloring because the blue with the green it's gonna muddle that blue a little bit so if you do want that with more intense blue like your Jolly Rancher go ahead and add a little bit more blue food coloring it's just exactly what I'm gonna do here so you took the one out of much just one drop will make one to two drops at the mouth you can see the difference there with one drop me get that mixed in so that's a much nicer blue how well you can see that so I skip it too much then it's gonna I'm gonna spill it and not like we haven't seen me see me do that before so we want to see what the color is gonna look like you just drop it onto something white there and I'll just see what it looks like so I'm happy with that color goody-goody I'm just gonna set this off to the side and we'll get our candy syrup started alright so for our candy syrup part portion we're gonna pour in our 1 cup of sugar our quarter cup of cannister up our quarter cup of light corn syrup and our quarter cup of our sorry our half a teaspoon of citric acid and our quarter cup of water and we're gonna get stirred together so you just want to get it mixed together so the water and Evert the sugar in the syrups are all incorporated and then we're going to turn our heat on to medium high forever this pillar so we're going to continue to stir this until until it begins to boil then if you have any duty sugar sugar sugar sugar crystals are so acceptance I just want to scrape that off or get a pastry brush and hot water and just wash down the stop then as soon as your syrup begins to boil you're going to stop stirring and we're going to watch your candy thermometer and we're going to cook the syrup to 260 degrees Fahrenheit and that's it just the letter go now periodically don't forget about your jelly the gelatin and your candy syrup you want to go around and stir that because it we can do start to solidify around the edges if it's like to pull off too much solid once once go around and just make sure that it's all still doing good but don't worry it'll get remelted once it gets out we added into the hot candy syrup whose life my candy almost up to temperature once you hit 260 you want to remove it from your meat immediately keep the candy thermometer attached because you want to wait until the syrup comes down to about 240 before we add in our other mixture the best is that you have a stone or marble surface to put it on is the best thing it draws the heat out quickly and and it doesn't get the surface doesn't get hot at all if not just put it off to the side burner and wait until your heat comes down to 240 all right so now my temperatures come down remove your candy thermometer grab your can you stir up your gelatin and your Jolly Rancher syrup and now we're going to gently pour it into our candy pot candy syrup here it'll probably bubble up a little bit and then you want to gently mix this and and continue stirring until it's all combined and you want to try to stir it gently to incorporate as little air MIDI as little air bubbles as you can but we need to make sure everything gets stirred there we go and once you're all good with air we're gonna get this poured into our bottles or you're just gonna use your dispensers your little eye droppers so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to pour it through a little strainer this isn't necessary if you've got one great if not don't worry about it so because it gets so hot these gelatin may break a little bit you get that little bit of whiteness I can't really turn the pot that way for you but if you do you can run it through a strainer just so that doesn't get in and if not no worries it'll all kind of go up to the top I'm just gonna pour this in I don't want any left in here now one thing you can do is you can fill up if you want to know if your gelatin it's gonna set correctly is you can just set up one or two cavities in your in your candy mold put it in the fridge and it should start to solidify very fairly quickly within about five minutes or so it should start to set so you'll know if it's still really gooey and tacky then you may have difficult study let it leave it for twenty if after twenty minutes it's still not setting then the gelatin has gotten too hot or it is not it's not some notch Ellington's are all the same strength so it may not be strong enough you can remelt you can add that back into the pot and add in about another half a tablespoon more of gelatin so this way it saves you a lot of time and this has got to cool down anyway because it the bottles are too hot to handle even if I use the oven mitt you don't want to do it when it's super hot because what will happen is it'll warp your bottle and it'll screw them up so one of those will end up leaking on you so you don't want to do that so while my bottles are all that while I'm waiting for my syrup to call I threw a couple into the fridge so I'm gonna see how they're gonna set up now I wasn't setting you may find your bottles because the bubbles will start to come to the top and instead if any gelatinous broke them out White's gonna come to the top as well so what you can just do is get a little spoon and just scrape that tops kind of skin right off of there oh yeah that way it's not gonna end up into your candy and make it muddled want to have a nice clearer looking syrup all right so I did check my candies they are starting to set up nicely because the syrup is hotter it's taking them longer and I don't want to leave this get too cold so yeah so the velocity is really you just distribute it into the molds if it's still a little hot for your hands full you can use paper towels on it which is exactly what I'm gonna do cuz that's too small just hold up some paper towel to put around it I thought I don't go with the oven mitts because I find that they're heavy and clunky and that's it just disperse it into your molds and put them in the fridge for about two hours for them to fully set and I'll come back we'll pop these out to see what these bad boys looked and chase like I tasted the syrup and oh my god it's so good it tastes just like a jolly rancher now if you find that your candies don't set you put them in the fridge for two hours they come out and they're still sticky you can't get them out of the mold don't panic put them into the freezer let them freeze up for a couple of hours let me get good and frozen and then pop them out so I don't you have to do one mold at a time take them out one at a time pop them into a double boiler remelt it add another half a tablespoon to a tablespoon will be good enough bloom gelatin and that will fix that problem and the same thing if you you've gone you've made them set them up and they're just way too jelly they're very very jelly to sick you can still you remem and add in a little bit about a quarter of a cup of liquid and that should take care of that all right so I will be back when these are set and we'll pop them out and see how pretty they look all right so welcome back here so my gummies I have them sitting in the fridge just over two hours and now we're gonna take them out so as you see first it looks like they're gonna be sticky but you just got to pull around the sides and we'll start to pull away as long as they're doing that and you can pull them out you're good you're gonna slay them on your parchment paper or stand them up if you can some of your candies molds are able to stand up others won't so I bought these guys on their sides and then also when it's warm especially it's warm I only take out one or two molds at a time to take them out and leave the rest of the fridge so that they don't warm up too much if I don't have a hard time getting them out of the molds and then I'm just gonna let these little guys dry for 24 to 48 hours and they'll be good to go yeah if there is still a little bit sticky once you've dried them you can toss them in a little bit of cornstarch so you don't want to do too much usually what I'll do just coat my hands in them and then run my coat my hands and cornstarch and then just run my hands through the candy and just kind of get a very light coating on them the other thing is you could do the same thing with oil so if you want to just take some cooking water olive oil coat your hands to them rub it in and then just gently go over your candies look at a little bit of an oil that will help them to stop from sticking as well and there you've got it Jolly Rancher canna gummies look at that baby and these guys taste so good oh I tried one earlier I don't know if I'm gonna get these to drying time get them fully dried they're so good but anyway guys that's it for that tutorial I'll be back to say goodbye and yeah that's about it oh one thing is gonna tell you so if you tried taking them out of the molds and they weren't coming out they're too sticky as I said don't panic put them in the freezer let them freeze up for a couple of hours pop them out put them into a double boiler let them melt down again and then bloom a quarter or sorry a half a tablespoon of unflavored gelatin to a quarter cup of liquid blue matte add that in and that will take care of that problem recast them and you should be good that's awesome thing we working with gelatin and the either if there is a mistake you can usually fix it as long as you haven't burnt it oh and remember that this version of the recipe is just for playing gummies we are not going to sugar or citric acid these if you do they're going to melt I will do another version of the Jolly Ranchers of the sour version for you okay so don't add your sugar and citric acid to this they will melt so that is my tutorial on a can of Jolly Rancher gummies I hope you enjoyed that and if you have any questions as always please don't hesitate to put them in the comments and as I said in the beginning of the video in case you just skipped right over it use four tablespoons of gelatin versus three and a half it'll make that little bit of difference or a little bit softer than I probably would have liked but if you like a softer gummy go the screen 1/2 but if you want that more firm gummy go with the four and you'll be good to go check out that baby's its see-through ish it's got that clear candy looking it tastes just like a jolly rancher it's so good so please let me know if you give this a try I'd love to hear from you on which flavor you prefer and once again thanks so much for watching you have an awesome rest of your day [Music]", "oZvjQqbiJwk": "it's going on YouTube Jedi here it's been few days anyway since my last update it's gonna be a quick one I got clones I got a cutting stuff half a plant to trim still so but what I wanted to do is come out you guys Kelly stop your warning girl I'll let you in a minute stop this is my girl right here I'm a pup Kelly tsuyoi say I speak speak good girl anyway so I made these canna butter infused candies and I got the recipe from star Delta nines channel so for any of you who are not subscribed to her be sure to check her out she does a lot of different cooking recipes she has her own girl she's uh she's a wild chick that's for sure but anyway I wanted to do hard candies for the longest [ __ ] time and I just stumbled across this and that was about all four or five days ago and since I made these freakin candies guys I have been fried I have been met so medicated since these things are awesome they taste freakin great so without further ado these here are the lollipops I made them with orange jell-o flavored and they got some icing sugar on them quite a bit more than probably most people would put on them to be honest but I love it and then I made these little swirly candies a lot of it was because it you know it was my first time it's just for me a lot of it was just what's built out all over the cookie molds and stuff but these candies guys it calls for half a cup I believe of yeah half a cup of peanut butter and most recipes that I've been finding trying to find a cookie rest era candy recipe is with like tink stirs and oils and stuff so when I found this I was in my frigging glory and honestly guys they taste good the taste is really good they went raw card like they're rock candies man they're rock candies and if you look it's actually a mustache lollipop these ones are so that's pretty funny but yeah so I got these little molds small ones and I'm in Candy's boat here being a sec both this big so in my opinion if I'm eating candy this size right here it better be able to give me what I want you know I finally know one candy I want to make sure that I'm getting medicated from it and this stuff works great when I came to Cal no friggin way oh no hey so I just dropped this one on the ground so I'm gonna have

definitely a lot of crafts on her website and she grows as well she's got girl updates and everything so yup guys all right this is Jedi coming at you with a candy update peace out", "yWvNBBq1Av4": "hi everybody its flower child and I'm coming to you tonight to show you how I make my hard candies with cannabutter so in the pot here nonstick pot I have a quarter cup of cata butter it's probably medium strength medium to strong kinda sorta depending on your preference I like the stronger that way you don't need so many candies anyway I'm getting ahead of myself so here we go quarter cup of can of butter in the pot and melting yay so we wait for that to go down then you have half a cup of corn syrup I use be high so there's half a cup of corn syrup 3/4 cup of white sugar here are my molds that I will be using and I pour my hard candy mixture in here and plop it into the mold you'll see that as well so I'm just gonna show you again you will need a quarter cup of butter 1/2 a cup of beehive corn syrup or whatever corn syrup you're gonna use I prefer The Beehive you can use your cheaper brine it really doesn't matter and then 3/4 cup of white sugar so I'm gonna go ahead and pour in the corn syrup I wish I had an extra hand but I don't so do the corn syrup I'll scrape that out in a second and you're putting your 3/4 cup and I like to just sprinkle it over I don't like to plop it all in in one little flop like I just did so you stir it all in it looks so good smells yummy too nice and sweet so you stir that around make sure it's all mixed up and there's no clumps or anything it will melt down with the heat regardless anyway do that and we need a thermometer a candy thermometer we go up to 300 degrees and this thermometer which takes about 15 minutes on the stove I like to have my temperature at 4 degrees you don't want to have it the stove too hot cause you will burn it and I have done that before which it's a total waste of ingredients but anyway sorry the boys heard a noise and like all boys do they mouth off so anyway again you will need 1/2 a cup of corn syrup 3/4 cup of white sugar and you will need 1/4 cup of cannabutter so the all the mixture is in there the stove is on I'm gonna put in my thermometer my candy thermometer and we're gonna wait for that to go up to 300 degrees which is perfect for hard candy so I'm gonna pause it and let it go anyway this goes for anywhere 12 to 15 minutes and it'll be at 300 degrees and tonight we are going to make root beer yummy so I'm gonna pause it now ok friends see you soon hi I just want to show you how it's cooking and it does bubble a fair bit but you just let that go be careful again that it is on a low temperature that you are not going to burn your ingredients you do not want to do that you want to cook it slowly but at a high enough temperature that it is going to boil like this so your eyes just above 250 sorry I had to look at it if my glasses I need better glasses so anyway it's up to 50 you're gonna pause it again - you're almost ready to pull out the thermometer and shut the oven or the stove and at that moment I put in a teaspoon full teaspoon of the root beer flavoring I am NOT going to show you myself doing that I'm the only one doing this and this stuff is quite hot so I will show you once the mixture is ready I put in a tablespoon or teaspoon sorry of the root beer flavoring in the pot stir it around then I pour all the mixture into my funnel and then I drop little by little obviously to make sure I get it in there enough and not too much in forgive the left side of the sink I have a few dishes in there I did not finish yet but I figured once I'm done all this I'll have to finish the dishes anyway so we're going to do that I am going to pause it and do the mixture and put it in the final so that I can put it into the mold okay so I have put them all in the moles if you are a little overflowed but I'm not gonna test them I'm just gonna leave them the way they are so there we go usually they do if I write on my measurements out I normally fill them all out but I was a little generous and the other ones so it doesn't matter but now I stick them in the fridge for about um you know about 15 minutes 15 20 minutes and they should be all solidified and hard and ready to be bagged up and put in the freezer so there you have it and they look good can't wait to have any but I hope you enjoyed this little instruction instructional video on how I make my canna heart candies so enjoy your day folks hope you enjoyed the video take care love and honey's flower child signing off have a great day stay true and stay unique bye Mase hope you enjoyed the video my friend", "wKHaFj1T8Lg": "*Galactic Music* Corinne: Woah, dude! This sh*t is crazy! What up, Internet? Corinne here, and you're watching Corinne vs The Galaxy! Yes! Today, I'm trying a project that's been suggested a gazillion times. The galaxy lollipops. \"Stuttering Noise\" Hold on. Let me fix this real quick. *Banging Noise* Phew! That should do it! Are you ready for blastoff? Let's get started, shall we? *Engine Noise* *Cartoonish Sound Effects with Darth Vader's Breathing* This video posted by 10 Minute Crafts, makes it look pretty easy. So, I'm gonna follow their instructions and dive right in. The first thing we have to do, is crush some Jolly Ranchers. F*** yes! This is a major stress reliever right here! *Clanging Noise* Actually, this is pretty damn hard. Some of these little suckers do not want to break. Oh, yes. A mallet. *laughs* This definitely works a lot better. This process alone took me more than thirty minutes. So you're a f***ing lie, 10 Minute Crafts. A lie! Also, what the f*** are these things? This is not Jolly Rancher. And it seems pretty important for the final outcome because of the white. No mention of this candy anywhere. What is this candy? Ugh, now I'm gonna have to go to the store, and find some stuff that will work. Yes! Candy melts! That's the ticket! Okay. Now we just separate our candies, into little sections on this lollipop mold thing. But, *laughs*, they're all stuck together now. Yeah, I just have to chisel it out here, I guess. Alright, now separating the candies into the lollipop mold thingy. And then adding some of the white candy melt pieces. Wait, does this go in the microwave or the oven? Rob said to try the microwave. Don't know why I'm listening to him, but we're gonna do it. Yeah, this doesn't really fit in here. The little spinny plate can't really spin. And only half of them are heating up. So, that's a no. Great, now we know. That's why this show exists. Isn't it awesome? Okay. Let's try the oven, then. Wait, maybe this is good? Maybe if I mix things around a little bit? Sure, okay. Yeah, I don't know. The candy melts seem a little curdlely? I guess that can represent some star clusters? Yes. We have to let those cool and prepare our sugar mixture. Just add in sugar, water and corn syrup. So now you're supposed to cook that until it reaches 300 degrees. To be honest, this takes a while. Once you reached burning stage, you're getting pretty close. Actually, I don't know. This kinda looks pretty yellow. But little things like that wouldn't stop God. Right? God? Are you out there? Can anyone hear me? Yeah, now you have to pour your melted sugar solution, into a measuring cup. And then pour that, into one side of a cake pop mold. Now we're supposed to sprinkle some edible glitter, on top of there. To create some cosmic star dust. Yeah, that's that star stuff. Maybe I'm God. *MWAHAHAHAH* The power's in my hands! Then you're supposed to place your colored piece, good side down. Into the melty sugar substance. Now if you're smart, you'll already know that this sh*t is really hot. And it's probably best that you don't try to touch it with your bare human flesh. F*cking dumb-dumb! This sh*t burnt my finger and it hurts like a mofo! F***! *Sigh* Okay, now we have to let this cool. Great. I guess they look okay? You know what, I still have faith. You just have to melt some grape Jolly Ranchers, in the cake pop mold, which is easy enough. And then add a lollipop stick to each one, like this. And place the other piece on top! This is a little bit of a messy process, so be patient. Um, okay. I think these are gonna work. But this, this is when the real magic is supposed to happen. Got my blow dryer and here we go. The big reveal. Yeah, this is definitely not what I was expecting. I mean, I guess if you want to keep things positive, it kind of looks like Mars? Which is in a galaxy, I guess? *SIGH* Okay, um, we obviously need to try this again. And I'm thinking we need this candy. Right here. Actually, you know what? It kinda looks like one of those candy sticks that the Cracker Barrel sells. Okay, Cracker Barrel, here we come. Ooh, I wanna play checkers. You go first. Random person: Oh. they're here. Fine, I'm gonna leave now. Bye. Ooh. *Laughs* Look, here's me. Triggered. Mhhhh. Rob: Oh, Jesus. Corinne: It's the peacock section. Do you need anything from the peacock section? \nRob: *laughs* There's no black and white ones but I think these should work. Sour green apple. That's a big bag. That's heavy. Can you get this for me? All righty. Here we go again. Luckily, I also got some of these peppermint because these ones are mostly white. And the sour apple ones are mostly green and that is not what we were going for. Why you gotta let me down, sour apple? I thought we were friends. The only problem I foresee is that the lollipop is gonna taste like peppermint now. But honestly, that doesn't really matter to me because I don't plan on letting anyone eat any of these. Yeah, okay, here we go. I'm just randomly adding all the different colors to my lollipop mold. And you know what? I'm feeling really good about this round. Into the oven, we go. These are already looking better. Not all curdlely and what not. Let me get them a little mixing. I think we got something here, kids. Now time to retry the sugar-water-corn syrup situation again. And I think this is also looking a lot better. Meanwhile..Yeah, um, my measuring cup is currently occupied. So I'm just gonna use this other little vessel here. And yeah, sure. Now we pour this into our cake pop mold again and let it cool for a bit. Now I'm just adding my cosmic star dust and my galaxy disks. And now we wait. For like six days or something. Let it marinate. Now that shit didn't take billions of years. It only took six days and only rest on the seventh. Yes. Alright, we're just gonna pop these suckers right out of there, and I'm thinking it's looking pretty good. Not as yellow as the other ones, so that's a good sign. Now we melt the grape again. Hehe. Add our lollipop sticks which I was much more organised about this time. And then just stick our other half in there. I think my grape was a little too hot. When I did it this time, because things started spreading out a little more than they did previously. Also, this made it a lot more clear without the need of the blow dryer. So I'm gonna go ahead and say this was intentional. They look pretty dang cool. I actually did hit them up with the blow dryer a little bit and this just brought them to a whole other level. It's honestly quite the process, though, so you want to be a little careful. Those people, they can shove their ten minutes right up their ass. Right down their black hole. No? Too far? Okay. To keep it 100 with you, I would probably rethink some of the color combos if I were ever to do this again, But since I'm planning to never, ever do this again, I think they look f***ing great. Really like this one, but this one is my favorite. I mean, all of them are pretty cool and kind of out of this world. From this moment on, you can now refer to me as the Galaxy Queen. I'll also respond to Guardian Of The Galaxies. Yes, here I am, your new galaxy queen! As the official galaxy queen, I control all existence, and am the knower of all things. For instance, here, in this galaxy, there's a planet called Catdor. Home to the giant fire-breathing cat dragons. There's not many a space traveler who had found their way here and lived to tell the tale. Except for Pete, Pete's a crazy motherf***er. And see this galaxy? This galaxy here actually contains the planet Earth. And you know Earth can be pretty cool? But, there's some f*cked up sh*t going on there right now. Actually, you know what? We're just gonna burn this sh*t to the ground and start all over again. Well, uh, I guess that's it for this video. Um, doesn't really matter if you subscribe or like it up and I probably won't see you next time. Computer, set a course for deep space nine. And computer, turn up the space jams. *lit af techno music*", "dw-avRWzFV4": "welcome to lofty pursuits in public displays confection I'm Greg today I'm driving across country all the way up to Syracuse New York so you can finally hear hi I'm Craig at Hercules candy and we're gonna make hard candy there's so much to know about candy making no one person can know it all so I travel the country and I see other candy makers and I invite you to travel with Greg as we go to see Hercules candy in Syracuse New York [Music] Hercules candy is located in Syracuse New York and Steve and Terry and Craig who's off camera right now run the place and they make wonderful candy and during our Kickstarter campaign we said we'd make a joint video and we never thought we hit that level but this is the video folks and we went up there they know something about making hard candy but not about making image candy and I know absolutely nothing about making chocolate so we thought we'd trade skills I arrived in Syracuse and the GPS takes me up a lovely Street and it points me to a lovely residential house with a sign that says Hercules candy out front I guess I didn't know what to expect I'd seen their videos but I didn't realize it was in the basement of a residential house they're gonna move soon so I sort of feel lucky I got to see this old tradition where they've been making candy since the 1930s the basement is the factory the ground floor is the showroom and they live upstairs more they make the candy just like the Shemp such a mess confectionary I've never made image candy in a kitchen from the 30s so I had to figure out what they had they had a pot to cook it in a table to pour it on and let it cool a hook to pull it on and a heating hood to keep it warm it looks like they had everything but like all things this equipments gonna be different than what I'm used to so let's see what we can do we were both prepared to take notes Terry more than me she had her little notebook ready and I had my notes made for them already drawn out for this project I hope it made it a little easier before I go any further I have to state an element effect steve is a superhero superheroes have superpowers and Steve's is handling corn syrup I use ladles I use cups I transfer it in various ways and some of it always ends up on the floor he takes his bare hands plunges it into the bucket of corn syrup and moves it without dripping with his bare hands into the pot I have no idea how he does this take my word for it steve is a superhero [Music] this beautiful copper pot takes the sugar up to 310 degrees quickly and Steve and I talk about candy making and I discover we have a difference of experience for him making hard candy is not something you do in the summer it gets too sticky and for me I'm from Florida it's practically summer year-round if we hadn't figured out ways around making candy in the summer we wouldn't be in business Steve adds the flavor stirs it in and then the pot goes down to the marble candy cooling table a four inch thick marble table I never actually worked on marble before you can't control its temperature so it does what it wants to do unlike my candy cooling table and if it gets too hot it'll just stay that way until it cools down or until you ice it down to keep the mixing colors familiar to me I brought a whole stack of my little wooden spoons with me to mix the colors in oh it's cooler than in Florida the air temperature in this room might be 65 and I'm used to working at 75 everything's cooling off a lot faster than normal so I got to work fast to add the color into the candy and we do our three sections they're dark orange for the skin our light orange for the middle and our clear that will become the white for the pith of the orange this is the place I normally add citric acid Terri Steve and I decide not to you see citric acid can behave very badly when exposed to marble marble and citric acid can break down a produce carbon dioxide in fact dissolving marble dust or chips into sulfuric acid is how they made seltzer water or the carbonation for seltzer water back in the early days and you can find out more about that on our video about how to make an egg cream we don't want to damage this so we don't use the citric acid but that's okay it may be a bit sweeter than our normal orange but it's going to be delicious because we're flavoring it with pure orange oil just the way we do with lofty pursuits I cut the sugar into its three color blocks and Terry and Steve start flipping them over like experts I guess they are I know there have been jokes made by these guys about how tight the space is down there when there's only three of them well there are six today you can see four on camera and there are two more just coming to watch and to help out [Music] Steve starts the batch on the hook he's pulling it to fold and air bubbles you fold in air bubbles into candy like this it stops being amber and it starts becoming white that's because these little air bubbles reflect light beautifully we need a very white candy for the pith of the orange now what's surprising me here is that we actually made this work this room is so much colder than I'm used to not as cold as they're used to and I have to work much faster than normal for me we need to get this thing off the hook and still be warm enough to do the next couple of stages in the process at lofty I'm used to working with a heating table to keep the candy from cooling too fast but the traditional way to do it is a heating hood I never had that opportunity to work with one when I was learning because we didn't have a gas source in the building we were working with we had a deal with electrical heat a heating table is a very large area that has one temperature and it tapers off very quickly as he get off that area the heating hood has a gradual taper from the back where if the heat sources to the front whether you're working this posed some challenges for the type of image candy that I'm used to making but ends up being a huge advantage for ribbon candy and hopefully I'll show that to you in another video [Music] Terry and I start cutting the candy down the light orange is going to be the triangles in the center of the orange and we need six parts for the design that I do she takes three I take three we even them out and then we have to shape them into the triangles and cool them off and in this environment the cooling them off is not the problem [Music] Steve knows how the candy cools in his shop he comes over and starts flipping the candy I'm used to flipping it because the bottoms warm in the top skull but in this case the bottom and top on one side are cold and the bottom and top on the other side are hot and he's gotta flip it in a different way it's all different everybody's shop has its idiosyncrasies and Hercules candies is no different but I gotta say it's a lot of fun to play with the old equipment Steve earns his stripes by putting stripes in between the pith of the orange slices and we've put in the last slice on the first half and the first half of the image Candy's done the second half he assembles by himself and we are able to put both halves together and end up with the core of the orange [Music] Steve keeps the arms center Moving's that it won't go flat while I pull out the white candy into the outer layer of the pith and we wrap it around the orange slices we repeat the technique we did with the white candy on the orange rind and we end up with a beautiful outer layer then the log is rolled for a bit and we want to take the log in two rods and we pull it down we pinch it off and we stretch it out using gravity as AIRAID if you ever make it to tell a C please visit us at lofty pursuits we're right off i-10 here in Tallahassee and if you can't make it you can still buy our candy we made a batch of this orange and it's in our citrus mix and you can get that at our website www.jfn.co.jp/toho clips are amazing they're hard candies are wonderful and it's always good to have colleagues in the field that you like everybody's changing positions all the time so that everyone can have experience at each step of the process the log is being rolled to keep it round Steve is pulling it out into the lengths without distortion this is the hard part of this project and he's cutting it off in two rods Terry and other people and me at some point end up rolling the logs to keep them cool and round until they are heartened which once again he isn't very hard in this environment he can't tell a little jealous it's hot here in Florida [Music] the candy came out great sometimes if you over pull or under pull the candy or if there's too much stretching and twisting involved it becomes hard to cut but this Candy's cutting beautifully and I cut the first couple of rods and then Steve takes over and he starts learning the process like everybody who's ever learnt this technique has to it's not always as easy as it looks don't worry he'll get his revenge when he tries to teach me how to kill a chocolate mold and I thought that would have been easy I was wrong [Music] and look at how much faster he is after a few dozen rods to cut [Music] and Terry did a great job she picked this up in no time at all and then we were done and we headed upstairs and I went out towards my car with everyone else helping to carry my gear and there was somebody waiting outside apparently he'd seen the live stream he wanted to come by and get some of the hard candy the first person to try it thank you for watching this video we want to thank Hercules candies for their huge hospitality it was a wonderfully fun trip and we really enjoyed it and if you ever make it up to Syracuse please make sure you visit them their new store looks like it's gonna be great and if you ever make it to Tallahassee visit us we're located right off i-10 on the Thomasville Road exit subscribe to us here on YouTube make sure you turn on notifications we started to do live streams and we don't tend to store them so you can't see them later also watch us on Instagram Facebook and Twitter and we do constant updates you can see what we're doing all the time thank you again for watching see you with the next video [Music] you", "ZqsIT_mGapI": "hi everybody my name is Sonny and you are in sunny days kitchen sorry for the shaky camera but I just had my silly cat max jump on my shoulder Oh Manny way we are going to show you how I make my canna chocolates I make it with my half a cup of can of oil and it's coconut oil infused with cannabis I make it myself and a cup of chocolate milk chocolate for flavouring this time around I'm going to use raspberry laron oils they're fabulous I use them all the time I make heart candies as well and I use these flavorings in them too so sorry I'm gonna stutter a little bit I'm a little nervous this is my first video I'm gonna put up on YouTube but anyway so and this is my little spoon that I use with I used two of these this is half a teaspoon of measuring with the oil and then in these is what I used as my moles so I'm gonna pause it so I can put my half a cup of kind of oil in to the chocolate and then I melt it that way melt it down slowly in the microwave some people use like a double boiler or whatever but I don't do that I do it slowly in the microwave it doesn't take too long especially if I'm pouring my kind of oil over top of that and it helps the mixture actually it's probably good to go but I just put it in there I'm gonna have to put it in the microwave just to melt it a little further but dying out and then I melt it down mix it together and we'll be right back okay so we're back I melted down the chocolate and it's just a little bit shy of one cup but I'm not too worried about that because um that amount right there will probably make 45 chocolates so I've set out my molds I have my small these are half a teaspoon each these are a full teaspoon so this is a full dose one of these is a full dose you'll have to take two of these depending on your tolerance level some take two three four depending on my pain level my tolerance level is quite high so I switched from smoking to edibles and back and forth so anyway this is what I do I take a full teaspoon of the raspberry flavoring I put it in there stir it around and because it's just me doing this I'm gonna have to pause it again sorry okay so we're back so I've got a tablespoon of the raspberry oil in there flavoring mine if you're wondering within my little box it's all my Laurent oils she's fabulous I loved her oils I use them all the time there's the raspberry but I've got because I make hard candies too I've got different flavoring in there I have a green apple caramel butterscotch root beer creme de menthe and orange I believe so anyway here we go this is pretty well good to go just scrape off the knife it's kind of hard to do when you're looking at it through the camera all right the whatever so then I take my little half a teaspoon and I just measure it out obviously you just take whatever because it's going in the mom like I said it takes two of these because they're half of teaspoons I just find that the smaller spoon goes better into the molds without making too much of a mess so here we go we're gonna go in one of the malls takes two it is to get it falling up as you can see it's pretty level oh don't have it so we just keep going and going and going and going you have no time lapse so I'm gonna pause it and I'm gonna get these done and then they go into the fridge and they sit in the fridge I don't know about 10-15 minutes you can check them after ten minutes because but because my molds are fairly thick molds I keep them in there probably about 15-20 minutes just to be sure that they're all solidified and they're not going to again max jumping on my shoulder on you jerk ball just to make sure that they're solid enough that I can pop them out of the molds and bag them and put them in the freezer so I am going to pause it and fill the molds and put them in the freezer so we'll just end it here but this is what we do and I will pull them out of the molds next okay so there are linear molds and I'm a little medicated because I went licking the spoon after I filled all the molds up it's very good taste yummy that's why they call them edibles because they're so good anyway I'm gonna put them in the fridge now and the next time you see them they'll be ready to be popped out of the malls so instead of waiting for the other ones to solidify cuz it'll take 15 minutes anyway so I'm just gonna cheat here anyway so these are ones that I already made that I put in the freezer and I find that these chocolates I've had them in the freezer not these particular ones but some of my edible chocolates in the freezer for just over a month and they still taste great so I've never pushed it any longer than like maybe five six weeks because sometimes they might get that freezer burn taste so just keep it to your personal preference anyway they might not even last that long but me I don't always eat edibles so I just make them and put them in the freezer so that they're there when I do want them anyway so this is all I do is just you just push on the back of these silicone molds and they just pop right out and then I put them in my bag ease I put about a dozen in each bag and then because they're little freezer baggies they don't hold a lot anyway and then I just seal them off right okay so I got everyone's in there these are crime to match and the ones are in the freezer they're our raspberry so that's it so I hope you enjoyed the video if you have any questions please put them down below and I'll try and answer them as as soon as I can I'll try and keep an eye on it I don't anticipate too many people watching it because I know there's a lot of videos about edibles on the internet but I just thought I'd try my hand on it and on my channel so again this is flower child and I hope you enjoyed the video if you have any questions please post them below and I'll try my hardest answer them okay smile have a great day be true be honest be respectful stay true and stay unique bye", "zYgVCXcyrcI": "hi welcome to dive into light edibles my name is Liz if this is the first time you're joining and to the regular subscribers thank you so much and welcome back new subscribers thank you again for joining I'm so excited this channel is kind of weirdly taking on a life of its own it's it's really really exciting but a little overwhelming I'm not gonna lie it's kind of cool when there's like you know a couple thousand people seen it but now we're getting into some not large numbers for me um that I never expected and it's like what oh but it's super cool and thank you guys so much I couldn't do this obviously without you so today I know I've got another company recipes up there and I'm always working to refine and make things better so in this recipe this is good for regular gummy bears or regular gummy candies or the sweet and sour there's really only one difference in the change for that recipe whether you want to make regular or the sugar sugar-coated and so I wanted to go for that as well as a little bit a little bit of change in the method but any one of those recipes will work so kind of how I'm gonna how I would list it is the regular gummy bears that I put is more like a condensed jello realistically it's jell-o and gelatin and you harden it up that's condensed jello and then the other candy this the sour one with the the sugar-coated sour ones they're more like a real candy so I know also how the gummy that's more like a real candy versus just condensed gelatin and I will stop babbling on now and also I've got a recipe at the end there if you want to stay tuned on how to make inverted sugar which is a replacement for corn syrup so if Kourt lake corn syrup is difficult for you to get expensive just not available in your local grocery stores you can actually make your own at a fraction of the price and it's super easy to make however it is very very finicky but I go over all of that at the end there about the inverted sugar so I hope you stay tuned for that and and check that out and I think that's all I've got for us right now I'm gonna get in as I usually do get into my ingredients the utensils you're gonna need we'll put everything together and we'll get some candies made we're getting started what you want to do is to get a pot of either ice water or set up a pot of cold water and put it in your fridge or freezer about an hour before you want to start this very important you need the really cold water to start to stop the cooking process for the syrup so just get that set up ahead of time and now we'll get into your ingredients and the tools that you're going to need all right so I'm just gonna go over the ingredients now the ingredients for the gelatin side are exactly the same whether you want to do be regular or whether you want to do the sugar coated it's exactly the same the only difference is whether you're doing the sugar coated or the regular is in the candy syrup and the difference there is if you're doing sugar coated you're gonna use one cup of sugar actually I'll go over that when I get into the sugar part you never mind about that right now we'll start with the gelatin side so you're going to need a one box of jell-o three envelopes of gelatin or three tablespoons you are going to need a quarter cup of corn syrup or you can use what's called inverted syrup which is a substitution for corn syrup I have a video at the end of this to show you how to make your own inverted sugar which I use quite often which I'm actually using today I'm just showing you the bottle for what you've got what you need in the light corn syrup you will need a quarter cup of melted can of butter 1/2 teaspoon of gore gum a quarter cup of liquid now I tend to use the kool-aid jammers or the or the kool-aid waters they're great or the Hawaiian punches are great to use as well or you can just use water you're gonna want a half a cup of liquid again you can use your juice or your gelatin I'm sorry your juice or your water for the gelatin and for this you need it needs to be cold so for your gelatin it has to be very cold and for our jello portion we're actually going to boil that and the only other thing is if you want to add some additional color and additional flavor we can do that as well and I think Oh sorry and we also need a quarter tea store sorry a half a teaspoon of citric acid I apologize almost missed that our half teaspoon of citric acid that's everything that we're going to need for our gelatin side and now I'm just gonna when we start the syrup I'm going to go into the ingredients in that for the syrup side and then if previously I talked a little bit about clear gel for the regular gelatin gummies you can actually use this now for either one and again we're gonna do all the work on our gelatin side and add this in so with regards to the clear gel if you want to use it what you need to do beforehand is you take a cup of the clear gel and you mix it with a quarter cup of sugar and you keep that to a side mix it thoroughly so that the sugar and the starch are thoroughly mixed the reason for that the starch will clump if you do it on its own or doesn't have the sugar properly mixed these starts will clump up in your mixture so that is why we add the sugar then you are going to use two tablespoons for your gelatin for your gelatin mix now this is an option now what this does is it takes your candy to that next level that more professional candy like you get in the candy store so it's not as gelatin like it's more it's a little bit softer it's more of that gummy candy versus just like concentrated gelatin and I've been using this ever since I first since I tried it I used it in all my candy now it's I love it it's not that expensive you get a large container of it and it lasts quite a long time so if you do make candies more on a larger scale or on a professional level you might want to give that a try it's excellent it's a little pretty pain to work with but I'll go over all that adding that in so for the candy syrup you're going to need one cup of sugar okay laureate let me back up here if you are making the sugar-coated gummies you are gonna use one cup of sugar and a half a cup of corn syrup if you want to make regular gummies that are not sugar-coated you're going to switch that you're going to use one cup of corn syrup to a half a cup of sugar but it's to a half a cup of sugar so the recipe is exactly the same this is the only part that'll change regular gummies one cup of syrup to half a cup of sugar sugar-coated gummies one cup of sugar to half a cup of corn sort syrup and the water remains the same half a cup either way you go that's all you need for the candy syrup side temperature cooks to the exact same we're gonna cook it to 260 all right so the equipment that we are going to need is a double boiler you don't have one no problem just what I do use a metal bowl that fits into a pot you want to add water into the bottom to the pot you just don't want it to touch the bottom of the bowl you're gonna need a second pot for your syrup you would let you want to use a heavy bottom pot it works it's better for even the heat distribution for your syrup that way your syrup cooks evenly you don't have any hotter spots you're going to need a candy thermometer a hand blender a whisk a couple of spatulas and a strainer if you've got one handy and I think that's everything that we need for our equipment I usually end up finding something that Wow's that we need but this is generally the majority of the equipment that you're gonna need so next I'll get into the ingredients for putting our gelatin portion together and then we'll then we do the candy syrup and then we combine both of them alright so give me a moment to get everything together here and we'll get started all right so let's get started with our recipe so our very first step what we're gonna do is our quarter cup of liquid we're gonna heat up in the microwave for one minute we want that boiling then with our half a cup of cold liquid we're gonna bloom our gelatin so add that to a bowl and your gelatin you want to evenly spread it over your liquid and again water or the juice I'm actually using kool-aid jam or yes or sorry I'm using the kool-aid waters you know if you do use real juice with real fruit all you need to do is to add a mold inhibitor laureen's makes a makes one and that's what you need to use if you if you use anything with real fruit in it otherwise they will mold very quickly but if you use fruit jammers Hawaiian Punch they don't have anything real in the sugar content they don't go mouldy I literally have gummies that last for months I've never seen mold on them so with regards to your gelatin you want to sprinkle it evenly and then mix it up to make sure that there are no lumps and then you're gonna set it aside for five minutes to allow it to bloom and meanwhile I'm going to microwave this for one minute so you're gonna add your box of jell-o to the double boiler you're gonna set your temperature to low and we're just gonna wait for I'm just waiting for my liquid to boil all right so we're going to add our boiled liquid yeah it got very hot I'm gonna add that in and we're gonna stir that around let our gelatin let our jello get dissolved you might need to add a little bit more liquid to it if you find that it's not fully dissolving but it takes a few minutes anyway and you want to continue to scrape all the gelatin off the sides otherwise it will harden up and we're just gonna stir that and let our water get warm now it's really important with jell-o and gelatin is the heat jello and more gelatin sorry I apologize the our unflavored gelatin melts at just hot a hot water bath if it is too hot it breaks the gelatin and what will happen is your you'll notice it'll start to get very foamy if it starts foaming immediately remove your bowl from the heat and let it cool down you also may need to add about 1/2 a tbsp more of unflavored gelatin because you've kind of broken the the you broken the gelatin a bit so it may not be as sticky or it may not be sorry gel as well so you may I need to add in an additional half a tablespoon to compensate for that so I'm just gonna continue to stir this on the low heat until it is till it's pretty much fully melted until the sugars all fully melted so now that my gelatin is pretty much melted we're gonna add in our quarter cup of corn syrup and get that thoroughly stirred in and we're also gonna add in our half a teaspoon of citric acid we're gonna let that all mix in and melt together again try and keep the sides of your bowl as clean as possible so now that our jello is all melted we're going to add in our gelatin and your gelatin is bloomed when it is nice and spongy if it is squishy at all then either your gelatin is it's not strong enough because gelatinous do have different strengths or it's old and the gelatin is just broken so you want it to be nice and firm and just break it up into pieces and scoop it in and then we're just gonna stir that until that's melted and again remember you just want to warm hot water by at this point you don't want the water underneath boiling at all otherwise your jello your gelatin will break and again if you see it starting to foam up at all take it off immediately now once your gelatin is all melted and everything looks nice like so we're gonna add in our can of butter so you know it in a quarter to a third of a cup of can of butter I'm doing a quarter cup they have dogs and cats behind me [Music] cats trying to trip me up here and then I'd in the Gerber gun this is when you want to use the strainer throw it on there and you want to evenly sprinkle it all over the top and now we're going to get our handy dandy hand blender and so you're going to blend this until it is completely all one color one unit alt one texture and that you're not seeing any kind of oil separation [Music] all right so we've got that all what we called emulsifies so what Gord got gorg um is an emulsifier what an emulsifier does is it allows oil and water to come together essentially it creates a little bubble so when we use the blender it breaks the oil particles up into tiny little part into little pieces and the emulsifier acts as a bubble and holds the water and the oil together in little bubbles that's how it all comes together and your water and oil live happily together otherwise your butter is going to separate and come to the top if you don't use that now a lot of people have asked me if you can use zanza zantac xanthan gum no you cannot it is not an emulsifier it is only a thickening agent so geurim is an emulsifier it is also a thickening agent and a stabilizer that is the other you can use lecithin I prefer Gore gum because lecithin gives it a flavor that I really don't like and I find that the Gore gum works awesome with you don't need the lesser than now at this point if you want you can add in your some additional flavoring I add in about a cup and a half full and if you want to add in some additional color I do it on this side as well I use the no taste red if I'm doing red color so I'm doing raspberries so I use the no taste red reason for that a red die has red food coloring I mean has a tends to have a bitter flavor to it so I like the no taste rent the only downfall about it is you don't get quite as an intense red as the regular ones but I would for rather give up a little bit of the color for than the flavor so I'm gonna mix that in and I'm gonna use the hand blender again just to get it full all mixed together the color comes out much nicer when you use the hand blender [Music] and when you're riding a clear gel you're gonna want to have your whisk ready and coupes and we're going to add in a tablespoon at a time and you want to evenly spread it over the top like so and then use this too and then you're gonna have to whisk it for about a minute or minute or two you're gonna notice it start to thicken up it's just kinda like cornstarch you know when you're making gravy you have to keep mixing it a little while for it to up for it to thicken up and do its thing we're gonna do and you can see how it's starting to thicken up and now we're gonna add in the second tablespoon same thing evenly over the top whisk and you're gonna repeat the same thing we're going to whisk it for about a minute or two until it's all to look pick it up so you can see how it's thickening up here I said you want to continue whisking for about two minutes and it should look nice and smooth and again all one uniform texture and color alright that side is ready is finished now we're gonna do the candy syrup side alright so for our candy syrup side because I am doing sugar or sour coated ones I am going to be using one cup of sugar half a cup of corn syrup and a cup of water now remember if you want to make regular gummies our only difference is you're gonna use a cup of corn syrup and a half a cup of regular sugar that is the only difference there you're gonna mix that together until it's up until it comes up together and your sugar begins to dissolve make sure to go all around the edges because the sugar likes to hide on the edges all right so and once your gonna have that all mixed up you're gonna turn your heat on to medium medium-high and you're going to continue to stir this until it begins to boil once it begins to boil you're not going to stir it all right the other one of the things I forgot is you want a pastry brush or a paintbrush clean paint brush so that you can clean off the sides of the pot to use a cup of hot hot water and that'll melt any sugar crystals that you've got and you want to get those off the side because any sugar crystals can cause your syrup to crystallize later on and just continue to stir it until it begins to boil Oh once your syrup begins to boil stop stirring and you're going to add in your candy thermometer and we are gonna cook this until 260 now if you want a firmer candy you can cook it to about 280 so anywhere between 260 280 you can experiment on your firmness if you want a softer candy cook it to 250 but I found 260 seemed to be a really good temperature for it and we're just gonna let that go until we hit the proper temperature now you also want to get your pot of cold water handy and the only thing that you'll do drink the cooking process is if you do see any sugar crystals form just wash them down and now while your candy while the candy syrup is cooking you just want to consider this because stir your jello side because the top part of its gonna start to solidify and the bottom is gonna be liquid because it's closer to the heat so you want to continue sure to mix that up and it all stays nice and smooth and keep it on keep it on low temperature so you have the low hot water bath keeping it melted all right so I've hit 260 take your pot and submerse it in cold ice water turn off your heat and you want to wait until the temperature begins to come down on your thermometer then you're going to place it on the counter until the temperature hits 240 well once your temperature reaches 240 you can remove your candy thermometer and we are now going to add in our gelatin or our jello and our gelatin mixture right so now we're gonna get our jello we're going to get that added in and then you're gonna very carefully stir this until it is fully mixed together your sugar the sugar syrup and the gelatin come together but be very careful because this is very hot you're going to pull it from the bottom and again make sure to get the edges and then it's this is up to you it's an optional step I do I like to use the hand blender on it and the reason I like to use the hand blender is just to make sure that everything is all mixed and blended thoroughly together [Music] [Applause] well see you like that be careful I'm gonna clean up my little mess here and then we're gonna get lit gonna let this sit let some of the air bubbles come out of it we you can work them out by just gently stirring it let it sit and then just look gently stir it again we need this to cool down a bit so you can do that and I'm just gonna clean up a little all right so my mixture is cooled down a bit and I'm going to pour it into my to my bottles my squeeze bottles that was one of the things I forgot in the utensils or tools you need is your squeeze bottles or eyedroppers and I use these squeeze bottles they're by sugar sweet sugar bowel and they've got their nice because they've got the piping tips for them which makes it really nice and easy as well as they have a wide bottle and a wider thread if you use bottles that have too thin of a thread if your syrup is hot or really thick it'll pop the top right off if after you filled your bottles if you still have syrup left just keep it on the lowest temperature just so that we can that you it'll stay so melted there otherwise it will solidify all right so now we're gonna get ready to put this into our moulds all right and then when you're filling up your mold you just want to fill them up just a little over halfway you don't want to go all the way to the top because that way it makes a rough edge on them and it makes your candies not very nice so you just want to try to make them as clean it's also you want to try not to get any jello on the edges there and you're just gonna fill up all of your molds and then once you've got them all filled you're gonna put them into the refrigerator for a minimum of four to six hours I found its best overnight so if after four hours or so II go to try to take about there knock coming out just leave them for overnight usually that usually works if they're still not going to come out of the mold you can put them in the freezer it means that you've got too much syrup the gelatin isn't working too well what you can do is put them into the freezer get them out of the molds remount them at about a tablespoon of gelatin and recast them and then if you find that you take out your candies and they're far too gummy too sticky you can remount them and add a little bit of liquid to it means that it has more too much gelatin you can add up I probably say about two or three tablespoons of liquid to it remelt it and just recast them and this recipe makes about sixty candies if you use smaller molds and if you use those little tiny bear molds you're gonna get about at least a hundred to 150 all right so these candies I had in the fridge overnight and I made lemon yesterday so you can see now I did I have found that they do stay there are better if you leave them overnight then just leaving them for a few hours and they'll come out and you pop them right into your sugar sour mix now your sugar sour mix should be one cup of sugar to a half a teaspoon of citric acid don't use any more make sure to thoroughly mix it in and that'll make a nice sugar sour mix if you just want sugar just use sugar what I usually do is for the sweet ones I will use a cup of sugar to about a quarter teaspoon of citric acid just a little bit because it brings out the fruit flavors so you just mix them into your sugar shake off the excess and lay them on a a rack with parchment paper to dry overnight now these guys also dry a lot quicker and then the other recipe and just pop them out now if you find that they're getting too sticky like this you can put them back into the fridge sometimes they do the when you leave them out they get too warm so as they get a little bit too sticky so what I usually do is take out one mold at a time and do them and that's it you'll continue doing that until they're all are all coated and just lay them out on the rack to dry overnight and those are your sugar or your sugar sour coated candies your sugar soda yeah cannabutter gummy and I just want to go for also a couple of things with regards to molds when you get brand news if you get brand-new silicone molds what I recommend to do is to cut to season them so I use a spray the spray cooking spray I spray it on let them sit for 20 minutes and then rinse them in hot water I don't use soap on them again but I want to rinse off all the excess cooking spray and then that kick that that cures them which is nice I found that red silicone mold do not work well for some reason they're thicker and I can never get anything out of them so I tend to stay away from red silicone molds I found the blues Browns and that work great but red mm-hmm does not work Oh to make inverted sugar replacement for corn syrup you need two cups of white sugar one cup of water and a quarter cup or sorry a quarter teaspoon of citric acid you're gonna need a pastry brush or a clean paintbrush brand new one will be better in a glass of hot hot water we're going to need a pot you want your pot to be super clean there cannot be even a speck of dust or dirt in your pot because it will cause your syrup to crystallize now you want a spatula and your candy thermometer that's pretty much all you need so to get started we're gonna get started in just one moment all right so we are gonna combine we're gonna put in our sugar or 1 cup of water and our quarter teaspoon of citric acid and we're gonna stir that till the biggest sugar begins to dissolve and any sugar crystals that are on the side you want to make sure to wash down we'll do that in a minute and if I change you see anything in your sugar at all any dust or any little particles whatsoever make sure that they come out because I said anything at all in your sugar will cause it to crystallize and sometimes things happen you get little little dust or little pieces of stuff I said then wash down any sugar crystals off of the side and then we're going to turn our heat on to medium high you want to make sure that your pot is always in the center of the burner so that you're getting proper even heat distribution not where your sugar is cooks prop evenly and so we're gonna continue to stir this until our syrup starts to boil the moment it begins to boil you're gonna stop stirring it stirring once it starts boiling will actually cause your syrup to crystallize and we need to avoid that at all costs so just continue stirring until it begins to boil and wash down and in between keep the washing down the sides of your pot for any sugar crystals whatsoever like literally one crystal will cause your your syrup to crystallize so although it's really easy to make it is very finicky when you're stirring it's also very important to take your spatula and go right around the edge of the pot the sugar likes to settle in on the edges so you want to make sure that nothing's sitting because otherwise if it sits to the bottom it will will stick and cause you problems so the reason why inverted sugar is so finicky and while any crib one single crystal or dust will cause it to crystallize because what we're making is a what's called a supersaturated solution so I don't know if you remember science class see that science stuff does come back to you if you you made saturated solutions and supersaturated solutions where you add a saturated solution is where you have water in salt you have us salt to its maximum saturation point in its water once you go one crystal beyond that it becomes what's called a supersaturated solution and that is what we're making here because we start out first of all with a saturated solution the two cups - 1 cup of water tea cups of sugar - 1 cup of water creates a super create a saturated solution by cooking off the water we are now gonna have more sugar content than your water which then creates your supersaturated solution there you go science for the day you've learned your something new you're done oh sorry one thing I did forget is you're going to need the lid for your pot mine as you can see this one is too big for it if you don't have the right lid no big deal just use them flipped over they work just as good so you definitely need the lid to your pot because once we stop cooking this we're gonna put the lid on it immediately now as soon as it starts to boiling you're gonna stop stirring it you're not going to stir it anymore from this point on you're going to add your candy thermometer and we are gonna cook the syrup to 230 for between 234 and 237 if you want a little bit of a looser syrup then 234 if you want it a little bit thicker than 237 but you're not gonna go beyond that and the only thing now that we're gonna do through the cooking process is wash down the sides of any sugar crystals form that it's the only thing you want to make sure that's equal that's it that we're going to do through the process so keep an eye on the thermometer goes fairly quickly don't walk away don't go be hitting the bong or anything silly like that and as I said as soon as it hits 234 you're gonna wash down any crystals that may be on the sides and then we remove it immediately from the heat place the lid on it and put it on your counter or a stone block and you're not going to touch it again until it's room temperature it is very important that it doesn't get agitated or moved in its cooling process because any agitation again can cause it to crystallize now if your sugar does start to crystallize at any point not a big not a huge deal put it on low heat re melted and it should be fine so as it's boiling while it's boiling into all the sugar melts the crystals can splash up onto the side so said just keep a very close eye and if you've got which imma call it screws here normally there's little bolts here on your pot where the handle make sure to clean around there because the sugar likes to hide in on those and the sugar also will gather behind the thermometer but I only tend to move that one time near the end of the cooking process because as I said you don't want to be agitating your sugar at all so when my syrup gets close to to 29 to 30 is when I will gently move the candy thermometer and wash the crystals off in and behind mat and then gently move it back all right so my temperatures now at 234 I like to actually let mine go to about 237 I like it a little bit thicker so at about 236 I'm gonna pull it because your sugar does still tend to and continue to increase once you pull it off the heat so we're at 235 236 I'm going to remove the candy thermometer turn off my burner remit place it over on my back burner here cuz it's nice and cool wash off any crystals that may be there for the last time be very careful and then you're gonna place your lid on it and you're not going to touch the syrup again until it reaches room temperature as soon as it reaches room temperature you can use it you can either store it on your counter or you can put it in the fridge for up to six months and the one thing is you can transfer it to another container however any time I've ever done that I have it ended up crystallizing I guess the agitation of moving it from one container to another so I just tend to leave it in the pot that I cook it in so I always recommend if you're gonna do that use a pot that it's not your favorite so that if your it's off to the side for a couple of months you're not gonna miss it so I basically designate one pot for my syrup so I'm not gonna miss that pot if I'm if I need it for in the next couple of months and that's it for inverted sugar making your own corn syrup so this said this is I use it quite often in place of my corn syrup it's great if you do not have access to a corn syrup easily or like places in the UK that you really don't have corn syrup you've got I think it's called a golden syrup I'm not sure but now you can easily make your own well I hope you enjoyed that little tutorial there on how to do your own inverted sugar thank you very much for watching you have a great so that's my little tutorial there on a regular gummies and sugar sour coated gummies I hope you enjoyed that as always if you have any questions at all please don't hesitate to put them in the comments I'll get back to you as soon as they can I do apologize I do sometimes have a bit of a delay there I don't mean to but some life takes over sometimes but I do try to get back to everybody as I can and then here's our little of my little lemon and I did lemonade and or sorry kind of turned out like lemonade so there lemon and raspberry and these are there were little little puppies aren't they cute well good luck with your candy making and I'd love to hear how your how yours turned out and if you have any questions about the inverted sugar let me know and I hope you have an awesome rest of your day thank you so much for watching and if you're new here and you like the video I really do hope you subscribe take care have a wonderful awesome day [Music]", "-7N80ptxDCk": "hi everybody it's Brad with big family homestead and in this video we are making candy sweet awesome simple easy candy so let's get to it that's right we are making candy some friends of mine at church said they really liked watching these silly videos we make up and and all the different desserts and and sweet things but they said also that they like watching Animalia videos too so I started thinking to myself how could we do this I came up with the perfect solution cooking with animals how about that we're going to cook up some candy with animals how crazy and fun is that going to be if you're wondering has he lost his marbles the answer is probably yes but we're going to still cook some candy ax it's awesome it's easy basically going to show you the ingredients we're going to do it fun easy cheap cheap cheap and you should be able to make it and you know it only takes like 10 minutes so this is awesome stuff okay so four ingredients as always or generally speaking I should say if it's a complicated recipe I generally don't make it and this one is very very basic you really only have four things that are going to make this candy up you've got two cups of granulated sugar 2/3 cup of light corn syrup 3/4 cup of water and then some kind of a flavoring I'm going to show you up close what I got here this is a raspberry flavoring but it's from my believe Lord and Lord and oils raspberry flavor and you can use whatever you want I've even seen people using essential oils and all kinds of other things but we use those because it's pre-made pre-measured out easy to do I think it costs like 50 cents or something really really small so there you go ok for tools its basic stuff you're basically going to need a saucepan a spatula and you're going to need a cookie sheet or whatever kind of form you want to pour it into if you're going to make lollipops you could get little forms for them or dinosaurs or even ape-like looking things that would be crazy candy candy apes but yeah anything whatever floats your boat you will also need a thermometer to monitor the temperature of your soon to be deliciousness in candy yay okay now that we've got our ingredients sorted we're going to heat up our saucepan and I'm going to need help from my lovely assistant David because it would be truly a silly thing for me to be cooking with a rabbit in my hand so here is my lovely assistant David ha the hammer the cannon DJ magic snappy pants whatever you want to call up so he's getting the saucepan ready and we've got our thermometer because basically all you're going to do is you're going to heat these ingredients up to 300 degrees they're going to boil then as it's cooling down you're going to stir in your lovely raspberry Ness for us it's raspberry nice it's whatever flavoring you want and that's it then you put it on your tray it'll spread itself out and as it cools down you cut it so here we go let's get it going over a medium-high heat so now as David's putting ingredients in I want to make a note there if you see that thermometers stick the sticky thermometer you basically don't want it touching the bottom or also will give you a false reading but you do want to make sure that's fully into your mixture here and in goes the water and now it's simply a waiting game as the temperatures coming up to 300 degrees you do want to make sure that you're stirring it regularly you're looking for a boil make sure that you're checking that temperature you don't want to get it too hot or you will burn it now you do want to keep stirring but when when you reach 260 degrees then you're going to stop stirring because it's going to continue to elevate in temperature that's already at a mass a critical mass critical critical mass and it's going to keep getting hotter so basically at 260 you stop and then it should start to clear up okay so we have just now crested the 260 degree mark so we will no longer be stirring we will still be waiting oh yes we will be waiting alright so now we're keeping an eye on the temperature like good little Scouts that we are but keep in mind that the last few degrees the last 10 15 degrees jumped quickly so you got to be ready to get this off the heat then you're going to stir it up again as you add your flavoring and then on to your form we just crested 300 degrees we've taken our goo off the heat we're adding our flavouring we're going to stir it up and pour it into what we're using for form is just our cookie sheet so we're going to take that thermometer off there be careful keep in mind this is 300 degrees stuff and if it sticks to you it will stick for a while it will burn the stew out of you be very careful so here we go now we're like I said we're just using a cookie sheet for our form because we're going to cut it into squares you just pour it on and it will spread out just like that now some of you might be saying yourself right now hey inner chubby guy why don't you lick the spoon that would be a terrible idea it might tear off your tongue it's very hot don't do it resist the urge all right let's see if this thing is cooled down it's been about 15 minutes what you do is you just take a regular little pizza cutter you're going to score this yeah like that into whatever size of shapes pieces you want now if it's not see that if it's not ready it'll just kind of blob back over itself and the idea is not you're not cutting it we're just trying to get it to a score so that when it actually does get completely hard then it will break apart very easily now if you let this go too long it will start to break right away so there's a sweet spot it's usually about 10 or 15 minutes oh so you look started to blob back together the edges are fine I got to wait so we'll wait another five now at this point it's all gridded up and it's not going to blob together anymore and if you were a normal person you would just let that sit there for a good 40 minutes or whatever but well let's just say I'm abnormal and I'm also not very patient so into the freezer you go baby all right so we very impatiently waited and reluctantly waited and waited and now it's done it's ready so basically you can just take and crack it bust it out of here however you need to do it I can sometimes get under here with a knife which was exactly one we'll do right now so now you have made candy delicious delicious candy one more step that we do is well actually take some powdered sugar and dust this stuff with it shake it around I mean this this little container is not big enough we'll do it in a bigger container but the reason for that is it helps it not stick together which is really nice so there you have it folks cheap easy delicious homemade candy it literally cost us maybe 50 cents for everything and in the great part is you know what you're getting you know there's no nasty weirdo chemicals no asbestos or fungal material well anyway I hope you liked the video and the animals so there you have it I'm Brad with big family homestead please pass the video around yes we're silly it's just silly here anyway have an amazing day that is one lazy dog one lazy dog indeed", "3K9NKiL29Gk": "today we're going to be doing a taste test video

ingestion or uptake or effect whatever you're comfortable with chances are we've got it for our first edible I want to talk about gummies gummies are the most popular edible and we've got the kiva camino gummies today they're cannabis infused gummies but they also add terpenes which is unique that gives it more of a indica or sativa feel just really nice tasting Class E gummies these are wild berry it got a pineapple habanero flavor a blend I'm apricot and my personal favorite the sparkling pear Prosecco next we've got sublingual strips sublingual strips are a small tab that you put in your mouth and let dissolve on your tongue you may know cookies and brownies as your typical ingestion method but what's unique about these is that those other edibles take up to two hours to take effect whereas sublingual effects you can start feeling it in 15 to 40 minutes you don't run into that this isn't hitting it's been an hour and nothing's working I'm gonna slam some more and then two hours it all hits and you're done and finally we've got tea now cannabis and tea have been a match made in heaven since time immemorial I find that this slightly caffeinated green tea is a really nice chill but focused way of ingestion it's absorbed through the stomach so this is another faster method than digestion and what I find with tea is that as you sip it it comes on in sips as opposed to like a boom there are different types of tea this is a caffeinated green tea there's non-caffeinated herbal tea this has a little blend of CBD as well really nice for chilling out so those are some of

here if public displays confection the machine we're using was made by Jay Gardner probably prior to 1855 somewhere around then he gave us company to his stepson Thomas Mills and the company name changed we're going to make three flavors peach plum and cherry and we're going to mix them with the colors on the table we pour the sugar on our candy cooling table this will drop the temperature dramatically and then we'll use our little wooden spoons and we'll stir in food coloring and flavoring boiling out the water that's in either of them because water makes candy sticky you this machine is a dual-purpose machine the side we're using make snap stick and the other side adds a texture that allows the candy to being robed so you can make chocolate covered toffee or something like that snaps two candies type of candy that you break off pieces from the stick has a texture on it that allows you to snap off little bits that you can pop into your mouth and our snap stick candy we've

that's the first thing i saw when i made this the first time i was like why does it go brown because you kicked it how you doing girl all right i put this on when i get off a line like the minute i get offline my temperature goes from high high to low low although it gets cool in here it gets way way cooler in here which is magical for me all right so what we're gonna do now is why is it like that ah all right so now what i'm gonna do next is i'm gonna use my butter machine [Music] to make tincture all right now when i'm making tincture if i can i'd much prefer to use fresh herb i would take the herb i would put it into the crock pot with glycerin this is the glycerin that i use this is a vegetable glycerin that i use it's my favorite um i don't like it to come in this bag because that's a but it's but that's what they had so this was this is a gallon uh it's always better to buy more if you know that you're gonna cook a lot so um anyways all right so i am going to be so i would normally do it that way if i had fresh herb i don't have fresh herbs so i did the carving yeah yeah yeah all right so we did the carving which it went into the stove i i grinded it up i put it in the oven on 220 for 40 minutes all right now i'm going to use this this machine because why do why why this does it for you so all i have to do is plug it in and then press on it for tincture and then that cooks i think it's i want to say i want to say that it is um look at this did whenever they give you i swear to you like i don't know why they think the companies think that this is good like you must keep it exactly next to the outlet in order to get this thing to plug in and whatever you need to have a three prong anyways that is with all my thing all of them all my machines all my machines that i cook with freaking they all have the same the same exact one they must have a deal amongst each other all right so what i'm gonna do is um this is gonna i'm gonna put like a little bit about two cups in here of the glycerin because there will be no point me putting two cups of freaking glycerin into a uh into a crock pot it looks like my crock pot is that small but it's not a mess all right i could see down here so just letting y'all know all right what'd i do with the camp what i did with the cat if i leave it up here i will for surely spill it all right easy enough we're gonna dump this in now there's another um there's a there's a medium that you can use it's called um uh lecithin okay you can put that lecithin like uh like a teaspoon and you can throw that in there and let it go ahead and mix with that that's will help the um it will help the marijuana to bond to your medium you could be putting in here anything you could be coconut oil in here extra virgin olive oil you could be sleeping flipping vegetable oil you could be doing butter this process is all the same okay all right all right all right so all i'm gonna do at this point is plug this in hey chad how you doing what's going on that's okay carolyn that's okay that's okay no worries no worries okay so you got replay all right so i'm gonna put this and now i don't know how long this is gonna we're just gonna put that on top like that and i'm gonna plug it in let's see see this is how about how much room i got but i'll be able to let me put it on um [Music] oh no don't go it went too fast all right wait i don't really okay okay listen i'm a little bit stupid sometimes so bear with me all right because i'm seeing it funny all right so when you plug it in i i'm trying to make it so you guys can see it and whatever all right so the select will go on and then it will and then you press start okay so the tincture is four hours all right and that's it the only thing that sucks about this machine it's great for everything except for the fact that it has this horrendous spinning sound which is not it's spinning it's the spinner it's the sound from the spinner but it's like scary a little bit so you kind of have to get used to it i'm just making glycer uh tincture that's it it's great to see you too in here hey christina how you doing sweetheart and i'm not even cooking anything good maybe i could cook something good i was gonna put some pizza in the oven but i do need to make like cake or something i bought cake too i bought you know what i bought i bought um i bought muffins i don't even have any muffins i don't even have my muffin plates what the hell did the top of that thing go i don't know why i don't have that top to this that's so funny i look down and my glycerin's still down there and i don't know i don't see it still don't see the top there's such a mess going on here hey jamie so all right so that's really all there is i mean you know when it comes to cooking with cannabis here's the thing what little dog are you gonna stop me it's gonna stop because he's not hanging on me i found it all you do is clean up a little bit around you freaking mess here all right there you go hi faith how you doing what was i gonna say i was gonna say something about oh okay so cooking with cannabis the the worst part of cooking with cannabis is the beforehand the fact that you have to cook your something for four hours when you put this when you make this like if if you're making just brownies right and well you need something to go with that so you either need to make butter coconut oil or tincture one of the one any one of those would be fine right glyphs with glycerin uh if you do it all in one day it's exhausting but if you make your this is when it comes for what i have in my brain it's better for you to cook with a large amount of cannabis first make your items and then have them ready to go for when you're ready to bake something not baking at all in one day my birthday is soon i don't know when is my birthday oh yeah looking at us in 10 days congratulations what are we congratulations um oh yeah oh yeah i was just on um the last video that i was doing my old girlfriend from when she was a child she has a grandbaby for the first time and i was just like oh my gosh so congratulations to all of you because that's freaking awesome what you see he's gonna wind back there when i got off a line all i did was come here come here he just wants to lay on me that's all he wants is to lay on me he wants to sit like this i give him a little scratch he falls asleep and then that's it and then i can do whatever it is i was doing so if i was watching tv or if i was looking at my phone or whatever it is no this little freaking idiot will whine and cry until he's he's on me i bet i bet i was a fake grandma to um boyfriend's um child and um not his child his child's child and it was yeah it was it was amazing i hopefully it didn't screw me for my own grandchild like my own blood grandchild i don't know what that will be but one day i hope my daughter doesn't think she wants to have children and um but she might want to adopt i was like i don't care if you would die like i don't really care that would be my grandbaby regardless you know what i'm saying that's my grandbaby bro give a [Music] i don't care i don't i don't care i don't care that's my grandbaby that's what i think you know that other grand that other baby was a fake grandbaby and i still treated it like it was my own right this is all he wants this is this is just what he wants here it goes hey what happened here what happened let's see what i don't know what happened but it turned off on me there it is it probably wasn't like i probably had it just unplugged enough well i am so glad that you are getting to enjoy that the the the that's just wonderful wonderful all right so that's the that's the whole lesson like i really don't have more of a lesson than that [Laughter] uh because well all right he actually is a good boy but um my my uh my uh bambi my other dog my well that's not my dog but he was my foster dog he's eight years old and his previous everything freaky he pissed everywhere so when he came in he was pissing everywhere and then he would be he would ah go behind and you know mock because that one mocked so the other one wears a diaper and so this one wears a diaper too i'm keeping my house clean [Laughter] so and you know here's the thing is though i take off his diaper for the most part as long as i haven't like he lets me know when he has to go to the bathroom so i'll let him out and he will hold it the other one won't um so when i take his diaper off there is nothing there but i'm always scared because the uh he'll see what happens is he'll see bambi go and lift his legs up on something even though he's got the diaper on if he doesn't have his diaper on he'll go over right behind it so i'm i'll get screwed i'm trying to get bambi i actually uh wasn't this i don't know if it was this morning or um yesterday morning where i was surprised that bambi did not his his diaper wasn't wet and i was i was very surprised with that right does him don't care him just want to sleep on me that's all he wants he just wants to see and he knows that if he gets into this position that he's kind of golden because i can still work with him and he knows because he's only freaking five pounds i can he can reasonably get away with being stuck in there and me just continuing to do whatever i do all right let's do it cheers and then i'm out um i'm gonna be cooking though too i'm gonna be back tomorrow unless for some reason i wind up getting a date tomorrow night i've been ghosted by this other guy like i can't even believe i've been ghosted by this other guy i'm exhausted listen it's hard to tell people listen here i want to be your wife but i want to have a garden in the basement look at this mess and he'll just sleep there oh see yeah it's the it's him i'd be golden with him like literally if i didn't have that dog this dog would have five stars he doesn't because he's with him he's the perfect single dog um if he had a female he'd be all right like if you in that in when you have get when you put the same breed together you need to put feet a male and a female when you put the the same sex they are not good with each it doesn't matter what breed you use so whenever if you go to put like other it's better to put different breed dogs of the same sex if you're going to put the same sex i used to have a uh i used i used to do dog rescue used to it's in my bio oh that would oh oh oh oh oh you know what that would have sucked like if having a big dog and having to them to go to the bathroom on the floor oh that's rough so i was someone said someone i was looking at the freaking tick tock and you know i'm scrolling through because i'm just looking for anything at this i'm bored and i'm i'm having a weird thing going on over here i am lonely and lonely like lonely i'm just lonely i'm in that lonely space um and someone was talking about um there's a big dog and and they were doing something that she was like i peed in the floor and but i did it in the bathroom it's a big dog i'm like oh my god i can't i like i can't you know what my ex's dog he would lift his leg but he was mocking he wasn't like peeing pain the things that i talked about during my life right so that hap that will now happen every is it like 10 minutes every 10 minutes for the next  four hours i should have did it for tomorrow because with this machine like if i am cooking in my crock pot i can leave it in there overnight you know and just heat it up and then it will be good for me to go to to to um to uh strain it so uh if i you know i'm i'm awake i'm always awake uh what time is it it is nine o'clock i'm for surely going to be awake when this finishes i will go live i'll be exhausted and i'll look like  and i'm different clothes on probably no bra even though look at this i'm freaking hanging out i'm hoping the boy will just freaking jump in my skirt holy i sound so desperate don't i unbelievable yeah that thing's scared yeah so that will go off for the next four hours like that with when i do in the crock pot i just throw it in there after i leave it on high for an hour wait till this the the the herb turns brown then i put it down to low and i keep it on low for like 24 hours to 48 hours it's got a lot of herb in there and a lot of um like i have the whole freaking plant ugh one of my guys told me something about getting like cheap weed from someone and he told me how much it was it was and i was like it was like it's ten dollars cheaper what are you kidding me well i need to find me a sugar baby i'm a well no because i don't want to pay them i don't have the money to deal with that i don't have that kind of money i could probably give them i could probably give them edibles but not even anyways tick tock is terrible it is it's a terrible place uh because well guys are twofold because i create and because of the creating and the watching but ruth ruth so and so and that's bad okay i don't watch tv i only watch tv since this whole pandemic  started uh ruth something died she was in the lgbtq plus community um uh she was the the uh should judge um but it's a great loss be like there were people on tick tock like crying crying that um she has passed away and i'm and i know that they don't know her but she was that impactful to them so like i get it and i'm not making fun of them but at the point at first i was like what are you crying for but and i was like i get it i get it supreme court justice thank you thank you thank you thank you yes yes yes very very very sad yes yes that there it is oh the cops the cops christina the cops huh find me a sugar baby [Laughter] listen i am a more of a i'm more of a dominatrix type person where that's just my personality in that area i don't know i just think i need something different than that than young [Laughter] all right i'm doing cheers i'll be back with this crap later cheers thank you for joining i'll see you guys later right little baby dog peace y'all", "ARd8oVjSftc": "hey guys what's up and welcome back to nostalgia unboxings today i have an interesting item i ordered some handmade candies from the lofty pursuits website if you don't know what uh lofty pursuits is it is uh it is another youtube channel albeit one much bigger than mine currently is that uh they make candy essentially because uh i guess the guy his name is greg owns a little candy shop uh down in florida and he decided to start filming the candy making process and it's really cool i'm a big fan of the channel just uh i like watching it before i go to sleep kind of at night when they make a new episode although because of the uh current events they have not been able to make an episode recently since you know they can't open the shop because of uh corona i don't think so that kind of blows but yeah it's uh so he gives a whole rundown of like the whole candy making process he shows it from step one all the way until it's all nice and done in little candy form and it's really interesting like a lot of the history behind certain flavors certain candy shapes stuff like that it's all you know stuff you don't really think about and then you hear it and you go wow that's a lot more interesting than i expected it to be since we're just talking about like a congealed brick of sugar but yeah it's a pretty great channel they tape this thing up really well so uh i have three okay that definitely went through i have three different flavors here today inside this box or at least i should unless they mess something up there we go using my animal strength i have popped open the box whoa okay so uh i'm going to move the box out of the camera since there's a exposed slip with some information at the very bottom so these are the bags they're not too big i guess but it also depends on how fast you go through candy if you have some uh self-control then you could make these last for quite a while uh the total price was i think i paid like 25 bucks honestly like including shipping for all three of these bags which isn't terrible considering they're all you know nice handmade uh candies in small batches and the cool part is most of these you can actually go to their channel and watch it being made which is freaking cool like that's so cool to me i don't know it's not something you really ever get to see with any other food more or less i mean unless you're like the hibachi girl but this is candy so the three flavors i picked out um i went for the more kind of unique interesting stuff so we have these um these are the whorehound and marshmallow cough drops you see they have like it says cough right there uh these are a lot of the candies also he makes on like machines that are like 200 years old um from like back in the victorian era which is awesome and that includes these like cough drop actual um well you can't see it's on this side the cough drop stamps which is really really cool but we will start with these ones i will keep all the other flavors secret for when we actually get to them delightfully devilish so it pops open it's a nice receivable bag too which i gotta give them credit that's a really really nice touch i do have a little paper towel so i do not accidentally get any sticky candy on my uh on my little filming surface here which is also doubles as my bed so it says what is that dullen i think it says dahlin it's very hard to mullen there we go it says mullen i can see it now so that was the original company that owned the press that they're using now which is pretty cool oh sorry about that and then cough so i'm going to try this right now and let you know what i think of it oh okay so in the video he explained what hor hound actually tastes like i very much agree with what he said he said that it's a very licorice flavor and it is a very very licorice flavor if you're not a fan of licorice i would definitely not i'll not get the hounded marshmallow ones there's also no marshmallow flavor at all to them because um they're not actually flavoring it with marshmallow they're just using the actual marshmallow root from the plant that it's derived from and rather than giving flavor i guess what it does and what they used it for back in the day so they use basically an original recipe for this it was um it kind of moistens up your throat to help relieve your coughing and um yeah it works personally i am a fan of licorice so these are delicious [Applause] really like them um i'm sure you know your grandparents might enjoy these types of flavors more than a lot of the zoomers out there but these are good i'm really satisfied with these ones jump cut it took me took me just a little while to finish crunching up that uh candy so this video didn't take three hours next up we have pickle dill pickle flavored candy i'm a big um i love like dill pickle flavors being a a slav so to speak hailing from lithuania i am a huge fan of all these kinds of pickley things so i'm assuming i will actually enjoy this one even though the flavor does sound very weird pop the bag open we have little pickle itself kind of translucent no fancy um stamp on it or anything and now let's get right to it okay so it doesn't taste as much of like as the pickle itself if that makes sense it tastes more like kind of the brine what the pickle would be and you know in the jar very kind of vinegary acid flavor and honestly yeah i like it it's really good man i'm i'm pretty used to like super weird flavors i guess so maybe these don't phase me as much as they would someone else who you know grabs a piece of candy and wants it to taste like candy i guess the stereotypical candy flavor rather than pickle juice but yeah they're really good um i should also add that this video is in no way sponsored my lofty pursuits i'm just a fan of the channel and always wanted to you know try some of the candy that i watched them making and thought hey that made a good video i think so here we are i also show off their logo here this is a a caricature of greg himself the owner who provides all the voicing for the the videos on the channel seems like a great guy he has such a relaxing voice too so 10 out of 10 on that front but yeah lofty pursuits and you can buy these candies if you want um they are made pretty small batches so i can't guarantee that all these can these same flavors will be available when you guys go on there but they have like 50 flavors at any one time more or less so you should be fine finding something that will tickle your fancy so it'll be at www.pd.net and i'll link to that also in the description and stuff for sure the actual candy store i believe is called public displays of confection and it's in tallahassee florida as greg states in every video and a final jump cut hopefully we move on to the final flavor and what i think is gonna be the weirdest one because i actually don't even know exactly what the flavor is this is the um forbidden fruit candy is what they called it and it might be hard to see i will try to pull one out but these are actually these are based on tide pods uh hopefully not the actual flavor of tide pods because i can only imagine that going very bad but uh i guess they made their own flavor mixed something up in house that tasted very strange and unique and maybe what you would expect a tide pod to taste like given its colors and here we go it kind of looks like a berry i think used um a berry drop mold for this since they didn't they probably didn't have their own like special tide pod molds but they did swirl all the candy around with the color so you know it kind of gets the point across especially on this side and i'm kind of nervous because i really hope this actually tastes good and they didn't just like pull an epic prank on everyone here but uh oh them it's really tart it's like sour i did not expect that what are these other flavors it's definitely it's definitely berries some sort of berries i'm gonna go out on a limb and see maybe maybe like raspberry flavor but there's definitely like several things mixed in here but the tartness definitely makes me think of like blue raspberry maybe lemonade it's really good though it's super fruity and soury so if you're into any of those kinds of flavors just to be right up your alley it's really really good honestly out of all three of these this is my favorite one um i'll probably rank the pickle one last even though i did enjoy it but i did enjoy the other ones a bit better i really do like the licorice flavor of this one it's very like i don't know it kind of makes you relax when you're eating it it's just like on one of those like chill flavors i guess if that makes any sense i don't know maybe i'm just a really weird eater and can associate flavors with kind of feelings and stuff but um yeah this one is really good but this is definitely this definitely takes the cake because it's a very these are very simple flavors where it's like you know just kind of briny and acidy and this one's just pure licorice almost whereas this one has like it's really complex it's got all those weird fruit notes going around there like that lemonade blue raspberry vibe and then that citric acid the sourness it was really good ah here forbidden fruit two uh i guess they made a couple versions of this and um because the first one from what i understand what it said on the site was a limited run and but it was like so much that they're like you know we gotta make it again and then they made it again and we got this and it is good so it works and uh congratulations to pd.net and lofty pursuits aha see they don't tell us so it says artificial flavors natural and artificial colors make me just a coconut oil huh i don't think i've ever seen them actually put coconut oil into candy on the on the channel so i wonder if that's like maybe like a lubricant or something but yeah that's very good i will probably finish this candy this particular one off screen but that's about it for the video this really didn't come in handy at all i guess but uh thank you so much for watching i hope you enjoyed watching me test these kind of very strange and somewhat historic candy flavors i'm really thankful that they actually all ended up being good and i didn't like throw up on camera because that would be bad but yeah i hope you guys enjoyed and if you aren't a subscriber already i would really appreciate it if you hit that subscribe button like or disliked and dropped a comment you know telling me what you think do you think these candies are good have you tried them do you want to try them uh are you a fan of lofty pursuits in general stuff like that it would all be great to hear since my comments seem to have not been very active so far and i would like to just interact with people because i think it's fun to you know hear other people's opinions and whatnot so yeah uh see you guys make a new video every saturday so i hope to see you there next time everyone have a good one bye bye [Music] you", "zaml88FpweU": "all right what is up everybody Jacobs back with another video for you guys quarantine video I've been staying at home that's about it some exciting [ __ ] for you guys this time though

but which I don't like but I feel like this is gonna be a really good high so I wanna like have it last the majority of the day instead of like taking it like later in the afternoon then falling asleep like halfway through the high or some [ __ ] I don't know got these for $25 from the not from like directly from a dispensary but from a friend of mine so yeah there's a pretty good price I think if you were to go to like a dispensary or something they usually charge $10 per hundred milligrams so kind of a good deal but yeah I'll show you these guys again know if you can see right down there 500 milligrams yeah 500 huh so yeah let's dig in so that's pretty cool just like I don't know little sour patch kids they don't look quite the same the sugar is kind of weird it looks wet and another thing it says on the back here five servings per container serving size one piece but there's like just way more than five pieces in that I don't know if you guys can see but we're taking doesn't taste like weed at all it's a lot better than that nerd rope I had that [ __ ] was like I don't think I like nerds I don't know but I did eat like a banana like I think an hour or 45 minutes ago just to sort of like activate my metabolite I don't know but oh yeah and something else I forgot like I figured like people would just figure did I do it that way but like I keep like I got a lot of comments on the last one I did like the nerd rope the nerd rope 400 milligram edible I think it was there were a lot of people that like just thought that video was like one video or like one time I think like I just got a bunch of like comments that were like you know edibles take longer than 10 minutes to hit and I was like well you really think I've like a weed Tube channel and I don't know the edibles don't hit immediately after you eat them so I mean I don't know I mean but just this isn't gonna be the whole video like I'm gonna check back in like an hour two hours whenever I start like really feeling high and that's gonna be me then later so alright cleared the whole bag we're out of these shits so I'm gonna check in and like last like an hour maybe two hours maybe three hours however long this takes to take effect yeah I'm gonna take one more head of this [Music] little baby hit but yeah I'll check back in with you guys about two hours or so so peace alright so check him back in guys it is now 2:30 so it's been about three or four hours and I am [ __ ] high I'm so high like I just feel like good and like cozy like I don't know in movies right now I'm on yes man with Jim Carrey shit's hilarious but yeah I just been chilling and I had two bowls of cereal but ya know how feelings [ __ ] good this is like holy [ __ ] this light that I have for the lighting like he's really [ __ ] bright yeah I would definitely recommend these who these things are [ __ ] dope they smacked me in the face cuz holy [ __ ] I'm I like him actually like I don't know I feel pretty good about him at least right now edible you know just kind of chill cuz yesterday I got like I drank so much like an I passed out I'm so tired and I threw up it was just like a horrible day so this just yeah it's a lot nicer everything like I don't know everything I look at like specifically focus on like looks very like clear and like clean but then everything else behind it is it like such an intense like a blur well yeah I'm just really chilling you know like this I like I said this is definitely a [ __ ] fire edible I [ __ ] with this i 100% recommend it but I'm other than that I have no idea what to talk about I kind of just want to know getting my [ __ ] back get in my bed and watch this movie so yeah I'll take one last rep I haven't been smoking too much we're hiding actually I had a couple reps of this like I think three hours in or so not too long ago he's dying but I did that because I was like kind of feeling the body high a little bit but I was just like nervous that it wasn't gonna be intense enough for whatever reason sometimes he sings some like a [ __ ] hit or miss but yeah so I smoked and then I like got really high and yeah I think I'm like getting maybe close to like the full effect I don't know how long this will last but I think usually the potent ones are the more potent the longer it lasts so maybe it's still building up but either way I'm just trying to chill out so I hope you guys are smoking I hope you guys enjoyed the video [ __ ] sour patch dummies stay high stay lifted stay quarantine stay clean and peace everybody", "S4zjNt10xYA": "hey lovely people so I just wanted to do a quick update and review of stony patch stony patch edibles because I noticed that in the video and the first video I posted about this edible a lot of people were telling me this isn't what they were getting so poor oh wow like the first five times I went to go purchase this in DC they came in a cube shape like this there was just like cubes and very chewy like they're just like a barian gummy type of edible now this is the first time so I've been purchasing these things for a couple of months now and this is the first time I'm actually getting the pack that people are talking about which look exactly like the original sour patch kids and they look like this okay so I'm just gonna eat one right now this is the first time I'm seeing them looking tasting and feeling like actual sour patch occasion I have to admit that when I tried these compared to the ones I had been getting before these the ones that look like sour patch is are less powerful less potent I got what I would eat like - I really wouldn't feel anything but these I would need like a half of one of a half of one of these squares and it would be good the texture is different as well so I really don't know what's going on according to both packages they both have the same ingredients they both say they are in compliance with the CA prop 215 SB 4 xx section blah blah blah I'm sure there's some type of DC law but I don't know um so yeah maybe I would have to eat more of the sour patch kids ones in order to feel something but the other ones we're buying like I am not sure why they're such a difference but yeah I just wanted to make it update to let you guys know that I did I finally know what you're talking about when you're saying oh my pad looks just like the sour patch cake okay I get it I know I know what you're talking talking about now but when I like I said like when I first started getting these for the first time they look like the squares like this this is like what I was introduced to when I was interested introduce this Tony fetch as a product so yeah I'm wonder with that Bell no idea everybody look it up anyway if you have any questions comment

Johns County Sheriff's Office arrested Joshua waking who they say was supposed to have the drugs delivered to his home by mail from Colorado deputies seizing thirty five thousand dollars worth of drugs oh dear guess we're robbing Colorado yeah are you surprised no why not well since Colorado passed a law legalizing marijuana um the dispensaries are all over and you know it is a concern about the gummy bears said that looked like that I bumped into Theresa brink who's visiting from Colorado she wasn't surprised to hear this story saying these candies are all over Colorado where marijuana is now legal they're laced to a THC a chemical extracted from marijuana everybody's talked about it because it's such an easy thing that you think your child could easily get confused if they were at a party somewhere or something like that and they didn't know exactly what they were taking parents weren't happy to hear about this showing up in st. Johns County what if my six-year-old twins so what if they took it and something happened or if you got ahold of it I mean it's not safe at all this is the second case like this in st. Johns County this year last week I brought you a similar story when a man was arrested in Atlantic Beach also for having drugs that resembled candy in his vehicle commander Chuck Mulligan with the st. Johns County Sheriff's Office says this should be a reminder for parents particularly around Halloween I don't believe that someone who's doing on a drug trade for for profit if you will in distribution would hand it out freely to children but then again you don't know and that is a concern every year parent should be paying attention during Halloween for their kids candy and what goes in their bag but especially now because my understanding is that Colorado has seen some of these instances and not just Colorado but any of the states that have the legalize marijuana in their states currently that kids are getting their hands on this and the man who's been arrested from st. Augustine Beach is facing charges for possession as well as distribution and sale of narcotics it also faced federal charges because as these apparently were transported through the u.s. mail Scott Johnson Channel four the local station", "NtGmqEIz9to": "[Music] another review and today I'm doing candy yeah I'm doing baked Bros gummy bears again these are baked pros gummy bears this entire contrack ajiz 150 milligrams of THC 10 milligrams each piece and there is 15 pieces in here so 15 doses and this actually has directions on the bag most of them normally don't but it says start with one dose which is 10 milligrams I love worth up to 90 minutes for effects and consumers needed suggested use temporarily reduces pain stimulates appetite sleep aid and relief of nausea okay so again baked pros gummy bears 10 milligrams each you know guys you know I'm a lightweight so I'm just gonna start with wine right I'm going to cut into this right now I need to cut it again because evidently I didn't cut below the seal this cut low enough that I'm not cutting all right to hit me and just because I'm going for I get it so honey bear squishy yeah Oh something got put the sugar around it because he's very cannabis II and you know I tend to stray away from edibles that have a strong lead taste because I just don't like the V taste that's a personal thing you might I'm glad I read this it says testing accuracy plus or minus three milligrams of THC per piece oh and that's the thing would be good you kind of always don't know exactly how much teach so you're getting and that's why it's best you're like you know trouble I'm and then wait a little bit before you try nothing but they're gummy bears and they're good it's like to me once you get past that initial taste of it like the cannabis taste hmm I guess the sweetness other kind of mellows that out a little bit to me and they're good they taste like gummies you know like gummy bears but growing up and coming beers right and these are things that these especially when you start talking on gummy treats and things like that candy that kids normally eat or that they gravitate towards if you're medicating that way please you know make sure that you're keeping those out of the reach I mean seriously because for them all they see is gummy bear they don't really understand any of this other stuff okay so now that I'm done this is going back into my weed safe and again yes I can have a week I do have a weed safe and I try to keep my things away I have four kids to a grown and then the two youngest or in their team so just because sometimes it's candy and it might look you know killing even though they're old enough to understand what it is I still keep it you know am i safe just you know to keep it away from him but faith grows very good and as far as um I mean there's 15 in here so I mean this is a good amount to dose with okay and when I bought this actually bought this Micra so it's been a while but the price says $31 again baked bros and so many other companies out there they always they're always offering you know not always but sometimes they're specials that you can catch at your dispensary and there are places like weed Maps who else but I go to online they will actually send me notices about different specials that dispensaries are having and a lot of the companies offer you know boku you know buy one get one so what might be you know $31 you may end up getting tuning and that's actually what I did I think for sure I didn't pay the full price for this I end up getting something free or it was on discount or something so like I always tell you be mindful about the specials and deals that your dispensaries have because you can I'm getting your medicine or action alright alright guys that is it so also available in 75 milligrams and 300 milligram bags so you have options okay alright I will talk to you guys later alright y'all take care [Music]", "UqzhgZjdpAo": "what's up everybody my name is Sara Vee and welcome back to the haze today I'm gonna be doing another review I'm gonna be viewing the BAM Camino by the very famous brand Kiva confection now you probably recognize the name Kiba because of their chocolate products that you see at most stores they're very well known for them they're very very delicious but today I'm gonna be talking about their gummies now this is the Bliss they do other flavors but I'm gonna be talking specifically about the Bliss which is their hybrid gummy let's talk a little bit about this awesome container it comes in a tin container which I really love it keeps the flavor really nice and fresh it is all summer themed and in the front they'll tell you how much milligrams which is a hundred for the entire one in every little gummy is five milligrams in the back it will also give you you know all the nutrition facts that you're counting your calories if you're trying to get high on a diet that will be there for you to open it it's just a quick little push down and turn voila and you'll find your gummies on the inside too it does give you a little bit more information on why they're called Caminos which I really love when an edible company kind of gives you that it kind of sets the scene it gets you in the mood for getting high every little gummy looks like this look at that little gummy how cute it is and it is five milligrams now the taste is delicious they're very tasty they're nice and sweet they're not crazy crazy good but they kind of remind you of movie theater candy like chewy sweet and something you just want to shove in your mouth all day for the high because these come with 20 of five milligrams your will needle II eat a lot of candy to really get super blown if you're willing to go down that road more power to you're willing to down twenty of these but I would say this edible is best use and best for people who are trying to micro dose specifically for the fact that every one of those little gummies is five milligrams if you're kind of a lightweight or you're doing something that you don't need to be high doesn't it take a little bit of the edge off even one or two of these or eating just one or even half of one if you're looking for a 2.5 is really great and it makes micro dosing so much easier with these guys yeah I can't say enough about how how nice these are for micro dosing and how great these are for also traveling if you're someone who gets nervous going on an airplane or something like that these are great because you won't get to blown where you'll get like super paranoid but you'll get high enough to take a little bit of that edge off which is really great if you're looking for something and that's gonna get you super high if you're looking at like go to a party and you don't drink it but you want to be stoned as hell these I'd I wouldn't it wouldn't be my first choice maybe if you have a slower tolerance or you're just getting into edibles this is for you especially if this is gonna be your first edible a try splitting one of these small gummies is so easy and they have like had like a fake little line between them that can kind of give you a little idea where to split it right in the middle these are awesome if you are working from home like a lot of us are these are great for that too because you won't get high you won't feel stupid you can get your job done but it also helps with a little bit of shaving off a little bit of that anxiety which is great yeah if you guys see these which see them a lot I've seen the prices range I've seen them from twenty dollars all the way up to thirty dollars so I guess it just depends on what dispenser you pick them up from these were pretty average for me nothing crazy that's before tap that's after tax and everything so if you guys see them out of dispensary if you got some extra dollars in your pocket I would say pick up the Camino by the Kiva you won't be disappointed you'll get high you might not get superstone but you'll get there so alright guys well that's my review for the day my name is Sarah P again thank you so much for watching in the haze and I'll catch you next time [Music]", "uVrVyKUO5_c": "[Music] what's up friends welcome back today we have a little bit different video than you guys are used to so instead of giving you guys a exact follow the steps instructions this is gonna be more like you guys come along with me when i experiment so i like to try out different ways um that we can make different treats and a lot of times it turns out sometimes it doesn't um but i kind of just go with the flow and see what will happen i feel like no matter what you can always salvage your treats into something it may not be what you intended it to be but it'll always be delicious so for an example my intentions with this video was to create infused jolly ranchers and for them to be hard candy now that did not work out they ended up being a soft candy so i just kind of went with it and i thought it might be cool for you guys if you want to see my thought process and how i kind of decide to go with things when they go wrong so please let me know if you guys enjoyed this type of video or if you'd rather it be um here is like the guaranteed results from this step-by-step process [Music] all right let's get started here's what you're going to need some jolly ranchers or any hard candy that you enjoy some coconut oil or tincture citric acid and some infused sugar or regular sugar unwrap your jolly ranchers and then separate them into colors that you think would mix well once melted together i'm doing blue and green and the purple and reds now i'm setting up my double boiler and adding in my pink and red jolly ranchers they're mostly pink and i am using a total of 20 jolly ranchers now i'm adding in some lecithin and i'm just using my spatula because it is really hard to get off a spoon and then putting that back in and mixing it up now because i'm just doing a little experiment i decided that chamoy would taste really good with this jolly rancher mix since it's mostly all watermelon so i'm adding in two tablespoons of chamoy and then two tablespoons of infused sugar of course you could use regular sugar or you don't have to use chamoy i mean this is totally very flexible you can kind of flavor this to how you want you can put whatever creation you can come up with in there pretty much now i'm just waiting for this to melt over the double boiler it does take a long time i probably took about a half an hour to get to this point now that it's mostly melted i'm going to add in my coconut oil so i decided to add in three tablespoons there wasn't an exact reason for why i chose this amount it's just kind of like i said an experiment to see how it goes so we're going to mix that in and the oil is pretty tricky to combine with the mixture so i am going to use a whisk and just whisk that up really good just do it for a few minutes and it will come together very nicely and there is no problems getting this to emulsify just be persistent with stirring it until everything is nice and smooth like this so at this point it's pretty much ready to be refrigerated and like i said you guys can add whatever you like so if you want them to be very sour add some citric acid if you want them to have any sort of other flavor you know add it in anything is probably going to be just fine so then i now that this is all mixed together i'm going to pour it into a little dish because this is a smaller amount i'm just using a smaller dish so that i can get them to be thicker instead of very thin if they were spread out along a larger container this container had some grooves so i just filled it with some tinfoil so i could get the bottom to be flat and then place some wax paper inside of there um i had some issues with the wax paper if i was to do this again i would use parchment paper i just didn't have any on hand so then i'm going to pour this mixture into my little lined container and then i'm going to put it in the fridge to set i also just popped the little bubbles with a toothpick and then kind of just dropped it a bit to release any air bubbles um in the end because this turned out to be more like a starburst i didn't need to do that because i could have just squished it or molded it down with my finger okay so here it is after being in the fridge for probably about a half an hour and i was ready to score it because i was wanting these to be hard candy and you need to score these earlier on in the process so i'm just measuring it out and attempting to score it but it doesn't really hold my shape so i put it back in the fridge for another half an hour or so and then took it back out to score again and then i also sprayed my knife with some cooking spray so that it wouldn't stick now it's very malleable like i can reshape it really well and cutting it was fine but this was when i realized that this probably was no longer going to be a hard candy and it was going to be a soft candy so i cut all these shapes and then put them back in the fridge but they were kind of like they kept on molding back together so point being is that it needs to stay in the fridge a lot longer so i put them back in and then worked on making a coating for them so for these i thought they'd be absolutely delicious with a tahini coating so i started with one tablespoon of icing sugar one tablespoon of infused sugar and one tablespoon of tahini and then i tasted that and i felt like it needed more sugar so i added in some more sugar as well as some citric acid to make it more sour and then i tasted it again and it still felt like i wanted it to be quite a bit sweeter so i just added in the rest of my sugar and you guys there's no like exact measurements you just do this to what you think tastes good more sugar less sugar whatever you like and then i'm also going to grind this down in a food processor just to make it a little bit finer to coat my candies and then i poured it back into my container now these have been in the fridge for over an hour and while they were in there i'd go in with my knife and kind of just cut them so you can see they're still very squishy and like a soft candy nothing like a hard candy so that's a texture we're working with here now i'm just peeling them all off of this wax paper and you can see that it's stuck to the back of them quite a bit it was easy for me to get off but if i had used parchment paper there wouldn't have been that issue anyway so if you were to do this use parchment paper and not wax paper and then i separated them all and then put them into my tahin sour sugar coating and shook them all up then i put them back into the container as i was taking them out i could tell that they were very soft so i knew that these weren't going to be the type of gummies that were going to hold or not gummies the soft candies that were going to hold their shape outside of the fridge now that i've made these i've realized that in order to keep them out of the fridge we're going to need to add gelatin so let me know if you guys would like to see me do a recipe like that um but they look so good and of course i had to try one and they were so tasty like the watermelon jolly rancher chewiness with the sour sugary tahin coating and then the chamoy and the watermelon like i don't even know how i can explain how delicious that was but like so good now we're gonna do our batch of blue and greens using our tincture um these take forever to melt oh my goodness so yeah i left them on here for probably like a half an hour and then they finally were melting and make sure you guys are checking on the water in your double boiler i found that my water was going down fast and i constantly had to re-add it so just make sure you have enough water in there all the time okay so now after this has melted quite a bit i'm going to add in my tincture so we're doing one two three tablespoons and then to compensate for the extra liquid we're adding in three tablespoons of sugar i'm just using regular sugar because i don't know why i think i ran out of infused sugar anyways we're mixing that in and now we're going to add in some lecithin and i'm going to use my whisk to get that since we need to whisk this all together to get everything to emulsify so just stir that all up and get it to mix together and then i want these to be really sour because sour blue raspberry green apple like that's a good combination am i right okay so citric acid mix that in i had the candy thermometer in here because i was trying to make hard candy so we had to bring it to a certain temperature to allow that to happen um but in the end i realized it was not going to reach that temperature so i decided these are also going to be soft juice um which means i'm going to also add in some coconut oil so i'm just doing one tablespoon of this i could probably have added more but i just wanted to try using a little bit less since the three in the last recipe was a little bit soft now i'm adding in even more citric acid because i want these to be super sour like i've said before these recipes are extremely flexible if you're just making these for yourself it's not going to hurt if it's not exactly perfect every time if you're making these for other people then that's a different story but it's always fun to experiment um this is my favorite part of making all these treats okay now that we have the coconut oil in there we're mixing that all together and it's coming together very very nicely we just have to keep whisking it to make sure it's all mixed together you can see it looks nice and smooth and now we're pouring it into the same type of system the little container with the wax paper again because i don't have any parchment paper and then i'm putting it in the fridge i had intended to come back for this an hour or so later but it ended up sitting in the fridge for a couple of days because i got too busy to continue with them so now here we are with our refrigerated mixture slab i took it out of the fridge and then i let it sit for about 20 minutes to kind of soften it up so you can obviously tell the fact that it softens up at a warmer temperature means these need to stay in the fridge again it would u uh we would need to use gelatin to make them stay stable at um or to hold their shape at room temperature and if you guys are interested in me doing a video like that let me know this is just an experiment like i said a few times already so anyways so i just cut them up into these little shapes and then i put them in a container with some sugar and a little sprinkle of citric acid shook them up and then i put them back in the fridge so that was all we needed to make both of those and they were so good now let's talk about how they turned out taste wise okay so i'm just eating them while i'm talking so i can explain so first of all don't put them in the freezer because they'll get kind of wet on the outside just keep them in the fridge this green one it's sour green apple and blue raspberry the flavor is literally amazing they go so well together and the sourness is perfect [Music] that is really really good like i really like that it is very soft though it's not as chewy as like a starburst it's much much softer like very like your teeth just like go right into it so i mean maybe if you eat them in the fridge it'd be a little bit chewier but i let mine sit out um so i could see how well they would do i think it's about 24 degrees in my apartment so if the air conditioning was on i probably could get away with keeping them out of the fridge okay now we're going to try the watermelon cherry chun way one so it definitely is mostly watermelon only a little bit of cherry and we can really taste the watermelon chamois which one is really good i think the only thing i would change to the watermelon one is to do more of a sugar coating like i did for the green one um i just kind of want that like really like sour sugar to contrast the sweetness of the watermelon chamois um it is pretty oily but only on your fingers you can't really like taste the oiliness overall i rate the watermelon choi one seven out of ten and then the green one i would literally rate like a nine point five out of ten it was like so so so good i think it's gonna put some citric acid in it as well but both of them are good if i could do anything different aside from the sugar i would also add gelatin so they could be shelf stable but i don't mind keeping in the fridge anyways i hope you guys enjoyed this video please let me know if you did leave a comment below give us a thumbs up and subscribe thank you guys so much for watching i hope you have a wonderful day", "1Teck1q0S8s": "\u266b Guitar Jazz Music \u266b", "cYKLWo_G95A": "hey everybody how you doing welcome back to sweet freaks candy thanks for checking out our youtube channel i'm here today doing a little video on a hard candy i'm making for a halloween mix and we are starting with a grape so this has already been um the flavor is already in the pot as well as the color and this one is grape i'm going to add some citric acid to it to give it a nice little sour taste so we'll have a sour grape music in the background i hope that doesn't [Music] so what i do first is now that i've poured it onto the candy cooling table i'm going to let it sit for just a minute to cool off just a bit because if i add the citric acid now there's a good chance that it could burn and give it a little bit of a funky flavor so i like to wait a little bit and then um can go from there so uh once the edges start getting a little bit um harder see how i'm able to kind of pull that off the cooling table so it's starting to cool down a little bit and like i said i'm using a grate today this is from uh lorann oils so we're using a grape flavoring and corn syrup pretty much the main ingredients there sugar obviously so we boil it to 310 degrees drop it on here it's probably cooling off enough now that i'm gonna add some citric acid and this is what gives it that nice little sour flavor and it kind of looks like a lot you're thinking oh man but uh actually kind of dissolves into the candy a little bit as well and and uh isn't too bad so once i do that i like to fold it in so i kind of make this little pocket here i'm going to trap all that citric acid into there and then this is the part where you actually let the candy do the work i fold it in and as you can tell it's starting to harden up a little bit already this is probably make about a two and a half pound batch but as i fold it in and do this and it starts to uh the citric acid will dissolve into the candy and once i get it to a consistency that i like we'll take it over to the heating table where we can um pull and cut it so this will be for a handout that i'm doing for a farmer's market um on halloween so i'm actually gonna be hanging out my own candy so let's be a little mix for all the kids to come and get it back for me and this is the part where i just kind of let the candy do the work [Music] you still see some of that citric acid in there we're also going to pull it a little bit to give it that uh what it does is it traps air bubbles inside of it and gives the candy a little bit more uh volume to it and also it won't be as hard even though it's a hard candy um we're gonna pull it enough to where it's got some air into it so it's not going to just uh be completely solid and break a tooth if you bite into it so it'll kind of crumble it also distributes the flavor and the acid evenly so as you can tell now i'm starting to get kind of a little bit more consistency to it almost like a play-doh and at this point it's still very hot um but i can kind of manipulate it this is where i'll pull it a little bit and i don't want to pull it too much because trapping the air bubbles inside of this candy what it does is it also reflects light so the more that you pull it the lighter and more pastel the candy's going to get and for a halloween candy i want this purple to be pretty dark i have done some other ones where i've pulled the candy and made it very light and added black um coloring to it and like a stripe to kind of do that but this just being a small little free handout i'm just going to kind of make it i want to pull it a little bit you can kind of see here as i pulled a little bit it's gonna trap those air bubbles and it's gonna reflect some light and as you can already tell it's a little bit lighter than it was see that there so once i get it to about exactly where i want it which this is probably pretty good we're going to take it over to our cooling table or to our heating table i'm sorry so let's head on over there this is our little setup here for our heating table let me set this up for you guys so i've already got two pans set up for when i cut there we go for when i'm cutting it to get it just right for you guys there so you can get a good idea of what i'm doing let me see if i add some light there if that helps let me know if that helps this being my first video i'm kind of testing some of the uh lighting and different things that i'm using so um what i have here is just a oversized griddle with some silpats on it to get it nice and i don't need it hot because the candy will melt so what i'm doing is just keeping it from completely cooling down and getting too hard so that i can still manipulate it pull it and cut it i like to use ten and a half inch scissors so i like to make kind of this little design like this and what that does is it kind of keeps it hotter up here because it is um a little bit thicker but as i pull it i pull it from this end and i get the consistency that i want coming out of that so as you can see it's still a little bit too soft because if i tried to pull this right now it would just kind of really thin out [Music] and i'll show you what it does when that happens i'll pull from the other side and this is just kind of a test run on the consistency so i'm not too worried about it you could actually put this back into the candy if you wanted to and what this does is the way that i cut them it makes these nice little pillows nice little bite-sized pillows and just from doing it for for as long as i have and as many times as i have i kind of have an idea of the consistency that i want as far as the size and thickness of the candy and the reason i have two pans is that i still pull it when it's a little bit hot and so if you do them all together they can stick together um obviously once they cool down you just drop them in there but for me it's just easier and like i said you'll get these nice little pillows when you're done i call them little candy pillows um it's just from pinching each side with the scissors and it's kind of uh really gives it that homemade look and feel to it um you know that people really know that i've done all this by hand people are kind of surprised sometimes when i say that i've cut and make each each piece by hand instead of at a machine and i'm not worried about having every piece exactly the same size i mean i like to have a good consistency and i think you know those look great um sometimes i do get a bigger piece or a smaller piece but i do it by weight when i when i do them so that uh uh you're gonna get the same amount of candy every time there might be a couple bigger or smaller pieces but um that's you know you'll get the same amount every time then i just keep flipping it making sure i get the same amount same consistency pulled off every time make nice little so just starting out this channel you guys let me know comment down below let me know what colors you'd like to see what flavors um any questions you might have i can also make i will be doing some videos that are multi-colored to kind of show you how to uh put more than one one color together and how i build them and and get it a nice looking piece of candy so i will be doing a couple videos on that and obviously if you guys would like to try any of this candy um you can go to my website at sweetfreakscandy.com and check out any of our i think right now i've got about 36 flavors in stock you can check them out have them shipped to you and if you see any flavors that you like on any of these videos let me know and we'll be doing a discount code the discount code will be uh youtube and if you put that in it will give you 20 off of your order so that's another reason to uh watch it so on these um on this heating unit this griddle i never really go past warmth because then that will get it too hot to where the candy will start to melt but as i go and it gets smaller and smaller it gets a little bit harder so i turn it up just a bit to keep it going i'm going to start doing a little bit longer pieces [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and that's all there is to it guys so like i said if you'd like to check out any of this candy go to sweetfreakscandy.com comment down below let me know what uh you guys want to see if you guys like the video it is my first one doing it this way so i'll figure out the lighting and kind of the angles and everything to

delivery service here in town so this is stony patch it's a you know as you can obviously tell if you know if you've had sour patch kids the candies it's a fake version of sour patch kids so it's a sour sweet then stoned usually the real one is sour sweet then gone no I don't [ __ ] know sorry sweet don't let I don't [ __ ] know every but yeah and these are 350 milligrams as you can see I cop these for 20 bucks each those forty bucks for both of these I got these delivered pretty quick too in like 20 minutes so this is the first time I'm actually trying it and see you can see and yeah kind of smells like tree but I really don't taste it first so I'm not sure on me I don't do the math on how many milligrams of each edible blood smear try one hmm oh it tastes exactly like carpaccio and as umezaki heard that I've seen in other videos that either actually met little blocks mmm he's exactly like starter packages so but I'd like a little something off in the flavoring like tree I'm gonna taste good obviously I just can't believe this down to 250 milligrams and this whole time pseudo I hate this whole [ __ ] name look like sour patch kids are like dope like soaked hmm can we go see uh we'd like that going up he's really gonna give you smack last one and they look like the shape like the real thing I don't know more what you guys know how this [ __ ] is pause the video after this thank you", "HvKJz4M585c": "hi everybody this is Jen from cookies cupcakes and cardio comm today I'm going to be showing you how to make homemade rock candy we recently made a cake Penguins of Madagascar that used lots of rock candy and I was reading through the comments and people were asking of ways that they could make it themselves at home so I put together this video for you so let's get started so we don't need many ingredients to make the raw candy we need just 1 cup of water 3 cups of white granulated sugar now these parts are optional I've just got some colouring you can also use food coloring for this I have gel paste out in front and I also have some different flavorings and you can use them or omit them it just depends if you want your rock candy to be flavored and then we're going to be growing the rock candy on these little wooden sticks you could also use popsicle sticks or you could also use cake pop sticks so the first thing we're going to do is bring our cup of water to a boil which is 100 degrees Celsius or 212 Fahrenheit so once the water is boiling just turn it down slightly and then by the 1/2 cup we're going to add the sugar so I'm just going to add 1/2 cup here and probably start off with a cup here and then I'm just going to stir it and I'm going to keep stirring and letting the sugar in here dissolve while I'm stirring it we're gonna get the 3 cups of water in or sorry the 3 cups of sugar into the water which is going to saturate it and that's going to be how the rock candy forms so I'm just gonna keep stirring and adding the sugar and it looks like it's dissolved from that first addition so I'm just going to add some more and then keep going so I have all of my sugar in it's nice and thick and the sugar is dissolved into the water mixture so now I'm going to just give it a final couple stirs and I'm going to set it to the side for about 15 minutes to let it cool and in the meantime I'm going to set up the where the rock candy is going to grow so what we need to do next is give a surface for the rock candy to grow on so I'm taking my wooden sticks and I'm just dipping them into the water here just dipping the stick and making it wet and then I'm going to roll it in this white extra sugar so you don't need too much you can tap it off and this is just going to give the rock candy something to stick to and so like I said it's gonna help it grow so just stick it in the water and then dip it into the sugar so we're gonna let those dry and wait for our mixture to slightly cool so what I've got set up are small narrow glasses and if you you can use anything that's kind of like long and cylinder like this in order to help grow the rock candy and what you're going to do is if you want one to be color just gonna put a drop in to the bottom you don't need very much because it is quite a small amount so I've got some blue and some pink coming in here and if you want coloring or sorry if you want flavoring if you want to have one flavour for all of your rock candy you could put it in while before you take it off the heat but I want to show you how to make different flavors so I'm just going to put a little drop as small as I can get here into that blue one there and then change the flavor and put another drop in the second one so this third one that's on my right here I'm just going to leave it plain because the clear rock candy also looks kind of cool so I've transferred my sugar mixture to a container that I can pour from and the mixture is still hot you just want to make sure you've given it a little time to cool down slightly so we're going to do is just pour into my containers here and then I'll give them a stir so I'm filling it you want to leave a little bit of room for this for the stick to go in there and just give it a little stir so it mixes up all of the color and the flavor I'm just going to repeat that with all three and then I'll show you what to do with the sticks so what I have are large clothes pegs you could also use the regular sized ones these ones are just like because they have a little hole in the middle which just happens to fit perfectly with the stick so what you want to do now is you want to put the stick right into the center of the mixture but you don't want it to touch the bottom so what I did is I just go down to the bottom so I can feel the bottom and then bring it back up a bit because if you put your stick too low then the candy won't be able to grow as far as you want it to grow so that's as simple as it is and then you're gonna leave them for at least two to three days in order for any candy to grow and some of mine I left for a couple of weeks and so I'm going to be bringing those ones out to show you and I will show you how to get them out of the container after this so these rock candy growths have been growing for about two weeks and what you want to do at that point is take them off take off the little clothes cake and then the surface is hard so you just want to break it and you can do that with just a butter knife and make sure that you're not breaking it right by the stick and then you want to dump the excess out here like that and then inside you can see that the rock candy has grown around the little post here but unless you're really lucky you might have problem getting it out so what I've had success with is just holding hot water from the tap along the bottom of my container here and then gently prying it away once it gets a little bit soft so I'm going to go and do that and I'll show you the final product so I have the piece of blue rock candy out now and it's all ready to be eaten and I'm going to take the rest of mine out as well and I'll be back to show you all the finished colors so there you go everybody how to make your own homemade rock candy it was a pretty simple tutorial today but something that's really cool that you may not have done before so I hope you enjoyed it and you learn something new so thanks for watching remember to subscribe to the channel and I will see you all again next time you", "vu1RKWQtN-M": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today I have a very exciting video that's been highly requested and I'm sorry it was taking so long I'm going to be showing you guys how I make my extra strong green dragon picture this photo has one cup of liquid and 10 grams of wheat and then I reduced it to 1/3 of a cup meaning that now there is 5 tablespoons in 1/3 of a cup so every tablespoon is 2 grams of wheat you're gonna need the carbs wheat for this recipe and I'll post a link of how to do that below here's what you're gonna need alcohol that is 95% alcohol or higher some coffee filters or cheesecloth a funnel some mason jars and 10 grams of the carb to read the first step is to freeze your Dakkar bleed for at least 24 hours I have already done that and now that it's been over 24 hours I'm going to pour in 2/3 of a cup of vodka that has been in the freezer for at least 24 hours the instructions for this can still be followed even if you're not using the same amount of wheat that I am which is 10 grams all you have to do is pour enough vodka to fill just to the top of the weed now you're going to shake it aggressively for 5 minutes then you'll put it in the freezer for at least 2 hours I ended up leaving mine in the freezer for about 20 hours there's no need to leave it for long within 2 hours I did that simply because I ran at a time now I'm placing a funnel into my mason jar and I'm going to poke some holes into my coffee filter so that it flows through a little bit quicker if you don't have any coffee filters you can also use cheesecloth then place that into the funnel now you can take your weed and vodka mixture out of the freezer and shake it aggressively for another 5 minutes pour your mixture into the filter and try to avoid spilling it over the edge like I do here then wait for it to filter through this can take a while sometimes even up to a half an hour you can see how slowly it comes out of the bottom and then once almost all of the liquid has gone through I'll move the weed around to try and facilitate more of the liquid to be filtered through I put some gloves on because if your fingers are touching the weed and vodka it can absorb some of the THC and we obviously don't want that because that would be a waste now that all the vodka has gone through the filter I'm going to scoop back the weed into the jar you can see how much weed is left in the funnel because I spilled it when I poured it in so again try to avoid doing that if you can [Music] now I'm going to pour in 1/3 of a cup of vodka that again has been in the freezer for at least 24 hours and then I'm going to pour it into my jar weed that I had already filtered once now again if you're using different proportions just use enough to just cover the weed you can just pour it straight into the jar I'm just using the funnel so I can try and get some of that weed that's stuck to it the first time now once again I'm going to shake that jar aggressively for five minutes now using that same jar and same filter that I'd use the first time I am going to pour in the mixture that we had just shaken into the jar that we first used [Music] now this step is optional but I'm going to pour in a little bit of that very cold flash-frozen vodka to get the remnants out of my jar again you don't have to do this but I don't want to waste anything so every little scrap I can get I'm gonna take now once again we're going to let that filter through and it is going to take a long time just like the first round did [Music] once that's all dripped through we're going to place a clean funnel into a clean measuring cup or mason jar as well as a new clean coffee filter and we are not going to poke any holes now we're going to pour it in and we're going to wait for this to drip through this step is not necessary but I like mine very clear so I like to filter out any imperfections if you like you can do this step twice but it does take a long time so I only do it once and I find that the one time is sufficient to get it very pure and clean I'm also going to take the filter with the weed that has been filtered already and press it out as much as I can of course make sure you're wearing a rubber glove so that your skin is not absorbing at all yeah and just try and squish oh as much as you can and then that little bit of leftover that is on the parchment paper there I mean if you're just using this for yourself you could just lick it up I don't know if you don't want to waste it anything works yeah so just squeeze out as much as you possibly can it's been about a half an hour and almost everything has filtered through and we have a total of about a little bit under a cup of liquid because some of that vodka is lost in the extraction process [Music] now we need to reduce our tincture to a smaller amount and we're going to use that by using a double boiler thing which I don't have so I'm making my own version and I'm just using my instant pot so that I can do it in the living room where I have better lighting so I am wrapping some tinfoil around it so I can contain the heat as much as possible and I'm just going to put my measuring cup on to the side of it and then wrap the tinfoil kind of around it that way not too much water and heat is evaporating all you want to make sure is that your bottom of your mason jar or your measuring cup like I'm using is not touching the water so same concept as a double boiler so I both to put it in there but I just have to show off how beautiful it looks it's so clear so golden absolutely beautiful I hope you guys appreciate how wonderful it looks because a lot of my friends and family don't really feel the same way as I do so I just love being able to share this stuff with you guys online please make sure you do this any well-ventilated area so I have all windows and doors in my house opened as well as if your dreams on the stove have your hood fan on there is no smell at all so unfortunately my instant pot broke part way through I don't know what happened so I moved it to the kitchen and I made this sort of contraption thing because I could not put the measuring cup on the edge of the pot because I don't have anything deep enough where the bottom of the measuring cup wouldn't touch the water so I just put a metal strainer on top and then created some insulation with the tin foil kind of like how I did it the instant pot so while you're watching it when it's bubbling a lot like this that's a little bit too much so turn your heat down a little bit you do want a little bit of movement but not that aggressively now I reduced it down to one third of a cup and that took me about an hour and a half I believe you can reduce it more or reduce it less it just depends on how strong you want it to be now it's ready to pour into a jar to save you can use this with a dropper or you can put into your gummies or into your drinks there's so many different ways to use it hopefully you guys will check out some of my gummy videos and try it out in one of those recipes and here's the finished product which is absolutely beautiful thank you so much for watching with the measuring cup I didn't want to waste any possible tincture so I heard some iced coffee into there and now I'm drinking that so that's a good way to make sure you're not wasting anything if you guys enjoyed this video please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe and please let me know if there's any videos you would like to see me record because I would be happy to do that thank you guys so much for watching have a great day [Music]", "6eOw9MLpuKA": "[Music] 20

moon rock art and I got me it got me high as hell but these they didn't do anything for 15 bucks I bought these at a dispensary in Compton and yeah these are not worth it at all guys definitely 15

chamoy sweeter high gummy is now sweeter hi is a company I believe based in California they do a lot of different products I think they do like vaporizers edibles so on and so on on their website I couldn't find too much information on them specifically but they say they specialize in high quality lead which I think all these companies do anyway at this point these guys are the 300 milligrams on the packaging and it does not tell you which how much milligrams is in each candy strip which is the hard part but on the back to tell you the nutrition it has lots of sugar so if that's something that concerns you be aware of that but they are very very delicious let's just go into opening them they have one of these on them not one of those child safety loved ones again they don't tell you how much milligrams they're in each strip but here is one of the strips now I personally don't like sour candies I don't have a high tolerance for sours but if you do you will absolutely love them they're very similar sour points you like sour patch kids those aren't these are for you I'm sure these are gonna be good the spiciness too is also not overwhelming and if you're not really into spice this won't really hurt you it's gonna be like comparable to like those little sweet Mexican candies with the spice around it those those are the most similar to these other than the sour being like obviously really overwhelming for me this flavor on these guys are really really good I haven't tried the other flavors but the spicy and the sweet the combination is super super nice the high so for me from those guys you do get high I wanted to say that it feels like 300 milligrams I ate an entire pack of these in one day and it felt like probably like a hundred and fifty so I don't know who does their testing but yeah it's definitely if you're looking for 300 milligrams this will be a little bit of a fall short but if you're looking for 150 labeled 300 this is for you it was not overwhelming high either I didn't get those little butterflies feelings in my tummy I just started a little giggly I'm always feeling the loose and then I fell asleep which is a thing I gotta say about edibles they will make you knock out I fell asleep like 7 p.m. and woke up at 11 so if you want to sleep these are a great sleep aid honestly um I don't know why they didn't get me super high and just made me sleepy usually both come together but I don't know maybe way to hit me or maybe it was what I was doing that day but yes these will make you sleep won't make you get extremely high won't make you get paranoid will make you get in your head but if you're looking sleep these guys are a great option also for smell wise in my last standing a video a lot of people are wondering about the smell I get no THC flavor no THC smell but if you're looking for something and that can be really hot on the low somebody can take in public something that you're afraid someone might smell it in your backpack person like that you won't get this with this this you don't smell any THC no oil nothing even in the flavor you couldn't you couldn't tell the difference between this and a regular candy to be honest so yeah if I was you and I saw these guys at the dispensary it's 300 milligrams I got these for 15 bucks I would get because oh I I'll be honest a lot of these kind of packaging a lot of these kind of candies I don't pick up when I see they don't seem to hit very well for me they always seem to be disappointing but these guys were actually something I have now revisited this is the second time I bought it and I didn't I don't regret it I think they're they're they're fun so if you want something a little bit different you're tired of cushy punches you're tired of lemonade's you're tired of the whole shebang you guys see the speeder hire any other gummies I'm sure they're all the same I would pick it up so again my name is Sara P thank you so much for watching the haze

and find it so thank you guys so much for watching and I will see you next time [Music] [Music]", "a61vjUPxcFc": "hello senior stunt fans is the real senior stunner back at you today we're gonna be discussing powerful edibles this is non liquid mostly chocolate but let's talk about starting at the top with my WoW brownie remember edibles are to be used very carefully this in particular is some of the strongest edibles I've come in contact with the WoW brownie 500 milligrams bottom line even though it's not that big one bite and you got to put it down and wait an hour and a half two hours because I found it to be almost too strong so be careful with while brownies they're very strong mostly a sativa / hybrid on the upside there Delta which is a more traditional Delta nyan edibles this is a classic 250 milligram milk chocolate that for people it's scored into nine different pieces for people who just want to have it casually this one is much more intense for the experience usually this would be something even a beginner could eat into over here let's move on down to our pj butters assortment we have two today that we're gonna look at on the right is a traditional Belgian milk chocolate double dose with 300 milligrams that means you can take it to a movie or a concert pop it in your pocket it's real small look how small it is and it's very discreet here it is in Belgian chocolate with cappuccino flavor also PJ butter 300 milligram Sheriff with a friend please I bought this because I thought it was gonna be really exciting I'm looking forward to it this is a hive I've talked ilat Belgian chocolate flavor came a lot of different flavours what they do with this 400 milligram puppy is they score it they score at a number I think they score at 20 different pieces he bought you cut out a little piece for yourself and / - so you're in 40 milligrams apiece take two of those and you'll be very very happy let's move over to bang this is medical cannabis pretzel chocolate and this is one for one person that says double strength but for me 120 milligrams really is gonna be for me now I want to take this and go into detail the Wow 250 bar is made by the same people that make the Wow brownies and you have to be very very careful some reason I don't know what they're using on inside of their edibles because it doesn't tell me if it's distill it or cannabis oil for weed it's incredibly strong their brand let's move to something that I've experienced with I've tried the G bar before the 500 milligram buy lol edibles very tasty this is done really nicely it's a pretty package but it's also a very tasty bar because of that I purchased some 1000 milligram bars they're the same size but more potent so yesterday I attempted to take a piece of one of these were the day before oh my goodness I had a piece of one of these and I had a bite of the brownie no drink during the day and oh my god so I think what has to be said about edibles especially edibles with this type of power because these are really powerful animals is you need to go very slow and in small small pieces you're not like me don't think you are with edibles most people I've been doing edibles for a very long time if you have and you understand what I'm saying they can overwhelm you very quickly so you don't want to turn book could be a great experience and have it be a pain in the ass because you don't feel good so remember go slow but go bold or go home right this is a fine assortment of edible high potency edibles I wanted to take a look at from the real senior stoner everybody have a great day thanks taking a look", "SfBJ-VyVLl0": "this is a recipe for hard rock candy the kind fat are bite-size pieces that are covered in powdered sugar the first thing you'll need to do is to pour some powdered sugar over some parchment paper in a baking pan and spread that out and make grooves in the powdered sugar you can make the grooves as little or as big as you want in a saucepan for 2 cups of granulated sugar one and a half cups of white corn syrup and one and a half cups of water now this is a pretty big recipe you can have the batch if you want a smaller amount but I decided for this one I'm going to experiment a little bit by using some different flavors now wipe down the sides of your saucepan with the little wet towel to help keep it from sugaring I made the batch big because I wanted to use watermelon cinnamon and a nice oil which sort of tastes like liquorice I'm also going to use green blue and red food coloring and citric acid to make the watermelon sour now this is going to cook for about 30 minutes gives a candy thermometer or a laser thermometer till it reaches 300 degrees i heated up 2 extra small pans and separate them out into three different portions one two three in the first little pan I'm trying out some a nice oil and I'm not going to use a lot of it because it's just a small amount and it'll steam up a little bit I had it a couple drops of blue food coloring and mix that up pretty quickly whoo and then I added some cinnamon oil and this steams up pretty good and be careful with the cinnamon because it can get really spicy and it also can seem up a lot and I'm gonna color this one right so if you want to make the three different flavors you have to work pretty quickly and so this third pot I'm making the watermelon now if you want to make it sour out of touch of citric acid but at it only when it's a little cool because you don't want the citric acid to burn otherwise it just completely ruins it the watermelon oil turned it pink for a while but then it turns yellow so I added a little green to make it some type of color once you have all your flavors mixed pour them into tubular shapes over the powdered sugar and when the candy is still just a little soft but starts to harden up you can use a pair of scissors and make little bite-sized pillows they're a lot smoother on the mouth then the broken cracked kind the powdered sugar helps keep the candy from sticking together this is great to make at Christmas time for little gifts or just to suck on whenever you need something sweet but don't want to eat a big old candy bar anyway thanks for watching [Music]", "PfYE4KY2DxQ": "it's rolling up until morning is certified pothead you may notice a I'm not smoking right now I do got some super flame for you and you put it on spin move never gonna be doing a review of some dank gummies so without further ado let's jump to the close-up [Music] [Music] [Music] hi Burke owes me some other bird emojis flapping in the comments section as we take a look at the base edifice never look at these dang gummies these are peach rings now I'm already about to in um I wasn't smoking if you know video so I can tell you how they make the reef you just go ahead pop this third one it you know explain to you how to take all right Burke up these have a very decent peach scent oil you don't really get a cannabis scent coming out of them you know it's a very good peach and kind of sugar scent place papi can try to break down how to taste actually it [Music] coating very sugary when you start to break it open very nice peach flavors come - and it's actually a pretty good Pete very good peach representation like it almost tastes like biting into an extra peach [Music] not really picking up too much of the cannabis at first but starting to come through is still behind the peach flavor a lot but figured up on the very end of the taste as far as what I'm feeling right now three of these are 15 milligrams this is the third one out hat so same won't break that break down the third mini twenties they're almost 30 milligrams I've already a and it's a nice feeling nice body high relaxing everything on and you spiny gummies but I will say they do them a try you don't want to go just eating a whole bunch of them because it takes a while creme to uh jump in nice you start to feel the effects so you can easily overdo it but they'll be afraid these at will be real good I'm I definitely recommended that to Lamar come out there [ __ ] cuz [ __ ] bring buddy trumpeted but daddy what a comedown [Music]", "sTfaooUIaXg": "hey everyone it's been a while hasn't it hope everybody staying safe and I apologize for not doing any recent videos a little bit preoccupied with Kovac stuff and you know everything going on around here and Minnesota with the the protesting and and all that stuff but just kind of been an emotional drain so I've been taking time out to deal with that and just really focus on keeping myself and my family in good spirits and yeah good spirits and just taking care of each other which hope everybody out there is doing as well but with that in mind the show must go on so I got a cool little thing here I'm going to try out today I'll tell you a little bit more about it here just a moment [Music] hello everybody Sam the foodie from Minnesota back finally with another taste testing video I hope everybody's doing okay yeah let's get right into it so today we have an item that I purchased a while ago so hopefully it won't affect the taste but I don't think it would so we have some more candies of course because I've got my sweet tooth so this is from a company called lofty pursuits these are they're called madness and it looks like what they are is just flavored candies these were recommended to me so yeah I decided to purchase them and want to kind of see what they're about I do not have any clue what they're gonna taste like or what the texture or anything is gonna be so I'm gonna open these up let's take a look nice little mylar bag here packaging is great so alright take a smell they've got oak the smell is kind of different I kind of smell like a hint of strawberry in it okay so let's take a look at it so I'm gonna give you guys a little close-up here it just looks like a yeah it's kind of weird yeah I mean a little strawberry but I don't see really yeah well let's give it a try whoa dem are crunchy okay this is still in my mouth a little bit but I'm just gonna kind of leave it there because it's gonna take me a while for it take it a while to this all and stuff so so yeah this is very crunchy definitely not something you chew it to the flavor kind of a strawberry flavor kind of lick it it's not too bad yeah very crunchy so they act remind me of the Hickory Farms strawberry bon bons that you like the meat packs very tasty the flavors great and yeah yeah okay so looking at it looks like serving sizes four pieces certains per container about five so you're looking at about 20 pieces in the mylar bag yeah um total carbs 5.9 grams for every four pieces so definitely carb friendly as long as you eat only eat a couple of them so now you got to give it a rating on a scale of one to five with five being just amazing I got to run out and buy more one being you couldn't pay me to buy more I'm gonna give these a four um it was not over it didn't make my mind explode they were very tasty though I would definitely buy them again so yeah four out of five is what I'm gonna give it so thank you so much for watching this video if you have any ideas for future videos for things for me to test please drop them in the comments please subscribe to channel like the video you know how works on YouTube and you guys stay safe and have an awesome day [Music]", "dRCWeLKTTyw": "hey YouTube this is grant Smith from Colorado I'm coming at you live from the mile-high and I am just going to do a quick review here of another edible medical marijuana product here and that is the sour gummies by a company called wana I am not familiar with them this is my first experience with their product and so these are sour gummies really not sure I think that yeah they're about 10 milligrams apiece in terms of THC per and apparently it was made I don't know you got all sorts of information about the plants they used in different trim apparently they use some trim I tore this package up like an idiot so anyway these are what they look like and you know if you're into gummies and you're into that whole thing that's flavor and that texture you would really like these the flavor is great I'm not really the biggest fan of the texture personally so sorry one sec here we are you know here if you're a gummy pen you will enjoy them if not you probably just you know like me you'll be able to tolerate them and you know I'm certainly not trying to knock this product at all because they definitely tasted great again I'm just not a huge fan of the actual gummy textures so you can see they're covered with you know crystals or whatever infused I really don't know anything much about this particular process but this is what they they look like you know standard candy and that's ten milligrams of THC infused within this and that's a pretty good deal you know it'll get you a good little buzz going on and you know if you have a high tolerance level you may want to eat a couple of them if you don't well um I'm sure one will do it and so you know just again I just wanted to remind you all out there that if you're not you know here in Colorado or California someplace where you can kind of get these things with a little less you know going to the street kind of deal you know you may you may not really know how to use them right and so I just want to help everybody out there you know if you get your hands on this kind of stuff just remember don't go overboard with it you know you'll enjoy it so much more if you don't eat too many at once you can really make yourself sick and you know regret doing it if you just tear into them like that so anyways hope you guys are out there having a great one tonight and if you would like me to review anything or have any questions or anything like that if you want to see anything let me know and give me any suggestions that you've got thank you for watching and be safe out there alright peace", "059ZsVUl-3A": "hi and welcome to kena basics today we learn how to make rosin lozenges rosin lozenges are cannabis infused honey lemon ginger hard candies or cough drops that can be used for a medicinal or recreational cannabis use they use rose and pressed wax Akif to infuse the cannabis it has only four ingredients it's all natural and healthy so let's get started here's what you need to make rosin lozenges first you need 1/2 a cup of honey you can use raw honey or regular store-bought honey you need 2 tablespoons of freshly squeezed lemon juice 1 teaspoon of freshly grated ginger root and 1 gram of cannabis rosin pressed wax or one to two grams of Keef I do not recommend using eh-oh or butane extracted hash oils for this or any other recipe because making hard candy can be a very time-sensitive endeavor you do need to make sure that you have all your ingredients ready to go so the first thing that we're going to do is go ahead and squeeze out our two tablespoons of fresh lemon juice make sure you strain out all the seeds and pulp and have that ready to go and also you want to go ahead and prepare your ginger again we're using fresh ginger and if you get organic that's even better but you want to go ahead and make sure that you peel off the skin and then use a grater and we're gonna grate finely grate about a teaspoon of the fresh ginger root and then it'll also be very helpful if you go ahead and pre measure out your half a cup of honey again I said you could use raw honey here or you can use just regular store-bought honey such as we're using here but you need a half a cup of honey and you have all your ingredients ready to go before we move on to the next step which is to put a small saucepan over medium-high heat and then we're going to combine in all of the honey as well as the lemon juice and the ginger and we're gonna bring that up over medium to medium-high heat and the first thing that we're going to do is we're going to sort of boil out the water and some of the other impurities and cook down the ginger so after we've combined all of our ingredients in our pan you want to go ahead and give that a little bit of a mix and let them combine together and then as the heat comes up we're also going to make sure that we have our candy thermometer available okay as the heat brings up a little bit you'll the honey will melt and you'll be able to come coorporate those ingredients together make sure that you have your candy thermometer ready and a candy thermometer you need to make sure that it's the kind of thermometer that goes up well over 300 degrees but you're going to want to make sure that you carefully monitor because what's gonna happen is and once you get up to about 212 degrees or boiling for water we're gonna start boiling out the water from the honey and there's also a water and the lemon juice that's going to boil it out and condense down the honey then honey and the lemon flavors both but what's what happens is a lot of foam occurs when this happens you need to be right beside it and make sure that you have a pan that has tall enough sides to accommodate at least triple um the depth and foam and then as the foam gets to the top of your pan you need to pull it off the heat and let the foam subside it just takes a few seconds for the phone to subside and then you can put it back on the heat but like I said just be there with it because this is going to occur several times but over time as the water boils out it's going to foam less and less and then you can bring your heat up to high and go to 295 degrees Fahrenheit and you would be very precise about that temperature leaving a little bit room there if it gets up to 300 degrees you're fine don't go over 300 degrees but 2 and 95 or 300 degrees Fahrenheit should be perfect if you don't have a candy thermometer you can also do this by having a cup of ice water available and take some of the candy when you think it's getting close and drop it in and let it harden and the high water if it hardens into a brittle hard candy then you've reached the right temperature and we're getting real close you can see it's really darkening till you don't want to go so far also that you earn and get a really better flavor so you want to be really careful you monitor your temperature and when it gets to 300 degrees or 295 degrees Fahrenheit pull it off the heat and immediately it's gonna start to cool once it's pulled off the heat so we're going to act fast make sure you still monitor the temperature when it gets to 250 degrees Fahrenheit we're gonna add in our rosin or our Keef what we're doing here is we're we're using that temperature so the one it'll melt into there and be easy to mix but also because we're decarboxylated are still activating the cannabis rosin pressed does use heat and pressure so it may possibly be decarboxylated but what we're using this heat just to make sure that we've activated our cannabis and if you're using Keef then that's gonna be necessary also to activate the cannabis so starting at 250 degrees and then as it cools over the next couple of hours we'll be decarboxylated them remaining cannabis well once you've added in and mixed in your cannabis you're going to now pour your candy into the candy molds the video always slows us down a little bit and so the candy is a little thicker than I would like for it to Bend when it poured in the molds here it would have poured a little more evenly if I had used it a little bit hotter but when I pour it into the molds but that's okay and those little drops that I put on parchment paper would also have kind of out a little bit more circular and nice so just make sure that you move fast enough when you're doing your candies but after about two hours and you don't need to put this in the fridge or anything just let this cool on the counter after about two hours your candy will harden into a hard rigid candy you'll be able to pop those out of the molds with no problem and this candy can be really sticky so you might want to coat it in powdered sugar which will help prevent them from sticking together and whatever storage container you put them in and if you don't have powdered sugar you can also use crystal sugar or you may want to anyway because it gives it a nice kind of a cool looking coating there and also adds some sweetness to the candy which can be a little bit better because of the lemon and the ginger but these are really good and they're the flavor of these is not so much like a sweet candy so much as more as like a lozenge and you get the the lingering numbness from the gingers are really good this episode is brought to you by the Rafah studio smoke shop

yesterday and a friend of mine Ted owns the supplemental store east coast supplements in there and he got these they're called chronic Tandy what it is is it's got ten milligrams of CBD and it has o G cush terpenes in it so it's an all-around wellness candy okay but as small as it is in this little city CBD it has in it I think it might be more geared towards like little kids maybe for like seizures or or a DD or even just wellness in some way because ten milligrams isn't a lot for an adult I would think cuz I personally need it probably the whole case of pops to be okay because I think it comes with like twenty or so in a case so I would probably need two or three hundred milligrams of this stuff but we're gonna open it up we're gonna try it out and see what it tastes like and see if we can get any you wouldn't get any wellness out of it okay so just give me a moment I'll rip this sucker open and we'll see what's in it cheers pop first off Wow I smells like an OG plant rate right allogram holy moly doesn't seem to be any low chunkies or anything yet so I guess it's just straight candy that's like flavor right off that's like you stuck the whole plant right in your mouth holy moly [Music] it tastes good yeah yeah I think it tastes great there's definitely terpenes in it you can taste them right off the candy itself has room it was sort of a like a sweet flavor to it I don't know if it's my imagination but I feel something well I was gonna get to that I actually even though it's only 10 milligrams I definitely feel calmer and that was just a little lick that I did well or someone who doesn't ingest or take CBD in a lot the sights a little bit could probably be you know you'll probably be beneficial do you like calming or making you are relaxed be another thing like your kids run around the house bouncing off the walls like a Gibbon throwing Legos everywhere you've been one of these little pops be like your kid you know son daughter child have a lollipop it's definitely appeasing in flavor I mean like the more I eat it the more I want to eat it I mean totally is when I was a kid I probably just want to ask for another that like definitely is like peanuts chronic candy is that it definitely has a a sense of appeal in its flavor okay like I can say that like if I were to take like marijuana or so forth and put it in my mouth I would be like this definitely has flavor and I could say that when you do it if you don't continuously lick it it goes away like I felt something but now because I ain't continuously doing it yeah it's not doing anything anymore yeah you probably have to ingest a whole pot like it's supposed to be one dose but one does for who wonder what type of people would benefit from this like I said like maybe like people with seizures because CBD supposed to be great for seizures and focusing concentrating relaxation just watch them move like children it's a pop yeah ten milligrams I feel it but I don't think it'll last long not for me cuz I'm you know kids like fifth my size it'd probably be like hey I'm ready to watch Sesame Street hey bring on the spongebob I'm ready for cartoons is it snack time yet so let's go through our daily thing here first we'll say that one one two five one being and five being presentation what it looks like what definitely looks appealing ain't a person in the world unlike a pop so due to four and a half it was a little bit bigger around maybe a five because then it'd be more appealing flavor would it taste like right off the bat man it's like you put the whole plant in your mouth so I give this sucker a five color I'm not so big on the color could have been yellow like a lemon maybe put some kind of flavor in it just not just strength terpenes in the CBD but you definitely know it's in there effectiveness I feel it I don't feel it like like when I used like the flowery products like the CBD blunt or the bubble bag hash and that's a BAM in your face you're you know I'm medicated this is just an underlining feeling that definitely is calming and medically it's good so those three things combined and the price is nice um I was giving this one for free to try it but if I remember correctly on the box here were like two bucks apiece I think I think there was like 10 or 20 in the box and he had like two or three more boxes you could just maybe buy a whole box for 20 bucks or something it's probably gonna be a big deal especially for since I work here at that new Nannan it's [ __ ] stressful working in there sometimes cuz there's definitely a cultural gap so being able to calm down and being able to focus yeah I'm sterile these are your mouth at work no probably never know I know so if you have any questions or comments if you've tried these before or you know a different flavor or a different company or a place where you can Vicki's wholesale or even ones that are stronger 20 I think a 50 milligram one of these would definitely be more adult in a in a in a dose cuz I know when you buy just like the hemp bombs those pills are like three pills for 60 milligrams total you take all three of them pills you know you took them so if you have any questions or comments please feel free to leave them down below thumbs up like subscribe comment comment comment meanwhile while you're commenting I'm gonna finish this lollipop so till next time guys have a great calming relaxing medicated day", "FYsqZXHVnI8": "hello and welcome to lofty pursuits in public displays a confection in Tallahassee Florida where we make hard candy today we're gonna make some crystal flour candy this time in the shape of a sunflower this batches flavor will be honey this was made originally as a custom order for a wedding but we like the results so much we thought we'd show you it and start making it at lofty pursuits for a little while [Music] the table were pouring the hot sugar on is a special table from the late 1800s it was made specifically for this and we're going to be stirring in our food coloring and adding it we're gonna do this before the table cools the candy down to the point we needed to we needed to behave like a clay not like a liquid we use small wooden spoons to stir in the food coloring and let the water boil off that's in the food coloring this keeps the candy from getting sticky our color pellet today will have three colors brown yellow and green this is a part of our crystal candy series that we started earlier this year [Music] none of the candy is cooled a bit we're gonna cut the colors apart and then fold them on the cooling table to even out the temperature within each piece [Music] sunflowers are fascinating plants and they have attracted the attention of everyone from painters like Van Gogh to scientists one of the reasons I think people like them is they all face the same way in a field it's not one sunflower it's a bunch of them that are amazing and they all face the same way because they are Gila tropic this means they follow the Sun so as they turn to the Sun they all turn in time with each other to like a slow dance of flowers and their petals all open up and they're out they are looking at you sort of like faces and this is one of the things that make them cool and we're gonna try to capture this in our candy and now it's time for me to use the candy makers hook on this I'm gonna take the yellow candy fold it over and pull it again and again to trap air bubbles this is gonna change the nature of the candy it's gonna change its texture and increase its surface area with these little air bubbles this makes it taste better when you eat the candy it's also going to make the color brighter and while it doesn't appear so on this video yet the brightening happens after the candy cools off it's more noticeable the color change when I pulled the brown sugar because I'm going to need to Center the little seeds to be lighter than the outside and when I pull that you'll be able to see its color change as I pull I [Music] mentioned earlier that I needed some green candy too and I haven't made me yet I'm gonna make it on the heating table you see I need such a tiny amount of green if I try to make it on the cooling table the color would spread and I'd end up with more green than I could use so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take a little bit of a hot clear candy and add just a drop of green food coloring in it I've done this too a pocket inside the candy and I'm going to fold that over again and again with the pocket sealed and it's gonna sculler this candy besides the sunflower being the only flower that has the name flower in its name it also has other peculiar characteristics it's actually not one flower but a group of flowers if you think of it each flower only makes one seed and a sunflower has a Fibonacci sequence of a spiral of seeds in it when it's done and we end up having multiple seeds in each seed as a flower and those are tiny flowers in the center of the head of the sunflower the yellow petals we think of as the petals of the sunflower are called rays and each of them are a special type of flower in themselves multiple flowers on the flower head I'm making the center of the flower out of a group of cylinders the center of the cylinder is pulled lighter Brown candy and the outside wrap is a dark brown candy the nice thing about candy is I can do multiplication with it in other words I'm going to pull one long log out and cut it in half and keep on pulling it and cutting it it'll get thinner but it'll make all the cylinders that I need and they'll all be roughly the same size [Music] and now to make the raise around the head of the sunflower I'm gonna do this by making one large block of yellow gonna put some clear on one side that's gonna act as a spacer to differentiate the different petals then we're going to take two cold triangles of clear and they're gonna shape the top of the petals as best as I can now I'm only going to make one giant petal and then I'm gonna stretch it and cut it in half and then I'll have two and I'm gonna continue to repeat this until I have enough to wrap around our seeds [Music] you can try this candy for yourself you can get it at www.ppsd.com flowers are native to North America there are two varieties native to South America and because of that it's become the state flower of Kansas but it's been exported and it grows beautifully in some other countries it's actually the national flower of the Ukraine and the Ukraine over there grows more sunflowers and produces more sunflower oil than any other country in the world [Music] all the fluff to do is put on the final wrap but it went into the final wrap I make a clean square edge and I add my green so when I roll it up will have a stem on our sunflower I know I took some liberties here with the brown sunflower seeds real sunflower seeds are black if they're used for oil and blocking gray striped if they're used for eating but gray doesn't show up well in candy and I thought the brown would look better and now to our new piece of equipment to Thomas Mills batch roller well it's new to us they started making this model around 1895 I've got a catalog page from an old catalog from before it and when I found that I was very happy it has been able to do what it was advertised to do back in the late 1800s increased my productivity we can now make more candy with the same number of people and what it does is it rolls the candy it does the job that I used to do there is some templates I have located under those mats I used to protect my table feel carefully you'll see that we're getting ready for candy cane season and those are templates for making candy canes we're not going to be using those today now we have to pull the log of candy into Roth's and I've been calling them rods but the industry term for them is canes this term was borrowed from the glass industry where canes a glass were pulled and cut into beads using a similar technique called Miller Flores I want to take this time to apologize to you for not putting on a video lately we've been very busy making candy and we've been doing a lot of work preparing for a Kickstarter campaign which is now over and was quite successful we're gonna be traveling around the country to shoot some really cool candy making videos for you and if you didn't know about the Kickstarter campaign and want to find out what we're gonna do just go to Kickstarter and check us out I want to personally thank you for all the unbelievable support through that Kickstarter campaign we're gonna be able to do things I never thought we could afford to do thank you so much [Music] the last step of the process is to cut it into pieces and then we can go for the quality control check fortunately I have a group of people here who are happy to volunteer to be my quality control checkers [Music] I think this may be the first time that when somebody saw my candy up close they were actively unsure if they should eat it or just save it as a piece of art [Music] we appreciate you watching our video today if you liked our candy and want to try it for yourself you can go to our website www.youtube.com and Twitter too and if you ever come to Tallahassee we'd love to see you in person we call our candy public displays the confection because we do it in front of the public and you can come ballet we don't make candy all the time but we do make a lot of it and you can see us make candy in Tallahassee thank you for watching you", "nUlkBjwEBsc": "yo what is up guys that playing togar back here again welcome to another video man we're back filming back on my phone instead of the iPad my iPad is kind of [ __ ] out right now so it's whatever I can stick with the phone I like it a little bit better anyway west of the hassle so today's video guys I got a edible review my favorite edible it's the flavor X watermelon sour belt well they're not called sour belt but it's just built this is the packaging I would show you that apples inside and everything but I kind of ate it all and I'm just going to give you my experience and my review and should you get it get should you even you know try it out but before we start off the video man I do have a bowl loaded so I got some alien OGE loaded up we're gonna be using my big bong cuz the bubblers dirty and plus I keep knocking it over [ __ ] annoying but this is the only no G already took a bat rip and I put some fresh stuff on top but hopefully you guys are gonna be smoking along with me I was going to get hit on my babe but not today man so anyhow guys hopefully you're having a good day and yeah let's get this video started with uh take this first hit and hopefully you guys are smoking along with me if so let me know what you're smoking on cuz I'm always curious to know what you guys are smoking on um while watching the video and let's get dis sesh started man so Cheers so yeah guys so today we're gonna be reviewing the flavor X watermelon belt this is a 250 milligram package it contains with 10 belts each belt is 25 milligrams each and to tell you the truth it had really good taste really sweet it was a bit sour at times but one of the better gummies that I've tried and the California cannabis market like there but yeah man [ __ ] almost aired out here for a second but flavor axe is a San Diego company and I do live in San Diego so it's pretty cool hometown company at least that's what I was told Dendi the research but I know they do have a production factory down um down in San Diego though so you know I don't I don't know if they started up in San Diego that they do you have a factory here um and yeah guys like honestly best best tasting gummies didn't taste like cannabis at all like super sweet but it tastes exactly like watermelons didn't taste anything else I didn't get any weed back taste to it or anything like that um I I had to like the downfall though but like the downfall to it I had to eat a half a bag to really feel something but my tolerance is pretty high cuz I do smoke every day and I do eat edibles on more than a couple of times a week so I do have a pretty high tolerance so um if you're like a rookie like looking in on this like don't eat have the don't be a [ __ ] [ __ ] you know cuz you'll be [ __ ] throwing up and you're gonna be regretting it and you wouldn't like edibles at all like you want in try it and try one again after experiencing a edible overdose it's really shitty it's happened to my mom a couple of times funny enough but uh but yeah I don't don't be that a don't be that a smart guy that chased you uh eat half the bag or the whole bag and just think oh don't feel anything okay do not do not be a [ __ ] like that man that's all I got to say but yeah man like I really do recommend this product this is like a really shorter like video I guess not really but yeah like I read into everything like this time around I read the packaging there they are lab tested and they do follow the new guidelines for the edibles if you're an outsider that's not in California if you don't know what I'm talking about back last month June not July 10th or July 1st they passed a new law which is like the new phase going into the recreational and medical market for the cannabis market here in California everything has to be free packaged everything has to be lab tested and yeah there it's much stricter like compared to like Oregon like I see origin like they so have like they're so using the pill bottles now it's in fanciest jars and they give you in the legal dispensaries anyhow they give you a smelly proof bag and everything and it's child locked it's to prevent kids from it's to prevent [ __ ] the kids getting into the [ __ ] my cat [ __ ] tried to pop in the video popped in the video again so sorry about that but a dude come on this she's a dick anyhow yeah so it's really different here I've been kind of looking into like other states and stuff not really finding anything but just like comparing but it really does seem like California's a lot stricter with the whole marijuana thing compared to everywhere where else but yeah man honestly I'm gonna have to give the edibles a 5 out of 5 I'm sorry for kind of rambling on about the whole California cannabis market but I just to give you guys insight of like what's different and hopefully you guys learned something new about it if you're you were interested in knowing how the market was here but five out of five I would get them again and it was only 20 bucks - I did not mention that I only paid twenty [ __ ] bucks for this and hell yeah I would pay for it again cuz it's cheap I don't mind paying twenty bucks or something that gets me [ __ ] up like I'm pretty sure if I take like a month off like tolerance break man and and I eat least like I'm pretty sure like a half half a belt would get me pretty ripped but I do have a high tolerance and I don't know when the next time I'm going to be taking a tolerance break to be honest but but yeah guys I'm going to take one more rip and be out of the way the next video is going to be string review of alien og I might have that out later today or probably tomorrow which is I'm recording this video on Friday the 24th so the 25th tomorrow you'll get the video and if you have it already man make sure

to make jello jigglers it's not the same thing as gummy bears but I'm gonna give you some tips and tricks on how to make real gummy bears not just jello so stay tuned and now but I'm the one that has the culinary arts degree and does most of the baking and cooking in the kitchen anyway this is going to be a bit of a review and how-to video all in one I was given a free sample of this here bear mould and it is silicone it's machine washable and it makes 50 little gummy bears now it really only contains like for retail spoons with of liquid when I measured it out that's if you're just pouring water in there but we all realize you'll definitely need a recipe that has more than three tablespoons cuz trust me I tried to do like a micro recipe and it didn't get me very far but so far I really do love this mold I haven't had a spray it I haven't had any problems they just come right out so there's two main camps of homemade gummy bears there are people that are just making their own for the fun of it and they're gonna be using jell-o unflavored gelatin water then there's a camp that is usually doing it for the health benefit so they might have some kind of eye they will probably have juice and honey and unflavored gelatin most likely beef gelatin which is higher quality more health things to it so I that's what I'm trying for I don't have a special gelatin but I did try to do this with juice and honey and a couple of failed batches with double die vitamins but we'll get into that so this mold actually came with a pdf recipe book I really didn't find it very helpful but you can look around and find different recipes kind of experiment with what you like especially if you're doing a juice phase to go me what kind of juices do you like they do say to frown away from pineapple because the enzymes in it do not work well with gelatin just a heads up let me show you how I went about making some gummy bears myself so this is the ingredient list off of your store-bought gummy bears and you'll see here you know there's sugars there's gelatin but there are some extra waxes and that I just don't have in my kitchen I don't know about you but I'm going to give you two big tips on how to make this as close to legit gummy bears as possible less like just jigglers the recipe I have makes about 80 to 90 gummy bears and it calls for 1/3 cup of juice so I used some orange juice and lemon juice to top up that last little bit but it's primarily orange cuz that's my favorite and then it calls for two tablespoons of honey and 2 tablespoons of unflavored gelatin I did try grinding up some multivitamins it was foul and profusely disgusting so I haven't mastered that yet I'm going to show you how to do it without the vitamins take your juices and honey mix them together and then gently sprinkle your gelatin the unflavored gelatin on top and wait several minutes it'll kind of soak up like you see here and that's called blooming you don't want to add it directly into hot liquid or you'll have problems then I just slowly warm it up in a pan I'm warming up a larger pan to the side and then tip number one is boiling you are making a candy so with taffy with that sort of thing you have to boil the sugar and water to get basically a soft ball to get to the right consistency there at texture so since this is a really small batch I only did it for a couple minutes I was afraid of burning I think the consistency could have been nicer if I had done it longer but I was great so you can kind of experiment with how long you let it boil next I keep my smaller pot in side of that larger pot and just let them sit there with the spoon and dropper that they give you just so that they stay warm so they don't start setting that because then it becomes a real mess this little dropper that they give you with this set is awesome and yeah just fill them up one by one no big secret there try to fill them up as big as possible because they do shrink a little bit as you'll notice there are some bubbles you can try to skim off that before you put them in but I like them and then I put them in the fridge for just a few minutes or even the freezer and they pop right out didn't need to coat that with any oil or anything so here's the mold and I will say tip number one is to make sure and boil your sugar tip number two is to let your gummy bears sit let them dehydrate a little because in the factories where they make them they actually do put them in a drying room for a couple of days and so letting out a little bit more of that moisture should help them have a little bit more of a chewy consistency than just thick jello and here's the final product next to a Haribo Haribo gummy bear so it's a little smaller slightly different design but I like it I think it's adorable and I think it's tasty I hope that the video was helpful for you here are some of my orange lemon honey gummy bears you know they're not 100% like this stuff at the store I know they're gonna be healthier and they're cute and I still taste good so I'm gonna enjoy these snacks and if you don't want to take the time and effort for gummies even though these are awesome that you can make your own healthy version or custom flavors and colors if you don't want to do that you can also use this mold for chocolate bears make a little bag for your sweetheart for your kids throw it in their lunch a little bag of gummy or chocolate bears that says I love you very much I'm cheesy like that I would totally do that so all in all I definitely give this mold a 5 out of 5 recommendation I don't have any problems with it I really like it I love that it came with the dropper to help fill it up and if you follow my tips I think things should go smoothly let me know down

extractions and today we're in the\nkitchen we're gonna make gummy bears today and we're gonna infuse them with\nshatter we're gonna make 100 gummy bears here we're gonna use half a box of\njell-o two packs of gelatin maybe a tablespoon or two of our vegetable\nglycerin and we're gonna use our shatter here there's seven grams in here this\nshatter has to be decarboxylated which means it has to be heated to change the\nform of it from a THC a to THC so that you can get a medical effect from it and\nwith that being seven grams that will break down into point forty five\nmilligrams of shatter in each one of these gummy bears so they're going to be\nquite strong because they are for our own personal use and basically a medical\nused to help you sleep etc I just want to stress the point here that these are\ngummy bears and if you do happen to make something like this it is so important\nthat if there are children around whether it's grandkids your kids nieces\nnephews friends that have kids any kids that come over you can't just hide this\nstuff you actually have to lock this away because if a kid did get into it\nand they do seem to find things they will be hospitalized so everybody keep\nthat in mind and that's with all all edibles that you make that are THC\ninfused okay so our first step here is we're gonna decarboxylate this shatter\nwe're gonna put it in the oven at 200 and\n50 Fahrenheit for half an hour all right that's our first step here all right everybody we decarboxylated\nour shatter we melted our jell-o mixture it's warm remember everything's in low\nheat now we're just going to melt our shatter right into our liquid here slide\nit over to the heat pretty sticky   okay go we're gonna mix that in here now ok we got our hot liquid here we\nadded a teaspoon and a quarter of food glycerin just to disperse the shatter\nin here now this is a little tricky to do so we've got to move quick here here\nwe go and basically that is it okay everybody this is master-blaster\nsaying thanks for watching give us a thumbs up subscribe peace and we'll see\nin the next video bye guys", "MxPBmxnLivM": "[Music] two wheats the marijuana animal review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and today we are talking about krispity krunch II no I'm just joshing with you we're not talking about Peter Barnes but I'm on camera one because they're good too because they're high in fat and three because we're actually reviewing a hundred million gummy bears what's correct we are reviewing the ED of your 100 milligram Getti gummy bears today looking at in another this is another in this series if that appeared that we're going to be reviewing smaller dose to the last time we took these if history is going to repeat them itself these will taste awful and won't get me that high I'm hoping against hope that both of those things aren't true but there are no guarantees so the peanut butter minims just that just bad to help me get some of this as the best part of this th e so that's why I'm eating news those are gonna taste so much better than these I have a feeling alright let's open it up here oh man I thought last time this packaging was easy to open but now it's not looking so good balls all right I'm gonna have to grow grab some scissors technical difficulties back that's a negative anytime you have to go for the scissors she'd never have to do that finally finally let's give it a sniff oh man Oh smells like gummy bears with weed here we go that is awful oh and it gets worse it's got that harsh aftertaste oh oh they're so bad oh why would you do this to yourself and get gummies guys why why candies and goes-- why I don't understand it I really don't but I'm willing to keep doing it for you guys just because you seem to like them I I I'm not sure I get it so the head of pure 100 milligram gummies guys I'm going to finish these bad boys off not looking forward to it and I will see you in two hours to let you know how they are feeling and let's hope against hope one last time that they are the exception to the rule and I am coming to you blazed in two hours but not too optimistic see you two hours peace it has been two hours since I had the head of your gummy bears 100 milligrams and nothing really I can't say nothing I little high it's sort of as equivalent if I had maybe smoked a small bowl recently so on about in line with what I thought not a good value proposition at ten dollars not at all they tasted awful tasted really really bad and I'm not very high there isn't really a lot to say about the etta pure gummy bears and then they taste terrible and they really don't get you that high I have a few more and appears to review and I hope things turn around for them and again I want to I do want to say that I think these are more potent than like the infused creations that I've had so take that as you will but you know just gummies and candies just don't do it for me they may do it for you edibles you know can everybody experiences them a little bit differently maybe they just don't seem to work but I'm willing to give ed up here a fair shake in the future reviews guys

wednesday because he's not gonna be here tomorrow and yeah well thank you for watching subscribe uh follow me on youtube subscribe yeah thank you for watching bye", "DuWDJEI1NZo": "this is Sofia because it's not the same thing as Facebook where they're just going to stream in I wonder if I can share this on my Facebook though but I really just want to do a video so I guess anybody who comes in and just pick up when they come in so I want to get this done all right I don't know if I'm gonna wait for any people to arrive I'm just gonna start doing what I'm doing and if someone comes in that's great okay I'm gonna be making Jolly Rancher edibles with canvas so what I'm gonna be using is tincture you can get from you dispenser re I made it myself if this is a THC Pro and chem dog what I do is I actually cook live plants I have an illness I have fibromyalgia so I cook with live plants and I cook cooked the plants for about 24 hours in palm palm leaf glycerin you can get it on Amazon or anything like that okay so we're going to be using the tensor that I made which is an indica indica for night time I usually I just got finished doing the day but I want one for the nighttime we're gonna use 45 Jolly Ranchers seems to be the best for the the molds that I have which are emoji I'll show you those so it's white die very just unwrap them when you unwrap them what's going to happen it's cool they're gonna go like this this is not gonna be the situation afterwards okay afterwards you're gonna wind up with you're gonna wind up it's gonna be a little bit more sticky so don't anticipate for them to be like this I keep the rapper's after I drop them so there's 45 of them I keep the rapper's I will show you afterwards they won't go in the same way like this they'll go in from the side and it's kind of like the same thing and I'll show you in the end how that's gonna work out now so I use 45 of these I use watermelon I get them from Amazon I love them then like my what about one's my favorite and Jolly Ranchers are by far my favorite and one of my fav one of my things was trying to get this recipe so that when I put in my liquid cannabis it stays more like a candy I must have gone through so many tries doing this and it winding up you can actually cook if you wanted to cook less of them you could get like a gummy candy but my fake teeth so I'm not using that I need to have a solid candy and be able to suck it all the way through and and you know what I don't really want to eat them like that because when you start to eat them like that though you can get a little bit carried away especially with like my Jolly Ranchers I like to have probably one every hour or so so I don't want if I said chewy candy I'll just chew it up but not with these teeth okay okay so 30 milligrams depending on what you want it's tin sure you can use the alcohol tin sure if you wanted to just the alcohol will burn off you could use I used cooking hash before and I would just throw it in and it almost didn't matter what how many how many Jolly Ranchers don't kind of glue up back up the same way okay so I'm also gonna add a Tama butter just to keep the facts rolling because cannabis stays glues itself just absolutely glues itself to any fatty substance that's why it's good for them to go into baked goods brownies and all that's fun stuff so okay we're gonna I'm gonna use my like nonstick pan just a little tiny pan it's not gonna take much the smaller almost the better because I mean really look I just this and it's gonna be on the bottom and you want to be able to keep control of this now this has been on D carved you need some decor of your cannabis most of the time if you're going to do almost any cooking with it except I cook fresh so what I do is I'm cooking it fresh for 24 hours which actually then activate the cannabis so that and furthermore I'm now gonna cook it again now if you do a cooking hatch or you're doing a concentrate it hasn't been activated yet so you need to make sure to stay in this pot for like 20 minutes and try to keep it on 300 for that 20 minutes if you do that you should be golden okay so we're gonna get started now and I'm gonna put it on on a very low I haven't looked at the stove so and I'm currently I have an electric stove with this I hate electric so I so much more prefer fire if I was cooking but now that I'm cooking cannabis I'm so glad to have a an electric stove okay so I'm gonna throw some butter in I'm gonna take my t-shirt here I'm taking in 30 gram 30 30 milliliters milligrams no I'm not exactly sure mm ml in grams okay so it is at 30 taking me a minute to get this going to make sure that it's the exact right consistency your marijuana after you're using it okay so here is gonna show you here is the what it looks like in the pan and then I'm gonna start to you see that yes so let's get this going and like I said it's on a medium very not even meet him he on like a three I have it on very very low I just want to get the butter into the tint tincture I don't suggest you use a I suggest using only plastic utensils with this because the candy when it when it becomes a solid again it's going to get into the wood it just the my wooden spoons are just not the greatest okay so now what I'm going to start to do is so now this is all ready now if you were gonna do this with a hash you would start with the butter and really make sure it's on low and then start to cook your Jolly Ranchers I'm shaking you guys like nuts I'm sorry alright let me hold this a little bit better see that looks good so like right now I can the marijuana smell is starting to come up into the house now it's not a heavy duty smell this is probably lighter than normal but if you are gonna have guests your house is gonna smell like marijuana you may not smell it but your guests will want to give my sister cookies in public she's always says that they smell this is just gonna take a minute but you gotta keep it going you got a he picky pick go in keep it go in and it's gonna be funny because it's going to once it gets totally liquid it's gonna be really easy to work with but it's gonna get not easy and fast go a little bit slower to and you can see that the water the texture is starting to get pink and I have one viewer on here hi how are you I hope you're enjoying this please share it I would okay even though I've had a ton of people asked me for this and now I can just point them in this direction and they will be able to go and make it I'm always being asked on my social media to do videos so now I am doing them I'm just doing them live I can't see any comments if there is any so we're getting there we're getting there were getting there once these get warmed up and get heated it's gonna like it gets very gooey very fast and then it gets really really easy to work with I was very surprised how easy it was for me to work with this once it got melted because I have I have fibromyalgia so my I incorporate cannabis into my life because I have fibromyalgia and I think just by far is the best medicine that I take I think it would definitely be the last one that I would allow them to take from me if I had the choice I still I'm all medicines and I'm really working hard to get the right dose going with the cannabis but the more I the more I I know the more that I eat it the better I feel so one of those I like to have a second candy so I wanted to make sure to have I actually had a company that I was buying from and they had something that was called Ranchers and it's by want to say baked it's the company but really nothing nothing for the amount that I was spending on them I could just cook it myself and be done with it I don't want to be bothered with having to put money in other people's pockets when I am gonna be leaving my own money in my pocket and being disabled I gotta keep as much money as possible all right we're starting to really Eric we're getting there we're getting there it's getting there it's getting there it's getting there but I like to show how it's going it entire time so that you understand what what it takes to and what it's going to look like and not just oh all of a sudden it looks like this no it's gonna take you a minute to stir it and start it start started started sir they still have these candies left to go so but as soon as this gets all liquidy I will be able to start throwing in more and they will liquefy much faster and of course I would normally use my other hand to hold this still which I'm holding the camera with just so you can see it right I should get a stand we are getting there see now look how easy it's getting to be worked with like this is just so much easier now and see how the the tincture is still like it's not mixed in all the way so if you were to do it like this you would really have to whip it and like if you wanted to do a smaller amount say I guess I took about half in there where you wanted to make it a chewy you would like really make sure that you whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it and then put it in your mold but I didn't really need to do that because I am going to be keeping it solid usually I like throw maybe in a couple at a time but they almost all fell in anyway so I might as well just take it from there all right yeah I'm having a hard time because I normally just stick in a couple of something and I just said that no I said it twice and that's what will happen when you smoke cab as you'll say things twice some talking all right well hello hello my second person watching I'm so excited I cannot see comments right now if you are commenting there I have to push on the thing I have gloves on so I'm not gonna be able to see anybody comments but um please share [Music] everybody always wants to know how to make cannabis candy it's so easy so easy just so ridiculously easy now if you wanted to you could go to your dispensary buy like want to say an ounce of some nice you know some nice weed and cannabis marijuana pot have you wanna call it and you're gonna bring that home you would take a full pound of butter and first you would put the the cannabis in in a tin in a tin pan and you would put tinfoil over the top and then you would cook it bake it on low for [Music] see then it's not the recipe I'm just giving you extra because this is taking a long time you were D carve it so you put it in the tappan you put it in the oven with the tinfoil on top and then you bake it at like 125 so like 150 for two and a half hours no no no no you know what look it up on the internet I'm pretty sure it's one no no I'm so sorry this is not my recipe right now because I don't cook this way I always to cook with my pictures I don't ever use anything else so the fact that I'm trying to come up but this is old and I headed that's its problem okay so if you'll go to the Internet it's kinda butter and it really is just bake it you have to I think the baking in the oven could be for 25 minutes or can a be an hour of 25 minutes or two hours and 45 minutes I can't quite remember like I said it's not my forte I am going to make some kind of butter and get it right and then put it on live as well let me just put this down so I can get this going just first live ever so sorry for my one person who was watching alright I just needed to get in here a little bit like this but it's it's a very sticky but then you're gonna put the cannon we after you cook after you D carve it in your oven you're going to you're going to melt the pound of butter in like a saucepan and then put the cannabis into the butter now you died I think you're gonna cook for an hour and a half to two and a half hours I'm not exactly sure and then you would use the butter right into here and it would probably like even out you only want to use the wood you would be using like one stick so like an ounce and now it's a butter and that would be comparable to the tensor and then it would in my mind it would definitely come out the same way I don't see any reason why it wouldn't come out the same way all right all right but my one person is watching I don't know who you are but thank you so much for watching okay so here we are I see I still have a little bit there's still a couple in there but this is primarily what it looks like so it's not going to be as see-through as its start first started because we're use that we used butter so it has just a small tint on there this is so easy so so so easy yeah almost there I should have thought about this in the first place goes right into my crook of my arm here and I'm a little turning now see it's very I mean better than you would think it is but is when you're holding it but it is very easy to work with I was very scared that it was not going to allow me that I was gonna go get so stiff on me now you're gonna lose like a little bit like on the sides and whatever it don't really worry about that most of you medicine is gonna be in here it's gonna be nicely mixed okay so that's evenly evenly through all of your candy it's gonna be even it's not gonna be like there's a piece here and this piece here and this piece here and this piece there it's not gonna be stronger in one spot then it is gonna be in another so now these are gonna turn out to be about five milligrams of THC this might be ten I'm going you know what I'm gonna say it might be 10 because the I used the THC Pro and I used the chem dog which are you know pretty strong indica breeds strains so this one could be stronger it's not really intended to make for me it's just about kind of making it through the day with my pain so if I can put it on myself a little at a time that is just so much better for me and being that this is something that I like to I try to have to incorporate it into something that I like to do because I'm actually like handstand medicine until I was sick but cannabis just was not a part of my life I didn't do any drugs I didn't drink I didn't do anything but cannabis has just made a whole world of difference whether it just be for me being my fibromyalgia or the fact that I'm gonna have an attitude with my family and you know we're getting in there that the world is changing so see how we're getting now with that so good I love these they taste just so amazing I brought to my door and she was like no I don't want to eat it she really really doesn't what she likes to smoke it but she doesn't like the taste of it in her food so she put this one in her mouth and she's like oh my gosh this is so good okay so now what I'm gonna do is super spoon okay now I'm going to just hold you up here get this as good as possible kind of far away but alright I might have to put you back here alright so now at this point so easy mix it up still um okay now this is the special part because you want to get it in to the molds and put to the side is kind of as quickly Funko's you're gonna take off the heat so we are gonna go ahead and take off the heat I'm gonna leave it there okay for this second do this on the stove it'll just be easier to wash off so you I have emojis can you see that yes see they're emojis they don't really come out looking like that though they they kind of do but not really so they're adorable but they're also like all the other ones had like edges and I had one that have hearts on them and then it has the edge and then it's in my mouth and I really frickin hate that so alright okay so now you're just gonna take your spoon and just go ahead and stop putting it into the molds and that's about it feels like one spoonful almost wonderful but was CMI you see how bad I shake oh my goodness okay look because I want to not like have candy everywhere and of course with my shaking of course I do and at this point with my fibromyalgia I'm trying I usually yelling at my husband to help at this point oh I'm in so much pain but because I'm on here talking and I know someone is watching that my Adrenaline's running so I'm not in pain but I'm still shaking that also could be my nerves too from doing my first life fill my [ __ ] person it takes more Muslims more time to get this in here now I should be able to pick one out once I get them into both molds I should be able to pick one out and show you what it's going to look like should be almost cool by then I think might be yeah all right so this has this mold has 24 and so I'm doing 48 candies though I'm getting it everywhere okay seriously last time I did this I did not get this like this this is horrible I'm gonna put him gonna want to put this in my freezer after this into mist you can see it's true see you know what you know why because the spoon that I used last time was a little spoon that was like perfect every scoop fill was perfect this one's a bit larger and you know what I'm short if you know how to cook candy you're probably looking at me going holy God what the hell is this person doing she's just making like an absolute mess of it but I will show you that it looks like right now I still have the other ones that go so there we go okay so yeah I did get it everywhere cuz that's just the way it is now at this point I really need to get moving because it's starting to get solid on me you see the strings coming out that's it getting solid I'm just gonna let some heat go on that so it's not so bad because this is a horrible mess but you know what I'm gonna do right after it's done I'm gonna eat the candy that smoke that's upbeats because it still will come out perfect it's just on the side it's not a big deal still candy see I didn't do that last time I had nice what a mess alright it's alright here we go heat back on it cuz it's just a mess right now well it's hilarious see that stringy stuff should not be happening see that won't happen if you use a smaller spoon and it drops right off and it's like perfect at the zone I use is old and gross and I really don't want to show that to you guys so I don't want to show you that that's what I'm using because you should be used to make sure that like everything that you're using is good because this is your mess and it is going into your body it's just an old spoon and it has like it's like it says 65 year old spoon so you could just imagine you but it's clean and it's usable but it doesn't look like it's used I'm gonna wind up with less than 48 I think and I just think that's because I got them on all the sides but don't worry whatever you get into the hole this will go down into that area like and you still will have a good candy and you can like spread it although it just seems to be sticking to me but I'm sure that you could [Applause] see now I'm a little a little bit more salad [Applause] it's stupid super-sticky when you let it go this long okay I should be done by now super super sticky so see that so once it goes kind of past you got you just sometimes you're better and just get it done really you could put it into I would assume that you I could probably put it into one of those cake things that squirt it out but I am bought one I don't really big all right I know it's my blog right but it's so good all right [Music] and my face but I have candy on them [Music] okay so stove off I'm a dumbass is what it is the first one was pretty much better they're heavy alright so this is what we have I don't remember which side we started off with so I'm just gonna pick us up I'm gonna pick this side because there's a little one in here now I was still little and it's not wrong it's not cold enough I should have put it in the freezer while I was taking care of that alone I'd see it's gonna come out looking if I pop it out now they're not ready they're still warm you know I don't have it open okay so just you really don't need to put them in the freezer see this comes right off it came right off oh yeah it was just wipe it down and it comes right off with the pan just put hot water into the pan don't forget to lick the spoon okay so that's my lollipop but like the next hour I let this dry chemical right action this is what I know because it is a decent amount that's been here I'm just like okay so this was what's left over in the pan and I usually they look that behind because I'm gonna eat this for the next like half hour or so because I'm a high dose er today I didn't have any but normally when I'm going to cook I always wind up running out unless my oldest daughter is here and she will my youngest daughter will cook for me as well I just hate asking her because she works so much but at the time I am cooking something that means like I have not had like I didn't have any candies today because I really needed to cook but I didn't get my approval to do my online my life until today so I just waited I don't know why I don't want to take the tension or just regular like in my cup or something but so this is like a big lollipop in the end so you can't take heed that's all but normally I would like to start off with a candy and then and then I would probably maybe have one every hour every couple of hours and if I haven't had something all day then I'm looking to have something more like 25 milligrams or above by the end of the day I usually hope to have a BMI system around a hundred and fifty milligrams which is just perfect for my body my [ __ ] body feels really really good at the end of the day I'm never actually stoned your body it doesn't edibles don't really work that what's in some edibles could really like send you into another space furthermore these edibles could also do that em it really depends on your tolerance it depends on how much them how long have you've been doing it you know someone actually could be there they're just even one thing just and you could smoke it and smoke and smoke it and then edibles will just not work for you so but for me they work really really good with my fiber males I really really really enjoy the fact that I have something that's more on the holistic side to working and that I can make any medicine so this was my video on how to make Jolly Ranchers go over real quick again I used my own tincture butter and regular Jolly Ranchers my favorite one Ellen and just rewind video whoops you can

is out", "d0ab5GPZD7M": "yeah keep going up cardstock you guys got a business card now you guys know that yeah how do you guys have a digital one good summer lesson yeah who's the bandit it looks like the outline of mom although I can't see her that well because she's hidden she's an outlaw yeah her choose one in 17 states what would you do mom yeah I can't tell you it had something to do with tie-dye but I can't tell you what it was Oh counterfeit tonight yeah oh you did such a good guest couldn't tell me and that I got it pretty quick in one somebody Facebook messaged me that there's a video where max adds the flavor it was cherry the champion cherry & epified video and flavouring form performs a perfect part well no it's a little lopsided but if it wasn't perfect I posted perfect but it was a heart issue so should me where it was like to get screenshot I don't know I'll put that on the facebook at some point yeah they're a regular old Walter White well that's not so good [Music] a sketch like that's a good grandparent flavor like that I don't have a bowl of water spout their house my grandparents kept their butter whether Scotch they kept that out of tune is locked up but it's hard as a brick part of butter right just trust me on that yeah I feel like there's people in this world that love cranberry sauce cakes cranberry sauce love coconut I hit coconut like a fan on the sleep or don't like a family sake and then there's your heart butter people versus yourself but who like start over very soon in the comments who is on team hard butter and enlighten us Oh your mom likes it too no no I'm just saying she probably was if you never talked about it yeah okay so our family is very into talking about our feelings dad you do watch her head I was very quiet for but we didn't put any hot water in the table for this correct oh yeah I felt the table this field decides with a little bit warmer than the other side but I guess it's because that's where the I just didn't know if you did it for Hardy I mean I know we do for tie-dyed for a couple just not I'll put it on the table so you just put it in leave it in there for a couple of batches that stays warm yeah it doesn't hurt enough money too quickly the other lie because this is a butterscotch so I'm not gonna add any citric acid sour butterscotch there's a flavor that nobody wants and you guys are still trying to get the citric acid amount still messing around with that we're gonna add more today because if it lemony should be kind of safflower then once we nail that I wouldn't be opposed to it you're trying a strawberry lemon-aid mmm I'm just gonna have teeny tiny bit which is gonna be tough for me to add a teeny tiny bit next does drop mmm next those drops was trying to say he said it so easy I thought it was a sick thicker you know what I thought it was - I haven't worked with a brown a heck of a lot oh I know I saying I wouldn't be opposed to I thought maybe strawberry lemon-aid you just did that would be okay I'm talking to somebody maybe talking to me just like everything to go okay that's right that was the point I think we're talking about how we would do that but we would do half a batch would have to do strawberry half of you lemonade insurance they're trying to blend them together and just because one might cover the others or mix using other where's that the Kings are side by side that might work I'll come back to that I just want to make sure people didn't miss the corns are being put in because this is so exciting isn't it yeah Wow one more problem good to pick tomorrow to work that way right hand where our sketch is an extra flavor yeah those where we get the food and friendly right and it's not further that off route but it is friendly as opposed to being punched in the face or something wait clove is a popular one we had a Christmas time there's quite a few people that want us to separate clothes really yeah I know it's hard never we make spiced candy other than maybe like cinnamon and anise and the clove wow yeah or even like the cinnamon I I don't much care for it but if some people doesn't love it you know quite what we were actually make cinnamon candy cane yeah cuz I like brown cinnamon and cinnamon stick things but the Senate oil doesn't do a lot for me tell me this I have to make an emergency run to the nature time I'm almost out of organic oat bran hope that piano my guy about as good as quinoa and kale broccoli on a line of filled healthy ribbon cables bag yeah someone said that I can't take over the business because I would want to make all the candy healthy at all no I especially when it comes to candy Candy's not supposed to be healthy it's just supposed to be a tree really yeah just for breakfast not breakfast just some meals three all of your snacks I only like one serving an hour yes and not when you're sleeping perfectly you're right because you can't really enjoy the whole reflects that - yeah yes not maybe okay so we recommend if you don't eat candy while you're sleeping and as a public service enough don't smoke in bed why everybody uses ruse or you candy while you're running this is your interactions how many ARMs do these people have how many mouths okay one of those special hats you know you know that holds your beer straw and your scissor that I can do yeah we're talking about those kids but smoking is bad don't do it adverse there's just no reason for it do eat organic oat bran whenever you can with the chocolate chaser where's a lots of taking I know though we're getting there I heard somebody email me she had a question that one question was but anyways she's a teacher a special needs children and she said they're gonna do tie-dye at the end of the year because they want to pepper tied I like Miss Terry hmm oh they watch our videos in fact one of them says this is relaxing I think I could do this for a job and she said that that was huge so you know they can't be making itself like no I thought that was kind of sweet those go ahead patents we shared it with uh yeah you know right now it's not that relaxing I'm staying awake with no problem but it can be relaxing when you're with a nice warm kettle of chocolate and you just turn it around the table sitting right for it to temporary head it's 9 o'clock at night you're not enough then that's relaxing I basically describe me

you know when you get things between your teeth Christmas trees no hero [Music] so max correct we're just talking about off-camera oh you're right yeah [Music] my opinion I think so as well yeah you guys are both saying it and last time we were all like do you guys agree that like when you think lemons you're thinking like your face puckers up but no it's super tangy and I don't know if it's just me but like sometimes it doesn't even have to be something sour but like when I eat something after a while it just like really gets me in the jaw muscles yeah yeah like yeah I mean lemony target right yeah definitely it's like lemon juice and sugar yeah so yes I fit every time the girl will just have to bump it up although I think we should pump it up we put we put 50% more in this one yeah I mean say we put in too much one bag you could even just call it like very sour lemonade that because people been asking for sour candies I think we could do like quite half a pub next time yeah but this time when they brought a quarter cup I won't have to okay yeah if I can convert teaspoons into cups that would probably help the 3 TSP 4 tablespoons and 4 tablespoons 2 1/4 cup the beach 2014 is going to convert yeah it is it's just kind of like the imperial system or whatever the Imperial I think that's all it is right the non metric system okay I guess I would say it's like Imperial it's like quarters you know threes and then borders and then it's it's it looks alright well there's no help being a foot and there's a feet in a yard and there's 5,280 feet a mile like what go on instead of like it's all making sense so far 1000 meters in a kilometer I just gotta think about it I'm super done I don't know if I should say this part on camera but we're just talking about there's no plans for us or anything but just like throwing the idea around of having like super sour candy if super spicy candy in and I may be calling it like that twelve trials of Hercules or really something it's like so sour it's like oh I don't know if I can finish yeah yeah I got a mystical challenge to finish it like warheads for foundry challenge when we were kids you know like yeah we got to tell you just talking about this and make my teeth definitely sour apple would be good yeah you said a challenge man I could be like joked chocolate yeah I'll give it give it some aegyo huh or you could just buy chocolate liqueur I think it's just someone every time that we use that stuff I try to get people eat it maybe I'll not eat it it tastes bad I like it yeah I want to get a video of you eating it and a spitting it out gun this is good all right could I stand what happened last time we had it out I tried to get here to eat half a piece and she ordered I ate a whole piece damn except in Islamic summer candy potentially spice it handy to be different types of brittle I can't wait that coconut brittle you guys it's great sometimes experimental season after Easter we got like two more months yeah the day after Easter all right we gotta do something experiment at home the numbering [Music] yeah can't sell it we could try samples I thought about making a hard candy hole a few times yeah we're going for it exactly on the floor very pour it into our baking pan if you just do a small batch [Music] nicely put you know some some muscle and amber yeah that'd be cool because you know I've been thinking about sour candy since I started people at home want to do it you can just do it and use a baking pin and then let it harden and then just take a little hammer to it and break it up I got it you made your own more you know all three guys in there's one more piece left over here uh-huh it's festive no way he's gotta be here with a heat up the candy panel corabeth there we go a lot faster we've been there Oh so they were all done with this and then they turn it on it's like why he they would get done it what - and he said yeah they'd be finished the hours and of course waste to me it's like I want to go home yeah yeah like making this stuff but yeah whenever we go to work felons that's why we do it you know what it's gonna sound weird but I think they taste like chocolate cheez-its what mm-hmm it does sound weird yep I just they have like a weird out like bacon cheddar quality to them almost is there any there's no animal products in there that's the 100% cocoa this anime content may contain their so chocolate liqueur presses up okay all right I'll try it on yep I'll see what I'll see it I swear it's like yeah can you be a camera person yeah it's very chocolatey at the end but I think it tastes like it's almost like baked cheddar or something in the beginning I haven't had this isn't bitter wedding 2013 the last time I had just pure luck or and I was like oh if I go to like it a neck roll like chocolate to your shop I'll always try there there hundred percent alright I'm just gonna stop sniffing for now be brave just get it over with Greg go suck on it I like to chew them up but if you chew it up it's gonna taste more like it taste so I assume you mean cheddar right which isn't as bad as I this isn't as bad as I remember maybe it's that one that you guys they're for the more better good the other one was strong okay this one's really not that bad it was like I remember yeah I had before like your hands I could spit I was so bitter this is this is a little milder it's definitely better a little strong I'm not a huge fan of it I kind of minds of like very chocolate baby hot cocoa that hasn't been sweetened ah yeah mm-hmm well that's what it is right yeah yeah so you get chocolate core just add some sugar I like it you know it's not bad I wouldn't seek it out but yeah goodbye let's see go regular chocolate either yeah I'm gonna try making that my in hot chocolate one of these days what's that I think it's just I think it's just that like cocoa liquor and hot water or something they didn't do sugar than the Mayans they just just use the beans and then they they may be diluted it with water possibly I don't know out of it I don't know coming read any Mike Mike Mayan that works lately yeah I'll let you get back to work alright we're

be very happy to help you know we would love the features like and share this video further subscribe as always until next time from jogging on the beach they can have a great [Music]", "0gUS_AFxV-w": "Welcome back guys. Today we're bringing you another lovely animal, the most requested design from our last video's comments. An Akita Dog. Now we add the colour. At this stage, the candy is still extremely hot. You can see when we put the colour in, it steams out the water right away. Now we're pouring it onto the cooling table, so it cools down to a temperature for us to work with. As you can see now, the candy is super soft, that means it is still very hot. So we need to spread it out on the table once in a while, so that it cools down evenly, and fast. Now we're going to add in the citric acid. Today's flavour is tangerine, which requires quite a bit of acid. From the previous videos, people ask us where does the acid come from? It comes from a well known fruit, lemon. So now we're cooling it off on the granite table. This table serves to cool it off evenly. While it cools off we have to spread it out and fold it nonstop so that is cools down evenly. Many people ask us from previous videos, do the colours have the same flavours or different flavours? The answer to that question is, each batch has the same flavour - however, All the candies in the shop have different flavours. Here we go! Right now I'm stretching this big piece of candy. We have to stretch it until it's white. In order to do that we have to stretch this 120 times, sometimes 200 times! By doing this, we fold little air bubbles into the candy. What the air bubbles do is allow the light to reflect and make the candy more opaque and white. It also adds a great texture to the candy. It makes it easy to chew and crunchy. That's why our hard candies are chewable. How I will put this piece of candy on the hot table, where we shape the candy and maintain its temperature. Look how white it is now! One,\ntwo, three! This is a much smaller piece than earlier, none the less, we still have to stretch it 120 times. For smaller sizes like these, we don't need to do it on the hook. We will do it by hand on the table. We will start off today by making the eye of the dog. The upper part of the dog is orange coloured. Now we're putting on water. Water is like super glue for candies. That's what we use to stick one piece to another. As you know, the Akita dogs, it looks like they have a little eyebrow on top of their eyes. So, this is what I'm going to make right now. So from one eye, we stretch it really really long, then cut it in the middle. That gives us two identical eyes, so we don't have to make the eye twice. Now we're going to assemble the two eyes together. We got to make sure we put them together with the right orientation. You don't want one eye up, and one eye down! So now, we're making the nose! So now that we have the nose, we will attach a mouth underneither it. Now we're going to put the mouth and the eye piece together. We will now wrap around the entire face. These triangles are going to be used for the ears of the dog. Excellent! Good! Perfect! Now this is where the magic happens. How we make this giant piece into smaller candies. Now we have to chop the candies one by one. Thank you for watching. If you like the video, give us a thumbs up! To thank you for all the support you gave us during the year, we would like to choose ten lucky winners for the candy we just made today.

Until next time, au revoir!", "YmpPGpPUw0Q": "[Music] hi guys welcome to Diamond delight edibles if this is the first time you're joining my name is Liz and all-you-can regular guys welcome back thank you so much for your support I just popped that 10,000 market oh my god think you could not have done any of that without your support guys I really really appreciate it it just means the world to me you like me you really really like me sorry just being an ass having some fun alright so today what I'm gonna do now that I showed you how to do canna candy sugar & Canas syrup we can now make our gummies without using butter and the Gerber is an emulsifier however if you want to make them super super strong absolutely go ahead and stuff the butter back in there but this gives you far more control over how strong or weak that you would like to make them now you guys are always asking me how much milligrams etc something is and I don't generally tend to answer that very often because it is all dependent upon what you make how you make it once you're starting THC is etc so what I've done is in the description there I've included a link for the calculator that I use it's a free signup it's a little course you're more than welcome to have a look take a look at it listen to her she's really interesting and lots of information but the calculator you can use for free and that's what I use so then you can go ahead and you can make your calculations and figure out how strong etc that you want to make your candies and with this it gives you a lots of versatility so you can go all can of sugar and syrup or half-and-half which is what I'm gonna do in the recipe so I will stop babbling on now and I'm gonna get into the ingredients of course and of course what we need and then we'll put all that stuff together and make some awesome gummies there we go alright guys all right so for our new gelatin for our new gummy version here you're gonna use one box of your paper flavored jello I three tablespoons of unflavored gelatin a half a cup of water for blooming your gelatin or what I use are these kool-aid waters so they're just flavored water so I now use these in place of water they're great because they add more flavour to it or you can kind of combine some flavors which is really cool to do so I use those things are nice they're lighter and sugar and said just adding more flavor now another thing you can do for adding flavor is juice crystals now I get these at the bulk bar and you can only get them during the summer time but I get these in all different flavors and I've got two tablespoons of those again enhancing the flavor that way if you don't want to use or have these flavors artificial flavors you can go use those which work great the other thing you're going to need is a quarter cup of your can of syrup and a quarter cup of water for our jello and then for our candy side our candy version so it's going to be like the other one where we do the cook you're going to need a half a cup of regular sugar 1/2 a cup of can of sugar or again you can use a full can of sorry a full cup of your can of sugar same thing with your syrup I'm using a quarter cup of canned syrup and a quarter cup of light corn syrup again you can go and use as much or as little of either of those as you like I like to do the half-and-half mainly for taste and not to kill people so that's my kind of my you I don't want anybody rendered completely useless and then we are going to need 1/2 a cup of water and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid and then as well if you want to add additional colors or flavors you can add those optionally as well and as I said if you want to add your butter as well it really makes them super duper you can do that you're just going to follow exactly the same thing except the previous steps from the previous version with regards to adding the butter and the Goregaon to emulsify it now something else I wanted to say and the same thing now in this version I'm not using the clear gel however you can use the clear gel exactly the same way as you do in the previous recipe of the regular and sour gummy recipe that's a good one to follow it's the most up-to-date and gives you both those versions that you can use and that's all we need for our ingredients and now we'll get into our equipment and then we will get the best part go and we'll get all this stuff put together alright so the equipment that you're going to need just like the other recipes a double boiler I just do a makeshift I get a bowl that will make sure that your water does not touch the bottom of your bowl you will need a smaller saucepan for our candy syrup two spatulas you will need your candy thermometer and you will need a larger pot that your bought is that your saucepan small saucepan will fit into ice water water with ice in it but a little tongue-tied today and obviously your candy molds now a lot of you ask me how many candy is gum you will get out of a batch now it's all depending obviously on the size molds that you use if you use about this large size I got these from Michaels you will get about sixty if you use of this size gummy which is kind of a little bit larger than those big ones you're going to get it probably about 75 to 100 and if you use the little teeny tiny ones then you're going to get about 150 to 200 of them so that's approximately what that recipe will break down to you for you and now d'leh before we get started there is something very important that I found out from my other recipe when I started this is and I don't do this in the other recipes but when we're working with the can of sugar and the can of syrups it is a must that we oil down the sides and the insides of our pot for the candy syrup reason being when it heats up and starts boiling the oil THC oil starts to separate and it sticks to the smiths of the metal of the pot you might have noticed that if you did that with a can of syrup which is why I redid the video for that specific reason so we're going to do things a little bit differently than we do for the regular candy recipe but I'll show you all those details once we get into it but the very first thing and don't really don't want to forget is we're going to lightly grease our saucepan and hold on just couldn't dribble a little bit of oil into it and then make sure to work it all the way around make sure to get it right into the corners because anywhere that this oil is not where there's no oil your THC will sit the only thing that dissolves THC oil is oil because it is oil soluble by doing this we're going to be able to scrape anything that sticks to the sides off much much easier then seeing all your products that they're going oh what happened so you said you want to lightly grease that you don't want to have any excess oil so make sure to do that up as well as your spatulas you want to lightly oil your spatulas for the same reason when we scrape it off the sides if these are not oiled it sticks to it and it doesn't come off so you want to make sure anything that is going to be touching the THC the syrup you want to make sure that you all and that's it I'm gonna get into putting our ingredients together and get this started oh one other thing I wanted to cover is with your moles I don't spray my moles beforehand but I have found sometimes that they do stick but so what I do is I care them so I will spray them or oil them down lightly let it sit for 20 minutes in the mold and then wash them out so it still leaves that oily feel but it's not gonna leave your Piquet knees all greasy and makes it far easier for them to come as well as you only have to cure them once every few once every five or six batches or so so it lasts a long time by doing it that way all right so now I promise we'll get into the ingredients in our candy all righty so the very first thing that we are going to do is we are going to microwave our quarter cup of liquid for about 50 seconds till it's boiling and we're going to bloom our unflavored gelatin all right so you're going to evenly sprinkle your gelatin over the top of your liquid whether you use water or the kool-aid water and then you are going to stir it in now a lot of punches I explained in about whether that your gummies did not are not that they're too sticky but they're not gelatin enough that can depend a lot of power on your gelatin I just bought a batch of gelatin because I buy a bulb that didn't it wasn't blooming at the strength of it or something was not working well I did two batches and I had almost double the gelatin so a lot of it is dependent upon your gelatin now one test that I do is when I put in the three tablespoons and mix it in it should start very quickly to get the texture of apple sausage and clicking up pretty quickly now this is not so what I'm going to do is I'm going to add in another half a tablespoon of gelatin yes I've just sprinkled on another half a tablespoon and I'm gonna stir that in and now I'm getting that texture of applesauce can you kind of see what I mean that's how you know you're probably are at the great strength for your gelatin starting off if your gelatin is not right from the beginning if it's mushy I'll show you when we go to put this in but that's the texture it should be once you once we've got it mixed in now we're gonna set that aside for five minutes or so to let that bloom now meanwhile we will add our box of jell-o I'm giving the blueberries well berry blue and we are going to add in our boiling water and stir that around and get it dissolving see was it and then just keep scraping because the jello will cause the sides of the bowl are cool it's good to just kind of stick to it so just keep scraping the sides down as you go and turn your heat on to low so again we only want to melt our gelatin over a hot water bath we don't want it hot at boiling at all that's what breaks our gelatin a lot of the time is you don't even think that you've got it too hot but really past hot water probably by 150 degrees it is that's about all you need so that's that's a big mistake that a lot of people make myself included so I'm just going to continue to stir that gently until the gelatin is dissolved and then we will add in our corn syrup and our other stuff and once your gelatin and that has started to melt the sugar takes longer because the sugar melts at a higher at a bit of a higher heat so it just takes a little bit longer but once your gelatin and that is melted you can add in your corn syrup and your flavor crystals if you're wanting to add so you saw your canister your quarter cup of Kanna syrup and then your flavored juice crystals if you want to add those in as additional flavoring and again just stir that until it all starts gets incorporated and now for you guys asking for those clear gummies how do I get my gummies clear this well you can now you could have perfectly clear gummies so I'm gonna kick it continue to stir this and just gently mix it together until everything is melted and combined I'd you notice I got my nails done so for all of you those wishing that I get them done they're done and to those of you commented there you go I know I looked at the videos and thought make and those are ratty looking hands so I do apologize hopefully it'll be better from now on in the future I hope you like these a little bit better do you got a look at them for quite a long time so why not make them a little bit more attractive and also just remember to continually scrape down the sides of your bowl so that the gelatin is not sticking to the sides and just to show you this is just how hot your water should be there shouldn't be any boiling just a little bit of steam coming off of that that's as how that's as hard as you want to get it otherwise any hotter than that it's gonna break your gelatin alright so now that everything's pretty much dissolved I'm going to add in our gelatin now here's another thing if your gelatin is after 5 minutes or so blooming is mushy when you touch it then your gelatin is not strong enough so whether it's old and it's weakened or there are different gelatin with different strengths if it is nice and firm to the touch and no mushy you're good to go so I just split this up into pieces slap her in and you're just gonna let that you're just gonna gently again stir that until it completely melts and again if you start to see any kind of foaming may take it off your heat immediately it's getting too hot so I'm just gonna let them set them going to continue to stir that until my gelatin is fully melted well once your gelatin is melted and everything looks good and it is nice and translucent just set it off to the side and now we're going to start our candy syrup alright for our candy syrup in goes our half a cup of white sugar our half a cup of Candace Canon sugar our Candace syrup quarter cup a can of syrup like I said before you're more than welcome to play around with your different measurements on that as long as it equals 1/2 a cup either way it doesn't matter and our quarter cup of light corn syrup our half a cup of water and our quarter teaspoon of citric acid and we're going to gently stir that till ever - your syrup till your sugar and water and everything's just combined and then once you're combined here turn your heat on to medium Cline to start and then we're going to drop it down to medium once it begins to boil and you're just going to continue stirring this make sure to get all around the edges because the sugar likes to sit there and so we're going to continue to stir this until it starts to boil now all of my and all the other candy recipes I say as soon as we start boiling we're gonna stop stirring and use our brush not in this recipe and I'll show you once it starts boiling as I said the oils yeah I got a little syrup on the burner there so the oils start to separate out with the heat and until it gets all to the same kind of temperature it will they will stick to the side so we're going to have to continually work the sides of the pot but you're going to want to be very very gentle because we don't want to spit dirt into the syrup so as I said I'll show that all to you once it gets there now you'll start to notice as as it's starting to heat up if you scrape the sides of your pot see all that that's your oil and that's what we want to make sure it gets back into our syrup so I usually have to use the two you want as I said you have to grease both spatulas here and work it off get it back into the syrup and we're gonna have to do this continuously through the whole cooking process so at anytime that you see any darkness starting to form on the side make sure to scrape it down and as your syrup gets hotter you can just put your spatula in it'll just melt it off and also make sure when you are scraping the sides of your pot hold on to the handle firmly I've done it before I wasn't paying attention and whoops and the last thing you want is molten lava being poured anywhere other keeping it in the pot so when your syrup begins to bubble starts boiling you're gonna touch your candy thermometer and remember this is normally where I say we stop stirring not this time so we're not actually going to stir it what we're gonna do is just to continually scrape around the sides of the pot but don't go deep into the syrup we just want to stay around the bubble area and you just want to keep pulling this in so this is the alcohol of the excess alcohol and stuff burning off and any impurities that are in it so see how it's gathering up on the sides that's what we want to make sure get them back into our syrup whatever is supposed to cook off will cook off whatever is good will stay in so again just gently don't go into the stirs syrup just gently keep going around the sides and you'll do behind the candy thermometer towards the end and we are going to cook our syrup - if you want a soft candy you're gonna cook it to 260 if you want a firm candy you can go as high as 280 280 is soft crack I'm gonna go to just before that I'm going to take this to 275 but you see what I mean about the oils how they just continue they'll keep going to the sides of the pot as it heats up and gets up to temperature it will it will the oils will get incorporated and once your syrup is boiling in that you want to just turn your heat down to medium just medium a little above medium I said then don't forget to get behind in behind the thermometer because it will hide in behind there I love the smell of this syrup cooking it's oh it smells so awesome oh and just as a tip for safety always have a fan either an overhead fan I've got one going or the if you've got an overhead on your stove regardless when you're ever working with tinctures even though you've working them in a dehydrated yeah most of it's cooked off some of them may not be and you just want on the safety side always have a fan going and leave don't be sparking anything up in the in the general area so you've had your gelatin sitting over on the side and you have a look and you've noticed that there's all this white inky foam stuff and you're sure positive that you didn't do it high on high heat the heat didn't get too hot that'll happen so nice if the gelatin is old and it's starting to break down so if you do see that in order to compensate for that bloom another tablespoon of unflavored gelatin and we're going to add it into the candy mixture at the end that's gonna help us compensate for the gelatin that's broken in our mixture here so that will help it so anytime that your candies come out super sticky and you can't get them out of the mold the reason is is because the gelatin is not gelling properly so there's a really handy tip there for you guys now in order to get that out because I don't want that in to go my syrup I'm gonna run this through a strainer before we put it into our syrup so now I might actually my syrup while I was babbling away there is getting close to temperature I've got my ice water ready to go and as soon as it hits temperature I'm gonna drop the bottom into the pot and once the temperature starts coming down and the cooking process is stopped I'm gonna set it to the side until the temperature comes down to 240 before we add our gelatin in just watch your thermometer till until the temperature starts coming down and your bubbles start stop bubbling and then just set it to the side and said until your temperature comes down to 240 all right so now my syrup is cooled and then it's say because I don't want that white foamy stuff into my syrup I'm going to use a strainer to pour it through that way it'll catch all the chunks of jell-o gelatin and being bad and I'm going to mix that in now I also what I did was I bloomed another tablespoon of gelatin in a quarter cup of liquid and we're going to add that in a little bit in a little bit so right now you're going to stir your jello and your candy syrup until it is all combined and if you find that your syrup is a little too sticky and it's solidified you can put your heat on to minimum you just want to heat the bottom to get the syrup off the bottom now you can make sure that you do so that you scrape the sides and if you said if you find that it's too hard coming off turn your heat on and it'll eventually start to melt so you just want to want to keep doing that until everything is completely melted in all the same temperature all right so now that everything is all melted together and nicely mixed now this is a test that I do to determine whether my syrup is did a job correctly if I pull it up and you see how it just goes in a nice smooth syrup it doesn't really seem to start gelling or anything it stays in a fine line so that's kind of telling me that this is gonna turn out way too sticky it's gonna come out what's it like you can't get it out of the mold it's more candy than the gelatin that's what I said about my gelatin breaking there that I knew that was gonna happen so I've added it I'm gonna add in the additional gelatin that I bloomed and I'm just gonna stir that until it's completely dissolved so now if you want your syrup just translucent that nice clear there you go you've got it you can go ahead and put it into your bottles your squirt bottles or use the little eye droppers for dispensing into your molds but however I never like to keep things plain so I'm gonna do half-and-half or I've got translucent and solid and also just to give you a look to see how to go about doing that all right so now when after adding the additional gelatin in now when I do my test you'll see it's thicker and it'll start to split up and almost solidify in midair so that's how you know it's likely going to set correctly I still had to not do things correctly that's occasionally but that is a very good indication that you're safe and good to go so if you wanted translucent go ahead and put it into your bottles at this point or use your eye dropper dispensers or whatever it is that you get it into your moles however I of course need to always get fancy so I'm gonna split this into two colors so I've got half of it translucent and half of it of the solid blue whoops all right so I'm just gonna eyeball this here if you want to be exact you can pour it into a measuring cup and split it exactly however I've been doing this from this pot for quite a while so I'm pretty good at it sometimes so because I mix the blue with the green because obviously the green from our can of syrup and our sugar so it's turned out a little bit greenish and I actually want this to be blue so I'm going to add in a little bit of blue color and then on 1/2 I'm going to add in white so this one I'm mixing in a few drops of blue you can use any kind of food coloring the gel base oil-based water base for this for this particular candy recipe does not matter so we're just gonna get that stirred in oh that's a pretty color you see it on the white that's nice that's a nice kind of teal color then in my other half I'm gonna pour in some of the blue the same kind of teal but this is gonna give me the solid background as the white now if you guys have white on hand make sure that you shake it really really well if it's hot it sitting for a while it does separate and you will find that if you pour it in you're gonna get a little tiny white it doesn't go well you get little white lumps or something like that it just doesn't blend really nicely so make sure to shake it really really well you can almost hear it come back together it's like you can almost hear the water at the top and then all kind of comes together and sounds a little bit thicker so I'm gonna pour a little bit of that in isn't that pretty so again you're just gonna thoroughly mix that in until it is one complete uniform color and once I've got that i'll get it into my bottles and we'll get this into the mold there's a little trick i learned the other day find it by Occident that's on most things happen so I'm if you want to have a half and half candy where you've got the clear on the bottom and the solid on the top what you can do to easily make that happen is use your hand blender on this we whip a bunch of air into it and once you put them together the air is all I'm automatically gonna bring the solid color up to the top or if you want to do that with the if you want it the other way around then air Rach you're clear but you're gonna have to wait a while for the bubbles to come out because that's gonna make it not so clear so I recommend just putting the solid on the back you can do that it's just a quick way of doing it otherwise you have to pour one layer let it set a little bit and then pour your second layer well aren't I just a cesspool of useless information today I'm just gonna pour this into my squirt bottle this should make a full almost a full bottle or a little bit more see bang almost right on now if you guys have to haven't seen these before these are the best squirt bottles ever they just make putting it into the mould so much easier especially if you want to blend colors absolutely highly recommend these I've got there's a link for them in the description there for you to make it easy if you'd like to order them and I'm just gonna do my clear and we'll get this going all right so I said I always do two colors I always like doing that so I did combination I'll either just whoosh or if you want to happen half you can do it that way you can go this way freestyle whatever you like and that's it get them all into your mold and you're gonna put them in the fridge for a minimum of two to four hours sometimes they've got to go overnight now if you let them go overnight and they're still sticking you can't get them out of the mold put them into the freezer for a few hours let them freeze up take one mold out of it I'd add out at a time and pop them out as quickly as possible if they still if there's still stop the first you'll come out if it starts to stick throw it back in the freezer work on another mold put them into a double boiler melt them down on low heat and add another tablespoon of gelatin melt it and recast them and that will fix that problem for you and that's it enough I'll come back low will pop these out so you can have a look at them and I'll show you how to sugarcoat them not that sugarcoating is that difficult but you can coat them with the can of sugar and just show you an easy way of doing it and that'll be it will say goodbye candies upset and you can do this in a bowl or I found that doing them in a large plastic bag worked a lot easier so in this I put a half a cup of regular sugar 1/2 a cup of can of sugar and I put a quarter part about a quarter cup of the flavored drink crystals that I used in my recipe again the drink crystals are totally optional for you just adds that little bit extra flavor and then I added about a half a teaspoon of citric acid because I wanted these to be a little bit more on this our side if you just want to have just a little bit of a tick bite but not really sour at all I add a quarter teaspoon so I'll do those two my sweet ones and then to the sour I use a 1/2 a teaspoon of citric acid I don't recommend using much more than that one it's not going to the sour flavor isn't that great and it can also melt your candies because citric acid acid is water soluble so simple enough you can actually see it oh and I also have sorry a wire a wire rack with parts line o parchment paper line line on top of it for them to dry so I just pop them out these guys are popping out nicely and I get and what I do is I do one mold at a time so I leave the rest of them in the fridge because otherwise they start to warm up and they can makes it difficult sometimes for them to come out of the mall so I just think about one at a time and once I get them on the bag I go a little bit there and I just fish them out and shake off the excess sugar and we just lay them out to dry here just like all our other candies this is just a slightly smaller mold that I use same thing now see sometimes you'll do that and you'll see you think oh no they're not gonna come out they're stuck just pull the edges away and then they just they'll just come right out now if you do that and it doesn't come out that's when you would put them into the freezer so again you see that just around the edges to pull it away and they're good to go and that's about it I'm just gonna go through and sugarcoat the rest of these guys and then I'll be back to say goodbye well guys that's my little demo there on your cannon Candace Eric and sugar gummy bears I hope you enjoyed the demo as always if you have any questions at all please don't hesitate to ask and thank you guys so much again for your support and let's get to the 50,000 whoo all right so you have an awesome rest of your day and thanks again for watching [Music]", "348s5l3DjQo": "[Music] hello and welcome to lofty pursuits and public displays of confection in tallahassee florida i'm greg this is our first video of 2021 and i don't know what your plans are but nothing is going to stop me from making 2021 a great year for lofty pursuits and i hope that means it's going to be a great year for you too we're going to capture the flavor of chocolate covered strawberries chocolate-covered strawberries are kind of unique because we know exactly who invented them lorraine larusso and she did it in the 1960s and we'll get to that at the end as i mentioned this will be part of our image candy assortment for valentine's day it's available at www.pd.net and here's the full 2021 assortment what we're going to do now is add the food coloring and if you take a look as i stir it in you're going to see the steam start coming off you know that's because the food coloring is water-based and the candy may look like a liquid but has no water in it and this is how we're going to build their palettes we're going to have a red section which is of course going to be the strawberry and in this case also the outside wrap we're also going to have a little bit of trouble today it's a cold day in tallahassee and i know those of you up north are going to think florida coal well the inside of the store right now is about 67 degrees and that's giving us some trouble the candy's cooling faster than i'd like it to so this is going to be a bit of a rush the entire time we're going to see how that goes and yellow is going to be used for the background fortunately yellow a little yellow goes a very long way we always use yellow for the background because it also lets us use it for the yellow seeds of the strawberry we're going to the brown which we're also going to use on the wrap don't need very much of that you'll notice the top layer of candy is getting a little hard it's getting a little hard to work but it's still boiling out and we're still getting a lot of steam it's been a long time since i made a batch of candy just by myself this should be interesting candy's just the right temperature i didn't wait too long there you go now i'm going to cut our candy into it the palace the stop light of color here we've got the brown and this part over here cooled a little bit much so rather than fight it and take most of it off put it in here it'll reheat there i can do the same thing with the green maybe i can save a bit of the edge of this now i got too much green on the edge i'll just use it all now to go for the red if i got the temperature right it won't stick too badly to the table well that's just perfect i can keep everything apart but i didn't succeed on everything apparently came apart good so this green can do the same thing let's see how fast everything's cooling i'm not getting the drips i normally do which i kind of have to do i'm doing this on a hot summer day it's the only way to aerate the candy enough to cool it off now that the sugar is evening out there's no real cold places that i can find to put the sugar or put my hands on so i don't get burned [Music] [Music] if you'd like to try this candy for yourself please visit our website at www.bd.net [Music] [Music] so every time i pull this and fold it over i'm trapping air bubbles into the candy this is really useful for me because it's like setting up little mirrors inside the candy and every time i do that it reflects more light that means it's going to bounce the light out of the red and it's going to make it look a little more jewel-like and that's the goal here to make this more jewel-like and it also creates more surface area in the candy and uh that means that the candy dissolves a little which is good because it makes the flavor more intense [Music] the first thing i'm going to do i'm going to make the strawberry frond the strawberry friend's gonna be sort of like half of a citrus if you've seen our citrus video three i think i'm gonna have four little green prawns so this is my heating table and different parts are heated to different amounts so i'm moving it around so let it cool off but not cool off too much got to make sure that the green edges touch each other [Music] [Music] and that'll be the top of the strawberry bread we need some more yellow we're going to need less yellow than the red by a substantial amount because these are going to be the seeds i don't even need less than that this area is going to be the wrap for the seeds and the body of the strawberry and normally i make 10 little strawberry cells and i'm going to make fewer this time [Music] because i'm making fewer because i'm going to be making the i'm going to be making pewter because i'm making the chocolate bit too and will be part of the same triangle so i'm going to end up doing seven of these little things so this will end up being four and that'll end up being three two three four the center of each of these is going to be yellow giving that little strawberry seed and this will be in thirds i'll do one two three i'll get the brown and i'll start pulling cylinders off this lots of leftover brown i guess it doesn't really have to be a cylinder but it definitely lets me measure the amount of candy in my head better there we go just like that one of the problems with the green is i always have to make too much so i'm not going to use nearly all of this the patron is never as wide as a strawberry but don't worry much of this can be saved and used for the stripe the noise you just heard with me turning on the batch roller it's a little squeaky today gonna have to lube it after all this is done a little bit of red isn't going to be a problem because we're going to put it right against the red from the strawberry or the brown and it's not ever going to be noticed [Music] there we go now all we have to do is do the outer wrap and in the meantime i'm going to put this on the batch roller let it spin for a few minutes but i don't let it go flat so now we get to see how soft these things still are they're plenty soft so we're going to be able to use these as stripes and you may wonder why we don't do much audio here live audio here the noises like that squeaking is definitely part of it also the noises from the customers are part of it because we can't use that audio according to youtube but today it's raining and we have no customers so we're not going to have that problem [Music] yeah approximately approximated the size very very close now i've got my log chocolate covered strawberry [Music] and off to the batch roller so so [Music] if you think about it chocolate covered strawberries are different than other chocolate covered fruits chocolate-covered orange peels are preserved orange peels chocolate-covered cherries are preserved too but chocolate-covered strawberries are fresh and they trace their roots back to the imagination of lorraine larusso a candy maker from a candy maker's family in chicago who was working at a grocery store that had a large candy section the cool thing about this story is i don't have to tell it to you even though lorraine passed away in 2014 she can tell her own story the produce department was right next to my candy department and ralph who was a manager used to get these driscoll strawberries from california i said you know i got a good idea we'll set up a display and we'll dip strawberries for mother's day and it became such a success and 25 hours is selling with an investment of only 700. i had a return of over 3 dollars we took the lag of candy and we drew it down into rods of candy and now we have to cut them into individual bite-sized pieces for the final assortment and we do that on our canvas if you're interested in hearing more about lofty pursuits please check out our other videos we also have a weekly or roughly weekly podcast that you can get wherever podcasts are available or off our website www.pd.net it's very different from the videos because i don't limit myself to candy do and now to see how our chocolate covered strawberry came out i really wish we could put the smells across on youtube too the smell of this candy being made was so much like a chocolate covered strawberry you could almost imagine biting into it in juice running down your fingers thank you for watching we appreciate it if you want to try this candy for yourself please go to www.pd.net you can get the candy there you can also follow us on facebook twitter and instagram and remember to subscribe to us here on youtube and to ring the bell so that you get notifications if you ever come to tallahassee we're right up the thomasville exit off i-10 we make the candy in the front of the store and we make it a lot of days but not every day so if you're lucky you can come and catch us making candy and we'd love to see you thank you again for watching and we'll see you in the next video", "FIvxTPO_x3A": "hi folks its flower child 1970 and as promised I am going to show you how to make homemade gummy bears the easy way this is the easy way there's so many ways on the internet I just this is what three ingredients four ingredients actually if you include the water okay so you are going to need Knox gelatin I'm gonna bring you up just so it's not crooked you will need Knox gelatin okay or brand name gelatin don't go I've tried to go the cheap route and just by no-name gelatin I'm telling you folks I don't know what these name brands stop having them but there is an extra ingredient or something that allows this to work so you will need Knox gelatin only two packets okay so I have my two packets of Knox gelatin you will also need half a cup of kind of oil which is kind of this oil or coconut oil infused with cannabis so this is kind of coconut oil a measuring cup because you need half a cup of hot water and whatever brand of jello you want to use today I am using grape okay so it's gonna get a little shaky I'm sorry so do not turn on your stove yet what you do first is put your dry ingredients in first so you're gonna add your jello I'm opening it up oh god I broke a nail okay so just put your jello in whatever flavor and use name-brand jell-o do not use no-name jello its I'm not sponsored by them or anything but it does make a difference folks okay you can try it doing in a cheaper way but I'm telling you it's not gonna work they won't set right though they'll separate that Kenoi 'el will separate from the jello and you'll get a two-tone candy gummy bear and it looks terrible and it tastes terrible so we put our gelatin in again you're doing the dry ingredients first grape jelly smells good my garbage aside and then you're gonna want to mix this really well so that you don't see the white crystals anywhere on top you can even do it this way just shake it about it works it either way of stirring it or just shifting it in the pot pan and I'm using a nonstick pot it's very important that you use a nonstick pot as well so I am going to add my half of cup of hot water I did boil it already and now it's okay to turn on the stove because you're putting in your water I have mine at medium art whoops terribly sorry about that just mix it around you're gonna want to make sure that the there's no clumps in here and all the grit is gone you don't want to feel great at the bottom of the pan you want to make sure it's smooth much like how you would make it when you make you jello so we're just going to stir this around for a little bit for a few minutes just to make sure everything's separated and something fell on my burner sorry so what you also need while that is it'll boil a little bit it's just on four but what you also need are molds okay and what I have here and you'll see it over on the other side once this mixture is ready and you will need one of these little plunger things but if you where did I buy these I think I bought these at bulk barn I think I bought them at bulk barn and when you buy them you get three of these trays which have 50 divots each they're little gummy bears 50 divots each so you get 150 total in three trays and you get two or three of these little plungers to suck up the stuff and the mixture and put it in here so you're not burning yourself or using a spoon or anything like that okay and because there's always overflow it makes more than 150 I have my other trusty Molde here with the emoji faces on them so yeah I mean it's pretty basic it only takes a few minutes what takes the longest in my opinion is having them solidify in the fridge so I think this is pretty well mixed yeah it's mixed so just because I'm going to rush it but don't rush it because of a mixture might not work out as well it's actually starting to bubble so I chose great because I find that you taste the can of oil I know it doesn't bother some people but I like to taste the sweetness and the sugar and stuff so I guess you could put it less than half a cup in there you could put a quarter cup in here depending on your tolerance but my tolerance is quite high I eat a fair bit of edibles and I do consume it by smoking it so throughout the day and so I use a half a cup of the can oil so it's pretty good right now I think I'm just going to add the can of oil okay so we're gonna add it slowly just make sure that it gets mixed in there's a lot of stirring involved in this it's just I mean I've watched different people do it online and I know some people just leave it be but I don't I prefer to keep stirring it because I find the more you're stirring it the more it's going to stay mixed together I find it separates a lot sometimes so just be careful of that be cautious and be aware because if they don't mix well when they're solidifying they separate and it gives you a two tone candy I don't like that I find the butter it just or the kind of oil separates from the gelatin and I don't know why that is so I prefer to do it mixing it a lot stir stir stir came and add the rest of it you know just see the gelatine ah oh no glad I noticed that it's a little hair there so you want to mix this once all the butter or the can oil sorry I keep saying butter and used to make it with butter instead of the coconut oil but it's just it's not butter it's coconut oil so I'm sorry if I keep saying butter I don't mean butter I mean it's kind of oil kind of as coconut oil so now it's starting to heat better and it's gonna boil up as you can see which is good you do want that but stir as it does that so you're gonna want to stir it for about five minutes you might have to turn your stove down like I'm going to do cuz I find that's bubbling too much I'm actually gonna lift it up off the stove and move you up I'm sorry my phone's getting a little hot I'm gonna move you over here okay you can still see hahaha sit in the bunk pot they're just silly to do that so yeah I'm oh five minutes four to five minutes you're going to want to keep stirring it as it's sitting on the stove on medium four or five degrees depending on how your stove how hot your stove gets but it's pretty well mixed even the stuff on the side is mixed into the pot I'm gonna lift it up just so I can see how well it's mixed and then it's all mixed and looking well together excuse me I'm sorry about that so I hope you guys enjoy this video I can't believe I've never showed you guys how to make gummies before but this is homemade gummies they're not gonna taste exactly like and the textures not going to be exactly like this way the way I'm showing you I mean they still taste gummy obviously because of the gelatin and this is the easy cheap way to make yourself some gummies you can use whatever mold you like but I prefer to use the little gummy bear molds and the emoji molds okay I'm gonna shut the heat or actually no I'm gonna keep the heat on low because the mixture kind of cools itself down when you're dispersing it into the mold so having it a heat source is a good thing because it helps keep it hot or warm depending on what temperature you're gonna keep it set at when you're putting it into the mold it's important not to have it too higher you're just gonna burn the mixture and it's not gonna work at all so I've got it on low because I'm going to get ready to put it into the molds and I move the pot back and forth but since I'm filming it I'm gonna put you in another spot yes so that looks really good it's mixed really well I don't see a lot of the remnants of the the cano around the rim which is nice that means I've been stirring enough and there it's gone off the spoon or the mixing spatula okay I'm gonna move you over here you're gonna see my broken picture on the floor I can't believe that happened to fell right off the wall and boom down to the ground it went and it smashed okay it's kind of crooked you guys are gonna be having crooked necks trying to watch this oops well I'm sorry for all the movement I'm just trying to get it so that I can film it set it like that then okay here we go you have our little little miniature turkey basters [Laughter] okay here we go so just take some up obviously you guys know how these little things work where are we start on this end okay and sometimes I noticed because it's so hot it'll squirt back out I'd yeah it's kind of hard to see that but just be careful this stuff is really hot so you just put it in squeeze it into your molds kind of at medium to fast pace because this whoops this stuff cools fairly quickly I notice when I'm doing them but you will get if you're using this small gummy bear molds about a hundred and fifty plus gummies yeah so you can once they are solidified I've noticed some people on the internet use sugar powder I can't remember confection powder sugar to sprinkle on them because they are a little oily from the kind of oil that's mixed with them but I don't do that I just keep them in the fridge and then if I want some because obviously the touched her when they're in the fridge constantly is a little harder than if you left them at room temperature once they are all solidified and ready to be eat so you just continue ba-ba-ba-ba-ba get them all in there squeezing as you go so yeah I just I couldn't believe I was looking through my videos going yeah indeed I've never shown anyone how to make the gummy bear so this is how you do it this is my way of doing it this is and I find the texture fine you just got to make sure that you're also doing this stirring it around because it does separate and putting it back on the stove is a nice idea to keep the temperature hot whoops making a bit of a mess but I mean I'm sure instead of using cannabis oil to make these like some type of edible or treat for the kids leave out the kind of oil obviously oops no there we go was a little raised up there we gotta have them even so they harden properly and they're all ready to go at the same time you know what I mean so I find this fun to do this I mean I love to bake especially when they're edibles we're almost done here folks I'm actually gonna put this back on the stove for a second be right back just noticed it was starting separate you don't want that to happen okay all right she didn't had the stove on hot so I might take a little longer for you guys if you have it on medium or low so obviously we're gonna get more than 150 there's 25 in each of those gummy bear sheets so we're just gonna fill these up now obviously the emoji the pink sheet that I'm doing right now is going to take longer to harden because they're deeper bigger so I won't be showing you those but I'm hoping that these little ones if I put them in the freezer will solidify really well and I'll be able to show you them in the video no guarantees because my phone's been really wacky lately and when I pause it it shuts off on my phone sometimes so we're getting to the very last of it and it will the last few gummies will be very mediciney because of the butter that stays behind that's really what I'm soaking up here I can just see the difference so I'm just gonna pour it in there okay okay so I am going to cheat and put them in the freezer alrighty and hopefully hey that looks see that that looks like the Mickey Mouse symbol you see that a little dollop right there two ears all righty so that's what we do so far so good okay got a bit of the counter in there

how you make gummy bears folks it's pretty simple it's pretty basic and it's really easy and quick it's quick nothing to it the longest it takes in my opinion is to solidify them in the fridge which is usually about 15 20 minutes but we're gonna cheat and use the freezer okay lemon honey see you soon right alrighty so it only took five minutes but here are some this is what they look like whoops

liquid 50 milligram thc lollipop now if you only got a wreck if you're only a wreck user you can only get these in 10 milligrams if you got a medical card you can get them in 50 milligrams so it is 150 milligram pop i like how they do uh their little thing right there um they they do it like ski slopes like the recreational ones they're actually they're 2.5 milligrams the gummies they make they have a green circle then they have um then they have uh a blue square which is when they're like 5 to 10 milligrams and then they got the black diamonds for ones that are like 20 to 50 milligrams i've got uh these little hard candies too which are really good the canyon suckets um they're tight they're tiny little hard candies i'm really a big fan of these let me show you how small these things are right here they're tiny me see just a little tiny hard candy and that's a little thin and that's 20 that's 20 milligrams right there and it's good very good i got one of those left i'm gonna save it for um movie i'm about to watch i went ahead and bought that uh that new wrong turn this is supposed to be [ __ ] crazy it's supposed to be about a cult um they're changing it up a little bit it's not necessarily a remake it's like a it's like a new wrong turn so hopefully that's gonna be [ __ ] good i'm gonna say my last little second to uh chew during the movie and uh i'm also gonna eat me a lollipop um these are good man i've had them before i'm not gonna lick this right now because i have a uh hard candy in my mouth but you see it's nice and sour it's got the thc uh diamond right there on it [Applause] and uh you know what's cool is your colorado they're thc dot it's a diamond um that's totally from from ski culture um it's the reason why they made a diamond like black black diamonds um and uh it's just great because you know washington's got a different center symbol california's got a different symbol um now this actually most of these you know they're usually about 50 milligrams this one has 45.5 milligrams cbd it has close to three milligrams of cbd 2.56 milligrams two and a half milligrams of cbd um so yeah man it's a good product canyon i like them um they use a really good what they call cannabis essential oil which is a co2 oil and um you know i like the hashier edibles the more like full spectrum edibles definitely with the oil they use is um has a has a tiny bit of a hashy flavor but it doesn't betray the whole thing it's not distillate it's a co2 um cannabis oil which it has other things in there like the terpenes and the um you know it's the full it's a full spectrum oil it's not just a not just a clear distillate but like i said these these are very good um so yeah i suggest you try one um i've tried them before it's got a good very good sour grape flavor i'm not even a huge fan of the of uh grape but i like it i like it a lot and um i always tell you the the this batch is made with box sativa hybrid they always make it with a bulk uh hybrid or indica hybrid usually um this one right here you see it's just uh made with just bulk hybrids so sure they get like a whole bunch of untrimmed um good good bud to make their oil out of but yeah man canyon good good company and um they also have gummies too their gummies are uh tiny like these and usually they're only 2.5 to 5 milligrams they're small doses but they're little so you eat a bunch of them at a time anyway thank you guys for watching my channel um i hope y'all have a good rest of the evening i'm gonna watch my movie get do a few dabs and uh eat a cannabis lollipop so take care peace", "Fj5PoNrZ3OI": "welcome to community cannabis review today i'm going to be doing a review on a cartridge i'll be doing a review on a select co2 oil cartridge the strain is cinex which i believe is a cross between cindy 99 and pineapple express so um i grabbed this one because this one looks really really nice you've seen it you can check my other videos if not but um check out the other co2 oil carts from them and they look like some standard co2 oil like fairly dark oil this one looks incredible same price same like batch as all the other co2 oils but it looked great so let me turn the camera around and show you then i'll take a couple puffs [Music] hmm [Applause] [Music] hey [Music] wow [Music] alrighty so let's get into this um first off i'll correct myself by saying it is actually a cross between cindy 99 or cinderella 99 and vortex i had not heard of vortex prior to this but seems like a good strain um very interested after just reading a quick leafly article about this strain seems like it's heavy on um less on the mirror scene in the cardiophiline which i get bored of seems like it's heavy on pinene and limonene potentially which i really like so first off trying to make more videos but struggling to find the time and motivation and also more so just not get greedy because i recently just bought like a gram of six star hash rosin that i was wanting to make a video on but i just got into it way too quick and didn't even take a picture prior to me opening it so i feel like that's not the best way to make a video so i'll buy another gram eventually and get a video on it and it was super great um but first let's start with what we have here cine cynix um so let's see it first off amazing for their co2 oil you normally don't get anything besides like that dark black oil basically which i'm not against for the price that it goes at it's pretty good stuff wow that's one of the best cards i've had in a good while um definitely has like a little base layer i always notice a heavier notes first a little bit of like that peppery taste but it is strong with the definitely taste a good bit of pinene in there and then maybe some like lemonade as well lemony is always light to me so if there's a lot i couldn't tell anyways that really really evens it out it's not it's always like such a standard boilerplate co2 oil taste which is a lot like whiskey or like there's usually a lot of humiliating in there this one it's got i mean it's got the slightest bit of that taste to it but it has so many other like terpenes going on that it overpowers that easily and that it's good it's uh it's very citrusy but it's like a heavy citrus it reminds me of grape with but it doesn't it's not like grape flavor it just reminds me of grapes grapes like a heavy fruity taste to me it's like um orange and mango is kind of mixed with like a peppery peppery main taste yeah so that's all i got on this one really but i mean that is a solid cart right there for their select co2 line highly highly um hats off to them because that's really really well done so thanks for watching i'm going to try and get more videos out especially some new brands not just the same old stuff but unfortunately there's not many new brands to work with so yeah i'll see what i can do but thanks for watching and grab one of these check it through the window of the cart first but even the dark ones look are pretty decent in my opinion but i mean if you see one like this go for it alright thanks for watching you'll have a great", "aUMaoTYB01k": "man what's up I'm Jayden today I am bored and I am going to be reviewing these because I have nothing better to do and these are in the bed with me so yeah like this if cherry watermelon blue raspberry and green apple they do not have a great flavor like regular Jolly Ranchers I wish they would had a great flavor though this is what they look like and when you take them out of the wrapper they're a little bit on the end like here they're a little bit more like rounded cuz others just look like cylinders finder these are rounded to look like a 3d eventually I don't wanna make y'all like watch me eat but like well been chilly this hour will come out okay i'ma stop it's to cringey um and the sourness will come out I have to please our and I read it like the four and a half out of five as well just for

beer well time for beer candy we got Katie McLaughlin from Los Angeles joining us now we do like to have beer on me the afternoon show on a Friday there is no beer will sell for their candy to pity they're not here well I maybe I'll have to send you some their new yeah so where does it be okay if for a man manly candy is what this is so there's beer infused into is it chocolate is it hard candy what are we going to be eating or what's he going to be eating right a variety of entrepreneurs have tried different ways to infuse candy with beer so there's beer caramel that's quite popular there are some beard heart beer hard candies although this is technically difficult because hard candy is made by bringing sugar up to I temperatures and beer can burn at those high temperatures and then get ruined so you don't see as many hard candies but there are a few a few people have figured it out beer marshmallows beer brittle so this all sounding delicious to you I'm good a popsicle popsicle would that work um I I think that if the technology is there to make beer candy you could probably make a beer problem so how was the alcohol content here how much does Simon have to eat to get his weekend buzz on right well with it what the candy makers will tell you is enjoy the beer candy which has no alcohol and then enjoy it with a beardo beer pairing so some of this has come out of that idea that there that you could pair beer with chocolate beer has become more chocolaty in recent years in the craft beer industry there are lots of stouts and porters out there as many are called chocolate stouts which is a result of dark roasting the malls and so some candy maker stuck with me we're gonna have two and a half two we're gonna have to hold it off the air we need a bit Katie

aftertaste boy that is just moving but I like you stay tuned in wood", "6FQlIslZYAM": "you're going to be surprised at just how simple it is to make your own rock candy today welcome to Todd's kitchen who doesn't love rock candy it's so simple yet delicious but let's put a little Christmas Ben on it so join me today as make my version of rock candy and also don't forget to check out Todd's kitchen com for my merchandise store now to start off with I have a pot on the stove on a high heat so today I'm going to add 3 and 3/4 cups of sugar then to that I'm going to add 1 cup of corn syrup or glucose syrup then 1 cup of water and finally a few drops or dissin out of red food coloring being a Christmas theme so it just can't - keep on stirring this over high heat until the sugar is dissolved and it comes up to a boil okay so once it's come up to a boil I'm going to turn it down to a medium heat now and just keep on stirring it just another minute or two just so it doesn't burn the bottom of the pot so basically at a medium temperature this is going to a simmer away for about 40 to 45 minutes you want a nice and slow you don't do it too fast and what I highly recommend is to use a candy thermometer now these are very cheap they're probably about 15 dollars and we want to go for the hard crack stage which is 300 degrees Fahrenheit or about 150 degrees Celsius so basically what it does it just sits on the side of the pot like so with a thermometer just inside and that will tell you the temperature that's that your sugar is currently acts so remember the low and slow is best because you want to make sure that all that water is evaporated and but give it a chance for that sugar to warm up nicely till we get to the hard crack stage so you want to add some peppermints for their Christmasy taste or we can add strawberry it's really up to you you can use any flavor that you'd like for this candy but being a Christmas version you want to try and keep it more Christmasy so I'm going to add some peppermint extracts and keep it as a red color so remember low-and-slow gonna should take about 40 to 45 minutes give or take okay so just got to the hard crack stage so I'll turn the heat off and I've also taken it straight off the heat you don't want to overdo it otherwise you can burn the mixture so what I have here is just a shallow baking dish and I'll just line with some baking paper so basically all we have to do now is just pour on our candy mixture on to our shallow dish now try and get as wide as you possibly can or as big as you possibly can possibly can so it's not overly thick and once there that's all you do it so it's simple as that just let that rest and sit there and cool down for a good two three hours and then it's ready you don't have to put it in the fridge or anything it is really that simple now as a tip with the pot just simply fill it with water and over the course of a few hours the water will simply dissolve all that leftover sugar and candy and you will be left with a perfectly clean pot so you won't have to worry about trying to scrape or break off any candy that's hardened on the pot okay so as you can see it is now completely set so you should another piece of baking paper here and I'm just going to place that just on top and just on the rolling pin basically just going to shut it see also start to break up like glass [Music] okay so I'm just got a bowl now I'm just going to put some powdered sugar icing sugar just going to place that into the base now because this is going to be very sticky so I got to coat it in the icing sugar so you see it just comes off the pot comes apart just like so and we just break it up and cover it in the icing sugar there's any really sharp pieces if you have kids around just make sure you just try and break those little bits off you can even eat the little bits if you like so this way I'll just prevent it from being all sticky so we have our candy and there we have our special Christmas edition rock candy no of course you can make this at any time of the year you can use any color that you like any flavor that you like for any season whatsoever because rock candy is so simple to make but it's also versatile so just by adding superb Mint and making a red for Christmas I've made it into a Christmas edition but the sky's the limit and rock candy is pure sugar so you do want to have it in moderation but honestly no matter what flavor that's use what color that you use rock candy always tastes simply delicious", "8bzWmwJ2hOw": "fruit by the scoop dropping Monday January 13 2020 this is the limited edition flavor of fuel coming to campus protein an industry-first fruit roll-up inspired flavor so for those who are uncertain about fuel you can also check some of my previous reviews in the comment box below but it is the king of energy to replacements typically around 40 to 50 stems per serving so on the back is a transparent label there and I kind of like that like I tell all my customers is Kelsey one being one of them who is here visiting for the weekend that you going to a mom-and-pop store paid two and three bucks an energy drink pop into a Giant Eagle Walmart pay 2 to 3 bucks a drink this is nearly a quarter of the amount to get phenomenal flavoring and also fantastic energy fuel highlights a gram and a half of creatine 1.2 grams of beta-alanine one gram of citrulline you have I think 750 milligrams of Kitaen on the back and then there's a mix of cooperating cognitive enhancers such as choline tyrosine recovery with taurine and around 200 milligrams of caffeine some of the previous limited-edition flavors such as white frost and Baja Breeze were 250 milligrams and caffeine Campus proteins went back to the oak geez just like pink burst and some of the newer flavors peach rings and strawberry Kiwi at 200 so it's a pretty happy medium right there so what we're gonna do today we're gonna mix up this bad boy and I'm gonna give you a taste test and also Kelsey is here to kind of chime in as well because sometimes you people think that my reviews are subjective so we're just about to figure out so you can kind of see there's like a little color desperation in there I don't know what's really what was here but whoever got is definitely up to something how's so fruit roll-ups if you're not unfamiliar with it come in multiple flavors of course some for you there yeah I think there's about 14 different flavors of fruit roll-ups so I honestly don't have any clue what to expect as far as how this will taste just by smelling it right so here we go moment of truth flavoured God campus protein everyone watching Cheers yes give it a whirl I get a little bit of cherry I get a little bit of watermelon yeah I get a blue raspberry vibe cherry watermelon maybe a little hint of strawberry on the back end it's definitely an array of fruit roll-ups kind of congealed into one yeah I don't know what room was going for the flavor guide but I tell you what I would put this right up there with papers yeah me too with all of our other flavors on the lineup how would you rank them I would say oh gosh I honestly would put this one first and then pink first and then probably featuring I know your big peach range first mmmm strawberry Kiwi I haven't had these ones yet so I can't speak to that is dry I would have to say yeah yeah I'd have to I don't have to really agree with Kelsey here between one and two this is really up there with pink bars it's a hard choice if you were fan of pink burst you're a fan of fruit roll-ups you guys are not gonna want to miss out on this like I said this is limited edition once it's gone it's gone and this is dropping on Monday the 13th make sure you use the order link in the comment box below I'll also update it with coupons and have a full write-up for you guys so mean cuz you're gonna knock out some fuel go get a workout hope you guys enjoyed", "aB_7ybNekGU": "as you know I'm an old man I'm getting up there in years you sir there's a lot of gray up here and in here not quite 60 yep I'm close but it occurred to me the other day that there are a lot of things that I've never done before and and one of them was make candy so that changes today well hello there old man Kelly you're Jeff to my friends in Utah me Jeff um let me tell you something about myself I don't cook I don't even barbecue I know take my man card away this guy doesn't barbecue men are supposed to barbecue so in an effort to broaden my horizons I thought what's something I've never done before and that's meat candy now was thing I was thinking back to when I was a kid we used to have these these flat hard candies that were about I don't know four or five inches by an inch and I'm really thin they were covered with plastic and you peel the plastic off they were delicious there was a cinnamon one that I used to always get at our local well it was a pharmacy that right down the road that sold candy and I'd get him there and they thought you've got to be able to make those at home right so I went on the internet I found four or five maybe six people who showed how they make rock-hard candy and I thought I could do that so I took these recipes from different people and sort of combined them and everybody had their own slight different way of doing it though it's all pretty much the same thing and so right now I'm gonna go through how I made some cinnamon rock-hard candy you need sugar I use two cups of sugar for this recipe light corn syrup you're gonna need about two thirds cup about 3/4 cup water is necessary and the flavoring I'm using the cinnamon oil that my wife got from somewhere and doing the powdered sugar for the very end a few other things you might need is a candy thermometer and parchment paper don't use wax paper the wax might melt parchment paper is better okay in my saucepan first I'll add the corn syrup that very thick sticky corn syrup follow that by the sugar that's 2 cups sure and the water with a food coloring just for style turn on to a high heat initially you want a high heat to really get this boiling quick but you have to keep stirring till everything's dissolved you don't want to stop stirring because you don't want it to start burning to the bottom of the pan remember you're a high heat once you get it to a good boil then you're ready to turn down the temperature of Bin's come out to a medium heat and now we're gonna let it simmer for about 30 to 40 minutes and this point we want to use our candy thermometer and now the goal or what we have to do here is get this concoction up to about 300 degrees that's called the hard crack temperature or something like that it's just a little over 300 degrees you can see our temperature's rising quickly but reality this took almost 40 minutes to get to the right temperature and of course a little coffee while we're waiting and our temperature continues to climb to get that's hard crack temperature and I'm not sure if you're supposed to but I kept stirring because I was afraid it would stick and burn and all that stuff and it didn't seem to hurt it we're almost there you can see it hard crack has been reached [Music] okay so we immediately removed from heat we can take up the thermometer this is where we add our flavoring my cinnamon oil I'm gonna add the whole bottle to this and almost immediately the whole house is filled with that cinnamon flavor you can smell it everywhere and you've got to stir it quick because this stuff gets thick and hard next we'll take a baking sheet covered with our parchment paper and we're gonna dump it right on there this thick gooey mess don't get any on you kids have your parents do this that kids don't try this at all because this is very dangerous very hot sticky mess 300 degrees and is too bright to your skin and burn you pretty bad if you're not careful and that's it now we've got to wait for hours before we can break this up and put the powdered sugar on and so we're done it's been four hours since I poured the concoction onto my pan and the nice part is it'll peel right up now look at this it's almost like a clear piece of glass right every so this you should just break it into chunks and look at that broke up nice and now what they say you have to do is cover baking powder because it's still sticky and though I actually like it like that the candy and remember it wasn't covered in baking powder but that had that plastic the plastic over it so I'll cover it with baking powder baking powder add some sweetness so I don't think it needs it and it'll get rid of the stickiness right and so you end up with chunks and all different shapes and sizes and now [Music] pretty tasty does remind me of those fire sticks I you see it as a kid and cinnamon always goes well with coffee so [Music] but it does plastic containers save it for later thank you for watching I hope you appreciated this I tried something new today and I sure enjoyed doing this maybe I'll do candy again in the future find another handy recipe if you've got a candy recipe you think I should try it let me know let's see if we can do it otherwise this is jeff saying so long okay [Music]", "dNfrNTZ5Sz8": "[Music] okay today we're here to review these uh three um they're kind of unusual jelly beans they're flavored like uh normal candies so this is jolly rancher uh jelly beans this one's sour patch kids jelly beans this one is nerds jelly beans let's try this one first this is jolly ranchers i'm not sure if they're the different foods will taste differently really for original flavors this is a purple one red pink orange green purple light blue i think nope i think they do taste all the flavors taste different i mean the colors taste like the flavors and they're all colored like the outsiders colors like the inside not quite as um um the flavors are not quite as prominent as like the jolly rancher flavors but they're pretty close [Applause] actually as you chewing more the flavor comes out more this one's supposed to have five flavors let's see one two three four five so there's red yellow orange green and blue blue raspberry you gotta get past the sugar first and then the sour comes in that one was a lime one that one wasn't as bad as the blue one was red one's pretty sour too that was red berry orange is not as bad [Applause] nothing's not as bad either no they're stuck twicky [Applause] okay these are nerds big chewy nerds let's see only three colors nope that's the same thing i think there's only three colors all right orange four cups these are crunchier on the outside i'm trying to remember what things did i used to eat them all the time what was that one the red one was a little sour yellow's a little sour too nerds are a little sour so yeah these are a little sour these are more sour because they are sour patch kids and then these are just kind of a normal rancher type flavors [Applause] and each of the colors are different flavors so it's not like i don't know you probably could just grab a handful and stick it in your mouth they're they're not that weird flavor is not like uh jelly bellies or sometimes you can get some weird flavors in there but yeah these are all good if you're kind of tired of all the the normal jelly beans where they all taste the same every color tastes the same try getting these instead because they're different and i bought these probably actually i think two of them i bought at uh five below i don't remember which two and then the other one i bought at i think target or something so if you find them they're probably only here for easter so get them all you can or wait till after easter and get them for 75 off so anyways let me take another break with this one i like the sour ones and i'll see you in the next one", "JzUBuzE4qQ4": "hey guys it's five phoenix here back again with another video but in today's video it's really special two reasons one um i'm gonna be eating my warheads but second reason is i'm gonna be doing it with a friend his name is chris what up guys yeah um you if you've seen my um try to find a raygun video you must have saw him in the that video we've tried to go to we tried to get it ready on but we didn't make sure to check that video out it was pretty good so let's get right into the parkour yeah the power cord okay let's get right into the video so here we have the warheads ah sophisticated oh it smells gross sorry it's just stupid gravel in the water okay one thanks for mine okay i only have two water rooms okay so we're gonna be trying um two two under there um two of each flavor um no actually we're gonna try one of each flavor okay so i've got my oh there's a lot of them last water but okay whichever flavor you like the best you can eat tools okay watermelon it's pimple and mine is a black cherry so hopefully i don't die after this okay so we're going to start off with which one do you want to start off with oh let's start off with my favorite okay okay three two one i i've tried this yes it's really sour but it gets sweet mine's pretty sweet me too and the one that i'm not looking forward to extra shower thanks we're doing it hardcore on ourselves they're extreme sour okay so let's move on to the next one um start by the end of this we're gonna have so many warheads in our mouth the thing is the sweet warheads you have always keep them in your mouth then the sour ones when you think it's sour just get the sweetener you've already dried apple oh okay started in my mouth what's with your face it's not even that sour always keep it on the side of your cheek okay now looking forward to the next one oh i got two more heads in my mouth i got two so so far we've tried apple and watermelon and then so in the next episode we will try blueberry and red and black cherry that was all for trying warheads and uh i'll make a part two this is too much for me to handle so i'll make a part two and the part two is coming out to this one so um and we're gonna eat lemon in part two so we're gonna eat three um we'll eat lemon and like part three so okay um yeah so that's it subscribe subscribe like and yeah till then peace", "qG-Ac48CyVU": "what's up friends welcome back today i will be showing you how to make infused pixie sticks the powder inside of these can also be used to dip your suckers into to eat by itself and if you add a lot of citric acid you can get it so sour that it's even more sour than warheads which is kind of how i like mine in this video i'm also going to be showing you guys how to infuse the sugar but if you already have infused sugar or don't need to know how to make it you can skip to six minutes in this video to get right to making the pixie sticks [Music] to make the infused sugar you're going to need half a cup of tincture and one and one quarter cup of granulated sugar start by pouring your sugar into a large dish and then pour your tincture on top and stir it all together i felt like mine was too liquidy so i added another quarter cup of sugar and then stirred that some more after i added the sugar the consistency was much better you could definitely still see the grains instead of it being mostly liquid like it was before um if you guys aren't sure about how much sugar to use if you find it's too liquidy just keep adding a few spoonfuls of sugar until you get a consistency closer to something like this then we need to evaporate all the alcohol off of this sugar so we're going to preheat our oven to the lowest temperature that it can go for me that's 170 degrees and we're going to place it into the oven leaving the oven door open and i'm also having a fan just to help with air circulation because you are having alcohol in the oven you have to be very very very careful to make sure to never close the oven door and to always have good airflow then i'm going to set the timer for about 10 minutes and every 10 or 15 minutes i'm going to come back and stir the mixture this is what mine is looking like after the first 10 minutes so i'm just going to stir it and try to kind of scrape down the sides and i'm gonna have to do this quite a few times like i said every 10 to 15 minutes just come and stir it so because i am making pixie sticks um i want to flavor my sugar so i want two different flavors so i'm just going to get another baking dish and pour part of this mixture into it and then i'm going to add a flavoring oil to each dish now we want to do this earlier in the process so we can help with the evaporation of the liquid but it doesn't really matter if you put it in the first 15 minutes the second 15 minutes or anything like that just try and put it while there's still liquid in there so that it can evaporate with the rest of the liquid then we'll just put it right back into the oven for another 10-15 minutes again we're going to have to repeat the process of in the oven for 10-15 minutes take it at a stir put it back in the oven for 10-15 minutes take it out to stir until it has returned to its original grainy sand consistency so at this point the sugar has been in the oven for about 45 minutes i think and is still a little bit too liquidy so again we're going to stir it and then put it back in the oven for a bit and continue to do this until we get a nice consistency so after about an hour and a half it was pretty much all good i did leave it sitting out um for a couple hours just to dry off any extra moisture and then here is what it looked like you can see it definitely made some clumps so we are going to break those up and each of these dishes are different flavors for me but um one is bubble gum and one is watermelon so i don't really mind if i'm using the same utensils because the flavors kind of go together but yeah so i'm just going to scrape all the sugar off the bottom of the dish and then we are going to put it in a blender to um make it nice and refined so i'm just pouring some of this sugar into my blender and we're going to try and grind it down into a finer texture unfortunately i don't know if it's because i put too much sugar that might be the problem um i it wouldn't really grind like the the blender wouldn't really get it to um like mix i don't know it just it wasn't working very well for me so i decided to use a food processor instead but i have a feeling if i did smaller amounts in the blender it probably would have worked a little bit better so using the food presser helped a ton it was coming out very very nicely you can see the texture is beautiful and i just continued to do this for all of my sugar until it was all ground down nicely i do want to mention that humidity plays a very important part in being able to make this sugar properly i luckily have air conditioning in my apartment so i set it really high so we could dry out the space as much as possible if it's too humid your sugar will clump so just try to avoid that if you can otherwise maybe just use extra sugar where i live in canada is not very humid at all so it's not something that i've really had to worry about but for those of you who do maybe you can leave some advice in the comments to help others out as well so at this point the sugar is pretty much done if you're going to use it for other purposes just store it in a airtight container um but for us we're going to be making pixie sticks so let's move on to what we need to make that our first and most important ingredient is the sugar that we just made we're also going to need some icing sugar some citric acid some kool-aid packets or some flavoring oils and some food coloring so this is 24 hours after i made the sugar and even though i did grind it down to a fine texture you can see it clumped up once again probably due to the moisture in the air i'm not sure um so we're just going to reprocess them i separated them into three bowls because i'm gonna do three separate colors and then we're going to start with the first one and place it into a food processor so i'm just pouring it in there and i'm going to grind it down first just to see how it's going to look and then we can add our other ingredients so it looks beautiful you can see it is so fine and not clumpy at all and then we're going to add our citric acid if you want to be sour just start out with um a teaspoon or so and blend it together see how it tastes and then add more as desired you can make it as sour as you like i'm also going to be adding some food coloring to mine i'm adding blue this is gel food coloring and i do have some issues using this as you will see as the video goes on at this point you can also add some kool-aid packages for your flavoring if desired i've already flavored mine with flavoring oils when i made the sugar but kool-aid packages work very well also and they have citric acid in them so if you don't have citric acid at home it'll help to get that sourness so you can see here my food coloring is not mixing at all it's just kind of clumping so i'm not sure why it's happening just yet but i have a suspicion that it's to do with lack of moisture so i'm just going to continue on with how i'd make these regularly and just see if maybe it binds so i'm just adding some icing sugar and this helps with the texture it kind of gives it like that baby bottle pop fine sugary texture that's really nice you don't need to use icing sugar um but it does help with the taste the texture and it also helps for people who live in more humid climates at this point the food coloring has still not properly mixed in so i decided it's due to the lack of moisture so i added my gel food coloring to a couple drops of water to create essentially liquid food coloring just a regular kind of kind you'd buy at a grocery store which i'm assuming most people that's what they would be using anyway so you probably shouldn't have this issue gel food coloring is just what i usually have on hand um but yeah adding a couple drops of water to the gel food coloring definitely really helped because clearly it looks very beautiful um and it mixed very nicely so i'm very happy with that now i'm just scraping the bottom to make sure everything is properly incorporated as well as adding some more citric acid so that it's extra sour and then i'm going to mix it a final time and then once that's done i'm going to pour it back into its bowl and set it aside until we have our other colors now i'm starting on my next one so same process adding the sugar adding some citric acid if you want to add your kool-aid packets you can do so now and then adding the food coloring for myself i am adding some water with my food coloring before i add it so like i said i'd let this sugar sit over 24 hours after i made it before i added um the food coloring and this whole process here today um but after i made my initial batch of sugar i did make some pink and i used my regular gel pink food coloring and i had absolutely no issues getting it to bind which is why i think it was because of the lack of water because the sugar still had a little bit of moisture in it yesterday but 24 hours from then which is now it was dried out more so that little bit of water added with the food coloring helps to restore that moisture now it looks like some of the food coloring got stuck on the bottom with the sugar so i'm just scraping it around to get everything mixed and then adding some powdered sugar the measurement is not really um well i didn't measure it i just kind of put spoonfuls into my taste but if you are looking for a measurement i would say use about half the amount of regular sugar for the powdered sugar so if you used one cup of regular sugar maybe use half a cup or less of powdered sugar but again it can be to taste or you don't even need to use powdered sugar if you don't want to [Music] now i'm just adding in a little bit of yellow food coloring just because i want to be a little bit more neon looking and then mixing it together you can see i have to scrape the bottom a little bit there um but yeah i think that the color turned out a little bit too green i kind of wanted to be more of a lighter green but that's okay anyway it still looks cool i was hoping i'd be able to lighten it by adding in some more sugar to dilute the color but it didn't really help that much and then that's done you can add in more citric acid or more sugar you can just adjust it to according to how you like it so then i'm just pouring that into its bowl and then i also have the blue one that i just made and then a pink one that i made yesterday and now it is time for the fun part which is filling up our pixie stix [Music] now we're going to prepare our pixie stick straws and we're going to seal the bottom of them using this bag sealer thing that i just bought i'm also going to show you guys later how to close them without one of these um i did just get this egg sealer thing but it works really well like look how great that straw looks um i think it was like 10 or 15 on amazon i'll post the link um but i am new to it like i literally just got it so you guys can probably see i will struggle a little bit but after the first few straws i got a hang of it better and then they were very easy to quickly seal now we're going to fill up the straws with their sour sugar powder dust whatever you call it um and i'm using this squeeze bottle to get it in there so i bought a tip that is slightly bigger than the size of my straw and i just put the straw in and hold it inside of that tip and then just shake it up and down and it comes out really nicely um the easiest way to do this would to just be buy bigger straws and then you can just use like a paper funnel to get it into the straw but if you already have these tools at home this works like the best it just it's not really worth it to go and buy it if you can just do bigger straws in a paper funnel then i just filled up all my straws using a variety of colors it was kind of annoying because i had to switch the tip every single time i did it if i want to change colors yeah just fill them up to however you like they can be all one color all different colors um and mine are flavored sour watermelon and bubble gum but they actually taste really good just with the sugar and citric acid like they don't even need flavoring okay now that all of my straws are done i'm just going to take my little sealer and close the tips of all of them now i'm going to show you guys how to seal the straws without a bake sealer so you're going to take an oven mitt or a folded dish cloth and then put a piece of tin foil on it put your hand inside of it sorry i didn't get this in the camera that well um put your hand inside of it and sort of shape it into like a little mitt like that with the dish cloth underneath to protect your hand now you're going to place the straw in your tin foil mitt hand and use a lighter to quickly light the other end then once it's lit you're going to quickly switch it over to the other side and squish it down holding it to seal it and then take it out see that looks pretty good so you definitely don't need to go and buy the sealer for this you could just use a lighter and some tinfoil and it seals very nicely the blue powder reminded me so much of baby bottle pops and it really like had that taste too i don't know i think it just because i used more powdered sugar in that one but i thought it would be really good dipped in or to dip suckers in there so i took these little bags and filled them up with some of each of the powders and then put a sucker in there these are just regular suckers because it's what i had on hand but if you really wanted to up them you could use a infused sucker and you can clearly see i'm thinking very hard about what color would go best i chose the dark one i hope that was the best color combination um i really like the way that the the red contrasts with the pink powder but yeah i think they all look adorable the green one's a little bit too green for me but i also really like all the colors mixed together so i did a mix of all the colors and then i'm just putting them into this little container because you don't need obviously those little bags to enjoy this you could also just put it into whatever you want and dip your sucker in there and i absolutely love how pretty all those colors look together once everything is done try to store it in a dry area so maybe keep them in a sealed bag or container to keep any excess moisture and they should last for quite a while i hope you guys enjoyed this video please let me know if you did and please

i don't know see you guys later", "RcVOWaIsDes": "today I'm gonna be doing something really fun for children and this is my version of jell-o gummy bears so let me set up with all the ingredients that we need and I'll be back in a second so now that I've set up I'm gonna show you exactly what we need I have a silicon gummy bear mold a measuring cup for our water we're gonna be starting off with cold water but I'm gonna get to that step in just a second you're gonna need one tablespoon of gelatin that is equal to 15 milliliters and if you buy your gelatin in little pockets this is what it looks like it's a standard package and this holds one tablespoon or 15 milliliters and also a regular sized box of jell-o and this here is 85 grams so for our first step I'm gonna get my water ready and I'm gonna come back in one second for my first step I have added 1/2 a cup of cold water from my kitchen sink that is very important you need the water to be cold I am now gonna take that 1 tablespoon of gelatin and I'm just gonna sprinkle it over the top of the cold water and I'm gonna let this sit here for about 5 minutes because I want this to completely dissolve in that cold water you can already see that it's dissolving quite quickly so I'm just gonna let that go for a few more minutes and then I'll come back so this is 5 minutes later and I've just taken a fork and just stir this around everything is nicely dissolved and now I'm gonna take my last little bit of water 1/4 cup and dump that right in so in here we have a total of 3 quarters of a cup of water I am now gonna take this put this into the microwave and just microwave it for about a minute until it's hot so that was 1 minute on high and you can see now that it's much clearer that's because heat has been introduced into the gelatin and water and now we are ready to add in our actual jello mixture so I've opened up our little box of jell-o and now I'm gonna get that right in there and because the liquid is hot all of the jello mixture is gonna really just dissolve that much easier in there well I smells good too and I am using a cherry today I'm just gonna mix this around so you don't have to worry about the exact temperature that you heat this to in your microwave just make sure that it's hot does not have to be boiling just hot and that will help all the you know the actual package contents mix up in there really well and that's good and now we are ready to fill our mold so I've just put my mold on a little cutting board because this is very very flexible and if it's very hard to lift up when it's full so we're ready to pour it just give that a little bit of a stir just to make sure that all the contents are completely mixed but nothing has settled to the bottom and then I'm gonna start filling our little mold and that looks good just like that okay I'm just cleaning this up and now we are ready to pop this into the fridge so you want to put this in the fridge not the freezer just into your fridge and just let this chill down for about four hours and you're gonna have a really really nice gummy bears so I'm gonna pop this into my fridge and I'll come back much later on and I'm gonna show you the final product and they are really fun and they are full of flavor a few hours later once your jello has completely set you can just peel out your little gummy bears that's what's so nice about the silicone is that you can get right in there and just peel them right out so I'll continue doing this so I'll be back in a second and our last one and there we have them let's get them around the right way look at that really nice let me zoom in so I've zoomed in just a little bit to show you how nice these are and there we have it our jello gummy bears and look at how really gummy these are really really nice you can see that extra gelatin will really set these up really well and these here are super super fresh hmm a burst of flavor right in your mouth super super fresh hmm YUM I just zoomed in a little bit more because I think I heard some of you say zoom in a little bit more I want to see a little bit more detail in those gummy bears and here we have them aren't those cute made with jell-o and gelatin a little bit of water there we have them really fun really really delicious that's it for this video I hope you enjoyed it if you did please give me a thumbs up subscribe if you wish I really do appreciate that and that's it for today I'll see you next time you", "OXMDHHWoKDM": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today i'm going to be showing you how to make infused oreos this recipe is so simple so easy and you can make as little as you want you can even just make like one or two and they have more frosting in the end so extra frosting definitely better [Music] here's what you're going to need some oreos i chose double stuff because i like extra frosting infused coconut oil or butter and icing sugar your first step is to take your desired amount of oreos open them up and then separate the cookies from the cream and just put the cream into a bowl then you can add in some melted infused coconut oil or butter and just add that to your oreo cream in the bowl and mix it all together the amount you use is up to you i wouldn't use any more than the same amount of oreo filling that you have because i think it might affect the taste a bit more but you can play around and see what you like best now in order to keep the texture what we're used to in an oreo cookie we're going to need to add some icing sugar so i'm just putting a few spoonfuls in there until i get a nicer thicker consistency if you're having trouble getting it to mix properly just throw it in the microwave for uh 20-ish seconds which is what i did here and then i'm just mixing it all again until it's super smooth and you can taste it and see how you like it you can add more icing sugar more butter more coconut oil more of the original oreo filling it's whatever you feel tastes best now this frosting is ready to either be dipped into or put directly back onto the oreos or just eat it in the bowl um but i'm going to be piping onto my oreos so i'm just putting it into this little piping bag but you could also use a knife or just a spoon and do it directly on there you can see the frosting drips out of my bag a bit because it is too warm so i throw it in the fridge for a little bit so it's a little bit thicker when i'm putting it onto my oreos it's been in the fridge for about 10 minutes and now i am going to pipe the frosting onto each oreo and then you can put the other cookie wafer on top and press them together to be little oreo sandwiches i put them in the fridge for a couple more minutes and then they are ready to eat all right now that they're done let's give them a try [Music] very good you can taste coconut oil a little bit so maybe using butter would have been a little better but they're very good thank you guys so much for watching i hope you enjoyed this video if you did please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe thanks guys have a wonderful day", "WWHzW6PadtU": "welcome to episode 7 of mmm medical edibles I'm chef Tommy Nicole chef and culinary nutritionist looking looking you just beside the wall Soni in today's episode we're gonna learn how to make rice crispy treat we're gonna use rice krispies but you can use any of these cereals so cool today's episode is sponsored by black-market marijuana support your local ganja preneur a friend with weed is a friend indeed for your edibles you can use Keith's good ol mary-jane BHO or cannabutter if you have we're using cannabis that's the bottom rack did today's recipe only requires a few ingredients we have Rice Krispies cereal a 10 ounce bag of marshmallows you can use either mini marshmallows or regular-sized marshmallows we have some kosher salt some vegetable spray and if you'd like you can use food coloring I could use a little color let's start the recipe we need to find a way to get the weed to the paper [Music] we're gonna start really simple we're gonna turn our stove on to low I'm using my induction cooktop but if you're using the stovetop you just want to make sure you use a heavy bottomed pan and set your temperature on low some people don't like it as cold as I do but I don't care so I've already measured these this is our homemade cannabutter you're gonna use four tablespoons of your butter or a quarter of a cup you want to make sure your butter melts completely before you add the marshmallow make sure to spray your spatula with some vegetable spray that'll ensure that once you add the marshmallows it doesn't stick - looks like our canna butter is already melted we're gonna go ahead and open the marshmallows and put them right in what is this gluttonous monstrosity before me add a 10 ounce bag of mini marshmallows or again regular marshmallows and if you happen to make your own marshmallows it's actually be about 12 ounces or a cup and a half let's go ahead and add these I know it looks like a lot of marshmallows but it definitely is going to melt down you want to make sure to continuously stir this once everything has melted we'll take it off the heat and we'll add the rice krispies cereal the reason why I use mini marshmallows is because I find that they melt a lot quicker than a regular-sized marshmallows you want to continuously stir it so that all the marshmallows melts evenly this is not the kind of thing that you walk away from you want to constantly stir it and watch it to make sure it doesn't burn now once this is completely melted we're going to take it off the stove and we'll add the rice krispies cereal at that time if you wanted to add food coloring you could or if you wanted to add any kind of chocolate chips or sprinkles or something like that you could do it at that time too now once this is done some people like to move the marshmallow mixture into a separate Bowl and mix the rice krispies into it but I've picked a large enough pan where I can just go ahead and add it directly to the pan and I definitely recommend that you want a nice wide pot so that all the rice crispy cereal fits into it and it's just easier to mix the marshmallows have completely melted I'm going to turn this off and pull it away from the heat and you got to say how many marshmallows he can fit into your mouth here we have 6 cups of rice krispies I'm just gonna add it to the marshmallow remember we've removed it off of the heat so we're gonna just put that right in there and to this I'm also going to add a quarter of a teaspoon of kosher salt anytime you make anything sweet or anything really when you add salt it really brings out the flavor in it if you wanted to you could add food coloring as well but I'm not going to whatever those rules aren't real and as you can see some of the Rice Krispies are dry and some of them are getting some of that delicious marshmallow so you really just want to work it let me work it so that all of the Rice Krispies cereal is coated with that yummy cannabutter marshmallow mixture that we made I want to make sure that all of the rice krispies are nice and coated a good indication of that is they kind of have a nice Sheen to it or shine what I see no more shines maybe you didn't hear about it you've been away a long time didn't go up that day and that's how you know that the marshmallow has covered every little last speck and that will have nice adhesion last thing you want to do is have your rice krispies treat fall apart on either no napkins or nothing you do like this you like that so again you can do this with any cereal Froot Loops fruity pebbles even Kashi if you wanted to do a healthier version ain't nobody got time for this so as you can see here everything is very nicely coated and what you want to do here is work fast we're gonna take this away and then we'll get a 9 by 13 pan that we will also spray with vegetable spray and we're going to put all those rice krispies right in there you want a normal size or a big fatty Oh every little inch of this you will really want to give it a nice coating because once the rice krispies is dry it'll make it easier to pop them right out pop pop pop pop now we're just gonna go ahead and sum all of this right in here really the part that gets tricky is putting this into this mold what I usually do is I start off with the spatula and then I will go ahead and spray my hands and press it in to the pan I find it does a better job so here we go all right and if you can see that makes it a lot easier with the [ __ ] dog man you can also do these in the sheet pan if you wanted to make thinner rice krispies and I have a rolling pin that I use and since the sheet pan is a lot flatter I usually just take the rolling pin and just roll it right over what the heck are you talking about these are what they look like when they're completely pressed into the pan and since they're still warm we're gonna decorate them with some sprinkles since it's 4/20 we're gonna go ahead and use purple in green light green sprinkles give it a nice green luminescent look to it and then we're gonna add some purple as well we've allowed the Rice Krispies cereal treats to cool down and what you're gonna do is you're going to either use a knife or I'm actually gonna use an offset spatula a what I want to do is you want to just Anderson it around the edges this should come out pretty easily since we already greased the pan I'm just gonna flip this over the Silpat that I have underneath it has measurements on it which will allow me to cut this fairly precisely fingers crossed oh it's fine that a serrated knife cuts it really smoothly so you want to try to cut them as evenly as possible it doesn't have to be perfect they're gonna taste amazing I wish that I could make a cake made out of rainbows and smiles and we'd all eat happy I finished cutting all the rice krispies treats if you'd like you can put them away by wrapping them individually in plastic wrap and that'll make them last longer in this house they won't last that long I just like to put them on a plate they look so delicious and they're really soft to the touch but they have like a nice stiffness to it well you know what we don't need to put this one on there there's plenty but I just want to show you here we have our delicious rice krispies treat 200 milligrams six of these you have this beautiful sheen from the marshmallow and the can of butter you have this nice denseness from when we pressed all those rice krispies together you still have a little bit of the chewiness and that give yeah Jesus Christ have you ever heard of don't get high on

welcome back today i'm gonna be showing you how to infuse chips this also works for any other kind of chips i just chose doritos because i feel like a lot of people like doritos the readers are gonna be a little bit easier because you're gonna have more surface area but this will work for um cereal it will work for pretzels it'll work for chips any type of like trail mixy type you know like grab and go little snack foods little bread type things i am going to be using infused oil or butter in this if you want to use tincture i do have a video that i'll put it below there's one for um hot cheetos and there's one for um cereal and they're both a similar concept but i also talk about tincture in there which is a little bit different but i feel like most people are using butter or oil which is why i'm going to use it for this one but i just wanted to do an updated video on it the reason why i'm using infused coconut oil instead of butter is because it's what i have on hand i have my butter in the freezer and i just didn't take it out so i'm like i'll just use the oil but the results are like for the effect is the same whether you use tincture oil or butter um the process is the same for butter or oil so if you're following on with exactly what i'm doing you can use butter or oil if you want to use tincture like i said check out one of the other videos it will taste better with butter because obviously everybody knows butter tastes delicious i'm going to be using coconut oil like i said because what i have on hand but you can use i recommend using butter over oil it really is just going to affect the taste it's not going to affect the result of the actual effects so i'm going to start by taking some of my oil i'm putting it in a little container i have a method on here and i am going to microwave it and yes i know a lot of you guys are going to have something to say about me microwaving it because it seems like you all hate when i microwave it but you guys don't have to microwave to each their own right you can melt it over a double boiler so feel free to do that i'm going to be using a microwave but by no means are you guys required to also use a microwave so please don't get mad at me for using a microwave we'll just set that aside i had already preheated my oven to 250 degrees you can do anywhere you can experiment between 200 and 250. i've had good results with all of those numbers in between um but i'm doing at 250 this time so i'm just going to start with um i have a pen with some parchment paper and i'm going to lay out my chips now if you're going to use chips that aren't doritos and have less of a large surface area you will put them into a bowl and shake them up but that causes some waste because when you shake it up there's oil and butter sticking to the sides of the bowl um or to the parchment paper etc so doritos are nice because of the large surface area so we're not having any weight i'm just going to lay out my chips and i want to know if you guys are here at this point in the video tell me your favorite nacho nacho no burrito tell me your favorite burrito flavor mine is chili heat um i do believe in the states the sweet chili heat isn't called sweet chili it's called like it's called i don't know what it's called i think it's a purple bag in the states but ours is black here and those are actually the only vegan flavored doritos the cool ranch ones just taste so bland but maybe are you guys dipping them in something because just by themselves they're like meh so i just laid out my chips and then i'm just gonna go take my oil and microwave it in the microwave for i don't know 20 seconds 23 seconds until it melts so i'll be right back so i just melted up my oil and i was going to use my spoon to kind of drizzle it over but then i thought it'd be easier if i just use one of these if you're trying to get exact dosage there's other methods that you should use but when it comes to like dripping and spraying it's not exact um but you can get close to it because you can do your amount of chips and you can measure out a quarter cup of oil or whatever amount of oil and then use that'll be too much oil for this but and then use whatever amount of oil you have on your chips and that can tell you how much is on those if you want to figure out how to calculate the dosing for your infusions i will attach a link um of a video where i explain it in like and explain like i'm five version like really like the most basic we can go so now we're gonna add our oil or butter to our chips so i'm just gonna zoom in the camera you guys can see a little bit better okay so like i said if you don't have a little dropper thing if you have a little dropper you can use um your spoon but i have a dropper so i'm going to be using the dropper so i'm just going to suck some of the oil up and i'm just going to kind of distribute it it does yeah see and i'm still i'm still even making a little mess but it does um the butter and oil has a really nice taste and i don't know texture to them when they're cooked it's just like oh my god when you bite into it it's so tasty so you can also turn them around and do that but i feel like the oil is going to drop off if i do that i'm going to cook them for a bit and let the oil kind of attach and then we can flip them and add more i want these to be very very strong so we're going to layer it up oops but you don't have to do that you can just do one layer you can do two layers three layers four layers honestly i wouldn't pass four layers i feel like it would just get a little too oily and buttery okay now we got our butter on these oil let's just say i used the word butter and oil interchangeably in this video it doesn't really matter and we're going to put these in the oven i preheated to 250 degrees and then we're going to check on them in about 10 minutes we're going to have them in the oven for about anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour depending on how much you end up adding how much they need to cook you can kind of just go with how the texture of them is when they come out but gonna flip them and move them around every 10 15 ish minutes so let's go put these in and then set a timer so now they're in the oven i have timer set for 15 minutes in 15 minutes we're going to come back and we're going to check on them and decide whether um to flip them to add more to put them back in yeah we'll see so i'll see you guys shortly the doritos are still cooking but i missed something very important but it's not too late so we're going to do it now if you haven't already noticed in the background how could i forget something so important i'm sure you guys can hear the timer going off but i'll be there in a minute a few minutes doesn't make a difference for flipping taste it burnt i gotta go oh why is it so bitter what did i do burn it oh you okay so they were in the oven for about 16 minutes and i want to show you guys something because this is because i was being greedy i wanted to be like so strong so i was just like putting too much oil on them and don't do that you're better off just doing a little bit of oil and then letting it cook and then flipping it and doing the same thing because i'll show you guys what happened so some of these over here i like put well you guys can see some of these over here i put something over here i put so much oil on and when you lift them up you can see it leaked through some of the oil like yes this is like drenched in oil too but i put a little bit too much so it was like leaking underneath most of them are fine and there's um not really any like oil that went through but the ones that i put like so much on it definitely seeped through a little bit so the first time you try it just like go light don't don't put that much that's unnecessary anyway i was just like i said it was being a little greedy so now we're to put these back in the oven and i'm not going to flip them because um these ones i feel like they're not like dried up yeah if they're more dry then i would flip them and at this point you would if you want to add more you would flip them over and add more oil and then you can put it back in the oven but because i went like oil crazy and loaded them up i'm not gonna add more oil to these ones so we're just gonna put them back in the oven and we're gonna check on them every 10 to 15 minutes um until they're ready and it'll be anywhere between 30 minutes and an hour so it's been another 15 minutes and i took them out and honestly they were still too oily so what i decided to do is i just took another piece of parchment paper and transferred them over and then i'm going to pour whatever was collected on the sheet onto those ones there so they can absorb it again if you want to be like more precise you could put it like on a spoon or something but i feel like this works pretty well and it's like completely changed color i guess because it like took the seasoning off with doritos now we have these oh after another 15 minutes so it's been 45 minutes total now they're pretty much you can see they're starting to crisp up a little bit in some spots i'd say these could be done now or we could do another 15 minutes i think i'm just going to call these ones done but like i said you could do another 15 minutes it's just up to how long you want to keep doing it you can do it up to an hour honestly even more but just keep an eye on that every like five or ten minutes once you get up there but yeah these look good so i'm just going to let them sit up to dry for a bit and then i'm going to pack them back up so i'm going to put them back into the doritos bag but you shouldn't do that if there's people around you who might accidentally eat from the dorito bag otherwise you want to like make sure they're clearly marked so that it's obvious what they are and people who aren't shouldn't be eating them don't eat them um but i'm just myself here so there's no chance of someone else eating them how could i forget to taste one they're really good but i could tell i won't be able to eat a whole bag of them you know you could eat like a whole bag of doritos but because of how much fat is on them like in the oil i can tell they're like filling like it was like effort to eat that one like i probably would only be able to eat a handful of them which is good because i need the control so now i'm going to pour them into back into the dorito bag and then maybe like with the oil i like use some bread to like scoop it up and eat it that's an excellent idea actually and then to seal this bag and like i said you don't want to do this if you have somebody who might mistake this as a regular bag because i'm gonna like reseal it like don't get me wrong the resealing will not look the same at all but i got this little thing and like i bought it on amazon for like five bucks or something and you can like refill bags so that's pretty cool i'm pretty sure it works on shipping so we'll find out so if i mess this up you can't really oh it worked i thought i can't do it from the other side it worked i don't know if you guys can like see how it's sealed like it's not super great quality seal or anything but it is sealed oh see i missed the spot right there but the rest of it is sealed slide it across and the heat like squishes it together and yeah anyways oh wow you guys can see my whole setup this is what i'm working with here i have like chairs and like different pieces of furniture all stacked together so i can get high enough i don't know i don't have a lot of places to take videos in here you know anyways thank you guys so much for watching i hope you enjoyed this video if you did please leave a comment give me a thumbs up and subscribe thank you guys so much have a wonderful day i want to like open these for like a dramatic ending but i actually just want to leave them sealed

It's your player partner\n2 Chainz checking in and this is \"The Most\nExpensivest: High Roller,\" and first I got my guy,\nthe comedian extrordinaire -- Hannibal Buress. Hannibal: What's up? \u266a\u266a And last but not least. The man that put\nthe 'G' in geek. We're talking about Tommy Chong,\nladies and gentlemen. \u266a\u266a Please, please, please. And we have\none common denominator. We enjoy\nthe fruits of our labor. -Yes. -If I must say so myself. We're going to\nhave a dish that is infused\nwith expensive marijuana, and hopefully\nwe don't pass out doing it. This is Zairilla Bacon. \u266a\u266a So tell us what's going on. What you got here? Right here we've got\nthat Z Juice, which is medicated Kool-Aid. -Okay. I've got the watermelon and this\nis my new flavor, peach mango. Each bottle is 100 milligrams. I make my own THC lean syrup. 100 milligrams, how would that\nhave you after you drink it? Well, everybody's\ntolerance is different. If you have a low tolerance, maybe about\na quarter of the bottle. A quarter of it? If you've got\na high tolerance, like myself, I just chug it.. -Yeah. -Yes, sir. Let me see you\nchug out off. -What? -You won't chug this. I wish I had my phone. -She didn't hesitate. -You ain't got your phone? -She didn't hesitate. She's going to chug\nthat mother fucker and it's got\n100 milligrams in it? Keep out of reach of children. That's some deep shit. She's going to be\ndifferent later. Oh, man. She's not even going\nto take a break. She's just -- All right. -I stay highly medicated. -Okay. Yeah. Highly medicated. This is\nthe mac and cheese. It's going to run you\nabout $500. You charge. Your shit high, shorty. Just a little \"turch\" of that. Not too much. Just a little \"turch.\" A \"turch.\" -Just a little \"turch.\" -Yeah. That's enough, that's enough. -Right on. This is my Zairilla's medicated\nchicken wings made with my Zeewee's\nfrom scratch BBQ sauce. In Chicago,\nwe call it Mouth Sauce. -Mouth sauce? Yeah. -That's right. So, we're going to eat this\nand get high? You want to try\nsome of this shit right here? Tommy, wake up. You want to try\nsome of this shit? [ Laughter ] -Already. Already. -Come back to earth. Come back here, man. -See that shit he's doing? -He's eating wings with --0 That's what you do\non a first date when you're trying\nto get some. Medicated wings,\nI'm very careful with. Oh, you've had\nthis before? I know what happens when you --\nwell you'll find out. Hannibal: This is going\nto get interesting. -So is the stuff in the sauce? -Yes, sir. -Also in my batter. -You hittin' it from both ways? -Yes, sir. -These are crispy. That's how\nit's supposed to be. -I like it. -What's that? -What's that there? -This is the asparagus. -The whole thing is? -It's reefer, too. -Every piece. -I use it in my\ninfused olive oil. Oh, it's in\nthe olive oil. You can't even taste\nthe reefer in it. That's the tricky part. -That's the best part about it. I love that, too,\nbut I think that's low down. I do. That's some low-down shit. You're making me\nwant to eat, man. It's a trick. This shit's tricky. You feeling anything? Well, you'll know\nwhen I'm feeling something because I'll panic\nabout the cameras, and run to my car\nand leave. [ Laughter ] When I run away from everybody\nscreaming it's like, \"Oh, yeah, I think\nthe asparagus got to him.\" Zairilla: That's usually\nabout $75 a pound. Really? So how much does\nthe Kool-Aid cost? -20 bucks. -20 bucks? -20 bucks for one thing. -For this thing right here? Yes, sir. She just drunk a $20\nright in your face. -After 20? -[ Laughs ] Yeah. You're looking at\nthis big platter of wings is normally about $1,500. -These wings about $1500? -$1500? -Yes, sir. -That's about 70 wings. So that's about, what, $7\nand some change? Wait, am I bad at math? -You're horrible. -Wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Oh, that's about $20 a wing. $20 and some change,\na wing. -A wing. -Holy shit. I just ate\na little $40. Those are\nexpensive wings, I see why Viceland\ndidn't pay me to come here. [ Laughter ] I think that shit's\nstarting to kick in. This is\n$20 and some change! Tell me what you think\nabout the food. I ate\n$60 worth of wings. Tommy, I'm talking to you. Tommy. -It was only three of them. Shit's good,\nain't it, Tommy? I love the greens. These, whatever these are. Asparagus makes\nyour pee stink. Is that true,\nor is that just just a myth and we went with it? It has an acidic base about it\nand when it mixes with a certain chemical\ninside your body, it lets off a certain scent\nas you urinate. \u266a\u266a What you got\nright there? Zairilla: So we got right here\nmedicated crab legs. Come on with it. Now these crabs normally\na pound go for $275 a pound. -For real? -Yes, sir. When these crabs were alive,\nthey didn't even know this would be\ntheir future. These crabs didn't know\nthey would get shot up with weed and get... -Full of weed, man. ...eaten on Viceland. I don't know how\nto open crab legs. I should've watched\nmore Rick Ross videos and I would know exactly what\nthe fuck I'm doing right now. We got some --\nNow we've got some -- Is that crawfish? No, baby, we got\nsome lobster tails. Oh, lobster, see, man,\nI don't know my seafoods. This mother fucker\nsaid crawfish. I thought it was just a big\nass crawfish with a God damn -- That's lobster, man! And one lobster right here\nis about $525. -This? -Man, hell no, shorty. For real. -$525. -This right here is $600? $525, you rounding. That was a big round up. -$500? -Very nice. Very tasty. $500 for a lobster tail. A small ass lobster tail,\nbut it got the dope in it. How much is in that? That one has\nabout 25 milligrams. Shorty,\nthis shit good, shorty. I feel myself\nbecoming different. -Can you feel it? -Yeah. Oh, yeah. Absolutely. I ain't going to lie, I think\nI'm feeling a little something. Do you feel pressure to wear\nmultiple chains all the time? Shut your high ass up. 2 Chainz. I think chicken and waffles\nis overrated, over-hyped\ncombination of food. So is your heart rate\ngoing up, as well or is it just\nyou're talking crazy? The chicken is Alvin. The waffle is the Chipmunks. How long have you\nbeen smoking, Tommy? Over 50 years. Have you ever been eating\nchicken and then like, \"Yo, I wish I had\nsome waffles with this shit.\" You back on this waffles. What's going on? I never left. I'm a real player when\nit comes to eating delicacies. I remember back\nwhen my chicken wings was between 30 cents\nand 50 cents. Now they're 20 bucks. -You know lamb chops. Since '71. When the Northridge\nearthquake hit. -And I'm eating, getting big. -Sea bass, halibut. And then\nthe earthquake hit. What's your favorite\n2 Chainz song? 2 Chainz. I was in a urinal,\nI took a piss, some of my pee splashed up\nhit me on my lip. Ruined\nmy mother fucking day. [ Laughs ] Gave you pee breath. All right, look. [ Applauding ] Thank you. Oh, wow. Thank you, guys. [ Cheers and applause ] Thank you. -Can I get a doggy bag? -Absolutely Yeah, we're about to\nget some take-home boxes. It's about that bacon. -Right on. -Bacon, bitch. -[ Laughs ] Thank you. Is it good marijuana? What up, what up. It's your player partner\n2 Chainz checking in and this is \"The Most\nExpensivest: High Roller. My boy, Adam, and my boy, John,\nwe're about to get into some real weed lingo\nand some real prices, y'all. Adam: All right, Chainz, we have\na few very special things for you to try, here. -All right, what you got man? I'm ready. Let's give this honey badger\na whirl. I want to show you\nhow this works. [ Roars ] John: It's got a ceramic tip\nas well as a bubbler. Its like a warm straw. It's essentially\na portable dab ring. Pretty cool. I think we should start\nwith the NBX King Louis, we've been waiting\nfor that. Now, what John is doing\nis he's actually mixing the King Louis\nconcentrate, it's sauce. All right, we're going to wait\nuntil that heats up and then you're going to hit\nthat nozzle. So what do I smoke,\nthe end right here? Yes, sir. As soon as\nI start touching, you're going to\nbreathe in, okay? There you go. \u266a\u266a [ Coughs lightly ] [ Coughing ] Pretty good,\nright there. \u266a\u266a Beautiful flavor profile. Nice and tasty. I'm gonna hit --\nI'm gonna hit it -- I'm --\nI'm gonna hit it -- Yeah. one more time. \u266a\u266a We've got to get it now,\nI like this. Welcome to the club,\nmate. All right. For real, how much\ndoes this stuff cost, man? So the honey badger itself\nis about $250 retail. The sauce itself roughly\nbetween $50 to $60. What makes it special\nis the high terpenes. They've probably got four\nor five different terpenes, like limonene,\nbeta-caryophyllene, myrcene. They're testing around\n13-15 milligrams per, as well as\nyour cannabinoids, so the cannabinoids,\nthe THC is testing probably around\nbetween 75-85%, so you're getting some really\namazing pure stuff there. Cool, so how much does\nsomething like this cost? [ Record scratches ] It's $250 retail. Should we try the buggy? This device here\nis our showpiece, though. Our friends over at Ziggy\nhave been kind enough to provide us this rig\nto be able to play with. Took 14 glassblowers\nseveral hundred hours of work. It's a $150,000 piece. They want\n$150,000 for that? -Yeah. -That's right. You think they would buy it\nand use it or just buy it and keep it\nas an art piece? Typically we wouldn't allow\nsomebody to smoke from this, but, obviously,\nthis is a special occasion. Let's load that up\nwith the King Louis and let's give him\nwhat he wants. Yes, sir. You're going to have to\nput something on that, man, you're going to have\nto put a real boog on that mother fucker\nfor me. -Yeah, I got you. -I've been smoking a long time. All right,\nlet me try this shit. Come on. \u266a\u266a Mm-hmm. \u266a\u266a [ Coughs ] What do you think of\nthe taste and flavorings? [ Smacking lips ] [ Coughs ]\nI like it. Excellent. That's what kind of\nmake this sauce so special. I think\nwe should also try, which one\ndo you want to try, Adam? [ Coughs ]\nOoh. [ Laughs ] -The Alien Bubba. -The Alien Bubba? All right,\nlet's do that one. [ Laughing ] [ Mumbles ]\nI like that flower. You like the flower? Yeah, all this shit\ngets you too geeked. He's too geek --\nIt's too geek -- It's \"2 geeked, 2 fast.\" We've got here a cannagar\nour friends provided for us. This thing's worth, roughly,\nretail side, $500-$600. It's 1,000 milligrams-plus. They're amazing. They made it especially\nfor you, my friend. What they've done is\nthey've ground up the flower, wrapped it\nin palm leaves, and then they dipped it in oil,\nthey've got kief in it. It's a super joint\nis what it is. Do you want to\nlight it up? Sure do. That was\ncustom made for you. It's not a for-sale product\nhere in this market yet. Mmm. So, it's, uh... So you're one of the first\nto have it. You could\nblow it out and... I know. It looks cool for TV. $500, man. This shit. \u266a\u266a \u266a\u266a I tell you what. To be able to experience this\nand get paid for it, I can't even lie this is\nlike what dreams are made of. Man, I'm going to be rapping\nlike a mother fucker tonight in the studio. Man, that's the vibe\nI was looking for. Know what I'm saying? It's that real vibe\nI was looking for. -Hey, 2 Chainz. -What up, man. How you doing? What's your name? -Good to meet you. Chris. I'm with Club M. \u266a\u266a I hear you've got a delivery\nservice or something like that. Yeah, we do\na monthly delivery service for a cannabis\nsubscription box. Marijuana, munchies, music,\nand merchandise. $200 worth of it\nevery month for 97 bucks anywhere in California\nand soon in Las Vegas. -How much marijuana? -A lot of marijuana. -Is it good marijuana? -Really good. -That's cool, man. -Thanks. So what made you come up\nwith that type of idea? I really, as a kid, loved to get the encyclopedia\ndelivered to my house, so I designed my box\nto kind of look like one. -That's some geek shit. -It is super geek. So, tell me more about\nthe box and everything. -This is a monthly box. -Are these pre-rolled? -These are all pre-rolls. -Let me try this out. This is all different\nkinds of flowers. Man. Topicals, vapes,\nconcentrates, waxes. I love the presentation and it don't look\nall hot in the mail and shit when it comes. It looks like\nsome encyclopedias. Oh that's where you get\nthe idea from you was\nencyclopedia boy. So what I displayed here\nis something special nobody's seen\nbut you yet. Okay. -This is our $24,000 box. -Why would it be $24,000? First, we've got\n24 1/8th worth of flower that are delivered\nwith it. -So three zips a month. -Then cannabis cigar set. Got cannabis leaf, I've got\ntobacco, and I've got gold leaf. Three months aged,\npressed, and with rosin and sap\nin it, as well. Then we've got 24 vape pens,\n24 edibles, 24 topicals\nand tinctures and then each one will\ncome with a custom... -Gold tip. -24-karat gold. 240 diamonds in it. You got to let me\nkeep this, man. This right here is\nsomething special, man. The other product that's part\nof the $24,000 box is this. It's our vape exhale. That's a $3,000 easy bake oven\nand a bubbler all put together. That looks too expensive. I don't want to be\nresponsible for that. On the plane\nthey might mess with it. We've got this vape pen\nwith the gold. This is nice. How do you use this? So this one will do\nvape oil or the flower. -Really? -Yeah. So we just open this one up\nand you grind the flower. I love this. I want you to see one\nmore thing before we go, here. This is my custom box that would\ncome with the $24,000 box. What kind of wood\nis that? So this is\na reclaimed wine barrel. That's dope. That's how I need to get one\nof my floors done, wine barrel. -Somebody locked it on me. -Did you lock it on me already? There it goes. So you open it up... -It's nice, bro.\n-...it's all gold inside. Got your flower all ready,\nloaded up. This stuff\nit'll keep you fresh. It's my box? Is this for me? -That's yours. You got a key\nand I keep it -- [Mumbles] Oh, man. -Look at this, though. This is everything. I appreciate you all man. You'll be able to roll\nyour own joints right here. Oh, a rolling tray man.

I'm happy to be\nreporting on it. I'm happy to be\na tester. Like I said, on this episode\nthere will be no stuntmen or no stunt doubles needed. I'll be here\nto try my own product. I love my job. I love waking up\ngoing to work every day, and so this is another\npart of going to work. Meeting people like you\nthat are so forward thinking. \u266a\u266a 2 Chainz. \u266a\u266a", "pxqo1RfC6Z8": "[Music] hi welcome to diamond delight edibles my name is liz if this is the first time you stop by and for the rest of you guys welcome back thank you so much i really truly appreciate all your awesome comments and your wonderful love and support i do apologize i've been a little absent for the last couple of months i've been really pretty sick for a while there um today's about the first day that i felt good so yeah i came to make you guys a video so if you want more details i put up a video under the community area there but i'm not going to bore you with the nitty gritty details here so let's jump into what i've got for you today and what i've got for you today are hot chocolate balms so what these are if you haven't seen these yet are really cool so these chocolate balls they're the hard chocolate balls and they're filled with hot chocolate or cocoa whichever you prefer and you put them into your mug add your hot milk and they turn into hot chocolate of course canna um but uh these are just wonderful and they make awesome um gift ideas for the holiday time which is just coming up right around the corner i know i'm sorry i'm sorry um but as i said they do make great gift ideas so without any further babbling on here let's jump into those ingredients the equipment that we're going to need to get these made and let me show you how to make these oh one thing i did tell you because this recipe today i mainly just show you how to make the chocolate balms if you want to see further details on how to infuse coco cocoa butter um check out my video on canna real milk chocolate and there i show you exactly the details on how to infuse cocoa butter and yes you can only use cocoa butter with real chocolate you cannot use coconut oil or anything else so please don't ask me that question only cocoa butter so i said if you need any further details on that as well as tempering details all right so what we're going to need for our can of hot chocolate balms is two cups of real chocolate and um you want to make it a dark chocolate it's going to give you a richer flavor so about 2 cups or 16 ounces if you've got black chocolate or shaved chocolate that's what you want to go with 16 ounces or two cups about one and a half to two cups of hot chocolate powder and this will be the pre-made hot chocolate powder it's already done with sugar if sugar is an issue for you then you can definitely use just straight coco you don't have to use the pre-made hot chocolate as i said i just do it because it's already got the sugar mixed in and it just simplicity's sake we if you want to add marshmallows what i did because these little dehydrated marshmallows are difficult to find is i just bought a really inexpensive hot chocolate mix sifted out the hot chocolate and kept marshmallows hey me um i think they if they're available on amazon if they are i'll throw a link down for you and then for i'm going to decorate mine with some salted caramel um for the decoration and give my hot chocolate a little hint of salted caramel but you don't have to do that if you just want to decorate them with a milk chocolate later to have that contrast giddy up i have not just leave them plain and then we're going to use um so this can be an and or an ore i'm going to add infused cocoa butter to my chocolate and i'm going to add about two tablespoons the other thing i'm going to do this is the end or i'm going to infuse my hot chocolate with tincture so as i said if you've got both you can do it if you just got one or the other there there you go you just add the cocoa butter to your chocolate or tincture to your hot chocolate all right so that's it for the all right so the equipment that we're going to need is you're going to want a double boiler for melting your chocolate so glass bowl in a pot or if you've got a proper double boiler you can use that of course most people don't so a bowl that fits snugly so um you don't have steam and stuff coming out the sides the other is you just want to add enough water you um towards the bottom you don't want any water touching the bottom of your bowl because it will get too hot and it will burn your chocolate also make sure if it starts boiling a little bit that it's not going to be touching the bottom of the bowl so you can always melt your chocolate in the microwave or what i picked myself up is one of these chocolate melting pots these things are really really nice so if you do do a lot of chocolate you may want to take a look at investing in one of these and what's great about it is because you have total temperature control although it's in celsius so you're in fahrenheit you just need to get some conversions but um easy to do anyhow as i said you can go 30 is about 86 degrees fahrenheit i believe which is your lowest temper for milk chocolate and for um for milk chocolate and white chocolate and then it goes up to 80 which for the most part you would never go that high because that's like 165 so and the reason that these are super nice is you can put your chocolate on and just walk away and leave it for a while you don't have to stay over the pot and continually stir it it's kind of nice basically i say it's just idiot proof for melting i've burnt chocolate before on the double boiler i step away for a moment this i can just drop the heat down step away go do what i want come back and just adjust my temperature and carry on my merry way so besides a way to melt your chocolate you're going to want a candy thermometer or a chocolate thermometer measuring spoon measuring cup about a quarter cup measuring cup or depending on how much tincture you're going to use a couple of spatulas straight edge a straight edge cutter offset spatula and a straight edge spatula if you've got those and a whisk you can use a metal whisk or a silicone whisk for chocolate either is okay [Music] you're also going to want a pair of gloves either silicone or latex or whatever really professional chocolatiers use cotton gloves but we'll just go with these this will help prevent you getting fingerprints on your product as you're as you're playing around with it if you're going to do some decorating you want a piping bag and then our mold for our little chocolate balms so this is i believe about a one and a half inch mold i will put up the link for it to um for you to see exactly which one it is and we're going to want parchment paper and the last thing that the method that i'm going to use to temper my chocolate is tabling if you are going to do tabling you need a marble slab or another natural stone slab things are falling uh is a natural slab as i said or marble and i actually got this from a table so all right let me get that out of the way and we're going to need a bowl we're doing our hot chocolate little tincture a baking dish with parchment paper and you're going to want a fine mesh strainer and a bowl i think that's about it of course you know i always forget something along the way but if i do i'll let you know all right so let's jump right in and let's get our hot chocolate infused with our tincture all right so to infuse our cocoa or our hot chocolate whichever you're using um get your uh get your powder get your strainer and we're just going to sift this through just to take out any lumps so you don't want all those lumps and stuff in your in your mix now i'm going to use about a quarter cup for 2 cups of for a hot chocolate mix oh another thing with regards to your hot chocolate mix i forgot to tell you read the directions on how much you need so there are some usually the less expensive ones will be like four heaping tablespoons or four heaping teaspoons you want to make sure uh you don't really have any more than two tablespoons um less is better it's hard to get it in those bowls balls and get them together so you want to make sure that your hot chocolate instructions are for at least two tablespoons or under just a helpful tip for you there this is my green dragon tank shaw and i'm just going to put a little bit on it first use my whisk whisk her in and you want to add in a little bit at a time because if you for one if you use an alcohol that is not a 94 or 96 you're going to have a lot more water you want to be careful of that because you're going to end up making it pasty so just add it a little bit at a time if you notice it getting clumpier pasty stop if you're using the 94 96 you can get away with a lot more but as i said just do it a bit at a time if you notice it getting pasty it all stopped you can always add more later so you can uh evaporate the batch and you can always add on as a secondary level if you want to make it really really strong i however don't really like to render people unconscious but hey whatever float your boat and then i take my strainer again and sorry you want to preheat your oven to 175 degrees if you're doing this in a an electric oven you i do not recommend doing this in a gas oven some people have done it successfully others have not always err on the side of caution and flame and alcohol don't mix and you can also use a dehydrator or you can always leave it out overnight if you have to do the table dry method just leaving it out overnight you're going to want to sift it a few times through throughout the night throughout the day and there we go so i'm going to pop this into the oven at 175 on the middle rack i'm gonna leave the oven door slightly ajar i have a ceiling fan going always make sure that you have some type of ventilation going don't ever take it for granted you can do this a hundred times with no problems and then one time you do it without ventilation and there can be a problem so very very skinny so what i usually do is i spread it out on the wrap trying onto the tray nice and evenly and then i just put little dash marks in it here just just so we can heat up through and i said pop that in the oven keep the door slightly ajar and it'll probably take about 10-20 minutes for that to evaporate so what i'll do is every couple of minutes i'll go with um one of my spatulas and just move the um hot chocolate powder around and then re-flatten it out so this way it brings the heated from the bottom to the top and it helps to evaporate it quicker and if there's any large lumps you want to uh just mush them out all right so we'll be back when that's done alright so my hot chocolate is done as take it from the oven now a tr uh test that you can do to see if it's done to make sure it's done is it's only at 175 degrees not that hot if you have really sensitive skin don't do this but if you've got tougher hands just run it over your hands and let it go and then if you feel any coolness on your hands from the air that means you still have some alcohol left so throw it in a little bit longer if it's totally dry you're good to go so we're just going to set that off to the side till the end time when we're going to need that next on to our chocolate all right so for our chocolate if you are using a double boiler you want to put it on medium low as i said you don't want it to get too hot chocolate melts at a very very low temperature so i'm using my pot i'm going to add in my chocolate and i'm going to add in two tablespoons of melted infused cocoa butter if you want to learn more about how to infuse cocoa butter and tempering chocolate check out my video canada real milk chocolate and i go over all those steps and details for you so i like to melt my cocoa butter first and add it onto my chocolate and then mix it over all of my chocolate i just found that it just blends a lot better this way when i do it the other way where i use cold cocoa butter i found a few more times than not i ended up with streaking and this method i don't just a little tip i'm giving you oops that pots are wasted small so i'm just going to continue to stir that until she all melts down nicely and as i said because i'm using this melting pot i can go toddle away for a couple of minutes i would just drop my temperature down right now i'm doing this for melting the chocolate i am doing it between 50 and 55 celsius and over in this pot over here i'm just melting my salted caramel yeah the salted caramel chips you can get them uh i found them in most grocery stores a bulk barn they're really easy to come by now if anyone's going to ask me can you do this with butter or anything else coconut oil no you cannot the only thing that you can add to real chocolate is cocoa butter and the reason for that is um the temperature at which uh but the cocoa butter melts butter and coconut oil melt at a very low temperature at like 79 80 degrees it'll start to melt so if you use those your chocolate will never ever stay set at room temperature that is the reason so if you see any recipes that are using butter in that don't bother trying it don't waste your time unless you plan on keeping them in the fridge and then using them right out of the fridge then you're fine but if you want them to stay set no will not work so just a little tip for your chocolate if you're using a block chocolate you want to make sure that you cut it up really really really fine using a serrated edge knife works really well for that same thing if you're using larger chunks you want to chop them down to smaller size it helps them develop quicker and if you're using a double boiler and that you um you don't have to worry so much about um with it burning if you have really large chunks in really small chunks it takes a lot longer for those big ones to melt and you can burn your chocolate that's why i just said i found these melting pots just so nice just temperature control like i said it's just a nice toy it's definitely it's not a necessity for making chocolate it's just it's a nice to have what would be super nice to have is a tempering machine chocolate tempering machine those things are expensive especially the good ones so i'm just continuing to melt my chocolate down here and once it's all melted we're going to get it to temperature of 113 degrees fahrenheit that's for dark chocolate if you're doing milk chocolate or white chocolate it'll be about 108 109 now if you're microwaving your chocolate um with about two cups or 16 ounces you're going to start with two 30 second intervals and then drop down to 25 sorry then drop down to 20 15 10 and then continue at 10 second intervals until you reach the temperature that you need so as i said for dark chocolate 113 fahrenheit for milk or white chocolate uh 10109 so our chocolate is almost all melted so i'm just going to check the temperature right now to see where we're at i'm going to guess about a hundred 99 i was close so with your chocolate with your thermometer if you're using one of these tight always clean off the end so that you get a correct read because the chocolate will harden up on the end of your thermometer and it can cause it cause a misread so i'm just going to continue to stir this until we get to our temperature so i'm just going to check it every couple of minutes another thing to remember um is that water is chocolate's mortal enemy if you get even a drop of water in your chocolate it can seize if that does happen don't panic get your sunflower or soy lecifit and put in just a drop or two that can help uh save it it can help loosen it up so where in most cases we use those as an emulsifier in chocolate it works for its viscosity so it'll help thin out chocolate so that so always make sure that your equipment whatever you're going to use is thoroughly clean and dried um i i just i generally do not use um wooden handle uh spatulas or anything because wood can retain moisture so i've done that before where i was doing chocolate and stirring away and it seized on me because the handle was damp so yay so i tend to try to like to stick to the solid silicone uh type spoons are but i find i find work best all right so we're at 113 for the dark chocolate you want to turn your heat off take it off your heat and you want to make sure your marble um your marble stone area work area is completely clean and again 100 dry so in the previous video i showed you tabling um this is a slightly different method in the one in the other video i still used temperature to get us to that point this does not so what you do is you take half of your chocolate if i engage what half is you set your regular you set your melted chocolate off to the side and you get your straight edge uh straight edge and your offset spatula and you're going to work the two use the two the agitation is what is going to create our beta crystals that we need and this what we're going to do is we're going to work the chocolate until it gets till it thickens up so this can oops you don't do that try and stay on the table but make sure to get all the chocolate from the side get that scooted in holder the cold from the side is what helps to start thicken up your chocolate i have found this has become my favorite way for tempering might take a couple of times for you to try it but as i said if you don't temper the first time you just re-melt it do it again continue to clean off the blades my coordination is not so good our chocolate's beginning to thicken up here a little bit almost getting to where we want it to be yeah professional chocolatiers are way neater at this so you can see the chocolate starting to thicken up now it's not flooding out as quickly i'm just going to go a little bit further almost done i found this way this method far quicker and more efficient i hate the other ways i have very few times do i ever get it right so you can see our chocolate's thickened up here it's not as fluid and it's starting to harden as it goes out to the sides so this looks about where we want it to be scoop up your chocolate not those other peas get the little pieces melted there [Music] now we're going to take our the half chocolate that we have and we're going to add in our thickened chocolate again chocolatiers make this look far more impressive eyes look like what the hell am i doing but trust me it works then get your whisk put my whiskey and you're going to mix it together until it becomes one texture the same texture it all gets mixed together and melts those two different textures together and becomes one nice smooth and silky and the color's all the same that looks pretty good now we're going to get our mold and you're going to fill that up fill them up to their tops you don't have to worry about being too neat you want to be pretty quick mix get that moved around and then you can try and dump it into your pot or you just pour it onto the parchment paper and scoot it off or pour it onto the board and scoot it off so you want to drain out the excess get your straight edge spatula and you want to scoop off scrape off all this excess off you want to try and make sure your molds are nice and clean at the tops and again you can move the chocolate around and we're going to dump out the excess and again we're going to clean the excess off the top here give her a little smack down get getting any air bubbles make sure that also make sure this is even now what i like to do is to place them upside down on a parchment lined board and pop them into the fridge to set this way um you don't get this big hunk of chocolate set at the bottom of your get that mold of the way you can just take it through any excess this will save you having a big lip what we want to try and create is a nice little edge and scrape off that top then i'm going to flip this upside down on my board here i'm going to pop this in the fridge for about then with your leftover chocolate here grab your pot and we're just going to scoop it back in the pot and re-temper it again for the second round so i think you can do this with candy melts um the only problem if you don't want to do chocolate tempering in that the only problem is i don't know how well or how easily they melt with um in the hot milk or hot milk and or cream but what you could always do to find out ahead of time makes it what you can always do is just do a quick test melt you don't have to infuse anything just melt some candy melts up um into the ball shape and see how they melt in more milk they melt up nicely then absolutely you can just use candy melts and you don't have to go through all this tempering chocolate all right so while my first layer there are cooling in the refrigerator i'm just going to re-melt my chocolate back up to the 113 fahrenheit and then just re-temper it again like i said it takes you may take you a couple of times to get this but if you can get down this method honestly it's so much easier and it makes you feel more professional so see our bowls now see how nice they are nice and even so again i'm going to fill them up i don't know where i'm going get that out of the way for a minute so we want to get that mixed around get that coated and again we'll just dump out the excess on our parchment paper and then we're going to scrape off this excess again you want to try and get the um the tops here as clean as you can getting your chocolate out of your mold a lot easier i just want to kind of smack out air bubbles here a little bit and then again we're going to dump out the excess so the reason that you want to make sure to be getting out all the excess chocolate is just have a really nice um even mold of your chocolate you won't end up with a big lump of chocolate in the base of them again clean off the excess and then one more time and then we're gonna do one final scrape here and i'm going to flip her upside down onto my parchment board here and pop it in the fridge here for about 15-20 minutes and then your leftover chocolate you can just um keep in a plastic container and just save it for next time there we go you can recoup most of your chocolate especially when it's expensive you do not want to be wasting too much and the other thing you can do is just take your parchment paper if you want to make sure to get all your chocolate pretty much put that in the refrigerator once it cools up all of that will just crumble right off i however i'm not gonna bother all right so we'll let those cool up then next we'll decorate them fill them and put them together all right so on to decorating if you're going to decorate go to this step if not you can skip on to the to the filling part so we've got our molds and they're all nicely set so you want to very gently take them out this is what you want to put your gloves on because you do not want to get fingerprints all over your pretty little balls and now you'll know your chocolate chocolate is tempered by when you touch it if it instantly melts and then it is not tempered but if it stays then it's good and it's not instantly melting on your fingers then you're good if it is not tempered it's not going to be if they're not going to be as pretty and shiny they'll be a little bit dull or streaky and as well as they said as soon as you touch them they will like instantly melt on your fingers so i've just put my salted caramel into a disposable piping bag and i'm just going to cut a little hole here and then probably should do this on a wire rack duh i knew i needed one so place the model place the wire rack down and then put some parchment paper underneath that and i'm gonna pop these in the fridge let that set up for just a couple of minutes while that's setting up well let's get our hot chocolate ready so again get your strainer and um and i've got a bowl here [Music] pay attention so i'm going to dump our hot chocolate into our strainer and we'll just strain it through take out all the lumps all right so on to our final step here everything's set here so we're going to fill them up and seal them up but what i've been here is i've got some tempered chocolate that i put into a piping bag and i put a really really tiny hole at the inlet tip so you're going to flip your little guys over if you if they're a little stuck to your rack here just get a little spatula and gently scoop those off and my um hot chocolate it its um recipe is two tablespoons so i'm gonna do one into each side so these get a little tricky to to stick together and then i take some marshmallows throw those in i'm just gonna make a little pipe that around the edge here carefully come together like so and stick them together then you can just gently with your finger just scoot off the excess off the edges here and then what i'll use is where'd they go is the medium size or these are the medium size or small sorry small um muffin cups to hold them in see pretty again we want to get that nice get a little edge on it take your two make sure your designs are going the same way let's scoot them together gently not the prettiest one but oh well can't be perfect we'll use that for the tester and there you have it hot chocolate bombs so what i'm going to do right now is i'm going to heat up some milk and we're going to give her a shot give her a try see how they turn out all right so i've got some boiled milk here let's check out how our balm does i'll use the ugly one so we just plop her into our cup here and i like to use a whisk we pour our hot milk i like to do a mixture of cream and milk that is my milk i don't really like it and look at her start to melt so what i like to do is to put just about a quarter in and get her mixed up use her whisk get her all nicely mixed up let's fill her up and there we have it [Applause] yummy yummy hot chocolate bombs that was good that was a perfect amount yum yum well before i can't finish up this video because if i keep going on this hot chocolate i'm going to bid you a fair a jew so i hope you enjoyed

"F-Ki-DqiXBQ": "hi I'm for traders Wonderland cat and I'm doing a review today for dr. Bob's medicated cannabis lollipop it's a 40 milligram THC lollipop I'm gonna be your flavored it's a hybrid by the package never had one of these before that everyone told me they're really good it's actually a pretty big lollipop can't really taste the fact that it's medicated which is a big plus for me because I don't really like the Medicaid taste and I got root beer and it really really tastes like root beer so oh no I have to say pretty good review I like it so far stay tuned for more thank you for watching join me on Fort Wayne nurse comm be my fan follow my Instagram", "N_-egbS8RaE": "so what is up guys it's your boy Shelton with another fire a video from waking baking this morning we got another surprise for you guys this is a good surprise to this deposits airheads this morning we got some areas I got this actually before I left to go to Miami because I went to Miami to a car show which was canceled because of the got-dang coronavirus ladies y'all this is airheads they'll see them crystals on that area is a hybrid strain it originates from the United States obviously it may taste fruity spicy earthy sour piney when smoked this strand can make you feel you for your creativity calm numbness appetite gain and pain relief negative side effects can include slight anxiety and slight dry mouth I can't see no side effects the smoking yeah get some ice in here on the girl so I'm sorry I can't remember your name right now but somebody had asked me why I prefer smoking bone over blunts of papers and I had told because it's aesthetically pleasing you know it looks better to smoke a bong than to watch me sit back smoking a blunt or smoking a bowl but or smoking on paper but the other reason is is that I smoke a bong because this gives me the full flavor I don't know people tell me that when they smoke blunts they can taste the weed really good I can't taste the weed but with to a blunt I don't know what it is and papers saying to see me distorted distort the flavor by making it harsh or something to me you know and I put a lot of weed when I rolled a j2 when I rolled a Jiang I probably put as much in a jet in a joint as y'all put in a blunt pipe on a 1.7 maybe 2 grams but anyway we're gonna go ahead and get in here on this area you see how it takes up I wish I'd have brought this to Miami with me I probably would have smoked it all I know what I smoked at all anyway on the way to Miami on the way back from Miami I had a blowout I don't know if you guys seen the video yet but I had a blowout tire blew out and now they're attempting to charge me for the tire and the tow service and I had to wait on the side of the road for four hours man for four hours on the side of highway I'm gonna dispute that anyway let's go with this airhead you guys let's get a good flavor there was a lot of different flavors that said that this could possibly taste like - excuse me um would it say a fruity spicy earthy sour piney all that let's get up in it I love that cool him when ice comes dukes I taste all that I definitely taste plain I guess I could've been spicy I tasted it sour in the earthy and piney maybe I'm just tasting all that because I just read it but actually this is a really really full flavor of gosh it's nice that is really flavorful guys that tastes so good Wow hence the reason why I smoke out of a ball so I can taste it all this is like straight flavor like straight from here to here straight flavor man I can't taste that in a blood I really can't but I know but I know I'm at the smoker blood would you like yes I was so disappointed about the car show we drove before they had five hours to Miami just to go to the Miami cars & coffee show for you guys I'm renting a car and everything we get down there man I should have recorded I should have showed you guys what cars and coffee and Miami was like so um they had like maybe eight cars there maybe twelve cars tops I was like you [ __ ] serious man but one thing about it I got to see a Lamborghini uris in person that was the first time I've ever seen one and that was a pleasure to see y'all tell y'all if you ain't never seen a Lamborghini yours oh my for those who don't know what a Lamborghini your citizens for Lambo truck oh ok you guys so definitely on a scale of one to ten one being the worst ten being the best for flavor critique of this area Wow I'd have to give this a eight a high eight for flavor this tastes really good job I I'm speechless oh my god you guys go look at the video with the meaning of being on shrooms oh my god that video is so hilarious cuz I was so high when I made that oh my god I wanted to see something so bad because I had took some shrimps when I was here before I left to go to Miami and the blanket was like literally moving my whole blanket was on the floor that my dog lays on the blanket was just moving and I was like oh because I never seen [ __ ] on shrooms cuz I always underdose so I'm just high enough you know I don't really like the see [ __ ] or at least I didn't think I did so anyway I get there in Miami and I took some shrooms and I'm tripping but I wanted to see something so bad that I kept taking shrooms it's kept taking him I wasn't seeing nothing and it was like I was just so high I was i god that is really nice oh yeah so yesterday I also tried to make a live video with tick-tock so I'm going on I'm on video live and uh I'm talking about weed and I'm smoking and showing the weed and all that like everybody else does and the video just stops I mean it wasn't a pedo it was live the live feed just stops boom I was like what happened oh you're gonna get some tick tock guidelines and you're banned forever from blood from live-streaming forever you know chances just you're just banned forever from live-streaming you've mattify we go take the live streaming off your page I was like are you [ __ ] serious everybody else makes videos with [ __ ] them smoking weed or or something about we what dude even show this plants and in nothing that's it that shit's good the only difference with everybody making the videos with them smoking on it none of them are black I'm not raising what black people can't be racist I'm not prejudiced but it's just odd to me that the minute that I put one up there it gets taken down they they've just taken it down just because it's me not because I'm black just because it's Shelton never know but I felt like those because I was black that was wrong anyway we're not here to talk about [ __ ] tick tock we're here to smoke some weed y'all [ __ ] with y'all oh yeah I'll tell you in a second Wow good lord gracious ah damn it Sammy wow that is [ __ ] delicious I taste everything that they were saying piney sour sweet bitter trees leave us a taste at all I taste car tires in this [ __ ] this [ __ ] is awesome the highest creeping a feeling right behind my hybrid here we go I gotta go back in because this is so delicious [Music] that's really delicious now on a scale of one to ten one being the worst ten being the best for the high of airheads I don't think the highest is anything spectacular it feels like a normal exotic high you know like it's just I'm high don't get it wrong I'm highs you know what if whenever you're in doubt of being high it'll smoke some more nose when you look my boy it starts sweating look at Wow listen I can't a boy I don't know no that was this we got me speaking in tongues so as I was saying the high really as I'm talking getting higher so we're gonna put a little bit more in here take my lure here which I'll then I've seen do all of the work I don't even know if y'all can hear me I'm talking solo and [ __ ] so here we go it's better than talking like this I'm just playing I taste the sour that time wow that flavors just y'all there's so many different flavors but let's do try this again on a scale of one to ten one being worse can't be in the best of the high of Ariat I would have to give it a strong seven yes we'll go to strong seven with this so the flavor outweighs - hi hang on a second y'all almost it no I'm not gonna do it because I almost did this in one little tape

plan on eating this right now so that way and like about an hour after I do my hair will be ready to do my makeup and humvee Heights bug so that's exciting but I wanna show you guys while I eat this this is cookies and cream flavor and it says it is by the brand 420 brownie I don't really know I'm not too sure yeah so it's so funny because on the back it literally says only start with a sugar cube piece sized piece wait at least 2 hours in all capitals it says 2 hours to feel the full effects but you know we're gonna eat as much as we can right [ __ ] now so - you're poppin so [ __ ] chocolatey like I don't want to eat it it's gonna be so torturous maybe this I know some people are probably like what the [ __ ] [ __ ] I would love to eat that and it's like yeah I want to be high but I don't wanna eat this like [Applause] do what it looks like very chocolatey it's um cookies and cream so not only is it the brownie there's double the chocolates of the cookies oh my gosh I don't want to eat this ah tastes like mint cuz my toothpaste I remember when I was younger I watched one of these videos of um a girl who actually had purple hair she's not even YouTube gray anymore I don't know what happened to her forgot her name actually her name was Erica cannabis and she had a video of her eating a brownie like this kind of but I don't know how many milligrams it was that by the way if you guys didn't know this is a thousand milligrams of thousands so that's kind of a lot okay a lot of people usually take like 100 milligrams 200 300 500 is a lot this one's a thousand so yeah I wish it was smaller so I could just eat the whole thing you know like one bite but the reason why I brought up Erica cannabis is um old video is because she was like oh I don't want to eat the brownie and nasty and I was like what the [ __ ] like I've never had an edible because I was like so young at the time watching that video and I remember being like what the [ __ ] this girl doesn't want to eat her brownie I'll eat it for her you know but now it's like no [ __ ] I understand because this is a struggle at least I got to film this video with like white peas and I'm like with white keys rather than like with the yellow tooth like you know my haters mad you had to find something new to hate on about me mmm haters mad Oh watch me you my brownie [ __ ] Oh Oh big bite mmm I hate it I don't like the taste I don't like it it's just too chocolatey it is 8 o'clock and I will check back with you guys in an hour I just came downstairs to get some water it's already 8:30 and I don't really feel anything yet so honestly get me eat some more no casually somewhere you know [Music] I probably will in the middle of my makeup to him I'm gonna have one eye done I'm a crazy go what could I say [Applause] okay here's how much I have left look okay mm-hmm oh I just threw up in my mouth and swallowed it like no [ __ ] joke what's stopping everybody it is your desk and it is currently nine o'clock right now and if you guys were here at the beginning of the video then you know that I ate this 1000 milligram edible at eight o'clock and then at 8:30 actually ate like a whole nother big huge piece so I'm sure throughout this video this edible is just going to be hitting me harder and even harder right now I really don't feel it I don't feel completely sober though I feel the train starting to blast off yeah but anyways enough of my chit-chatting let's just get on me to it so right here in front of me I have a mirror with my makeup brushes and online makeup products I kind of have a lot like compared to other people like beauty gurus I probably have like nothing but to me I I have a lot of makeup but like yeah probably not [ __ ] compared to some people just gotta start off with the hand sanitizer you feel me you gotta have them clean nice and fresh hands by the way if you guys didn't know a lot of you guys every single time I wear this choker and like a snapchat or

__ ] gay all my hair but yeah of course gotta keep y'all skin moisturize you feel me can't be looking crusty so there we go nice layer of moisturization yone on our skin and then I kind of let that dry up a little bit just so it's not all juicy and wet and moist and then I died right on in - you know that the good older what do you even call this primer I'm not a beauty guru guys I'm really not I'm actually very bad at doing makeup but I'm gonna try to do this good cuz like this is what I'm gonna wear for the rest of the day so I'm gonna literally try my 150% best to do this like pretty you know and I'm going for like a pretty like every day you makeup look I might do it like a little bit snazzier with some eye shadow and some lashes I've been wearing falsies a lot more and than I ever did in my entire life and I'm already getting if you guys think I should do a video on why I hate and we'll never get eyelash extensions again thumbs up this video so I could do like a whole experience and Q&A maybe all about eyelash extensions because I know what of you guys probably having on them yet and I know a lot of you guys probably do want to get them but girl I've got that a couple of times and from different people from salons from home studios and I just hate them and my phone's ringing who's calling me Yello yep life being guest on the beat yep okay now you're back to the Z video um what do I do next I got a cover up these acne problems cuz do you not see this face girl I know you do I know you see my pimples from a mile away I actually recently bought this foundation it's the LA pro coverage foundation by le girl hmm good thing I didn't go on my kappa pants [ __ ] oh heck no oh my gosh really honey I learn my freakin hair I got my arm again [Music] anyways as I was trying to say jeez you just want to be so rude trying to interrupt me a [ __ ] um I like this foundation I don't think it's the correct color for my skin but it's not like completely off we just kind of like oxidizes a little bit and then becomes a little bit too dark for me but I just kind of fix it with like a light concealer but yeah I ordered this from Ulta online because nowhere in my town do they sell la girl so I really had a guess my color because like obviously I ordered it online and I liked it I mean I don't regret buying it it was probably like five to eight dollars I don't remember exactly how much it was but it was pretty like affordable and I liked it um it kinda looks like pain on my skin like I'm painting my face but like isn't that what makeup is it's like painting your face right stop looking and it's funny because I'm doing a really bad job at blending this in but because I'm on camera I swear it on camera it looks so flawless and I look so pale but in person it looks way tan and then it doesn't look fully blended I hope so yeah always just keep in mind that youtubers I feel like look twenty times cuter through the camera so just you know don't be surprised when you see me add a bath on no I'm just kidding that's a really bad joke because mm I already passed but you get the idea I'm a Yoko has a [ __ ] basically next I do my eyebrows and honestly you guys I think I have been known for like a good year now ever since I started my youtube channel that I'm terrible at doing eyebrows I've always used this on Nastasia dip brow to fill in my eyebrows but just recently I switched to the honest Asya duo brow powder it's like the same thing just powder formula rather than the dipbrow formula which is like I don't know what it is and I don't know powder I think works a lot better for me and the kind of eyebrows I have because my eyebrows are really fine you guys could barely even see them from a mile away that's why I have to fill the [ __ ] out of them and just like you know I've tried yoga I only got eyebrows online so yeah you know I wasn't born with no eyebrows but when I use the dipbrow I guess I just looked like a lot more of a fake [ __ ] so when I use this powder it just works out a lot nicer for me because people don't judge me as hard on my Instagram comments and they actually give me compliments on my eyebrows people decide to be nice you know as opposed to when I use a dip brow people comment saying how fake my eyebrows are and how well it matches my personality oh [ __ ] I'm just roasting myself now oh and also somebody commented on my video recently actually shout out to that person who commented this cuz they said destiny oMG all you do is roast yourself like don't don't put yourself down like you know [ __ ] what anybody else thinks like your eyebrows are popping or everything this pop and you know who cares you know and I was reading that comment and I was like that's so true like who cares you know like who cares if I don't have no eyebrows that's what makeup is for to give me eyebrows you know like it's not a big deal it's just it's a [ __ ] piece of pube on your face like who gives a [ __ ] you know but honestly I love roasting myself because I love myself and how much why I can roast myself and laugh about it and still love myself and still feel like I pop it I'm beautiful even without makeup you know I don't really give a [ __ ] like Shu who do I got to impress honestly I ain't got nobody to impress like I you know life is just so short why live it trying to impress others Wow my eyebrows are not coming out good you guys I kind of just like slap on a bunch of product and then I get the concealer and I try to like actually make it look like I browsed oh like and I feel like once they get them threaded they'll be a lot easier to do right now it's hard for me because I'm really bad at doing makeup in the first place and then I'm a little bit high off of this edible and then my eyebrows just have [ __ ] hair everywhere like what the [ __ ] where do I fill it in you know the struggle is real right I say my say here's my eyebrows honestly if I got mistaken they don't look too shabby like yeah but not the best yeah they're pretty [ __ ] dark but I have had a worst days bill I've had worst days so that makes today a decent day kind of feel like hitting my wax pan because this edibles not doing me justice so Cheers all right so once I'm done doing my eyebrows I immediately jump into conceal oh my gosh the I fell that trying to talk okay cuz I'm already using the concealer for my eyebrows so it only makes sense to do the concealer after your eyebrows cuz then you're gonna need a use of concealer on your eyebrows like I don't understand how [ __ ] could do their concealer first and then do their eyebrows and then do concealer again you know I like to keep it all in one we can seal the brows and then we can sell these under-eye circles right now my pimples I mean my pimples my forehead you guys it literally has like craters on it like I want to zoom in I want to expose myself looking you see those craters okay like you see him you see how like from a distance you can't see them but then up close you could see them that's like the biggest insecurity I have right now is my acne on my forehead because they're not like pimples so I can't like pop them you know like they're not pimples but there's just like a bunch of like little bumps and I've never had that problem I've seen other like high schoolers I went to school with who have that problem and I remember always thinking like haha I don't have that problem and like all my friends would be like you guys and now look at me now look at me now I have that problem and I don't know so you know if you don't have acne right now y'all better not be laughing at me cuz watch watch you in a couple years get your fair share of acne and then you'll be like [ __ ] now what do I do and then I bake I bake these [ __ ] edibles that's what the [ __ ] I'm making after set these eyebrows in place because they like to play so I use this brow gel that I've had for a minute by anastasiya and I'm a broke-ass [ __ ] that I've had this sample for like months and you know it's still going strong and your girls still not having to spend that extra coin because she uses the samples alright anyways enough about my brother [ __ ] problems let's get it poppin with that bronzer so I used to always used a typical bronzing brush you know nice and angled no [ __ ] let me give you the biggest tip of your life I think I'm starting to feel the edible now actually okay anyways you get this brush boom this one's like super narrow and skinny I feel like this is I used to use this on my under eyes like that but now I just use my [ __ ] Beauty Blender for that and I use this from my mother [ __ ] Bora I see mother [ __ ] so much I should really watch my language Wow okay no wonder YouTube dis monetizes me um you know you just I think it makes your bronzer look a lot more like snatch'd would be the word like it makes it look like well [ __ ] you got a nice ass face you know you know what I mean I know you do because look at that it looks good you know and I'm putting like zero effort you guys like I'm the worst at doing makeup and I can make myself look dragoness [ __ ] with some makeup like honestly I'm so bad I do makeup but I need way more poppin with it I think so much cuter like look at me my skin my bronzer my cheekbones my eyebrows okay no we need this highlight crackle oh um I usually use I don't know what happened to it I probably dropped it just like I dropped my future now I'm just kidding um just how to drop everything I don't know happen to it I usually use a NYX spray for when I used to do my highlight but I don't know happen to it for like the 20th time how many times do I have to say don't [ __ ] know what happened - it was here like yesterday now I can't find it so I'm using this one it's a little fancier than the typical water supposedly cuz it's like supposed to be rosewater who [ __ ] knows they're probably lying okay anyways I'm using this highlight from this palette I got it as a present so I really I'm not sure what the name of it is or like how much it was cuz you know broke [ __ ] I would never buy myself this it's by lorac it's probably like 40 bucks for like literally the only not trying to roast on the person who got me this cuz I love them so much and I'm so grateful I have this because I owe you see this later but I feel bad cuz literally the highlighter is the only thing I use and this pilot was a good I don't know how much money put it and you know what I don't really like it that much because sometimes when I'm a high ass and I'm going like this to get my highlight I'll literally get the purple you guys cuz it's right next to the highlighter and I'll go on my face and I'll have a fat ass piece of purple and I'm like what and then I'll look down and I'll be like and then I have to do it like all over again and it's just a hassle so yeah I look so cakey right now like you know you went overboard when your skin looks like you need a blended out quick cuz I'd be looking like the Napoleon Express with my [ __ ] highlight like yikes okay I'm just cat oh I was about to say that I baked yes [ __ ] I baked oh my gosh I forget everything but I burped it tasted like we for the one cut this was like almost 50 bucks and I actually bought this myself and I only use this brown shade literally every day on a special occasion you might see me dip into like the Pink's but honestly I only use one color and I hate makeup you guys I hate spending money on makeup I hate doing my makeup the only thing I do like about makeup is the way it looks and I know my name we know actually I have this oh let's use this boom let's use it okay I just bought this this is from Stila oh my gosh this really made me a broke [ __ ] this [ __ ] was like 25 [ __ ] bucks and look at how much it's already gone like can you guys see that hole I just put the eyelash glue on the eyelash just waiting for that to dry for a sec and meanwhile honestly I'm really sad because I really didn't feel that edible so I'm sad I feel like by now I should be filling my [Music] completed makeup look all I'm gonna do only my top lashes because honestly when I play it okay and then the very last thing is of course that apply so I'm boom and then this is the completed makeup look honestly I think this I came out pretty good but I think this I did not so that was me trying to do my pretty good honestly from a distance it doesn't look too shabby you guys just gonna slap on that liquidy glossy and boom literally call it a day but don't wait and don't let nobody look too close cuz shoot don't be like [ __ ] is there a [ __ ] party on your eyelids cuz there'd be [ __ ] oh my gosh just don't keep in mind don't use as much glitter as I did and you'll be Gucci are everybody that concludes the end of this video honestly looks so fun I'm so sad that I feel like the edible did it hit me as hard like do I have hi of Tolerance they even eaten a thousand milligram a double I don't get high like what really cuz I fell high for a little bit and then I feel like the highest done like I feel like I'm done with the high like already so that's really weird maybe it was because I did it first thing in the morning so I just have so much energy that I just don't feel the high I don't know you guys doing the makeup I

Mike Hansen and in\u00a0\nthis video we're talking about CBD what is CBD\u00a0\u00a0 the story behind cannabidiol the cannabis product\u00a0\nthat gets you well not high you've heard of CBD\u00a0\u00a0 the cannabis product whose popularity has reached\u00a0\nalmost crazed lake proportions CBD has come from\u00a0\u00a0 nowhere to everywhere in just the last few years\u00a0\nit is perhaps best known for its ability to\u00a0\u00a0 reduce anxiety and promote happiness but CBDs\u00a0\napplications are seemingly endless it's been\u00a0\u00a0 successfully used to help with pain insomnia and\u00a0\ndepression there are some reports that it helps\u00a0\u00a0 with other medical conditions as well because\u00a0\nof its wide range of uses CBD infused products\u00a0\u00a0 are the fastest growing segment of the health\u00a0\nindustry even some pets are getting in on the\u00a0\u00a0 action for example CBD troubles are used to calm\u00a0\ndogs Carl's jr. the fast food chain has created a\u00a0\u00a0 burger served with a CBD infused sauce not that\u00a0\nI endorse calls jr. or any fast food for that\u00a0\u00a0 matter and New York City CBD infused coffee was\u00a0\nall the rage and sell at the camp and then there\u00a0\u00a0 is medical celebrities dr. oz and dr. Sanjay\u00a0\nGupta who actually advocate for CBD as well as\u00a0\u00a0 non-medical celebrities such as Joe Rogan Morgan\u00a0\nFreeman Quentin Paltrow then you got athletes such\u00a0\u00a0 as David Wells who argue on behalf of CBD use\u00a0\nin sports medicine where it's anti-inflammatory\u00a0\u00a0 power would allow players to recover more quickly\u00a0\nand not risk opioid addiction there are plenty of\u00a0\u00a0 MMA fighters who swear by it as well in Bubba\u00a0\nWatson a professional golfer said that his\u00a0\u00a0 decisions UCB was quote-unquote a no brainer the\u00a0\nFDA even joined the bandwagon last year at least\u00a0\u00a0 partially approving the CBD medication at the\u00a0\ndialects this is despite the fact that cannabis\u00a0\u00a0 remains illegal in eyes of the federal government\u00a0\nso CBD use is growing by leaps and bounds with a\u00a0\u00a0 projected twenty two billion dollar market by the\u00a0\nyear 2022 CBD is cannabidiol which is derived from\u00a0\u00a0 the flower of cannabis the only plant genus that\u00a0\ncontains YOUnique class of molecular compounds\u00a0\u00a0 called phytochemicals so there's more than 8500\u00a0\ncannabinoids that have been identified but the\u00a0\u00a0 two most prevalent are tetrahydrocannabinol\u00a0\naka THC and cannabidiol which is CBD THC is\u00a0\u00a0 the psychoactive ingredient of cannabis meaning\u00a0\nTHC is the component that gets you high while\u00a0\u00a0 CBD is the quote/unquote anti psychoactive\u00a0\ningredient meaning it doesn't get you high\u00a0\u00a0 there are actually two types of cannabis plants\u00a0\nmeaning there are two subspecies one is marijuana\u00a0\u00a0 which is rich in THC and thus has been cultivated\u00a0\nfor the high associated with its recreational use\u00a0\u00a0 and then there is hemp which is low in THC hemp\u00a0\nwas historically cultivated for the industrial\u00a0\u00a0 uses or its tough fibers in December of 2018\u00a0\nin part because a growing body of scientific\u00a0\u00a0 evidence showing CBDs therapeutic attributes\u00a0\nthe federal government legalized him although\u00a0\u00a0 33 states have legalized medical marijuana\u00a0\nincluding 10 states with legal recreational\u00a0\u00a0 use marijuana remains prohibited at the federal\u00a0\nlevel so both hemp and marijuana contains CBD\u00a0\u00a0 the recent full legalization of hemp is part\u00a0\nof the reason why some experts believe the CBD\u00a0\u00a0 market will have a societal impact as monumentous\u00a0\nas the tech revolution two decades ago but to\u00a0\u00a0 really understand what CBD is and why it is only\u00a0\nso recently burst into such almost revolutionary\u00a0\u00a0 prominence it helps to know a little bit about\u00a0\nthe history of cannabis and the biology of its use\u00a0\u00a0 cannabis is believed to have been used medicinally\u00a0\nrecreationally and for spiritual reasons\u00a0\u00a0 throughout much of humankind's history it's been\u00a0\nused in some form by societies throughout the\u00a0\u00a0 world the oldest known written record regarding\u00a0\nits use comes from almost 5000 years ago in\u00a0\u00a0 China ancient Greeks used it to dress wounds at\u00a0\nhorses and to apply to human nosebleeds it was\u00a0\u00a0 medicinally popular among Vikings and medieval\u00a0\nGermans for relieving pain during childbirth and\u00a0\u00a0 for toothaches while Queen Elizabeth used cannabis\u00a0\nto relieve her menstrual cramps but only in recent\u00a0\u00a0 decades it's have we come to understand how\u00a0\nand why cannabis affects humans the plant\u00a0\u00a0 was largely excluded from scientific study due to\u00a0\nits widespread illegality until the 1960s when an\u00a0\u00a0 Israeli chemist named Rafael McCollum McCullum was\u00a0\nable to obtain confiscated hashish from police and\u00a0\u00a0 study it he elucidated the structure of THC and\u00a0\nCBD and then in 1992 made an even more fundamental\u00a0\u00a0 discovery the existence of the endocannabinoid\u00a0\nsystem meaning the EC s in the human body so the\u00a0\u00a0 EC s is the body's largest system of receptors and\u00a0\nit's found throughout the brain nervous system and\u00a0\u00a0 organs it's been described as the molecular bridge\u00a0\nbetween the body and the mind scientists have come\u00a0\u00a0 to believe the EC s is among the most important\u00a0\nphysiological systems involved in human health\u00a0\u00a0 because it regulates both mood and homeostasis\u00a0\nkeeping internal systems balanced in the face of\u00a0\u00a0 external stress and inflammation he said that by\u00a0\nusing a plant that has been around for thousands\u00a0\u00a0 of years we discovered a new physiological system\u00a0\nof immense importance we wouldn't have been able\u00a0\u00a0 to get there if we had not looked at the plant\u00a0\nso the implications of this discovery including\u00a0\u00a0 the burgeoning applications of CBD are only\u00a0\nbeginning to take shape and looking at the\u00a0\u00a0 ec s McCullum uncovered naturally occurring\u00a0\nneurotransmitters called endocannabinoids that\u00a0\u00a0 are structurally nearly identical to the phyto\u00a0\ncannabinoids found in cannabis THC mimics these\u00a0\u00a0 endocannabinoids endocannabinoids and binds to\u00a0\nthe two main kinds of receptors in the body cb1\u00a0\u00a0 and cb2 CBD doesn't directly bind the cb1 or cb2\u00a0\nreceptors but instead serves as a real take and\u00a0\u00a0 break down inhibitor preventing the breakdown of\u00a0\nnaturally-occurring endocannabinoids in the body\u00a0\u00a0 this is essentially the same way that selective\u00a0\nserotonin reuptake inhibitors or SSRIs work which\u00a0\u00a0 prevent the reuptake and breakdown of serotonin\u00a0\nin the brain and if you're not familiar with\u00a0\u00a0 SSRIs these are the medications that are mainly\u00a0\nused to treat anxiety and depression think paxil\u00a0\u00a0 zoloft cetera so CBDs health impacts span the\u00a0\nentire endocannabinoid system in particular\u00a0\u00a0 researchers have found a CBD increases the levels\u00a0\nof an and amide and cannabinoid known as the Bliss\u00a0\u00a0 molecule derived from the Sanskrit word Ananda\u00a0\nwhich means extreme happiness or one of the\u00a0\u00a0 highest states of being CBD has shown to generally\u00a0\nserve as a boon for brain health serving as both\u00a0\u00a0 a protectant and enhancing neuroplasticity it's\u00a0\nbeen shown to be effective applied topically in\u00a0\u00a0 reducing inflammation and overall body pain some\u00a0\nearly studies suggest that CBD might help fight\u00a0\u00a0 cancer and has already earned a place in overall\u00a0\ncancer treatment force ability to reduce nausea\u00a0\u00a0 and help with pain and the benefits of CBD appear\u00a0\nto come with little to no side effects according\u00a0\u00a0 to the World Health Organization they said CBD\u00a0\nexhibits no effects indicative of any abuse or\u00a0\u00a0 dependence potential and today there's no evidence\u00a0\nof public health related problems associated with\u00a0\u00a0 the use of pure CBD because this is all relatively\u00a0\nnew science studies of CBDs efficacy in a number\u00a0\u00a0 of treatments are still preliminary and its actual\u00a0\nmarketing is often suspect many products are being\u00a0\u00a0 released without much regulatory oversight and\u00a0\nthe CBD levels and overall quality of CBD products\u00a0\u00a0 are not always as advertised mostly they don't\u00a0\ncome as advertised so some CBD products contain\u00a0\u00a0 unwanted THC which means some people might test\u00a0\npositive for marijuana so you really have to do\u00a0\u00a0 your research to learn what CBD brands you can\u00a0\ntrust besides determining the safety and efficacy\u00a0\u00a0 of CBD for various medical conditions there are\u00a0\nlots of other questions that scientists need to\u00a0\u00a0 answer for example what form of CBD should be\u00a0\ntaken what is the recommended dosage and much\u00a0\u00a0 more so there's a

more space inside the GB eyes crime lab marijuana edibles are a growing problem for the state cbs46 is Meagan Packer is live at the GBI crime lab which is working overtime to control the intake of edibles Meghan yeah Thomas they are really trying to keep up with it here there are so many of them in their lab right now and they have seen a sharp increase of the edibles there's especially concern about children getting their hands on them because there is no way of knowing about the dosing in these products and it can make kids really sick check this out they've got so much of it right now they had to get an extra freezer in the crime lab just to store edibles that are awaiting to be tested from different cases everything from brownies to Candida crackers all suspected of containing THC the active ingredient in marijuana in the past two years the GBI estimates it's tested more than 400 samples I also spoke with the director of the Georgia poison center today who tells me they are hearing from more and more panicked parents many of the calls that we've been getting our accidental ingestion where parents are leaving their products out whether it's gummies or cookies and an unsuspecting child getting a hold of it it should not be looked at because oh it's just marijuana that it's not that bad or it's safe the issue with this is very easy to overdose the effects of these edibles are extremely can be extremely severe and they're extremely potent and the folks I'm speaking to today urge people especially children at school if you are given a food product a homemade treat for example and you do not know where it came from it's better to stay away there can be a variety of signs and symptoms and children who ingest these products ahead at 5:30 one reason the GBI says could be behind this sharp increase in their crime lab reporting live in DeKalb County at GBI headquarters I'm Meghan Packer CBS 46 News", "oEUgqp41pcM": "hey guys welcome back to a brand new video today we will be trying i've never seen it on tik tok but he said it was advertised on tick tock or for some reason a bunch of videos came up on my for you page and just i guess people having like celebrities try it and everyone's saying that they liked it so i wanted to try it and it wasn't super expensive so i got it even though they took forever to actually deliver it either way though if you guys didn't know you guys will know because of the title but it's exotic sugar or whatever which is like what they call it but i don't know we'll try it the crazy thing is you have to keep it in the freezer because it sticks up and gets like yeah hardens so it's been in the freezer it's still there's still a little bit of clumps in there but i don't know we're so we're going to try it hopefully it's good they said the best way is to mix a bunch of different flavors and i didn't see that but i didn't want to buy multiple anyways but this is a blue raspberry one they have like five or six or i don't know how many flavors they have a good amount of flavors what you're supposed to do put on your fruit shake it up in a bowl and it's supposed to be fire so we actually did try it just a little bit with no fruit though no nothing it was just on a spoon yeah we kind of got jolly rancher vibes from it yes i feel like this is grinding up jolly ranchers but we're gonna try it on fruit and see if it's like anything crazy this like i said this is the blue raspberry one i don't know if that was the right choice to get i don't know which one to get it didn't really say like this is like a favorite so i just chose this one but anyways let's let's get started so we're gonna dump all this out [Music] all right so we put some fruit in there now we got this i think we should have been do this because i feel like i don't want it to get pumped up all crazy even though that's a lot yes i want to coat it so we're going to do that shake it up chicago all right so as you can see we got it in there it's time to shake it so i don't think this was even enough well it's all clumped together now and there's a lot of liquid in here oh yeah all right so i don't think we put nearly enough it kind of created a glaze yeah but anyways let's try it i'm gonna try a pineapple first into so many of those i'm gonna try a kiwi i don't know if it's gonna focus on that but all right ready one two oh one two three it's really hard to tell because pineapples are so strong and there's not that much on there i couldn't really even taste all the strawberry it was just very crunchy all right we need we need to get more all right so we're going to put a lot more i think we kind of messed up by putting there's big so much liquid in here because it's supposed to be flaky like this how it just looks like that so we're just going to keep it like this i'm going to shake it all right let's go i'm going to try a strawberry this time i'll do a pineapple i mean this is definitely something you need to eat with like a fork also not just your hands it's kind of hard to taste yeah like i can taste it but i can't at the same time yeah it is good but it's not mind-blowing mm-hmm it's not something where it's like whoa then again it did kind of harden up it's like we messed up a little bit i like that it's not super strong because i want to taste the fruit a wee little kiwi i mean i like it will i buy it again i don't know i wouldn't i still feel like this is jolly ranchers grind it up because you get you get like the hardness or like stickiness of a jolly rancher like just the texture on your teeth it's definitely you could tell it's like that kind of texture yeah it's like it's just grinded up yeah i'm not mad at this i still want to try it again another time with less liquid in here we should put on here let's see do you remember how much this bag was but we'll put it right here all right so i'm gonna try this one and it's i don't know if this is even a lot cause it's only on the top it's not anywhere else but it seems like a lot um it's really hard to taste with the pineapple this pineapple doesn't really taste like anything though you must have corona or something seriously this tastes like pineapple i'll taste this one no i'm not tasting nothing after you know she this tastes like pineapple i don't know what she's talking about maybe that's why you don't like this so much you don't taste anything don't pull her closer to here yeah she's gonna get it too so what would you rate this out of 10 though this was six i'm a five i give it like a six or a seven like six point five or seven probably because i like it it's nothing crazy it's nothing like the next big thing yeah no it's nothing crazy like i don't think like oh you have to try this then again they i don't know if this is the best flavor to get maybe i should just got the original one maybe i should have got multiple ones and mixed them i don't know in my opinion it tastes a lot better by itself rather than on fruit wow why would you do that all right so that's gonna be the video of us trying exotic treats exotic sugar she wasn't the biggest fan of it i thought it was okay nothing crazy well about it again like i said i don't know but the rest of the bag i'll enjoy um so yeah if you guys enjoyed it though it's probably a short video but not too long but if you guys enjoyed it definitely leave a like we appreciate that subscribe if you haven't already and comment down below if you guys have had this if you guys are from l.a these guys are from la i think like

have you ever had magic before I'm like no but I don't see why you're trippin I hate the whole brownie like 20 minutes ago and I still don't feel anything and right after seeing that I hear yo somebody need to get me a doctor man somebody help me man yo Davey to the nurse dawg so if by now I have been completely and thoroughly shatters the illusion that I was the angel ik horrific kid that my parents believed I was back in the day this uh this video will surely fix it so this takes place back in high school back in Georgia to Jamaica Jamaica yeah man I was about 14 years old so one morning I get to school and I'm just chilling in my home classroom before the first school bell rings were one of my boys who will call Jeff comes up to me with a big smile on his face he's like yo Don how much lunch money you got today man so automatically I'm like god damn boy I just got a school man why is you begging me for money already dog can't I'll live he's like Don chill just just tell me how much lunch one you got man so I'm like 500 this is Jamaican dollars of course and at a time $300 was a reasonable amount for a day's worth of lunch money but my mama loved me a little bit extra so you know she'd often give me 500 just for context back then I 100 Jamaican dollars was equal to like one American dollar so I told him how much money I got and then he is like cool cool okay okay you should go half with me on a brown so I'm like brownie what brownies is there like a bake sale going on or something just like done no bro I'm talking about Leroy's and brownies dogs so I'm like oh snap Leroy that big dark-skinned dude I'm good I know Leroy he looks like the kind of guy that would scratch himself and then put his hand back in the batter without washing his hands I think I'm gonna have to take a hard pass on that one and Jeff was like done you know about these brownies huh I'm like what about them then Jeff's eyes lit up in that special way that people's eyes light up when they know a secret that you don't you leans in and whispers God these are magic brownies I look at Jeff and I'm like you're kidding he doesn't even say anything just stood there smiling I gave Jeff all of my lunch money you see by this time a lot of dudes in our grade were experimenting with magic but they were only using magic inhalers and that didn't really appeal to me but I was still curious about magic so when Jeff told me about the magic brownies I was like that sounds lazy so yeah I was like sign me up so Jeff takes my money in dips ow 10 minutes later he comes back to me enhance me my brownie wrapped up in foil paper he tells me that I should wait on till lunchtime to eat it and that I should only eat half so I'm like cool I got it I was pumped I couldn't wait till lunch fast forward to lunchtime and everybody has brownies like Leroy Maybank that day man so I'll find Jeff and I'm sitting with him and a group of friends and then we all ate our brownies so we're sitting there in 15 minutes or so passes and I'm not not really feeling anything also lunch was gonna end in less than 30 minutes so I started to get a little impatient on top of that I spent all my lunch money on this dang brownie tomorrow was Heike hungry I didn't have anything else to eat so I hate the rest of the brownie the whole thing I eat the whole thing I even lick the icing off the foil paper man so I'm sitting there and then Jeff comes over to me and he's like yo dumb and how you feeling bro and then I'm like hungry man and a little disappointed I had to hold brownie still pretty hungry and I really feeling any magic as soon as I said that Jeff's face changed from happy and magical to extremely concerned he was like on no I told you not to eat more than half bro have have you ever had magic before I'm like no but I don't see why you're trippin I had no whole brownie like 20 minutes ago and I still don't feel anything and right after seeing that I hear somebody need to get me a doctor man somebody help me man yo take me to the nurse dawg I look over to where the noise was coming from and I see this dude let's call him Amar'e screaming and running across the schoolyard then he gets tackled by some of the other students they bring him over and my man's is tripping hard he was sweating mumbling gibberish trying to take off his shirt just completely losing it so I'm like yo what happened to him and then one of his friends was like man that boy had a whole brownie dog I guess Leroy made this batch extra strong made this batch extra strong I'm instantly begin to panic I mean I was going to die and certainly I was I was going to die obviously here's why Amar'e was one of those dudes that was known to take part in the use of magic inhalers after school so you understand what I'm saying this this guy was an experienced magic user he was an experienced magic user and was still going insane I on the other hand have never used magic and I ate the exact same amount of brownie as he did I was so there I am just panicking internally awaiting my certain death I was sweating profusely I look sick just from the worry and anxiety then Jeff comes over to me and is like yo Don how you feelin man then I was like oh no bro I still don't feel anything too crazy man and it was like as soon as I said that BAM give me and here's the thing when it comes to eating management unlike inhaling it when you eat it he doesn't gradually come on to you one you're fine just chilling and then out of nowhere it's like a magical fairy comes over to you and bashes you over the head with her magic bit sending you straight into lala land I was on it was so bad that I ended up skipping all my classes after lunch there were three distinct feelings that I remember from being under magic spell the first was that time was moving in slow motion and I don't just mean my sense of time which did happen the last 10 minutes of lunch felt like an hour but I mean visually the best way I can describe it is like a visual echo for example let's say someone wave their hand in front of my face it was like their hand left a trail of hands as it moved along its path it completely tripped me out the second feeling was that my sense of touch became hyperstimulated I remember just sitting on the floor in complete agony because the wrinkles in my uniform hurt when my skin rubbed over there like I would rest my arm on my pants and the bulges in the fabric fell as if they were trying to pierce through my skin absolutely awful the last feeling was severe anxiety I can honestly say that this was the first time in my life where I experienced a real traumatic panic attack I was so worried about what you ask I remember in particular I was dreading that my mom was going to pick me up from school and see that I used magic and then kill me so for like the four hours between lunch and when I was supposed to get picked up from school I just sat on the floor Hannah can that my mom was gonna be just so disappointed and angry with me but here's the thing my mom never picked me up from school and I mean never she has a nine-to-five job she's a manager at Bank she's never picked me up from school but for some reason I was convinced that she was coming to get me and when she did she was going to murder me in front of all of my friends but of course instead a taxicab pick me up the same taxicab that had been picking me up every day from school for the prior three years so when I say that it made no sense that I was convinced that my mom was gonna pick me up I mean I have absolutely no idea I thought that but that's what you'd imagine community especially when you eat it at 14 years old so I get home and I immediately just went a bit I slept for like four hours got up and then proceeded to eat all the food in the house all of it like everyone's dinner that my aunt had cooked that afternoon and put in the fridge like four plates of food my G I ate all of it and then went back to sleep moral of the story kids don't do magic man it's a powerful stuff big shout out to the best squad on the internet man the sauce squad it's your boy man Yeung done the sauce

it is me filling in for noah glutton who definitely isn't too high to be on camera right now I'm sure you guys have all heard of scissor and lean thanks in no small part to your favorite popular rap songs well there's a new scissor out there that replaces the codeine with THC for your health a company called active list has created grape scissor with cannabinoids which they first introduced via free samples to the public on 4/20 I'm not sure why they picked Hitler's birthday for their pot sauce premiere but let's move on active list is a pun on the company activists were the folks behind the original prescription codeine syrup that you've heard you know little Wayne or Miley Cyrus or you know just whoever rap talk about see activists is pulling their stuff from the market because people are keeping way way too [ __ ] up on it seriously man that should kill you so legs the state way so active list swooped in and created their own medicine which is supposed to be a lot safer than lean they're touting it as a healthy alternative like soy milk but it still has the same purple color and goopy consistency it's $45 for two ounces which is up to two doses although some people just down the whole thing in one go cuz they're rebels and they don't care it seems kind of pricey to me since the high is over in about ten hours do you have any idea how much meth you can get for that kind of money guys the gentlemanly asking now we can get this stuff here in LA because pot is basically legal here but they are working on a THC free version so it could be shipped across state lines I don't know what the point of a THC free version of this would be but hey why not knock yourselves out active list there's a pretty good chance the activists people might try to sue ACTA bliss for a copyright infringement or something but they haven't done it yet and active list is just hoping they won't while still preparing for the possibilities I'm not sure who I'd pick in a fight between someone stoned on codeine against someone stoned on weed but let me know where you put your money in the comments I michael truly subscribe to taste it where you can find out about all kinds of ways

your dispensary and on today's episode we are not going to be reviewing a product instead we're going to be talking about news news and very sad news at that and that is that the edible Bonanza the edible crazy wonderful Wild West market in California is coming to an end as we know it January 1st I believe of 2018 the new regulations go into effect for both medicinal and recreational weed in the state of California and one of those major major changes coming to to the marijuana industry at large is headed headed straight for the edible industry in a really really really devastating way so what is changing one one thing makes sense and that's no more edibles that are shaped like kids candy that makes sense to me nothing you know no gummy shaped things no cartoon shaped things nothing with a cartoon mascot that'll make sense that all that all makes perfect sense to me and I'm totally ok with that but the far more devastating in the far more far-reaching consequences are gonna come in from the limits of THC henceforth each package each product can only be a hundred milligrams in total and can only have 10 milligrams of THC per serving so let me let's let's let's put that in perspective that means that you could only have a brownie can't even be a hundred milligrams it has to be cut up into ten squares of ten milligrams each and the whole thing can only be a hundred milligrams how they're gonna price these things I have no idea if they're going to be commensurate with the prices we see for 100 milligram edibles now or if they're just going to be more expensive what this does to the folks who really need those high you know folks with high high tolerances you know focuses with cancer diabetes terminal illnesses that rely on these high potency edibles for their pain and killing needs I don't know what they're gonna do it's again it's a it's a crippling blow to patients and it's equipping Bluett I assume to the industry they're gonna have to completely change the way that they operate here in California no company that I know of operates in that mode right now everybody has much more higher potency edibles and they're not divided into ten milligram parts in any way shape or form I'm just trying to think of the production and logistics work that's gonna have to go into these companies to change up their products and their formulas something like a kiva like how are they gonna break down their 180 milligrams chocalate bar and I take it back I have seen one company that's already seems to be on their way to figuring that out and that is kirova if you go to their website you can see where they now have many cookies and 100 milligram packages I assume they are coming out with this products just in preparation for the regulations but what everybody else is going to do that don't have the resources of say a you know a Korova to to shift like that to to completely change their production line the way they do everything III got to assume that's going to put them in a you know in dire financial straits so it's gonna be a big big change come January 1st and I still actually have lots and lots of questions about this so I don't know if first off everything I've read and I will provide links below I'll provide links in the description to everything I've read including the actual if I can find it the actual statute itself but right now I've seen on High Times and on Leafly and a couple other places summaries of the new regulations that are going to affect and these are definitely happening but I cannot find clear evidence on whether or not this is also going to affect medical market whether or not this is only going to affect for the recreational market or whether this is pan market and it's going to both recreational and and medicinal so I don't know I don't know if it takes what happens to all the old stock come January first if everything has to be tossed out or if there's a grace period i I have I have tons of questions left and if you are say a dispensary owner who is in the know if you're somebody who has any kind of knowledge of the cannabis law in California please hit me up I would love to talk to you on the show so we can clarify some of these laws you can email me at you can it mean weeks a tweets reviews.com or weeks reviews at gmail.com you can hit me up on twitter or facebook please get in touch with me again if you have any additional knowledge on this I would love to get in contact with you I feel terribly terribly for all of the patients that are gonna have to completely change their sort of regimen for for edibles I know a lot of patients already have their favorite edible that they you know dose themselves have everything perfectly set up to help them get you know escape their pain huh I'm I'm I'm bummed out myself um I'm not sure what what we're gonna do here a tweets we'll figure it out we'll still be reviewing edibles for sure and I'm sorry I've been away a lot recently been very busy but rest assured new reviews will be coming but as to what we're going to do January 1st we'll continue to review edibles but it's gonna have to be a change for us as well here at wheats so again guys just to reiterate come the beginning of the year the edible market that we know and love in California is going to a revocable II and in my opinion a revocable change for the worse come January 1st it's it's it's it's not going to be the this sort of great place that it was before I mean I of course it had problems the edible market like all markets had problems but I think these these new regulations are are an atrocity frankly and I hope I hope this state will we'll see the error of their ways rather quickly and and things can get back to normal but just wanted to give you guys a heads up and again if you know anybody or if you yourself know any of these laws anymore please hit me up I would love to talk to you and we can get this further clarified so guys that's going to do it for this episode here on wheats sorry for the bummer of the news hopefully things will change but for now that looks like it's the way it's going to be thank you so much for watching waits and we will see you on a future video peace", "IJZP_uqnS78": "There are many things that can damage your\nkidneys, you know... stress, drugs, bad habits, just to name a few\nbut they're NOTHING when compared to the TOP 10 UNHEALTHIEST FOODS of today's video. The foods I'm going to show you today are\nLITERALLY KILLING PEOPLE every single day. They damage your kidneys, harden your arteries,\nthey make your bones brittle. And I've ranked them from tenth to first,\nso you will know EXACTLY what to avoid. And these are common foods, things people\neat every day and that are dangerous for everyone, not just for kidney patients\nNow the worst part: many of you will see on my chart some foods that you actually eat\nregulary. If this happens, remember that it's not your\nfault. Because, you know, food brands are spending\nmillions every day to make you think that the poison they're selling you is healthy,\nyummy and even cool. And this is true for many of the unhealthiest\nfoods, believe me. So, don't get fooled and watch today's video\nto learn how to tell if a food is good or bad for your kidneys and your overall health. My name is Katherine by the way, I've been\nworking with people suffering from kidney disease for 7 years now,\nhelping MANY OF THEM finding way to eat better for their kidneys. If you are new here on 00kidney, welcome to\nour journey together to a better kidney health. Today I'm going to present you the most up\nto date guide to the unhealthiest foods. Yes, today we're looking at the bigger picture. This is why I think this video is going to\nbe interesting. As you can see, there are different colors\nin my chart. The foods on the upper part are \"to be limited\"\nor eaten in a moderated way. Those in the middle are \"best if avoided\"\nAnd those in the tops 3 are real kidney killers you should never eat. Especially the number 1. The good news is that if you stop eating these\nfoods, you can lower your creatinine and start to support your kidney health right now! So, let's start immediately. Our number 10 is not going to kill you... probably, but it's something too many people\neat EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. Number 10 Refined grains\nAnd we're talking about pasta, pizza, bread, but also the healthy alternatives brands market\nas \"whole\" and \"diet\" and \"gluten free\". So, a quick heads up for all of you, if you\ncare about your kidney health, limit your intake of anything made from refined and processed\ngrains. Like most commercial breads for example, these\nfoods are unhealthy if eaten in large amounts. Because the grains in these foods have been\npulverized into very fine flour. The result is that these foods are going to\nRAISE your blood sugar levels very quickly, ok? And that's bad. And this is true for white bread, for pasta,\nfor pizza but also for anything else made from processed grains. In fact, this kind of products will always\nhave a very high glycemic index. Now, many brands make their \"healthy\" versions\nof these foods. So, you can find whole-wheat toasts and breads,\nwhole-grain bagels... even whole wheat pizza and pasta. And, Yes, they're unhealthy too. Because they're made from REFINED whole grains.\nand that's different from real whole grains. These grains are still stripped from fiber\nand essential nutrients and high in glycemic index, just like regular refined grains. So, don't get fooled by the marketing. This is especially important if you have kidney\ndisease, because many of these whole grains have too much phosphorus for you. Also, some of these products also contain\nadded sugar and artificial trans fats. And that's bad. Now, refined grains won't kill you, alright? This is why it's the number 10 of today's\ntop 10. Just try not to eat them every day or even\nseveral times per day like so many people do. Ok, this one is my weakness too, actually. Especially pasta. I know it's unhealthy, I know I shouldn't\neat it. And what about you, guys? What's your food weakness? Let me know in comment section! And talking about weakness... number 9 is\ndeliberately marketed to exploit the weakness of many people. Scary. Number 9 Diet, low carb and low-fat foods So, I'm talking about Diet yogurts... no fats\ndairy in general, but also Low-fat candy bars or similar food items marketed towards health\nconscious people or people on a diet. Yes, marketing is the keyword here. Years and years of aggressive marketing campaign\nby food brands ended up instilling in the consumer a fake sense of what's actually healthy\nor suitable for a diet. Actually, you may end up eating the unhealthiest\nthings just when you think you are eating healthy. Example: diet yogurt. If we take a 0 fat yogurt and we check the\nlabel, we can see that there's actually no fat in it. And that may look like a good thing for someone\non a diet. The problem is that fat tastes good, and it's\nnot unhealthy either. So, they artificially removed fat from the\nyogurt and replaced it with .... Sugar. Or even worse, additives and sweeteners. We can find Aspartame, for example. It is widely used in these fake healthy foods. And there are studies showing a correlation\nbetween aspartame and headaches, heart disease and even kidney damage. But these additives are going to make these\nfoods taste good, without adding calories. A true dream for the marketing department,\nam I right? Put simply, these yogurts have had its healthy,\nnatural fats replaced with unhealthy ingredients. And the same is true for many, many other\nlow-carbs, low-fat or low anything else food items. Now, if you want to protect your kidneys from\nthe dangers of these fake healthy foods, my advice is to always read the labels, ok? Because being informed and reading the labels\nis the best way to avoid falling for marketing tricks. By the way, do you know anyone who thinks\nthat eating diet foods is healthy? Send them this video now so you share the\nawareness for these dangerous marketing tricks! Wow, this was already bad, but it's just our\nnumber 9! We're still in the green! What can be worse? Our number 8, for example! 8 Fried foods\nIf you have watched my video about the kidney killer mistakes, you may already know how\nhard is to fry something without making it unhealthy. The wrong timing, the wrong oil or too much\nheat can turn even the healthiest vegetable into a cancerous nightmare. By the way, watch that video if you haven't\nalready, ok? A lot of useful tips to cook healthy, in my\nopinion. My point here is that, even if you fry your\nfoods by yourself, with your health in mind, you still risk ending up with unhealthy junk\nfood. But if you eat deep fried foods at a restaurant,\nfor example, they probably are not gonna use the good oil, ok? And they are not going to change the oil regularly\neither, because they don't generally care too much for your health. The results? Many fried foods contain large amounts of\nacrylamides and other carcinogenic substances that form during cooking. It's not a surprise that most of the fried\nfoods you can buy are a... crime against your kidney health. Speaking of which, I cannot avoid to mention\nour number 7. 7 Fast food meals\nGenerally speaking, fast-food chains serve junk food. Most of their offerings are mass-produced\nand low in nutrients. Despite their low prices, fast foods may contribute\nto disease risk and harm your general wellness. You should especially watch out for deep fried\nitems. for example One ounce of regular potato chips\nhas 152 calories and 10 grams of unhealthy fat. And that's from just a couple handfuls - which\nbarely constitutes a satisfying snack for most of us. Now, many fast-food chains have started offering\nhealthy options, as a result of mounting pressure. This is why fast food meals is just number\n7 in my chart. This is the \"better if avoided\" category. But, hey, if you have to go to a mcdonalds\nto spend 15$ for an apple that's already sliced, a salad and some water...\nmaybe just stay home. Especially nowadays. OK, we have seen our first 4 unhealthy foods. The table is starting to tell us something. Let's see. Number 10 was processed grains, then fake\ndiet foods, fried foods and, fast food meals. There's one thing all these have in common. They're all processed foods. The more the processing, the more micro nutrients\nyou lose and the more calories you get. That's what makes these foods unhealthy, ok? Now, the number 6 is different. It is in a category of its own. And it's a really unhealthy food for people\nwith kidney problems Number 6, Milk and dairy products. Milk and cheese are not unhealthy in general,\nbut they are really too rich in phosphorus for people with kidney disease. And while many patients prefer to just avoid\nthem altogether, some still eat them in small amounts. Which is a viable option, if your phosphorus\nis under control. Now, processed cheese needs a mention by itself. Because, if cheese can be healthy in moderation,\nprocessed cheese products are nothing like regular cheese. They're mostly made with filler ingredients\nthat are engineered to have a cheese-like appearance and texture. They're high on calories and salt and sometimes\neven full of phosphates and other harmful food preservatives. So, avoid processed cheeses. Ok, we're in the top 5 now, so let's see some\nreally, really unhealthy food. 5 sauces and condiments Not all the sauces are unhealthy, ok, but\ncondiments like ketchup, ranch dressing, barbecue sauce, Teriyaki sauce, pancake sirup and most\nsalad dressings definitely are. All of these are too rich in sodium, sugar\nor both to be part of a healthy renal diet. Ketchup, for example, is up to 30% sugar. And it doesn't even taste sweet because...\nwell, just one tablespoon of ketchup contains up to 200mg of sodium. So basically, if you eat ketchup, you're just\nadding salt, sugar and a bit of tomato to your meal. And neither of these is healthy for someone\nwith kidney disease, or for anyone else. And don't even think that low carb alternatives\nare better, ok? Because, as we have seen with our number 9\nreplacing sugar with sweeteners is never the answer. So just avoid these sauces and you'll be healthier. Maybe use spices instead? Another food that you should be avoiding altogether\nis our number 4. Yes, this one is really bad I was on the fence\nif putting it in the top 3, actually. Let's see why. Number 4 Processed meat Deli meat. Sausages.. Hot dogs. Yes, these may look good on the grill, but\nthey are even unhealthier than most people think. This is what I usually refer to when I talk\nabout bad protein, ok? And while a little bit of protein is recommended\nin the diet of a kidney disease patient, bad protein should be completely avoided by everyone. As you may already know, hotdogs, sausages,\nhamburgers and other types of processed meats are made from all the trimmings and leftovers\nof the actual cuts of meat. When the meat processing plants remove all\nthe good cuts from the animal, like the chops, steaks, ribs etcetera, what remains is still\nedible. But not really good looking or appetizing. And the worst part is that sausages and hotdogs\nare even worse than they look when it comes to your health. According to a report from BMC medicine, those\nwho eat over 160 grams of processed meat per day, the equivalent of 2 hotdogs per day,\nare 44 percent more likely to die within 12 years. Processed meat consumption has been linked\nto cancer, diabetes, heart disease and stroke. And it's maybe one of the worst things you\ncan do to the health of your kidneys. But not as bad as the number 3 of my chart. Let's see. What could be worse? Number 3 Sweets! Pastries, cookies, Ice cream, and cakes\nReally unhealthy! These foods are generally made from refined\nsugar, refined wheat flour, and added fats. Shortening, which may be high in unhealthy\ntrans fats, is sometimes added. These treats might be tasty, but they have\nalmost no essential nutrients, copious calories, and many preservatives. Ice cream may be delicious, but it's loaded\nwith sugar. It's also dairy, so there's phosphorus. And if you eat it as a dessert, you're usually\npiling it on top of your normal calorie intake. Candy bars are incredibly unhealthy too. They're high in sugar, refined wheat flour,\nand processed fats. What's more, these treats will leave you hungry\nbecause of the way that your body metabolizes these sugar bombs. Yes, this is what we call empty calories. And, the number 2 is probably the worst source\nof empty calories of them all. Let's see, number 2 Liquid calories Soft drinks, colas, cokes but also fruit juices\nare a really, really fast way to damage your kidneys. Why? Because\nIf you're drinking a cup, or 250 milliliters of a soda or a fruit juice, you're ingesting\nup to 30 grams or 8 teaspoons of sugar! And that's a lot of calories, that will go\nin your blood real quick, causing a spike in insulin. That's the last thing you want, as we have\nseen. And it's even worse when it comes from a beverage,\nbecause it won't fill you up or keep you feeling full, ok?\nbecause it's void of all good nutrients like fiber and protein. So, you're going to want more in a short amount\nof time. And yes, this kills people. I'm going to be very blunt here, I know, but\nthese beverages are really dangerous. Studies show that they can lead to an increased\nrisk for type 2 diabetes, heart disease, obesity and even cancer. Very unhealthy even for people without diabetes\nor kidney disease. But if you suffer from one of these, controlling\nblood sugar levels is absolutely a must. So my advice here would be... kill the sugar\nbefore it kills you. But just don't try to replace it our number\n1. LET'S SEE WHY! NUMBER 1... diet sodas! Let's talk about diet sodas. These diet drinks are sugar free, so they\nare artificially sweetened with Aspartame or Saccharin or other synthetic substances. Diet sodas have virtually no calories, so\nthey get marketed towards diabetics, health conscious people, athletes and people who\nwant to lose weight. Seems, straight forward, right? You reduce your sugar intake and your health\nwill benefit from this. There's just a problem with diet sodas. They kill your kidneys. How is it possible? Diet sodas are full of tooth-eroding additives,\npossibly carcinogenic food colorings and artificial sweeteners. And these additives are proven to cause risk\nof stroke, heart disease, type 2 diabetes and kidney disease. Now, if this isn't bad enough, there are even\nstudies showing a direct correlation between the regular consumption of diet sodas and\nchronic kidney disease. The synthetic sweeteners, like Aspartame or\nSaccharin present in diet sodas have been proven to cause a sharp decline of kidney\nfunction in people that consumes them regularly. So, in short, there are some big studies that\nhave compared the kidney function of people who drank water to the kidney health of people\nwho drank 2 cans of diet sodas per day. After 10 years the group of people who drank\ndiet sodas had a rate of decline of kidney function 30% faster than the group who didn't\ndrank diet sodas. So, this means that if you drink diet sodas\nregularly, your kidneys are going to be damaged. This is actually pretty scary, if you ask\nme: these beverages, marketed as \"healthy\", are actually doing more damage to our health\nthat their already unhealthy sugary counterparts. So, this grants them the NUMBER 1 spot in\nmy chart. They're not just dangerous, they're also sold\nas healthy. Nothing could be worse than this. Now, if you want to know what to actually\neat instead of the unhealthy foods I've shown you today, this video may BE what you're looking\nfor. This is all for today, thank you for watching,\nsee you next Friday!", "EXdb2a3Y6ys": "- Well, thank you, Katrina,\nfor that nice introduction, and thank you to the Kansas\nSchool Nurses Association for inviting me to talk about something I'm very passionate about. As she alluded, this passion came about from my background and training, first in a dietetics degree, and then I did four years\nthinking I wanted to be a surgeon, and realized how obese children were increasing and making\nit difficult in healthcare. Then I switched for my daughter's sake, switched to general pediatrics, and then I really started seeing how unhealthy children eat\nand how unwell they were. One of my favorite questions\nto ask my patients is, \"Tell me one fruit and one\nvegetable you ate yesterday,\" and I was aghast at the\nanswers I would get, from ketchup and fruit juice to, I even had a three year old that did not know what a vegetable was. So, that kinda opened my eyes to how big, literally, how\nbig of a problem this is. That, with all that background together with that knowledge of\nnutrition and everything, that's how this became my passion. This is a thing that breaks\nmy heart for children. I think we all have an area of focus that kind of breaks our heart, and for me, knowing all the nutrition background and what the body needs, and seeing how unhealthy children eat, this is the thing that breaks my heart, so thank you for letting\nme share this with you. I have nothing to disclose. These are the objectives, which you guys should have gotten in\nthe course background. How I'm gonna try to\nreach those objectives is through this overview. First, talking about pediatric obesity, the problem, the solution,\nsome of the barriers, and then some nutrition 101, because, I don't know about you guys,\nbut in my healthcare training, I did not get a lot of\nlogistics, nutrition training. In medical school, we just learned the vitamin deficiencies and overdoses. I really didn't learn\nwhat is healthy eating, and so, thank goodness\nfor my nutrition degree. So just kinda sharing some\nthings from my background. Then lastly, going through how you guys, how we can work together in\nthis fight for healthy children. What is the problem? It is one of the biggest problems the world is facing right now, literally the biggest problem. Our children are getting bigger. In 2012, 1/3 of children\nwere overweight or obese. That means only 2/3 were normal weight, and children are supposed to be our healthiest part of our population. They're suppose to be able to regulate their intake\nand their activity, and so, we're doing\nsomething wrong as a society. Children who are obese are twice as likely to die by the time they're 55. That means today's\nchildren may have a sicker and shorter lifespan than their parents. We are not progressing,\nwe are actually regressing in health for our children,\nand that's pretty scary. This is a graph of, this is 1970, and this is 2008 statistics. Back in 1970 we had about a\nbackground rate of five percent, and that had been stable for\n100 years of childhood obesity. Just kind of a background,\ngenetic, Prader-Willi, those kinda things, and that has steadily tripled to our current rate of about 15%. This doesn't affect everyone\nthe same, as we know. Down here you can see, Latino population is twice as likely to be\nobese than the Caucasian. This has a lot of factors,\nbut it's mainly socioeconomic. It's cheaper and easier to\neat unhealthy in America. They have less activity and\nsafe activity opportunities, they're on their screens more,\nbecause of socioeconomic. Their parents are less educated, which, I mean I have a\nnutrition degree and an MD, and sometimes it's even hard for me to navigate the grocery store, so I can't imagine how\nsome of these parents are trying to navigate what is healthy. These disparities are\nbased on socioeconomic. The minority populations have\nlower socioeconomic status, and so as you see, just socioeconomic, this is the bottom\nfourth of socioeconomic, has the highest rate. The top fourth, actually\nis the lowest weight, and they're actually decreasing\ntheir rate of obesity. There's this huge disparity\nwhere this is going up, and this is going down, so our efforts are targeting, are reaching mostly this because they can afford the healthy food. So we need to work on that as a society. Where does Kansas, where\ndoes our middle of the map, where are we? Well, we're right here, and we are red. If you look, that's not very good, so this is overweight and obese is 30 to 34.9%, so we've got\nsome room to go as a state. If you look at two to four year olds and 10 to 17 year olds,\nwe rank 32nd and 31st. Number one is the ones\nwith lowest obesity rates, so this is not a thing where\nyou wanna be a high number. We've got some room to go as a state. I think polices and\nstuff need to be passed to help us with these efforts. So what is overweight\nand obese in children? Overweight is an excess body weight, and this could be due to fat, muscle mass, water, lots of things, but obesity by definition\nis excess body fat. How do we, you know, we\ndon't do climetry on children to try to figure out their exact body fat, so how do we as providers screen for this? Well we use BMI as a marker, and BMI is weight for height, so it adjusts for how tall they are because of course, the taller they are, they should have some more body weight. For children, it's age\nand gender specific, and there's growth\ncharts with percentiles, meaning if you're 90th\npercentile for your BMI, that means 90% of\nchildren have a lower BMI, and only 10% have a higher BMI. This is what we use, and the CDC has these growth charts on their website. This is for boys, aged two to 20 years. This is the age, and this is the BMI, and so you plot this, and as you can tell, the older they are, they\nshould have a higher BMI, but not too high. Definitions, underweight,\nless than five percent, but there's some children,\nespecially immigrants, that are genetically\nsmall, and that's fine, so it's just based on their,\nhow they've grown over time. Normal rate is considered five to 84%. Overrate is this BMI between 85 and 94th, and that's just really a red flag to do a physical exam and a history and figure out if that's\nreally due to body weight, or there's just some,\nI have a hockey player six year old that that's\njust lean body mass. Whereas, if they're over 95th percentile, it's really hard for a child, that to be from lean body mass, unless they were lifting\nweights or something, so most likely that is\ndue to excess body fat. Why do we care? Why do we care about this excess weight? Well this excess fat causes a lot of disruptions in\nthe body's processes. We know about heart risk factors, and I went into pediatrics because I didn't wanna treat\nhigh blood pressure but, unfortunately, I'm treating\nhigh blood pressure as early as nine, so, this\nis a pretty scary thing. High cholesterol, type two diabetes, it used to be that juvenile diabetes was type one, not anymore. I diagnose a lot of type two in children. Bone and joint problems,\ntheir bones and their joints aren't meant to hold all that weight yet. Sleep apnea, they're tired during the day 'cause all that soft tissue disrupts their breathing at night. Then, of course, these children do not have the coping mechanisms to deal with the social stigma\ninvolved with being larger, and so, this causes a lot of\nmental problems in children. Students, why do you care\nabout this for your students? Well studies show, they\nhave more absent days. They're bullied more. They have depression, so they can't focus on their work as well. Less friends, and we know how detrimental that can be to a school experience. Not only that, weight bias\nstarts when they're young. There's a survey of teachers, and teachers have a hard job, but I think it's just\ningrained in everyone's brain, this stigma, the social perception of these students as untidy, emotional, less likely to succeed, and that translates on later in life. Studies show they're\nless likely to be hired, and they earn less, so this has huge\nimplications for their future if we can help them out at an earlier age. Also, the majority of\nthem become obese adults, and we know what that does in adults. Diabetes, heart disease,\narthritis, and cancer, so as a society, this\nis a really bad thing. They project if we keep\ngoing on this trajectory, in 15 years, 50% of adult\nAmericans will be obese. Not to mention, the rise in diabetes, heart disease, cancers, economic burden from these medical expenditures, and we don't have a\nworkforce, but also society. The number one reason that\nyouth cannot join the military is due to overweight or obesity. So, how are we gonna defend ourselves? This is a big, big problem, literally. So knowing that our officials\nand our governing bodies and your association, who\ninvited me to be here today, you guys who chose this session, know that we can do something. The good news is, this is environmental. This is not something\nthat is fully inherited. This is something we can modify. We can cure this. This is reversible, and there's a goal, and there's some logistics\non the CDC's website. The goal is to get back down to this five percent eventually, and that is our ultimate goal, and there's some logistics\non how we can do that. Why, how did we get to\nthis obesity epidemic? This is like a plague, it's an epidemic. You know when a third of\npeople are having this, this is an epidemic. It's too fast to be genetic. Genetic shifts take thousands of years, so this is environmental. We have become so good at producing food. We are a burden of our own success. We've made food easy and\ncheap, and lots of it. It's readily available, more than before, and there's an energy imbalance. We've shifted more to a\ntechnological, sedentary workforce, so that creates a huge imbalance. If you look, these are\nnumbers from the USDA. This is the rate of\noverweight and obesity, and we consume on average\nfrom USDA numbers, about 225 more calories\nthan we did in 1970. But it's not just an excess of calories. Our diet has become very malnourished. This policy statement\nfrom my governing body, the American Academy of Pediatrics, about snacks, sweetened\nbeverages, added sugars, and this is actually a policy statement about the foods that are offered like in vending machines at schools. 30 to 40% of the daily energy of children is consumed as these energy dense foods, but nutrientless, so we're deficient in this Standard American\nDiet, the acronym is SAD, so I think that's ironic. (laughing) This SAD diet, has become\ninadequate in vitamin D, calcium, fiber, magnesium,\njust to name a few, so our children are overweight, but inside they're malnourished. This has caused, I think, a lot, I'm seeing a lot more\nchronic disease in my office. One out of 10 children now\nhave a chronic disease. And again, I went into pediatrics 'cause I didn't want to have\nto deal with chronic disease, but here I am, and it's not just obesity and the diabetes and the\ncomplications of that. Asthma has doubled. We all know about ADHD,\nand there's probably multiple environmental\nfactors involved in that, but it's tripled. Like I said, children are unwell nowadays. There's a numerous environmental\nfactors causing that, but nutrition is one of them. My governing body, the AAP, has come out with a policy\nstatement and recommendations, and so the following slides,\nI'm gonna present to you how we approach obesity\nprevention and treatment. This is their algorithm. First, of course, you\nhave to identify the kids, and so again, that's your BMI. Assessing, that's something I do where I take their family\nhistory, I do some labs, I figure out if they\nhave any co-morbidities. Prevention, and that's a community effort. Then treatment, and there's\ndifferent stages of treatment. They present this in their thing, and again I keep coming back but, chronic care model was not something that I wanted to be involved\nwith, but here I am, and right smack dab, especially\nfor children in there, is the school environment. They spend a lot of their time in school and so this is a whole system effort. I'm kind of over here, but there's so many other people involved\nin a children's life. Another way I think we got here is, again, I try to get to the root of the problems, and it looks like in 1970, since 1970, something has changed, and if you look, I think our values have changed. This kinda illustrates that. This is an advertisement\nfrom 1970 for TV dinners. \"There's an easier way\nto catch an early show,\" and one was like, \"Give mom a break, \"bring home Swanson TV dinners.\" So we've been told from these consumerism and these companies that, \"Oh, you don't \"have to have time for that,\nyou don't have time for that.\" And, \"You don't have to\nspend all your money on that, \"keep your money for the\nmovies or something else.\" So we've kinda been brainwashed\nto thinking that food, we don't need to spend, value food, and time and money on that, and so we've gotten away\nfrom food being a nourishment and now it's a hassle that\nwe need to do it fast, and we need to do it cheap so we can use our money for other things. I think it's a shift with our children. We need to teach them that, you know what, to learn how, cooking is\na lost skill, a lost art, and we need to go back to that, to taking the time to enjoy cooking and enjoy your food,\nand nourish your body. So to me, this is one of the root problems of how America got to this place. One thing, and it's\nnot the school's fault, they just went along with society but, it's easier and cheaper and more available to have these other kinds of foods, these nutrientless but energy dense foods. At the same time, there's\ndecreased physical activity, there's more technology, and it's more fun to do that than to go out\nand play ball anymore. To be honest, it's less safe sometimes, and less time. The biggest thing we can do is, again, the problem is in the environment, is help shape that environment to help make it easier for children, 'cause children only know what's easy and what tastes good, right? They have no insight into\nwhat is healthy for them, so it's our job to give 'em that insight into what should help them for the future. Studies have shown far reaching changes that make it easier to\nbe healthy, really helps. California prohibited sugar\nsweetened beverages at schools. They consumed 150 calories\nless a day, and that's big. Mississippi set nutritional standards for vending machines. The obesity rate went down, so these are things that have results, is changing, making it easier for kids to make healthier choices. Some of the barriers too, is that the children\nthemselves have co-morbidities we have to work around. Like I said, the asthma rate is raising, exercise induced asthma. Joint problems, it hurts their knees and their hips with all that extra weight. And depression, it's a cycle. They're obese, they get bullied, and then they just don't\nfeel like doing anything, so it's this cycle of\ngetting them motivated. One reason why, another barrier, and especially from the healthcare field, why it is hard and why there's\nso many things out there about what is healthy, what's not healthy, and why it changes is\nbecause research on nutrition and environmental stuff is very difficult. Our gold standard of\nrandomized control trials is very difficult. There's no placebo diet,\nit's very difficult. With research we do a\ncommon sense medicine, if it's proven not to harm, and proven likely to\nbenefit, we suggest it, such as fiber with reducing cholesterol. One caveat, and another big barrier here when we do this research is\nconsumerism latches onto this, like with the fiber bars. You know, he's so sad he's eatin' a salad. Oh he's happy, he's eating his fiber bar, (laughing) there's a better way to get your fiber. What happens then is, they latch onto this and,\nwas it really the fiber, or was it the fact that they were eating the fruits and vegetables\nto get that fiber with all the other nutrients in it, and they weren't eating\nthe sugar, processed foods. That's why this is such a hard field, and I get from so many parents, \"Well it changes all the\ntime, what is healthy,\" 'cause we are learning, and it's common sense medicine here. For us, another difficult\nthing, like I alluded to before, the education, the healthcare education, has not caught up with\nthis epidemic very quickly. I think it's because they're\nnot testing on nutrition, so the schools don't feel\nlike they have to teach to it, and this bipartisan white paper showed that 2/3 of Americans\nare overweight or obese, but yet only an eighth of\nmedical schools teach about it, and so there's this gap. Can you imagine if 2/3 of\npeople had staph infections and we weren't taught\nabout amoxicillin? (laughs) I think people think food is innocuous, and it doesn't cause disease. It's not a disease and it's\nnot a treatment, but it is, and so we need to catch up with this, and I think slowly it is. Now onto some pediatric nutrition 101, so this is kind of my, what I didn't learn in medical school, and thank goodness I had\na nutrition degree lesson. Again, I like to go back\nto the root of the problem, and if we go back to 1970 where we had a low baseline in overweight and obesity, this was the all American meal. I asked my dad, what did you eat? Meat, potatoes, and vegetables, that was the all American meal. Somehow we've shifted to this\nas the all American meal, and I'll show you, the\nUSDA numbers show that that pop, hamburger and french fries is our all American meal, and this is USDA consumption of food. We've decreased our fat consumption, but we've increased our carbohydrates, and remember that extra 225 calories? That mostly comes from carbohydrates and added sweeteners, and of that, 200 of that is high fructose corn syrup. If you look in 1970,\nhigh fructose corn syrup is something humans made. It was not in our diet in 1970. This is your Coca Cola, this is your pop with the all American meal, right here. Milk consumption's gone down, whole milk and dairy fat's gone down, and low fat max milk's gone up, but the problem is, we replace that with vegetable oil fats, and\nthat's in your french fries, so there's your french fries right here. I'll explain later why that's a bad thing. We are overall consuming less\nfat and more carbohydrates in the form of high fructose corn syrup, less dairy and saturated fat, but more added trans and omega six fats, which I'll show you later, so literally shifted to\nthe all American meal. What is healthy eating\naccording to U.S. Government? Well it's a diet low in refined grains, sugar, red meat, moderate in dairy, and high in whole foods,\nso vegetables, fruit, whole grains, legumes, and nuts. The SAD diet is the\nexact opposite of that, low in the things that we should eat, and high in the things that we should not. What is healthy according\nto my governing body, The American Academy of Pediatrics? Building a healthy, balanced plate with a variety of nutrients,\nappropriate portion size, nutrient dense foods instead\nof those energy dense foods, and balancing calories with activity. Based on that, the AAP\nrolled out target behaviors for us to target, and high yield points for us to make with children. I've worded, I numbered it like this because there's a hand out that you guys should have available to you. I call it my six healthy tips, where I have each one of these, and then I explain each\none of them to families, and there's a Spanish\nversion too if you need. I'll go through each one of these and kind of explain why\nthis is healthy eating. So portion size, we know,\nagain we're a burden of our own success, we have more available and cheaper food, so\nit's easier to eat more, and it has doubled or tripled. What is a portion size for children? It's about the size of their\nfist or the palm of their hand. For processed foods, read labels. A bowl of cereal, a serving of cereal is actually 2/3 cup, but we know children are not eating 2/3 a cup of cereal. Just be mindful and wary of that. Number two, more nutrient\nto calorie foods. I call this closer to nature. Which is closer to nature, a\nbowl of oatmeal with apples, or these apple clone things? So that's why I call it closer to nature. Why is this a problem? Well highly processed\nfoods are highly processed. There's nutrients taken\nout as they're processed, and there's stuff added in. They're lower in nutrients, and they have added trans fats, sodium, and sugar, even in infant and toddler food. Infants and toddlers don't care\nwhat it tastes like, right? This leads to an over desirable taste and over consumption. The job of these companies\nis to sell a product, and they're doing a good job of it. But, you can't eat just one, and they formulate the sugar\nand the fat and the salt so you can't just eat one, so it leads to over consumption. Why are we adding this to\ninfant and toddler food? Studies show that added\nsodium and sugar early in life actually changes the taste buds and the perception of taste. It sensitizes the taste\nbuds to sugar and salt, and leads to taste\npreferences, food choices, and food intake later\nin life, and I see this. My daughter, since the beginning, has eaten plain oatmeal and broccoli. She'll have friends over, and they refuse to eat the broccoli unless I put cheese on it, which is fine, at least they're eating it. Or the oatmeal, I have to doctor it up with tons of brown sugar. Because their palate is so used to those supernatural\nsugar and salt taste, that I'm sure broccoli\ntastes like dirt to them, whereas broccoli in its own\nright, has a good taste. So I've witnessed this firsthand, and we need to keep this in mind that kids are literally\naddicted to processed foods, so when we say, \"You need\nto eat your vegetables, \"why aren't you eating your vegetables?\" Well it's because they're used to Doritos, and in comparison, that\nbroccoli probably tastes, like I said, like dirt, so we have to gradually help\nthem change their palate, and change their taste buds. It's literally a pretty long process to get them back to that. Evidence, eating out of the home is associated with more fried food, sugar sweetened drinks,\nand less nutrients, so I say when you rely on someone else to make your food, they don't care if they make it healthy or not. They just want to make it cheap and fast, so that's what happens. Family meals is associated with some increased consumption of fruits, vegetables, and dairy foods, so we know if we left the teenagers all day at home, we know what they would eat, so it's important for\nadults to be present. What is the solution? Going back to 1970, more\nfamily meals in the home, more togetherness when we eat, and this closer to nature food. What's closer to nature,\noats, milk, and apple, or this apple cereal bar\nwith all of this ingredients? That's a big thing I\ntry to teach families, closer to nature. How do we teach families\nhow to make meal choices? How do we teach them how\nto make balanced meals? Well, right now, the problem, we're supposed to eat more\nof these and less of these, and we're doing the exact opposite. The rest of this information, this nutrition 101 comes\nfrom this book from the AAP. What is a balanced meal? I tell kids your body uses\nthe food you eat like Legos, breaks it down into little\nblocks, and it builds your body. It needs certain Legos to build your body. It needs micronutrients,\nvitamins, minerals, macronutrients, carbohydrates, protein, fats, it needs fats. This is a percentage of energy, and here's grams for a 2,000 calorie diet, so if you look that's still, it's still a good amount\nof fat that the body needs. Going into each macronutrient, carbohydrates are sugar,\nstarches, and fiber. They're splitted into\ncomplex and simple carbs. Complex is in it's natural\nform with the fiber, the protein, the vitamins, the minerals. Simple carbs are where humans said, \"Mmm, this white starchy\nstuff tastes good.\" (laughing) \"I'm gonna isolate this and just eat this, \"'cause it tastes good.\" So that's our product. Really the only thing that carbohydrates do for us is energy. There's a small amount, if\nyou eat fiber and stuff, that the fiber does for your body, but mostly it's for energy. We require relatively little, because we convert most things to glucose, but the brain does rely on\nit, so there's a minimum. Because it's an easy source of energy, this is the recommendation. Okay, I think this is the most\nmisunderstood macronutrient, and fat has gotten a bad\nrap in the last 30 years, so I'm gonna try to dispel\nsome myths about it, and try to explain,\nthere are different fats. There's good fats and bad fats. Every cell in the body needs fat. In children, they need fat to\ndevelop their growing brain. The brain is mostly fat,\nand so it's very important. We require fat. There's some fatty\nacids for certain parts, co-factors in the body,\nthat we cannot make, so there's a lower limit,\nand recommendation. A little chemistry, hang in there, a little chemistry lesson. Saturated fat is saturated with hydrogen. There's no double bonds. Monounsaturated, has one double bond. Polyunsaturated, there's two. Omega six and omega three, Omega six has two double bonds, omega three has three double bonds. Omega three, three double bonds. Then there's this trans fat,\nwhich humans, again said, \"You know what, I think\nthese unsaturated fats \"are better for me, but I\nwanna spread it on my toast.\" (laughing) We wanted to make kinda\nsaturated fat from these, and so we created this trans\nfat, and this is margarine. I'll show you later why\nthis is not a good thing. Little diagram to try\nto conceptualize this. This helped me. Fat is first split into\nsaturated and unsaturated. Saturated is your animal\nproducts and your coconut oil. Unsaturated into poly and mono. Mono is your mediterranean diet, so that is your olive oil, nuts, avocados. Poly is split into omega\nthrees, omega six, and trans. Omega threes, remember not\nall fats are created equal. We even treat high fat,\nhigh triglyceridemia with fish oil. This is your flax seed, your\nchia seed, your fish oil. Omega sixes, those are found, those are those pressed vegetable oils, the canola, the corn, the french fries, the processed foods. We now know that these, in high amounts, causes inflammation and heart disease. We are supposed to, as humans, we're used to eating monounsaturated and omega threes in a 10 to one ratio, so we're supposed to eat these 10 to one. We eat the opposite in the\nstandard American diet. We eat about 10 omega sixes, and very little mono or omega threes, and that leads us to a\nvery inflammatory diet, and a very, inflammation in your body, so that's causing a\nlot of chronic disease. Then there's this trans,\nagain, this margarine. We now know that this is really bad. It causes insulin resistance, central fat accumulation,\nand inflammation, so truly there is a Time magazine cover where it was like, \"Butter is Back.\" Again, with environmental\nnutrition medicine, it's hard to know, because\nwe don't have gold standard, randomized control trials, and so sometimes, unfortunately, we try something new and\nrealize human nature, er, nature is actually\nsmarter than we were. So we're kinda going back to that 1970. Why did I color coat these? Well we are supposed to\nfocus on monounsaturated and omega threes as kinda green fats, mostly we should get these. Saturated and omega sixes in the middle, and avoid trans fats. If you look, the current recommendation is about 30% saturated fat. You can still have saturated fat, this is about two pats\nof butter, 22 grams, and we can still have a little whole milk with six grams of saturated fat, so keep that in mind. Unsaturated fat, we should\nconsume most of this, monounsaturated and omega threes, and then omega sixes in the middle, so you can have a couple french fries here and there, but not a lot. And then trans fat, avoid. To me, this is one of the major things that's different from 1970. Americans are eating less fat, because there's a concern\nabout saturated fat associated with increased\ncholesterol, LDL. LDL was associated with heart disease. We are now knowing that\nthe causation in there, too much saturated fat,\nyes, can cause that, but in countries like the Mediterranean where they have low saturated fat, they eat more monounsaturated fat, like the olive oils and those things, but what do Americans do? They've replaced it with carbohydrates. We were brainwashed to think that when things are fat free, we're not gonna become fat. (laughs) So that's the misconception, and we're trying to go back\nand change that misconception. We now know that carbohydrates\ncause a lot worse things than saturated fat ever did. Endocrine problems, it\ncauses insulin release and all the endocrine problems. It causes all the dyslipidemia. It decreases HDL, increases LDL, increases tryglicerides,\nso not just increasing LDL, it causes all of them,\nand it's less filling. I think this is where we started to have to count calories. In 1970s, you ate a meal, you were full. You ate your egg and\nyour butter with toast and your fruit for\nbreakfast, and you were full. You didn't have to self restrict. And now all of a sudden, Americans have to self restrict themselves because carbohydrates are not filling. Actually, studies show that\nwhen you eat more carbohydrates, it makes you more hungry, because you get a sugar\nhigh, insulin was released, and then you get a sugar low, and it makes you hungrier\nthan you ever were, and sugar sweetened\nbeverages is the worst. It's a double whammy 'cause your body doesn't even recognize,\nwhen you drink calories, it doesn't recognize that, it\ndoesn't get full from that, so it still eats just as\nmuch as it did before, and actually more because\nof that sugar low. So this is my number one\ngoal with most children, is cutting sugar sweetened beverages. If I can do that, my\nclinic I actually have a stage one obesity clinic, I have a success rate of 30% because that's the first thing I do,\nis cut out that added sugar. 'Cause kids will regulate what they eat. It's this added sugar\nthat they can't regulate. Alright, protein a little\nless controversial. Pretty straightforward,\nwhat it does and what it is, and how much we need, 30% of our energy, about 75 grams a day. I wanted to add just one\nthing about a micronutrient, calcium here. Calcium, we know kids need it, and dairy has been, for years, touted, because it is a practical\nsource of calcium, vitamin D in the standard American diet. Counteracts phosphorus\nin soda, low nutrients. The usual recommendation\nis low fat right now, because the standard American\ndiet is so high in added fats, but remember saturated\nfat is better for you than some of those trans and\nvegetable oils and stuff. If we cut out those added fats, we can go back to that whole milk, and kids can get full again. But that's down the road. That's where I hope we\neventually go with it, getting back to the 1970 diet. You can find calcium in other sources too. Because I'm having more patients with increased tolerance of dairy, I don't know if it's the feed\nthey're feeding the cows, or there's something\ndifferent with the proteins because children are\nhaving more GI problems, more skin problems, lots\nof problems from dairy, and when I do a trial, like\na four week trial off of it, they do much better. So if you're seeing a\nlot more notes from us saying dairy free, that's why. I'm having a lot more eczema, more allergies, skin allergies, and when I take out dairy,\nthey do much better, so that's why, we're seeing a lot more. Little thing-- - [Audience Member] Can I ask a question? - Of course. - [Audience Member] When you\ntell your eczema students to take milk out of their diet, do you mean just milk, or do you include cheese and cottage cheese\nand things like that? - I typically, so the question was, if you include all dairy when\nyou have allergy patients that you take off of dairy. What I do with my patients\nis I first let them just take out, just\nexchange their dairy milk for something like almond or coconut milk or flax seed milk even, and keep eating their\ncheese and their yogurt, because the bacteria\nsometimes can break down the proteins to be more tolerable. So that way, if they have an improvement even just taking out the drinking milk, then that's all I do. If they don't have an improvement with just taking out the drinking milk, the liquid milk, then I move on to start eliminating more. It's called an elimination diet, so I start with the\nlowest elimination I can to see if I get a response, and then keep escalating\nuntil I get a response. Sometimes down the road,\nnot to get into it, but if dairy's not\nworking, then I add wheat, 'cause that's the second intolerant thing. If that's not working, I add soy, so it's kind of an elimination\ndiet that I do in my clinic. I have some integrated\nmedicine training too, so I do a lot of environmental stuff, such as nutrition, meditation, elimination diets, those things. That's a whole 'nother\ntalk I could go into but, (laughs) maybe next year. I wanted to say a little thing, and I'll talk later about sugar, and it's not your fault and hopefully the Child Nutrition\nReauthorization Act of 2010 will improve this, but keep in mind that chocolate milk has 25 grams of sugar, and that is a whole days worth\nof added sugar for a child, who is already eating pop\ntarts and those kind of things that have, and flavored yogurt, so I consider it a sugary\nbeverage just like soda and juice, and we'll talk about juice later too. The government solution to this, and I'm a little wary of it,\nis doing artificial sweeteners. Because kids are not drinking\nthis white milk anymore, again because their taste buds are so used to that super sweet soda flavor, that milk just tastes like dirt to them, whereas when I was a\nkid, milk was a treat. So unfortunately, we're\nhaving to do these things to get kids to even drink milk. But, I worry about artificial sweeteners. Studies show that it increases the overall sugar consumption, because it's like snorting fake cocaine. When you drink artificial sweeteners, the brain thinks it's gonna get it, and then it doesn't, and\nthen it craves it even more, and this is why diet soda has been linked with obesity and more sugar consumption, because the brain then wants it even more. There's brain affects from\nthe artificial sweeteners crossing the blood brain barrier. Microbiuoe affects, so it\nactually kills good gut bacteria. In mice, when they feed\nthem artificial sweeteners and then they test their\ngut biome, it's worse, it has more pathogens in it, so we need to just keep those in mind. Again, to me the solution\nis going back to 1970, and just having plain milk. Yes, question. - [Audience Member] So\nit is better for a child to drink the chocolate, strawberry milk to get the vitamins and the calcium, or, not having milk at all (mumbles). - Yeah, so the question was, is it better to have them drink the flavored\nmilk than no milk at all. My answer would be, if children just had white milk available, they\nwould eventually drink it. - [Audience Member] We talked\nabout taking flavored milk out at lunch, and replacing it. Whenever for some reason they're\nout of the flavored milk, we only have the plain milk, milk consumption goes\ndown at lunch, and so, I guess making the change, over time-- - Hopefully they would get used to it. One of the schools that I talked to did, is flavored milk on Fridays only, and I think that's a good compromise, and they even monitored, you know, if you drank your white milk, and I hate to reward with food, it's not really rewarding with food, it's more of create\npositive reinforcement. But if on their card,\nthey drank a white milk Monday through Thursday, then Friday they could get a flavored milk. So, there's ways, and I think\nof this like an addiction. When somebody's stopping\nsmoking cigarettes, maybe they have to use a\nNicorette cigarette for a while, or chew gum for a while,\nuntil they get used to not, you know, 'cause it's a habit, it's a habit to drink flavored milk. So sometimes there's some\ntransitions we need to do before we get back to 1970. I worry about some of the solutions that are coming around with\nthe artificial sweeteners, but thanks for that question. This is what goes through my brain with, I had to take all the\nbiochemistry there is in undergrad and medical school, so these are all biochemistry pathways that your body does, and each of these dots are co-factors. When I hear the diets of children, Poptarts and french fries and coca cola, I think, how the heck is\ntheir body still going? How are they getting\nall these little dots? It just breaks my heart. I explain it to children that you need all these little Legos, like when you're building a Lego house, if you're missing one piece,\nthen you can't build the house. Isn't that frustrating? Well your body needs all those Legos. How do we tell families? 'Cause they don't know all these pathways. We give them templates, and this is where my plate comes in. I made my own, which also\nshould be available to you on the website, based on\nthe Harvard Healthy Plate. Because I'm having more dairy intolerance, I don't have dairy on there,\nI have calcium rich foods, and I've added healthy fats on there and little pictures that can help kids. And some other things that can help is starchy vegetables in\nthe carbohydrate thing, so this is kinda how I\nconceptualize to families to help choose their meals. Logistics, you know,\nhow do you do all this? Well, this is an example\nof my daughter's day. It can be done, with proper preparation. Whole grain wraps, and snacks with veggies and peanut butter and stirfries and stuff, that's kinda logistics of how\nwe do it in our household. Physical activity, pretty straightforward. They're having less activity,\nand more inactivity, so the recommendation is, more\nactivity, less inactivity. Getting through the barriers\nof how to get there, again, it's environmental,\nhaving safe places, having programs, having\nthings for them to do instead of screen time, so that's an important part. I do wanna give a caveat\nhere too about a myth. I have some families\nthat, with all of this, all these programs of Get Fit, or Play 60, and all these programs, and Let's Go, it gives the stigma that\nobese people are lazy, and they already have that stigma. Yes, activity's good, and\nyes, they should be active, but that's not all of it, because the average American eats this many calories of added sugar a day, and you would have to\ndo this much exercise, and no one's doing that every day. And so these kids, they are, I had one kid that was swimming on swim team every day, and she still wasn't losing weight. It's because she was eating\nall this added sugar, and you can't work all that off, so that caveat that it has\nto be both of them together. Okay, fruits and vegetables,\npretty straightforward. Literally the healthiest\nthing people can eat, the most nutrients per calories, and literally the least\nthing that people eat. The average kid has two servings a day, and this includes juice\nand french fries so, pretty scary, pretty scary things. What's the solution? Every meal and every snack,\na fruit or vegetable. I tell my kids, even if\nit's two baby carrots with your handful of chips, something to get those\nbuilding blocks, those Legos. Little caveat about juice here, it's just the squeezed\nout water and sugar, and yes there can be\nsome vitamin C in that, but remember to make a\nglass of orange juice, it's about six apples that are squeezed, and apples have about\nfive to six grams of sugar in each one, and when\nyou eat the whole apple, you get the fiber with it, which slows down the glucose absorption. So I consider juice a\nsugary beverage, 'cause it, remember, what do we treat\nlow blood sugar with? Orange juice.\n(laughing) We know it raises blood\nsugar really quick, so I wanna give that caveat in there that it should be not\nan everyday kinda thing. - Audience Member] I have a question. - Yeah. - [Audience Member] What\nabout flavored water? Like when you (speech\ndrowned out by static). - Yes, so she asked about flavored waters, even taking fruit and flavor 'em. That is a good stop gap, again, it's like the Nicorette gum, because, unfortunately just like white milk, kids don't like water anymore. Plain water, where, in it's own right is so refreshing and tastes so good, but kids are so brainwashed and their palate is so sensitized, so it's a good stop gap. I try to stay away from\nartificial sweeteners, so there's a lot of\nflavored waters out there that have artificial sweeteners, so I do encourage them to do the flavored waters where\nthey take strawberries, or watermelon, or whatever\nand put it in the water and let it kinda dissolve a little bit. 'Cause at least, it's not\nsix apples being squeezed and made into a juice. At least it's like three\nor four strawberries that you get that flavor out\nof it, so great question. Sugar, I think this is\nthe most high-yield thing that we can talk about with children because it's one of the biggest things that have changed since 1970. This is empty calories sugar, not the sugar naturally found in fruit, because a couple reasons. One, there's fiber and vitamins with that that slows down the\nabsorption of the sugar, but second, nature is smart. Nature limits the amount of sugar. Like I said, an apple has about six to eight grams of sugar in it. Humans made things supernatural, right? We like, \"This tastes good, we're puttin' \"26 grams of sugar in this.\" (laughing) So nature limits itself in a serving. There's usually not that\nsupernatural amount of sugar in nature and in nature whole food, in one serving of it. The average American eats 22 teaspoons, or 90 grams, or 360 calories, and the kid eats as much sugar in the first eight years of life than we used to in a\nlifetime a century ago. This is not good for the human race. If you look at children,\nthis is all children, in adolescence, their number\none source of calories is grain desserts and soda. Soda I could talk a whole\nconversation on that, but soda is pretty much a poison. Phosphoric acid leeches\nthe body of calcium. It changes the--\n(audience member sneezing) Bless you. Changes the PH in the blood, it does a lot of things to\nthe brain, it's just awful, and not to mention the\nsugar, the caramel color, the additives, the preservatives. The only thing healthy in\nit is water, I tell my kids, so just drink water, please. This is scary, that this\nis the number one source of what are contributing to kids' diets. Why is sugar a problem? It tastes good. Wooh, it's really bad in the body. It causes insulin release,\nso it's a metabolic thing, and this is where calories\nare not created equal. Yes, carbohydrate, calorie to fat calorie, but carbohydrate calories\nsecretes insulin, which causes a lotta\nmetabolic disarrangements in the body, and imbalance. Triglyceridemia, high blood pressure, it causes a lotta bad things. It causes fat deposition,\nit's a storage hormone. Increased adiposity,\ndyslipidemia, high blood pressure, it reduces, has reduced nutrients with it, inflammation, remember\nthe problem with diabetes is glycosylated end products, which stick to molecules in the body and cause inflammation and\nwhite blood cells to come in. So when you have just sugar, you know, drinking your orange juice, and you get high blood sugar, this inflammation's gonna occur. Cancer, we test for cancer with PET scans, which is a radio labeled\nglucose monitor, molecule, because we know cancer feeds on glucose, that's what it eats to grow, and so when it takes up a lotta glucose, that means that's cancer. So when we're chronically\nfeeding cells in the body that potentially could\nbe cancer with sugar, we have an increased cancer rate. And cardiovascular mortality, so saturated fat's been\nlinked with high LDL and cardiovascular disease. Sugar is actually linked with mortality from cardiovascular disease, and that's because of all\nthese things, inflammation, high blood pressure,\ndyslipidemia, hyper-insulinemia. It's pretty much a poison, so why do we still eat it? Again, it not only tastes good, but it tastes good because\nit causes dopamine release. Rats will preferentially\nchoose sugar over cocaine. So I say to families, there's a reason your daughter is throwing a fit for sugar, it's because it's more\naddictive than cocaine. And, when you get that insulin release, then you get that sugar low, and that makes you crave it even more. It's pretty much an addiction\nthat our children are having. The American Heart Association, based on that cardiovascular\nmortality study, showed that people who\nconsumed less than 10% of their calories from added sugar, had a lower cardiovascular mortality, therefore they recommended no more than 100 calories from sugar. Each gram of sugar has\nfour calories in it, so that's about 24 grams. Four grams is in a teaspoon, that's usually eye opening to the kids. I actually, when I go\naround to schools and talk, I take a kitchen scale, and\nI measure out a teaspoon of sugar, and it's four grams. It's not four granules, it's\nfour grams is a whole teaspoon. So 24 grams is six teaspoons. If you look at a lotta your products, like this is a flavored yogurt, it has a whole day of that added sugar. I don't know about you,\nbut when I was a kid, yogurt tasted bad. (laughing) It did, my mom had to force me, so now it tastes like\nmelted ice cream, right? There's even cheesecake\nkind, and key lime pie, it's basically a dessert now, so be aware of that. How do we take all that,\nand again, like I said, obesity is preventable and treatable with environmental modifications, but what is the treatment? What is the prescription? Well, it's identification\nof target health behaviors, and influencing families\nto change those behaviors to healthier behaviors, despite an environment\nat the present moment that is easier to be unhealthy. So that's our difficult task. This is not a diet, I\ndo not prescribe diets. I prescribe healthy lifestyle change, for permanent healthy lifestyle\nhabits, that is our goal, setting little goals at a time to improve. Usually my first goal is the sugar, to decrease that. The treatment, there's kind\nof different modalities, and we go along the treatment as a kid needs more and more escalated treatment. The first thing is to motivate\nchange within families, and there's lots of ways that we do this. Literally we're breaking addiction. Like I said, lots of\ntimes there's stop gaps, like with flavored waters\nand those kinda things, where we have to get them over and their palate desensitized\nfrom all that processed food. Pharmacologic, not really in children much to decrease their appetite. It's mostly in children, if\nwe change their environment, they'll choose, most often they'll choose the healthier things. If that's all they have, I tell\nparents, they won't starve. If all they have is water and white milk, they won't die of dehydration, I promise. They will eventually,\nafter the fits are over, they will eventually drink it. But, it can be a tough period while they're going through this, you know, withdrawal basically. They throw fits, they get upset, it's pretty tumultuous for a family, but very important to\nget through that period. Then when they start feeling\nthe positive effects, like they have more\nenergy, they're happier, they're less... Then they start, it really kicks in. There is metformin we use if\nthere's hyper-insulinemia, to kinda break that cycle\nof that hyper-insulinemia and that highs and lows. Surgery is a last, last resort, because that does not solve the problem. The problem is mostly in here, where it's a habit to eat unhealthy. That's where our\npsychologists really help us, because these children\nhave emotional eating. Sugar makes them happy. Then there's definitely the\nstigma, with the bullying and everything, the depression\nthat they're dealing with, so this behavioral component is a huge part of the treatment. So in the office, how do\nI do this with families? I use something called\nmotivational interviewing, that I'll talk about later. You try to see what\nstage of change they are, and you're basically\ntrying to progress them along the stage of\nchange by setting goals, monitoring behaviors for change, reinforcing, positive reinforcement, and reinforcing the goals,\nnot the weight change. I just want them to get healthy, honestly, and get off the sugar. Don't reward with food, but I know I talked about the fifth day, on Friday, having chocolate milk, (laughs) so sometimes it's a balance, but what I don't want\nparents to do is say, \"If you eat your vegetables,\nyou get your dessert,\" because then it shows that\ndessert is a desired end result. Then expect back fall. Habits are something that your brain, has in their brain, to, things you do often, you don't wanna have to\nthink about every time, and so it's a habit for them to reach for the Poptart, for the thing, so for a while, they're\ngonna have to think harder to bypass that, to get the oatmeal. But after a while, that\noatmeal becomes a habit where they don't have to think about, so it's just getting them\nthrough that period of time, changing those old habits to new habits. Problem solving barriers, and that's huge, and that's where we can work and collaborate as a team to help solve those barriers in the environment. Now a little bit about\nhow you guys can help, and how we can work together. I'm not a school nurse, and I know it's gotta be a difficult job, to be responsible for\nthousands of children, so kudos to you and\nthank you for all you do. I don't wanna sound like any of this is blaming or anything,\nactually I took most of this from this tool kit, which I\nhope you guys have access to. This is a great tool kit, and I wish we had this for\nthe AAP or something but, this is amazing. There's logistical letters in there, there's templates, there's stuff online, so I highly encourage you\nto take a look at that. And most of this information is from this. So, why you guys? Well, most kids in America\nsee you guys, 52 million. More of them see you than\npediatricians sometimes, so it's very important, and you guys have the healthcare background\nand the expertise, and you have the respect of the community. When my daughter comes home, nurse Nee, I don't know if you guys know her but, you have Rachel Nee is my\ndaughter's nurse, school nurse, so when my daughters come home and say, \"Nurse Nee said,\" I respect that. I think we as a community\nand students respect that, and peers and staff at\nthe school respect you, and so you have a unique opportunity and gift to be able to help that. And, if we focus on\nchildren early in life, and this is where we're trying to advocate with policy makers. I know children don't vote but, (laughs) they're our future, so\nwe need to make polices that involve them, because\nif we intervene early, we reduce their obesity rates, and the longer we wait, the harder it is. And I'm knowing that the older we get, the harder it is to stay\nhealthy and to stay... So if we catch them\nearly when those habits are less ingrained and\nthey're developing habits, then we can make a huge difference. Also, 31 children get\ntheir meals through school, and the majority of their meals, because unfortunately\none out of four children are food insecure, and that's really sad. Childhood poverty's on the rise. Our income and equality, and\nthat's a whole 'nother lecture, our gap is just increasing. The rich are gettin' richer,\nthe poor are gettin' poorer, and it's effecting children a lot. One outta three are overweight or obese. When they're food insecure, it doesn't mean they're starving. It just means that they're eating the really cheap food\nthat's not healthy for them, so they can be overweight because they're eating that energy dense food, and the school lunches\ncan give a good role model for what they can do. (audience member mumbling\nin the background) Yeah, and I know there's so many barriers, and I know time and money's a huge one, and I'll get into that. But I think it needs, hopefully needs to trickle down, but we can do what we can and I'll show you some things\nthat we can do together. What has been proven in\nschools to actually help is curriculum, so education. You know, kids aren't born\nknowing how to be healthy. It's our job to teach them. They're born knowing what tastes good, but not what is healthy, so\nit's our job to teach them. The food supply, and\nthat's what you alluded to, that we get needs to improve. Environment needs to improve, and support for teachers and staff, 'cause they're looking at us. Increased physical activity opportunities, and education to the family, so when they go home,\nthe family knows too. Big point here, none of these studies show that the interventions\ncause negative effects. Once again, environmental medicine is based on common sense medicine, where if it hasn't proven to harm and it's proven to likely\nbenefit, we recommend it, so really there has not been\nproven harm from education. As long as we focus on\nthe health benefits, and not cosmetic things, there's no harm with teaching kids about\nhealthy diet and being healthy. So, one of the starts,\nand back to the AAP's identification, prevention, and treatment, first step is identifying these students that need more help, and the intention is to\nfocus on the health risks, not the cosmetic things. Surveillance is anonymous, and that's for, like state or community surveillance, but screening is to identify students. This, typically needs to be done with caution, to inform parents to take action afterwards. It's recommended that\neach child over age six be screened yearly for obesity. Hopefully that happens with a\nwell child check every year, but a lotta times if there's no vaccines, then it's hard to get them\ninto the office unfortunately, but we really encourage. I had a kid yesterday, a teenager that hadn't had a well\nchild check in five years, and she had severe scoliosis, so it's not just, and you\nknow, it's no ones fault, it's just, it's access to care. And the earlier that we can\npick some things up, the better. As far as schools doing this, it's a cost versus benefit ratio for each individual school and community. One thing about screening is, when we screen something,\nwe have to be able to do something about it, right? There has to be some\nkinda referral option, or resources for families\nwhen you do find them. And assurance of privacy\nand confidentiality is an important part of this too. A big piece of this is a system. You can't do this all on your own, so having a system in place is big. This tool kit has actually\nsome good templates and some good systems in there. How to conduct screening, and again, I don't do this, but I got\nthis all from here. (laughs) Advance, I just wanted to\nparaphrase this for you guys, so this is a paraphrase of this. Notifying the families is important, communication is key, so that way that kid doesn't come home and say, \"Nurse so and so scheduled, did this,\" so advance notification. For BMI, you basically\nneed a height and a weight, and then the CDC growth chart, and there's templates in here for letters that have the growth chart on it that you can send home with families. Acanthosis is something,\nand this is caused by hyper-insulinemia, so this\nis when they're way gone. They're down, they\nactually need treatment, 'cause insulin's a growth factor, and it causes pigmentation. It stimulates pigmentation change. The important thing is,\nis to have them bend one way or another, and\nactually what you're looking for is actually the white lines,\nbecause then that means, it's hard to pick up, if this\nkid had his head straight it'd be hard to pick up\nbecause it just all looks dark, but it's those white\nlines that are important. This handbook talked a lot about screening for blood\npressure, and again, this is individual, community,\nand school preference. My preference as a pediatrician would be, I assume this would be very difficult to do in a school setting,\n'cause I know just in my office, it's very hard for the nurse\nto get the right size of cuff, to get the kid to stay still, to get a good reading, and\nwhat to do with that reading, 'cause blood pressure you have to plot for age, gender, height, percentile, it's kind of a complicated plotting, and although I know you can do it, I assume it'd be very\ndifficult in a school setting. And when they have\nelevated blood pressure, they're probably gonna have elevated BMI, and acanthosis before the\nelevated blood pressure, so typically, hopefully they come to see a healthcare provider\nbefore it gets to that. You're welcome to, and\nkudos to you if you do screen for blood pressure, but I assume that would\nbe difficult to do. So you have to interpret\nand communicate that to family, what that actually means, because you guys are the expert. You're the healthcare expert, and parents, a lotta parents I'm surprised they don't realize that\ntheir kid is obese. But I think this is why,\nthey see them every day, and so they see the gradual change, and they don't realize what's going on. I don't know, that's supposed\nto be easy to understand. (laughs) So when to make referrals, this handbook talked a lot about referring if they're greater\nthan 85th percentile, if they have family history of obesity, and this and that. My preference as a healthcare provider would be any BMI greater\nthan 85th percentile, so that way we can go through it in a more in-depth assessment of them. Definitely acanthosis, and\nI would really encourage every child to have a check up every year, so we can pickup things early. Having that on the handout\nthat you send home, please do see your physician every year, or healthcare provider every year. There are programs, there are\nstates that have done this, and the big thing is, is that, there's less opposition\nthan you would think. As long as you do these things, advance notification,\nfocus on the health risks and not the cosmetic results, and keep it confidential, that's huge. There's tips in here on\nprocesses to do that. In Arkansas it's a state\nmandate for nine years, and they've seen a leveling\noff of their obesity rate. Again, because they're not coming to see their healthcare\nprovider every year, but they see you guys every day, so that would be awesome. I wish Kansas would help with that too. Another big thing is prevention, and one thing on that is in\npromoting a health environment, having school policies on things. Just being an advocate in your own school. Role modeling's big, I remember, I went and talked to a\nclass and the teacher had a Big Gulp of soda on the desk, and as I was talking I could see she, startin' to put that Big Gulp\nand hide it under the desk. (laughing) I guess it worked, but... I tell people, it's not anyone's fault, and if anyone out here,\nit's our fault as a society that we have not taught our\nsociety members this stuff, and that we've let\nconsumerism run our life, so it's no one's fault. Again, I have a nutrition\ndegree and an MD, and it's still difficult\nfor me, so that's big. 'Cause the students notice,\nthey look up to role models. The treatment part, how\nwe can all work together, and this handbook talks about\nindividualized health plans, and I'm sure you guys know what this is. I'll talk about the individualized health plans in a minute,\nand the big thing is to set goals and to help with barriers, whatever barrier we can get through. Community resources,\neducation, information, helping with co-morbidities\nto try to control those, because if their asthma's not controlled, they're not gonna run around at recess, so that's important. Individualized health plans,\nagain verbatim from here, just wanted to summarize what it is, and there's an example in the tool kit. It's just a written plan for goals and how to reach those goals. Motivational interviewing,\nthis is a difficult thing for healthcare providers,\nbecause in training we're taught, you know,\nwhen we talk to families we're the expert and we\ntell them what to do, but that doesn't work\nwhen it comes to change, to lifestyle interventions. We have to put it on them, they have to want to change,\nand the way we do that is this thing called\nmotivational interviewing, and it's such a different\nthing for healthcare providers that there's even courses and apps, and the AAP has one called Change Talk where the mom has a\nlittle red line above her, and the more you talk down to her, the more it lights up, and\nyou're trying to get her to have green above there,\nlike she's open to it. The big way I do this,\nI start off with that, it's not your fault, it's\nour fault as a society, you know, it's not your fault, and I think that really\nopens them up a lot. Just listen, and ask questions, you know, \"What do you think about your health?\" \"What do you think about\nyour diet choices?\" Get them to think. \"Well what do you think\nyou could do better?\" \"Instead of this Coca\nCola, what do you think \"you could drink instead\nthat would be better?\" Kinda puttin' it more on\nthem as much as we can. Advocacy is the deliberate process of influencing those who\nmake policy decisions. This doesn't have to\njust be with government, this can be within your own school, within your own community,\nand there's some tips on how to be effective with that. Okay, barriers. We all run into these, right? The big one is money. It's cheaper and easier and I know schools are strapped for money, and we're doin' what we can\nwith our vote and everything, but we're having, people are not realizing how important it is to\nintervene at an early age, and how important children\nare to our future. But, there are things that can help. There's foundations, the\nCadence Health Foundation. There is government advocacy we can do, and there's grants we can get. Local PTAs, fundraising\nto get a salad bar, or this or that. Time, I know you guys\nare covering more schools and doing more things and have more kids, and are required to do\nmore and more things, but I just urge you that, to make obesity a priority. I know you have a bunch\nof rules and regulations, but if you have the time and if you can with your principal and your policy maker to make this a priority, because it's effecting\n2/3 or children, or 1/3, so we should really make it a priority. Cultural things, keep in\nmind that different cultures see weight and health as different things. That's why I try to focus\non the health benefits, instead of, \"We need to\nget your weight down.\" I usually talk about, \"We\nneed to get you healthier, \"so you don't get diabetes\nor heart disease.\" \"We need to make healthier choices \"that reduce your risk for diabetes,\" so trying to focus on those things with some of those\ncultures can be important. Liability, and I'm definitely not a lawyer and definitely not, but this\nis verbatim from the tool kit. FERPA and HIPAA, so from this tool kit, I think FERPA applies to your\nrecords more than HIPAA does, because you are hired by the school, but still you have to keep them private, and even talking, this surprised me, talking with fellow staff,\nlike teachers and principals, err on the side of caution and getting parents' permission for that, so that was unique I thought. You, we can talk, about a\nkid without parental consent. I know that, a lotta healthcare\nproviders do not know that. I try to spread the word\nas much as I can, but, feel free to communicate. E-mail can sometimes be the\neasiest way to get a hold of us, so I urge you to find out e-mails of your local healthcare\nproviders and phone numbers, and never feel bad about contacting us. I will do anything for a\nchild, so I'm happy to help. Now the caveat here is, as long as we're talking about something about a treatment plan for that kid in your school, that affects your school, but since this is such a\nsensitive issue with parents, it's always better to\ncommunicate with them, and I heard somebody say that they, when they sign, they\nsign a HIPAA and a waiver at the beginning of the school\nyear for all the students. I think that's a good way to go, because I don't want students\nand parents coming in, and I'll be like, \"Oh I\ntalked to nurse so and so,\" and the parent being surprised about that. I don't think, there's\nno liability in that, don't get me wrong, but I think it's always better to\ninform all parties involved, that there's communication\ngoing on about their child. So I think that's key, that\nwas the take home message I got from reading in this tool kit. - [Audience Member] I have a question. - Yes. - [Audience Member] I'm hearing you say that in your practice, you're engaged in kind of a team approach\nto childhood obesity. - Yeah. - [Audience Member] The\nbiggest, the biggest barrier I have are really (mumbles)\nwho are gonna need, the parents are gonna need to be involved, they're gonna have to follow\nthrough with the care plan, they're gonna need\nrespectful intervention. If you don't happen to\nhave that team approach in your community, it's\nvery hard to refer them out, and feel like you're not just referring them into a black hole. - Right, so she made a comment about some communities not\nhaving healthcare providers that have this background and have this ability and want to intervene\nand do a team approach. I can understand how\nfrustrating that can be, and so unfortunate as a medical, the medical system has failed obesity. It's not caught up and not helped enough, and unfortunately there's\nsome providers that, you know I had to learn most of this either from a nutrition\ndegree or on my own, so it's no one's fault. It's our fault as a system and\na society that we haven't-- - [Audience Member] Even\nif the doctor is wanting to spend that time, proper\nreimbursement is not supported. - Yeah, so you talked about\nreimbursement and supporting, and that's, again, a system barrier. I can get around it. I usually find some\nactual medical diagnosis, and that's why I do labs a lot. I draw an insulin level\neven if they're not fasting, to show that they have\na hyper-insulinemia, that way I can bill for\nthat hyper-insulinemia. We're trying, the American\nof Pediatrics is trying and there's actual obesity billing CME's and those kinda thing, so we're trying, but feel free if you\nhave healthcare providers that you think could\nuse some help with that, I'll give my e-mail at the end of this and I'm happy to share information. I think it's always,\nand there's an example of a waiver in the tool kit. I think communication's always better. I don't think we would be held liable, I don't think so. But, I think it's always better, and when I'm called from a school nurse about something specific,\nlike asthma or obesity or something, I'm happy to talk with them but I always request that\nthey tell the parents that we've talked, so that way, again, the kid doesn't come into\nmy office and I'm like, \"Oh, I talked to the nurse.\" 'Cause parents don't like\nkids to be talked about, you know, stuff to go\non without them knowing, and I understand that. Alright, so good, thank\nyou for that clarification. That was good, I learned something. Logistics, from my standpoint, big ways we can work together, what I see. One, if you can help\nscreen, if it's something in your system you're\nable to do, thank you. If not, please, I don't know, send home letters or make sure, at the beginning of the year, that waiver, there's a big bold, please\nhave a checkup every year. Parents think, unless\nthey need vaccinations or it's a new school,\nthey don't need a checkup, and that's so unfortunate,\nbecause it's so important, so I would advocate and\nreally encourage that, somehow to get onto your beginning of your registration\npaperwork or something. That would be really helpful. Communicate to families\nand healthcare providers, we're a team in this\nenvironmental approach. I have my canned letter that\nI send home with families to take to their school nurse when I diagnosed a kid with obesity. Just as, there's an obesity action plan just like an asthma action\nplan, that sorta thing, so that way we're all on the same page. A big thing that we can all\nhelp with is environment and these can be little things. I know there's big policy things, like the milk and those things that need to be worked on, but little things can\nmake a big difference. I've had multiple examples, and again, it's no one's fault, 'cause I can't imagine dealing with thousands of kids day in and day out. I had one family where discipline was taking away recess for an obese kid, and I had to write a\nletter, you know, run laps, something like that as\ndiscipline, something different. - [Audience Member]\nThe other side of that, - Yeah. - [Audience Member] Is\nthat the kids will be bad in the classroom, and the teachers will assign them exercise.\n- Yeah. - [Audience Member] Which\nconnects activity to-- - That's true, yeah, I\ndon't know which is better. She said sometimes assigning\nlaps for bad behavior equates exercise with bad. That's a good point, a valid point, but I guess I'd rather\nget them moving than not. Or have, this is a good\none, if they're good, if they get a sticker\nevery day or whatever, at the end of the week,\nthey get open gym time or something like that, extra, extra movement time. And if they're bad, yeah,\nyeah it's difficult. I know, again, you guys\nhave a very difficult job, because you're sending\nmessages to children for the rest of their lives,\nso that's very difficult. So drinking the chocolate\nmilk and the juice at lunch, allowing the kids to take a\nbottle of water for lunch. Most kids nowadays have a\nbottle of water on their desk, and letting them take that\nto lunch can be a good step. Like I said, everyone's\nconcerned about the calcium and vitamin D in the\nstandard American diet, and I realize that, if they\ndon't drink the plain milk. There's lots of other sources of calcium, and I tell all my patients to\ntake a multivitamin every day, so that way if they\ndon't get what they need, there's like a little assurance in there. The vending machines are a big factor. My daughter, I've taught her from the beginning what is healthy, and her first day of\nmiddle school last year, she came home and said,\n\"They sell Monster drinks \"in the vending machine.\" (laughing) And her eyes were just\nlike, \"Mom, my friends \"are buying Monster drinks,\nand drinking Monster drinks.\" So, you know, I made a phone call. (laughing) (clapping)\nThanks. It's no one's fault, again because, it turns out, they actually\nget money from Pepsi and stuff to have that there, and this all blows my mind. The system is so broke. Anyways, I know that's difficult, but there's fundraising options. Whole Foods has a salad bar grant. There's all kinds of things\nout there if you want to. I actually run, in the elementary school that my daughters don't go to anymore, we do a gardening club where they grow some vegetables and stuff, and I bring in extra if\nthey don't grow them. (laughing) So we can have carrots\nat the end of the year. Wooh, you grew that!\n(laughing) Good job! There's ways around it\nbut, we do what we can, and then, this is a big thing too, rewarding with the unhealthy food. My daughter would come home and say, \"We get a cupcake party\nat the end of the week,\" or an ice cream party, or a pizza party, or snow cone machine comes,\nor cotton candy machine comes at the end of the week. Again, it's that rewarding thing. Let's do extra recess,\n(laughs) or something. Little things like that,\nwe can encourage our staff and just educate. So lots of resources out there. Local resources, we have\nlocal farmers market that takes SNAP, it actually doubles SNAP, so your SNAP counts for\ndouble at farmers markets, it's awesome. Take home message, I think\nthis is the number one problem. I think it should be\nour number one priority. Environmental changes with sugar\nand highly processed foods, and help join the fight. Lots of people helped in my teaching. My two best friends, one of them's an integrative medicine\ndoctor from residency, and one of them's a\npediatric endocrinologist, so I get a lot of knowledge from them. Please feel free to contact\nme if I can help in any way. I'm happy to help. This is an example of a healthy lifestyle questionnaire I use. It's from the AAP and the 5210 Let's Go. It's pretty quick and easy. Alright, do we have time for, maybe? - [Audience Member]\nYou have three minutes. - Okay, one or two questions, yes. - [Audience Member] Is\nthere a specific brand of multivitamin that you would recommend? - Yeah, she asked about\na specific multivitamin. I say to parents, whatever\nthey will take. (laughs) I let them take a little bit of sugar, a little bit of red number 40 or whatever, if it means that they're\ngettin' their calcium and vitamin D, so I say at\nleast 800 of calcium a day, and at least 400 to 600 of vitamin D. Those are the most deficit that we have in the kids' diets right now,\nis calcium and vitamin D, so that's why I focus on that. I have some kids that only\ntake chocolate chewy vitamins, and some, you know, so, I lean towards, you\ncan get unnatural stuff if it's just in a little\nvitamin, and you get vitamins. Benefit to risk ratio, yeah. - [Audience Member] This handbook that you were talking about, where exactly can we find that? - I think, yeah, Katrina\nprobably is able to answer that. - This tool kit is the\nSchool Nurse Obesity, Childhood Obesity Tool Kit. It's available from NASN,\nso if you log on to NASN, or just search, Google search NASN, it'll come up National\nAssociation of School Nurses. Go to their bookstore,\nthere is a decreased rate if you are a member, so you get a reduce in\ncost if you're a member. - [Audience Member] What's\nthe name of the publication? - The School Nurse\nChildhood Obesity Toolkit from the National\nAssociation of School Nurses. - It comes with a DVD too. - [Audience Member] From 2015, is that like the second edition? It's hot off the press. - Yeah. - [Audience Member] It's 42\ndollars if you're a member, and I'm guessing 52 dollars\nor so if you're a non-member. - And it has a wonderful DVD, that you have all your forms on. (laughs) - Yes, that's awesome. - [Audience Member] Can you xerox it as many times as you want to or what? - Yes. - [Audience Member] Okay. - Don't tell anybody, but yes. - We didn't hear that.\n(laughing) Yeah I, again, kudos to the\nSchool Nurses Association. This is huge, because\nthat's another barrier, is there's stuff, resources\nall over the place, so having it in one spot, is amazing, and I'm currently working\nwith the Kansas chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics to do something like this,\n'cause this inspired me. I was like, we need this. Alright, well, good luck,\nand thanks for all you do to help kids.\n(applause)", "KOtZ3v8t3s8": "plus five and everybody boys I hope my neighbors are at home but I'm sure that they are boy we finally get late in today's video I feel so awkward right now I don't know why but welcome back to video hope you guys are having an amazing day today and if not I hope my video is able to make your day a little bit brighter I'm super duper excited for today's video I not only have half a blind I'm so butthurt you guys I have shout out to King palms send me more because I thought that I was too cool for school and that I didn't like hemp blunts and that I only like tobacco blunts but after smoking so many tobacco blunts and getting like headaches I [ __ ] with the king poems and so I try to like stuff it and I had it ready and when I was walking out here to set up my little filming it broke in half like literally in half so lively and as type [ __ ] I got a little Roach first a smoke and then I also got a bomb muhfucka a drink this is so refreshing you already know I got that double cup because honey Google today is a multiple game for toy edible loot bag video oh yes we've heard it here part two part two the first thing I pulled out is this rice krispies treat this is what it looks like I don't think the cameras focusing on it but looks like this this is one of my favorite edible but I feel like rice krispie treats and like treats like this like cereal bars I feel like they never hit me awhile back I went to dabba thon and I bought a 400 milligram at a bowl and it really didn't do much to me so yeah I have eaten this before in a my part 1 video but it was by a different brand I like to try all kinds of different brands and none of them seem to hit me too well but they're super super tasty so if you're more in it for the taste these are both then I got some soft beat thugs I never tried this brown before so I'm SuperDuper excited I love trying new brands of all kinds of different things and especially freaking edibles so in my part 1 video I had some different brand of chips so where is pretty much the same thing wheat hot cheetos and these have a hundred and fifty milligrams in this whole bag this has 500 milligrams so you got a great fight I also got oh my gosh I am so excited for this you guys these are sour belts candies and I love blue raspberry like flavored candies like airheads the blue but skittles the blade skittles is a happening but like anything blue and this is blue so I'm really I'm really stoked and I've heard from a lot of people that these were really really bomb so they hyped me up they hyped me up when I went to go get this stuff I was hyped up to try this because I guess you only eat one or two strips and you get super high but I have a high tolerance so honey a 300 milligram one or two bites is not gonna do me justice but if it tastes bomb I'm with the ships and then this is more my style you already know we might beat us this is a freaking la lucha that lon mmm okay so I really want you to this like right now okay I also got for the last but not least you guys oh by the way this has a hundred and ten milligrams so a little bit over 100 milligrams my everything really so last time we did a lemonade edible for the drink in the first new thing and then for this time I really needed to freakin go in with the 1200 milligram THC syrup because I've tried to CV syrup I've tried codeine I tried it all you know and I even tried filming a video trying this but in the fruit punch flavor and YouTube decided to delete my video so you know LBD famine stoppable honey and I came back with a great flavor so when I went to the dispensary and they had grave I was like put back on my shopping list cuz I gotta try so I'm really hyped up for this honestly like I'm pretty pretty pretty pretty hyped it's 1,200 milligrams this is the most potent edible I've ever seen on the market and that I've ever consumed you guys have seen probably my previous videos of me eating a thousand milligrams brownies trying to do my makeup and all kinds of different things and I really am NOT a fan of brownies and you know I like the rice krispies treats but they just don't hit me as hard you know sour belts are bomb but I usually like little gummies or something but something like there's like a beverage gets you so [ __ ] up you guys if you ever want to try any of one of these edibles please try the syrup do yourself favorite so I'm just gonna hop right in by mixing up our syrup because I'm just so hyped so I have my double cup my my sprite with my sprite and yeah oh actually I'm gonna take a thumbnail damn taking it thumbnails kind of hard okey-dokey well I literally could wake up the whole neighborhood anyways step yeah just so you guys know like what time it is it is 12:30 exactamente 12:30 exactly so let's see how long it takes for these edibles to hit why don't we first gotta you know consumed that no mm-hmm so I have this syrup I'm gonna just shake it because I bet you it's been sitting for a minute make sure you shake that hole nice and dandy Wow look at the cap it looks like th season there alright I'm gonna show you guys up close personality wait it off when you have no groups and you don't want a nip slip it's kind of a brown I wish it was a prettier shade okay so I used a lot I don't know if I'm gonna like this one I'm licking the syrup and taste a great I don't know okay so a lot of people like to come at me like dest you swear like you're sipping lean Jaime its [ __ ] syrup same base okay therefore you're supposed to make like I want my [ __ ] to be mixed honey mixed Loki I'm making a mess [Applause] pretty mother [ __ ] bomb I can literally see the THC in my soda like it kind of looks green like if I wish you guys could see it but it literally looks like wax on my ice it looks good though it doesn't look like what the [ __ ] is in my cup it looks like ooh that's bad again me so so far so good you guys I would give this syrup a 10 out of 10 if I had to pick one edible that's like my favorite edible technically it would be the syrup because [ __ ] bring your spray whether you're going to [ __ ] Six Flags [ __ ] Disneyland like no I'm just kidding I don't know if you're a lot of bringing drinks to Disney but sticks legs I know you're allowed to bring your own drinks honey so best believe I'm putting this in like a little canister my hydro flask I actually just recently ordered a hydro flask for college and I guess I have a six like season pass so if any of you guys are trying to go please hit me up cuz I ain't got no homies to go with and I'm fine I bring this Sara you know pour up and a hydro guess you popular okay um I don't know should I smoke or should I eat the rest of the edibles this is a mute thing I guess I should just use edibles you know I have to try that you guys I I've been dying to try these hot cheetos like I said I've tried different brands and other Browns were bombed on fire so let's see if this Alito's friends compares hmm ooh smells like like a [ __ ] spicy cheese ball with a little bit of weed it doesn't really smell like weed though that's what it looks like got a [ __ ] hot cheeto this [ __ ] looks like our normal hot cheeto it tastes just like the other ones hmm these ones were a little bit cheaper cuz the other ones I tried were 300 milligrams these are only 150 milligrams so less potency the artist Lee is still super bomb hmm smoking a blunt eating your chips and then sipping your [ __ ] lien just kidding tasty syrup it doesn't get better than this you guys like Yuki a highest [ __ ] by sipping this this tastes so good it tastes like a grape flavored sprite I love it I kind of want to add more syrup you added to do it just so I could be like really [ __ ] up you killed me cuz this is 1,200 milligrams like the big if I wouldn't take any of the other edibles and I just drank this I would be dead I would be dead but the fact that I'm eating this and I'm eating edibles like Wow I never even added up the amount of milligrams that I'm consuming but let's see 150 the syrup is 1200 I probably won't drink the entire bottle of syrup because I want to mix it also in this sprite I'm going to a family party later at a pool best believe I won't be chilling by the pool with my sprite so later I'm gonna finish the rest of that but right now I'm putting like just the perfect amount I actually added a lot more so I'm gonna mix it so 1213 50 and then the rice krispies is 500 milligrams so B 1850 and then the sour belts these are three hundred so that'll be 2150 yeah and then this is a hundred and ten oh my gosh oh honey wait twenty one fifty plus one ten twenty one fifty plus one and 21 carry the one twenty to sixty right I'm already feeling it now I'm just getting back right am i right I believe it's around 20 160 so 2,000 160 milligrams that's insane other thing mmm and these chips are so bomb if you guys like to medicate but like microdose EPS look like a sandwich and you'll be chillin won't I'm obsessed with these chips homie bomb but else is gonna say oh yeah somebody tried commenting in my other neat thing video saying that Oh a thousand milligrams ain't [ __ ] that's equivalent to one gram honey honey honey let me just sit my soda these are spicy I got the extra flamin hot ones they had regular hot ones and I got the extra hot superbomb um honey what the [ __ ] you talking about 100 1000 milligrams is one gram I'm not trying to call you out or anything much love to you but you have nothing but good intentions but that's just insane hundred milligrams is equivalent to one grab so eating a 100 milligram edible like this most likely since its 110 they used about a gram and a half maybe probably less than that excuse me they probably used about a gram to make this to make this now they used a hundred grams to make it a thousand milligrams but it's actually more than a thousand to this 1200 so there's more than that for this 300 milligram edible it's around 3 grams do you feel me you feel what I'm feeling so yeah 500 about 5 grams so as a human as a [ __ ] Union who smokes every [ __ ] day you know once I get to the first second balloon I'll be chilling so it's about 4 grams in you know the third blender mice so that's around five grams of weed so evening around 500 milligrams of an edible will get me pretty chilling but like I said the Rice Krispies don't usually hit me but that's why it 100 milligram edibles don't really hit me because if I only smoke one blood one gram I'm not gonna get that high cuz I have a high tolerance but for someone who never smokes and eats even 20 milligrams of an edible will be super fun but you know it's not always about the number it's kind of about well what's your what's your past like what's your what's your tolerance like have you tried edibles before did you smoke a lot but you've never tried edibles like yeah oh okay so I'm trying to open these and I'm super excited to try these these are the styler belts damn if I can even open it wrong it smells like cotton candy let's try it I know that flavour rx makes some like these I mean my sister tried I may really like them hmm sour I don't like sour candy but I did it for the bike for the milk bank drop them on the floor five-second rule hello wrong number wrong number the [ __ ] why you calling my phone yeah so I was told that if you eat one or two of these you'll be [ __ ] up so I'm kind of gonna save them so I can eat one or two and see if I get [ __ ] up but today I just wanted to try them out and they're pretty bomb you guys like they don't taste like weed at all none of these edibles so far it tastes like weed I hate edibles that tastes like weed I've gotten hate in my past videos where I eat the 1000 milligram brownie because people are like why are you gagging so much like it's not even that bad the honey of course you're not gonna [ __ ] know because you ain't the one eating it but when I was eating it it tasted like I was eating weed and that [ __ ] tastes bad you know this it tastes like I'm eating a [ __ ] airheads and I get high smoke it was so that shit's pretty tight same with the chips it tastes like regular hot cheetos you know it doesn't taste like I'm eating them a nug so I feel like that's really important when it comes to edibles it's just like at least for me personally is like one is it gonna get me [ __ ] up - is it gonna taste like [ __ ] cuz I don't care if it gets me [ __ ] up if it tastes like [ __ ] tastes like [ __ ] and I don't care if they taste bomb if it doesn't get me [ __ ] up you know that's again [ __ ] up so this is the little logic become behind the life beam des and me picking my edibles knees are pretty bummed I like the blueberry I like the flavor it doesn't taste like weed aiyo there's a little hit of an aftertaste but not really stay what's on my Cheetos you know like you're gonna get those little aftertaste but it's not bad at all if I could tolerate it you could part ollar a because I have a really bad like if it tastes like weed I won't eat it I'll give it away straight up and that's right today I didn't buy any brownies because brownies and cookies no matter what Brad how potent it is you know I've eaten the thousand milligram IV the 100 milligrams from the best friends from kirova to enjoyable - lol edibles like I tried it all and I'm just not a fan of the cookies and brownies especially because when you make a fresh batch of cookies at home how long do those cookies taste bomb for you guys for the first [ __ ] five minutes that those cookies come out the oven after 5 minutes those cookies taste like hard [ __ ] breaks and they're not bomb same with the [ __ ] edibles they're gonna have it in the refrigerator for months weeks months years and then you're eating it and it's hard and it's just it's not like a fresh bomb [ __ ] cookie so until I find a company who makes a bomb cookie that's like super potent I'm gonna stay away from the baked goods I really like these though these are really really really good really good and I'm not a fan of sour candy I'm not a fan of candy I have a sweet tooth too but I have it in a way where like I crave hot cheetos I'm not one to crave chocolate or sour candy and like skills like every time I go to the gas station I don't buy candy I buy water and chips super spicy chips and water so I don't I don't pass out I want to spark my blood already but I still have two more edibles to try freeze so I'm gonna try this one I'm super excited for this one this says Tama reand oh so this is a tambourine dough you guys if I ever have a me angry I'm gonna have a pinata and it's gonna be filled of these you know let's give it a gander my shirts already [ __ ] up this should taste like [ __ ] there's like a bunch of the product in the cap like that's already my 50 milligrams right there homie the [ __ ] this edible is too messy honestly it's not even that it tastes bad it's just that it's so hard to eat pbbbbbt I remember being little and thinking that was so fun to like push up these like normal candy I says it has sugar chili THC extract caramel citric acid I'm an enol egg corn product that's so weird I don't like it I'm kind of like like I don't know it's kind of like when you think about it it's like yeah like caramel and like what else did you see corn acid the [ __ ] Beach I bought this for you guys honestly I thought that maybe you guys would want to see it and it was like unique and it was cheap so 300 milligrams but honestly I don't really [ __ ] with it I wouldn't buy this to be like Tiki I wanna get high like no [ __ ] I'd rather just buy a topic rather by the sour Bell just cuz that's so much easier to eat like this it's already coming out from like the bottom right here it's all over the cap okay you guys have one more edible to try and that is this Wow crisps

these guys be sure to thumbs up the video if you guys liked it and I majored a little bit brighter [Music]", "u0-QK0hJKIo": "hey everyone it's tech crazy today's video is going to be a review for deep space it's a cbd i think let's check it out um thc 10 milligrams and thc one milligram so it's not too too strong it's not a very big can um it comes with all packaged up as you can see it's all sealed up and i'll put all the details and stuff anything they have on the page on it where i got it um any information i'll also take pictures of the camp for you guys ladies and gents are not just guys ladies and gents it's not like a male only product so um i'll let you know how it is um i'll go ahead and open it right in front of you i'm gonna drink it right now actually for these um when i do the reviews for them i will jug them um i'll try to drink them in one shot and then what i'll do is i'll get back to you when i feel the effects have kicked into the full amount and i'll let you know how they are i'm also going to let you know how the taste is um how well it goes down now this thing you just kind of drive it like that you pull this little tab up like so and then the whole thing comes off i'm pretty sure like so yeah it snaps so you snap the top off okay i'm going to clean my top my can i imagine it is clean already but as i always do this yeah these things okay so i'm gonna go ahead and open it up um looks like it's a little bit of fizz um it looks like um a can of coke and it has fizz it smells like cherry coke so this is deep space once again it tastes like cherry coke with a little bit of rum in it almost it's got a really uh kind of like medicine cough medicine taste to it [Music] it's not strong it's got this taste to it it tastes horrible it tastes good but it tastes horrible i like cough medicine i'm halfway through [Music] hey sorry man hey baby i'm here flavor um i've i've had pretty bad drinks before this is not too bad i guess the cbd you kind of taste kind of tastes like half the flavor up the taste is really nice other than the cbd uh so it's just like a can of pop cherry cola i'd say um i probably shouldn't have joked it but whatever i'm gonna do it for the reviews it's always deep space once again this was like under five bucks i think this one wasn't too expensive so i'll let you know how it goes uh i'll get back to you maybe in a half an hour an hour all right bye everyone's tech crazy all right i want to finish off the deep space review so you can see it um pretty good um it was a little bit more expensive than i thought it was eight dollars plus tax it's a uh so it's all right i found it very relaxing um it made me hungry overall it made me want to go eat um my back was hurting so i drank it and i found my back pain kind of went away but it made me more hungry than anything that was about an hour and a half ago i didn't go eat yet i felt the hunger kicking about a half an hour ago and it was like uh i could go eat at a buffet type of hunger so it made me hungry uh no pasties really but like smoking but it made me hungry and uh i had a little bit of a head brush when i first drank it i think uh within the first half an hour not much a little bit it might be because i'm a paraplegic but i got a little bit of a head rush and uh for eight bucks i'm gonna give it four stars four out of five um if you like cherry coke you're gonna like this deep space it was really nice i'll add all the information the company name everything that i got it from in the video too thanks for watching you", "M957dACQyfU": "we've all seen these pictures in\nmagazines, on the internet, everywhere of people going from a certain physique\neither fat or really skinny to a very muscular physique. Most of the time it\u2019s very\nhard to believe that a certain supplement or maybe training program can\nreally make you do the exact same thing if you follow the exact program. Now\nbefore I get started, I just want to make it clear that the pictures that I\nshowed had nothing to do with his video.  I want to make it perfectly clear that the\nphysiques that were altered or were transformed in those pictures may have actually been the result of the\nprograms advertised. The reason I'm saying this is because I simply don't want to\nget sued by those people. Now without further ado, I\u2019m going to show \nYou how I went from this physique To this physique in less than five hours. Now the first\nstep in this video is to reverse the process. That's right we're going to do\nthe after picture first and the before picture after. So here we go! First thing that we have\nto do is go to the gym. Make sure you do as many bicep curls, triceps push downs,\nand chest presses. Make sure you are as vascular humanely possible. Next,\njump into a tanning bed and get as  tanned up as possible. you want that vascularity to show\nas much as possible. When you\u2019re all done with that tanning bed, go straight home and set\nup some really good lighting in your basement. Now to prove that this video\nreally is legitimate I'm showing you the date on a CNN website when I take the\nafter picture. here it is Now grab a dumbbell one more time and really\npump it up just so you have that extra vascularity before you take your after\npicture. Next grab a bottle of PAM. that's right, that good old cooking\nspray and spray the hell out of yourself now you\u2019re all shinny.  Beautiful. Get ready for a your after picture. there's the after pictures, not so\nhorrible but we can make that better with a little bit of photoshop Not a huge difference but still a very\nnoticeable difference. Now that the after picture is done we're ready to do the before picture, the\nfun part. For the before picture we want to put ourselves into a fat blob\nmindset. Take two hours off you worked hard to do those after pictures just\nrest up and then make sure that vascularity  is disappearing. Grab some canned Beefaroni. Make sure it's\nreally high in sodium, we're really trying to retain that water. Grab a bag of chips and \ndown all of them. get kettle cooked, they got extra oil and salt\non them. Next step, grab yourself a bottle of pop A two liter bottle or even more is preferable. \nA diet pop actually works better because it has more carbonation,  therefore making your stomach even\nbigger. When you're done with your pop grab some chocolate milk this shit will bloat the hell out of you after\nthat diet pop. Believe it or not you're ready to go. once again I\u2019m showing you guys the date on the CNN website which actually\nshows less than a five hour difference between the two shots. You can see I look\nfat as hell compared with the other picture  so without further ado let's take a couple\nsnapshots there you have it guys check out my before and after picture\nnow five hours apart that's pretty crazy what you can do with your body and with a little bit of\nphotoshop. I just wanted to show you guys that anything is really possible in this\nworld nowadays and don't believe everything that you see with your eyes. Once again\nthe transformation pictures that I showed you guys earlier have no\nreflection really on this video just showing you guys examples of really\ncrazy transformations and ya I don\u2019t want  to get sued. Let me know if you liked\nthe video and don't forget to subscribe like and fav this video bye!", "g4tHSckLfGk": "[Music] [Music] only thing i care about is living life the best i could only want to

and i gotta say it's definitely uh blowing my expectations away i would say that i'm pretty picky when it comes to like uh delta you know cards and edibles and disposables uh and this one definitely um almost i would say that it's just like a regular delta nine card because it gets me pretty [ __ ] baked so speaking of that let's go ahead take a hit off this this is what it looks like man very sleek like you know they really did a good job with the packaging the brand the way it looks they tried to go for the cookies look i kind of see so i respect it but they'll never hold up to cookies in my opinion but i definitely wish them the best obviously but cheers boys we're going to take off this i have to be careful not to hit this too much too big because um delta really makes me cough i

bit of like kush terps honestly men they definitely got that flavor down to a science uh and you can see on the side it uh shows how much juice you have left which i really appreciate um because you never know when it's actually done until you start like tasting a burger hand but you're at least gonna know we're um they have obviously a bunch of other flavors i just picked this one because i was pretty much put on the spot with it and rush and anytime i'm usually put on this whenever i like buy something if they're like you want this one i'm like sure um but i would almost be willing to try another flavor man um if this video you know let's try to get 40 likes man if this video gets 40 likes i'll that'll let me know that you guys still want to see more delta videos more delta reviews um yeah i'm already getting kind of high off this man it's not like obviously like a delta 900 it's not like super psychoactive uh but it is very calming and very relaxing and my body feels really like

disposable um love the packaging love everything about it love the taste my girlfriend really likes this she even has been spoken on this a lot and says it really gets her to the you know that right high that she wants so yeah i mean i'm not sponsored i'm not telling you to buy it i'm just telling you that this is a good brand if you are looking for disposable pots it has a light down here to let you know like uh that you're hitting it i don't know if you could take a blinker on it i tried it when i first got it in the other video and i literally coughed for 10 minutes so i'm not really trying to do that again it also has a k right here i don't really know what that means but [Music] i mean it still looks really cool uh yeah man i mean i don't really have much else to say about this this gets the job done you will get high smokiness um well i can't fully say that you will i do and i feel like it would definitely get most people high because i spent a lot of time tonight um it's a
