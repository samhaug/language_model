medical marijuana patients this is Florida medical marijuana reviews showing you today 9 pound hammer true leaves own indica dominant strain coming in at a whopping twenty two point seven total THC it is beautifully coated completely in trichomes and terpenes that we're gonna try to show you up close and personal today with our macro lens this my friends is truly a beautiful batch of flower I mean there has not been a caliber of flower like this that I have seen yet though I did just scoop some Girl Scout cookies and white buffalo that actually is just as frosty but just as pricey they all came in at 53 dollars an eighth those 3/8 all being 53 dollars an eighth range from total percentages of THC from as low as 19% all the way to 26% they're all just as dense just as frosty just barely smelly not crazy smelly not punching your face deliciously smelly so I truly don't know how other than just pure amounts of trichomes and the density that they've priced their particular eights other than that I have no idea that's truly an assumption because to me the puck yeah coming in at 21 and a half percent THC is just as powerful just as potent just as great as all of those other four and yet it's a 33 dollar eighth I just don't I don't see how they're doing it other than just maybe a dice roll or a guess or some guys just picking and choosing to make these beautiful trichomes on this particular strain they had to take an indica GU berry a hybrid Hel's OG and a sativa Jack the Ripper to cross completely to make this nine pound hammer strain and these beautiful trichomes all over this plant are just evidence of the handiwork that they made at this genetics lab to create this strain when it's ground up is when I actually got notes of a citrus smell at all but before that just sitting in in the 8th container it's not very pungent but it is still a delicious smell but it's more grassy maybe earthy - anything more than citrus or sweet like I've read that it should be or even fruity I believe is somewhat people have said the strain can be as far as medicinally it knocked it out of the park for what I need an indica to do I was able to sleep I felt great all over my body from being sore from boogie boarding and kayaking took that care of all of those problems so I thoroughly enjoyed the strain I felt like it was delicious it smoked very well it was cured very well it ground very well it was everything I needed it to do but again I could love a lower price tag so I do not think I will come back to the 9 pound hammer I'm going to go back and stick with something more affordable like the puck yeah that does just as well and just as much and just doesn't quite have the eye-popping stunning trichomes and dense structure that everyone wants to pay I guess 53 dollars for 1/8 so that is how I feel about the 9 pound from true leave it is great I like it if I were richer I'd buy it but right now I'm looking at something more affordable down the line but other than that it's a great indica strain and thanks for watching Florida medical marijuana reviews you", "b3jxqpRXE54": "[Music] this time pound hammer if you ever oh my sighs oh my sighs take this camel

and then wife and husband combo huh Thanks proof from this rose jinx proof genetics hi good to see y'all and we also run a 501c autism charity in the state of Washington that's cool yes yeah we're always out collecting because we we donate iPads to nonverbal autistic children so they can find a way to communicate with the outside world and it's through the cannabis community that we are able to get all these donations and then we link into different universities in Washington State also to help find people who are in need tell me are you designing these strains for specific uses medically like for example autism some we have a high CBD strain that I believe is good for autism we really designed it actually for our veterans if a vet comes up to our booth today and lets me know their event they get a pack of it free we call it too many after the 22 many foundation the the suicide prevention for soldiers foundation and uh yeah that's i mean we've we've created some magnificent strains nine pound hammer when the michigan cup just a month ago but I mean our passion and the thing we're most proud proud about is helping autistic kids so we've done we do raffles all the time we've probably close to raising a hundred thousand dollars there is no community as giving as this committee when we first started we hit up like big businesses and [ __ ] we couldn't squeeze blood from a turnip as soon as we started cruising around the marijuana community BAM it's a big family absolutely giving family caring family absolutely everybody he's been super nice to us to talk to us and if we dig it we dig it ed let me ask you this tell me about your your strain like is it a sativa dominant indica dominant like what does the plant look like is it tall huge we have a several strains actually but the one that when the cup is a nine pound hammer it's a it's a pretty good sized strain it usually kind of will turn on maroon kind of purple it's super heavy foot super stony like I'm a glassblower I don't smoke lamb pound hammer unless I take my weed to my torch it's otherwise like magically my recliner pops open and my tv turns on it's like it's that kind of weave we have many sativa as hybrids and we have the menues down here you know all of our different strains one of the things I'm really into is creating limited-edition strains so I'll do small batches once they're sold out I'll never release them again it's just kind of fun to have keep a mom of them maybe or a clone if not I always at least set aside a package you know like 100 seeds for myself some tissue samples maybe in a petri dish somewhere freezer because even though I won't read breed limited editions I will breed them to other things and stuff like that so yeah I kind of got that yeah and I kind of got that collector gene into me so that's kind of where that limited-edition how I did it I did it I have my own collection of seats and strains myself few strains out there that I'm not a hater like they're absolutely bomb but they're almost like Budweiser now like you know every person here got the cutting of it cookies Girl Scout cookies yeah a little too much of that those are bomb strains I've even bread to go gorilla glue to my hammer cookies also you know but like say it's just nice to have something everybody has a cool hybrid it's a really cool hybrid and it's easy to grow I'll tell you that I think that's why a lot of growers like it but you know I like to change it up a little bit like let's get some like really long lanky sativas with these little tiny buds but they're like super powerful super packed but you don't I mean a lot of times people don't want to grow that way because they're going for you wait wait wait so anyways it's cool that connoisseurs and growers let such as yourself can still you know develop those types of strains and bring those to light which I dig yeah we were I really enjoy it so we started out with TJ sub cool after about seven eight years it was time to go on turn on so we're our own company now Jenks group genetics underscore jinx proof on Instagram if anyone wants to check us out well we'll put that on our link to this particular video and also if I can mention we do have a North West family for autism Facebook page and you can make charity donations there if you are interested or see what our upcoming events are to what you can be part of and we are a legal 501 C we're not just some dudes collecting money cuz you know you never really knows where it goes so you don't want to get audited as a charity like they cut it like there's a dollar miss and then you can't show where it went they come down hard so but but I like that because it shows that we're legit and that the money is going the appropriate places and also and another thing all y'all that haven't seen my Instagram every day one thing I'm really known for almost more than my strengths is every morning and every night I do a positive affirmation video and I put it up and I put a little riding there and controlling the vibrations huh most people that will come up here today that want to meet me or shake my hand that's usually what it is is they want to thank me for the positive videos and that it helps them not realizing that it helps me a lot too so check that out if that's is it Americans are programmed every day you know with the stuff that they see on TV it's cool to reprogram yourself so that you can actually take a little bit more control of what's going on with your you know your direction right deprogram exactly exactly you know with all the crap on you know social media and stuff like that it's really fun putting something nice out there and getting a positive response I can feel good about you guys company like I feel better you know it's cool that you guys are doing something good we will [Music]", "nfOj1tFgELU": "oh the videos yo what's going on guys welcome to the video today today i'm going to be reviewing the indica rso from true leaf so i went to my local true leave and i picked up some indica rso um i really wasn't sure what the strain was but i pulled up the batch results which will probably be on the screen here somewhere and it actually tells you what strain um the rso is derived from so that was good you find this rso pretty much at any true leave and it only goes for about 50 a pop i believe that's actually the cheapest in the state so if you're looking to budget for the week and you want a good amount of doses for what i feel like is a cheap price then you should definitely cop this rso so i actually was really happy when i found out that the strain was dry for a nine pound hammer because that's one of my favorite indicas that i can really get at truly just for the effects that i get from it for sure the thc wasn't too high i was coming in at 69 but then again i'm not really huge about thc percentage i feel like all the cannabinoids and then the entourage effect is really important aspect of the medication that i buy so i always make sure to ask and look into that kind of stuff before i even decide to purchase it so i'll pop that up on the screen here the other cannabinoids in the total the cbg is 2.633 and the cbn is 0.789 this is actually a triple clock this strain is actually a triple cross between goo berry hell's og and jack the ripper gubiri isn't berry goo berry is an indica dominant hybrid and it's known for its munchies it's helped with insomnia and it's really good for pain hellzog is also an indica dominant hybrid and it's best known for its ptsd insomnia pain and inflammation relief jack the ripper on the other hand is actually a hybrid and it's best known for its uplifting and stress and anxiety relief some even say that it could help with depression as well you know us over at couchlock news believe that the terpenes and other cannabinoids are the most important part of the plant thc percentage is but a little part in that we think every part of the plant can help and with that let's go into the terpene profile so another reason i love nine pound hammer is because of the fact that it really helps with my pain relief and my lower back pain you can really credit a lot of that to the carriephylline inside of the strain data suggests in many studies that carry ethylene is very well known for helping with pain some say it's even similar to the effects of a painkiller for those of you maybe even coming off painkillers from a previous surgery or anything like that if that's something that helps you medicate that's the terpene you're looking for the activation of the cb2 receptors by the kerathylene also helps with the anti-pain but not only that protects the brain from disease as well coming up next on the list we have number two and that is humulene so humulene is known for suppressing hunger but actually it is very well known for its anti-inflammatory effects its antibacterial effects and its anti-tumor effects it occurs naturally in things like clove basil and other greens and for number three we have lineal linoleum is known for its floral aroma so linalool is known for its floral aroma and it's relaxing and sedating effects it's actually one of my favorite terpenes i genuinely look out for it a lot and i think it's a perfect top off to any indica these three terpenes combined give nine pound hammer the perfect effects for me for insomnia pain relief and a great night to watch a movie and then go to sleep right after so now onto the effects of the rso i would have to say that these are some great effects for pain relief i have a lot of lower back pain and i know i'm young but i had an injury when i was playing football when i was younger and ever since then my back has just never been the same i'll make sure to put the batch number on the screen somewhere throughout this video i'll put it up again right now for you guys it'll be somewhere on the screen so my preferred way of dosing rso is i like to get about two hershey's bars and make like a rso sandwich i'll put point two on the back of one and then close the other one on top and then i just eat it this just gives me a way to accurately dose my rso without losing any in the cooking process so for the effects on the nine pound hammer i'm going to have to give it a 9 out of 10. i'm a huge fan of this stuff it really just gets me the medicating effects i need and it's honestly probably one of my favorite indicas in the state right now i'm very happy to have this in rso form right now and i'll probably be going to get another all right guys i'm going to wrap the video up here thank you so much for watching please press like please press subscribe for the low low when no love goes women but your buddy like has been laced up i really hate love from a stranger [ __ ] is fake stuff", "L1TIQaIV_8Y": "what up YouTube welcome back welcome back its king Luke 4:20 here if you're new here welcome this is my channel

reviewing a 9 pound hammer and then the THC on this is 18 7 which is pretty good nine hammer I haven't heard good things about this that's cuz I don't know just people it's expensive it's 53 for the 8th unless you get the minis which is 27 I got this mini sis the only reason I got it cuz 53 is kind of expensive for an 8th my friend said that the 9 pound hammer the high doesn't last long at all it's like a 30-minute high compared to you know other stuff which is like it's a lot longer than that well we're gonna go ahead and open this y'all that looks really amazing super green let me see the buds they're kind of fluffy they're not super dense so it looks like a lot for the8 you know it looks amazing for the bad stuff I heard about it smells really good it's got a skunky smell a little bit of diesel smells really good a nice earthy smell we're gonna go ahead and taste this in the new pipe here it's got a real good smell this is supposed to be like a energetic high supposed to be for your head mmm tastes really good I don't know if it worth the 53 for the 8th cuz that's kind of expensive like I mean I guess it always is well there's got real light smoke almost non-existent it's real good I mean I don't really do long enough videos to tell you how the high feels but I mean better than crescendo but at 53 dollars I don't know if it's worth it huh but I mean if you got the money to spend I mean might as well try them all see which one's your favorite I personally wouldn't buy this on the regular the only reason I doubt it's cuz of the minis 27 for the 8th at truly it tastes really good like I said the smokes like non-existent it's not it's not heavy at all not harsh on your lungs barely makes you guys we can show you this one more time it's a real light like

to buy him aloha elevators", "oGjZATwZdSs": "hi there welcome to another one of my videos and thank you for taking your time to watch it I also want to thank the new YouTube subscribers and the new Twitter followers welcome to the family let's get right to it today we're going to check out the indica strain 9 pound hammer from true leave and Tallahassee I paid 53 dollars for this eighth and this harvest came in at 17.2% THC this eighth had very nice size and dense buds which were green with an abundance of ice on them the smell is of sweet and spicy pine a unique hard to describe scent and the flavor itself is too unique to this try and describe too many different hints of flavors together but not a bad flavor at all now on to the effects the effects start with a river of inner joy that had me dancing while the hammer was swinging backwards picking up speed that leads to a way will calm and serenity that swept away all my stress and anxiety I had which I imagine is when the nine pound hammer was swinging back towards my head then boom the knight pound hammer gets me upside the head and took my pain away full body and muscles are completely relaxed eyebrows low like each of them weighs 9 pounds each the 9 pound hammer did what it was born to do and make me tired and sleepy that sleep was hard to fight so I went to sleep and slept like a baby for the whole night can I work on the strain only am i Colossus and in this strange case I limit myself to one or two hits of my bowl every couple of hours during the work day in reality in because that are this strong are not meant to be used during work hours I reckon with this strain for after work through the end of the night youth I hope this helps you medicate right have a great day", "1PwwKxUL0AA": "all right welcome back everybody purpose of this video is to try to teach people how to determine female seeds for male seeds okay if you have feminized seeds they're female don't even try this okay so this is this what I learned a long long time ago I wouldn't say it's exactly 100% because it's up to you know your own discretion so there's a lot of human interference in there but it's about 90 95 percent accurate if you actually are really like really a you know quality controlled about I was gonna say anal whatever but you know if you're really anal about it and you really really really only go for strict strict looks then you can pull it off 100% okay but this is what I come up with okay the female seeds look look a lot like this okay and if you see these seeds here see how they have like a little top to them okay now if you were look to look on this top you'll see a perfect circle where's my camera okay you'll see perfect circles it kind of looks like a little volcano maybe something like that oh look what I just found out guys so my cameras over here but when I put things over here it gets blurry when I put things over here they become clear oh you look nice I can work see how blurry though we did just remember that when you guys are trying to show stuff you put it right in front of you camera is blurry if you put it over there look how clear so so that's a perfect circle in there and it's like the volcano shape okay so you want to look for on the top of the seeds you want it to have like a little Ridge it doesn't have to be that defined these are pictures so you completely understand what I'm talking about okay they're a little over exaggerated so you're gonna see a little bit of a climb with in the middle will be a perfect circle okay and that's where actually the seed attaches to the actual button okay so you can see the top of the seeds it's the round piece and then you'll have you know the the sides of the little volcano that you'll be able to see from the top it'll look like you know you know it look like puckering up and then you have a complete perfect circle in the center and then from the side you see will look something like this okay the male seeds have a smaller Ridge or no Ridge at all okay do not confuse male seeds with immature seeds okay these are immature seeds they're super flat on the top but you can tell they have not grown yet okay those are immature seeds okay they have not completely formed do not confuse this with a male seed okay now mind you this probably would have formed into a male seed although it is not fully matured yet but this is how a male seed will look see how it has a kind of slight bump to it okay let's go to a male seed okay see how it's got slightly kind of inclined raised okay see it but it's flat it is flat it looks like a but okay and there is a circle in there but the circle will not be perfect it will not be centered perfectly normally and it will be flat looking and look kind of like you know it'll be like that you have a circle and there will be a weird thing around it and they look like little bloodshot lines spitting out of it and they'll look like these seats here these are 100% sure for sure mail seeds okay no doubt in my mind so this is just the easy way and I went through a whole bunch of different seeds to find males from females but um it's just an easy way if you're going through stuff like this and you want to find female and male seeds okay yeah yeah yeah that's a lot of seeds I got a couple of these okay I'm sure all you do to these right here people these are all skunk baby all skunk you see there's some immature ones in there blah blah blah whatever but yeah that's what these are so I hope this helps you guys you can determine your seeds a lot faster before you ever stick them in the dirt okay so try this technique out you know give me feedback see if it works for you works for me I know mother nature it also does this way works for her that's how we do it you know and like I said it's all up to human discretion you know you might look at you might look at a seed and say on all about by what he was saying that that might be a male but that's a female female seed perfectly round circle with the but you know the volcano look to it okay male seed are me female seed pardon me okay that's how we do it see that male seed see that you can see the volcano to it but look how flat it is okay male seed so I hope this guys this helps you guys I just thought I'd make this real quick while I was doing the harvest I forgot I had told somebody I was gonna make this for them so hopefully they watch this and you know pick up a future a few tricks are just bit my tongue so now I'm gonna get back to harvesting people so have a good evening", "4E1--V6y3dI": "what's going on everybody I just wanted to give you a peek at this lovely 9 pound hammer she's on day 32 in flower looking pretty nice getting a little chunky starting to get some size and some stat going on my hand up here for comparison she's about halfway through the flower cycle I expect to see a lot more nug meat clumping on as the next couple weeks go by here overall she's looking pretty happy pretty healthy not too bad of a run hanging out here under the single-source led from black sale market Canon 320 watt light it's got monitoring going on by the pulse unit pulse lets me know what's going on in the grow got the humidity probe here hanging down you can see this is letting my AC infinity fan know what our humidity and temperature are for the tent so it can kick on my light automatically excuse me my fan automatically starts it out low bumps up the speed and runs until it achieves the step parameters that I have programmed in keeping my environment nicely in tune and I'm pretty happy with it I think that's about all I have to say about that we're running this in the tips container down there it's kind of dark with inputs by build a soil all organically ran and nothing but water am one and mammoth P going into our reservoir I do a top watering every now and then every week maybe every four or five days want to make sure that that top soil stays warm and sometimes warm wet and sometimes that wicking action doesn't work very well so I take the cheap and sprayer fill that up when I do that I'll often throw in a little bit of yucca extract just to help keep the soil condition nice and wet and not hydrophobic yeah just did that to take she's looking a little bit thirsty but I'm pretty happy with the way she's Guerlain nicely shaped but I like the way she's just stacking up [Music] again that's a nine pound hammer bred by jinkx proof genetics gifted to me by Miss Rose that's sweet lady and I just couldn't wait to run it getting pretty excited about her she's definitely getting sticky she's getting a little bit of a stink to her not super distinctive yet on the smell hoping that that will develop a little bit more over the next couple weeks here and let me know what she's really gonna be like all right that's all I've got for you today I hope everybody's having a great week I will see you next time peace guys",

get when I smoke through a bong so they flipped it over a little bit got a little bit greens but so far five out of five but the green say sad it's got some nice sweet lemon pine on that first hand off the spoon pipe we'll see what it tastes like in the bowing though see what that filtration desk toast don't be taste of trichrome and that cutting out like how she tastes a little bit more so yeah so five out of five for the green sage test very strong in the palette and just sweet lemon pie with that a little bit of passion there now Hoshi keep America tasting so they're gonna take up more hits here and see what it tastes like a math degree nice taste that's gonna keep off smoke along guys toast so that screen say so so three out of five just kind of average tasting don't really taste the women no more nothing sweet you know nope I'm like I said no lemon no house no nothing there's gotten just regular already combusted flavor so after grease a sense the three out of five the high though I will say even though it's supposed to be an indica I do have a very strong sativa high and I guess the somewhat decent body indica high so I'll definitely give the high a four out of five pretty good strong on the THC but not very good on the CBD not very strong I should say and it's supposed to be an indica or at least to any codominant so yeah I love this point it on the indica side but still still got me stoned in those couple of hints so I still give it a four out of five so my official give the nine pound hammer pretty good wheat it's it's no I wouldn't say it's super duper top shelf five out of five but it ain't no Reggie no average mid grade so definitely give the nine pound hammer a four out of five definitely recommend you guys to go ahead and try this out once you don't go get yourself a grabbed medically recreationally or black market or the [ __ ] you get your [ __ ] at don't see if you go just grab a gram of it I'm gonna see if you like it because so far I like it it's not too bad when I buy it again probably probably I would not go out and try to get more of it like I really need this is the best [ __ ] in the world but you know if I went in there that would be one of my choices you know if I can't get super duper top-shelf that would be the next option right there so I definitely recommend it and see if you guys try it out you guys my liking a little bit better now I'm pound hammer I give it a 4 out of 5 not too bad so if you guys enjoyed this [ __ ] of course make sure to hit the [ __ ] lock button to fight against the [ __ ] who flag the [ __ ] also make sure to comment down in the comments and of course definitely make sure to have great date night all on 24 hours to post a somebody gets up $10 very piecey guys next time with Chris Kyle's TV with one more 9 pound hammer out of the spoon pipe to bong combo thingy oh hey I just look about just locale hi guys who's", "hchSvCgrYrM": "hey guys it's Florida MJ 4:20 here and today I have a comparison video between 9 pound hammer minis from true leave with 9 pound hammer regular buds from true leave so let's see what the THC is on the Mining's we got seventeen point six percent THC 0.5 percent CVG for a total 18.1% t8 cannabinoids and for the full size we have eighteen point three percent THC 0.5 percent CVG for a total 18.8% cannabinoids alright so let's get these minis opened up and it's the it's the jars of doom you know they gotta have jars that are really hard for people to open for some reason your medicine has to be that way guys see the seals pretty good on this looks like yeah it's not much of a bounce to it though see what's inside alright these look like some really nice little nugs in there 9 pound hammer this is the minis take a closer look at well let's get a smell first alright so the smell from these is very purple that's what I that's what I'd say it's got a sourness to it maybe a little penis but overall I smell that purple smell I want to figure out what that is it smells really good alright let's take a look at these things all right it'd look really nice as you can see these buds are just totally covered in tri cones they're really well developed little nugs these are not Airy wispy buds these are fully mature nugs that are just small and that's what I've come to expect out of truly minis between what I've gotten and what I've seen on the forums that's what I expect now because that's what they've been dishing out all right now let's open up the regular nine pound hammer eight here we've got the minis see if I can get that to stand up right there on this side we'll have the full-size let's check the seal on the full-size jar looks like the seal is intact go ahead and break the seal all right oh we got some nice nugs in here see let me compare these smells here hmm I would say these minis are a lot sweeter and smell and these have a lot more of the sourness to it and it's like a I'm thinking a candy sourness smell almost artificial smellin like like a lime candy or something it's really interesting just dump these mugs out oh wow look at this guy's it looks like we only got about seven eight nodes here that's good look at this man all right I'm liking what I see these look like they're maybe a little bit more mature than the smaller ones the smell is more pungent and well-developed it's more of a well-rounded smell to it deeper bolder smell all right let's go in for some close-ups of this stuff at the nine pound hammer Minnie's up close as you can see they're really nice well-developed little buds we've got a nice coating a trichomes on them there's a bit of leaf enos tiny bit of leaving as you can see to them not a huge amount take a look at that some beautiful stuff that's for sure it's really good try cone coating is nice-looking the color of these tri cones is very close to that of the trichomes on the full eighth you know I don't know if you saw my video yesterday where I compared the lemon og cush Mini with the lemon og cush full size and you can see a definite difference in the trichomes as far as their maturity their color that kind of thing all right let's take a look at the nine pound hammer full-size buds and these things are just beautiful man these are even better like more thoroughly coated with trichomes the smell is better on them they're just overall more well-developed buds I probably give you a higher quality experience overall and just look how sandy these things are man looks so good alright let's go in for a little bit of a closer view alright now we've got a real close-up let's take a look at the minis first trichomes right there they look so good nice furry coating all over the buds pretty little orange hairs everywhere there you go yo fir that thing is it's a little bit of leaf eNOS on some of them tiny bit of leaf eNOS I should say it's not not anything like some other batches you might get from other places and worth mentioning though let's take a look at the full-size wow I mean the difference really is impressive between the two while on the minis you did see a really nice coating of tri cones these are just really nice you can look through here you start to see those big heads forming on these things the smell coming off of this plate is amazing it's a really pungent smell and like I said I'm not sure exactly how to describe it but it smells like some purple strains I've smelled before like maybe granddaddy purp or something like that we'll look at that one oh man is it snowing or something are they evolving they evolving a winter coat oh yeah look at that you can see some really fat heads in this nice it's really good check out check out that Rando big fat head in there you see a couple more over towards this into the boat you so I'd say these are the trichomes aren't as big and fat and plump as the lemon OG Kush was still looking very nice though all right let's get this stuff weighed up and toked up all right now let's get these suckers wait up there the scale of course first I think we'll weigh the regular size since they're easier to get off the plate you got 3.6 nice so point one over on those tear that scale again just in case whoa holy cow four point one oh man I did it again guys it's like hitting the lottery on Thanksgiving what you're gonna do you're gonna talk it up it's what you're gonna do that's some really cool stuff right there I like having 4.1 man so this is half a gram half a gram over what should actually it's plenty six grams but it's it's half a gram over the regular jar and point six over what it should be so excellent deal for 27 bucks or 21 60 or 20% off heck yeah all right let's see so nine pound hammer is it's been around for a while in the system it's one of the go-to strains of true leave a lot of people love it a lot of people hate it a lot of people love it for night time a lot of people say it doesn't do much for them nine pound hammer is an indica dominant hybrid it's a cross between GU berryhill's OG and Jack the Ripper pretty good strain I've enjoyed it the times that I've had it I haven't had any problems with it so pretty good stuff now let's get some of this toked up thank for the review I'm gonna review the minis because that's really what everyone is interested in getting nowadays it's the mini so pick out some nice buds they're all really nice-looking but I want to get some dents one here we go this is look at this man this thing is the densest little nub of kryptonite kind of looking stuff and here's another really just covered node I'll use these to pack my bowl might not even need to honestly this one is really nice and dense this strain seems to have some really dense nugs I really like that I'm kind of disappointed in the lemon og cush minis I opened yesterday though that jar strikes me more as a joint roll in the scroll on a joint rolling jar you know so I don't know if you guys have that kind of thing like you know I grade in my batches that I get and like you know if this it's not that great if it's got a bunch of seeds in it I just consider it a joint rolling batch in that way I can roll big old joints out of it not worry too much about wasting something that's beautiful so I'd consider the lemon og cush from yesterday a joint rolling batch this batch right here I'll hustle man it's a vaping batch I want to savor the flavor I want to get the full effects out of it dang where'd that little one go that I was gonna use huh oh well I'll use this one maybe I already cut it up hey man this stuff is nice and sticky it's just covered when I did get there was one little stem in here I saw I don't want to be you know full disclosure here I did get a stem but 4.1 I mean come on 4.1 that all bundled up there so I can cut it up nice and fine all right Thank You Dade and use my splinters II see what this cuz I think this is gonna pack a big hole punch so I'm gonna let it do its best to me the splinters he really also packs a punch see I got it packed there I don't want to pack it down too tight go ahead and let this thing heat up for 10 seconds before I start hitting it I'm ease into a hit not much but I could definitely feel it oh man okay this strain tastes beautiful he's got kind of a pine eNOS to it but also that purple flavor really got to look that flavor of it maybe maybe it's a kind of a flowery flavor that purple flavor I'm not really sure like maybe some dried flower buds I've smelled before or something like that but it's really nice maybe dried hibiscus almost but a little bit more funky it's really nice really love the flavor on this thing but one thing I feel like one thing I feel like I need to do is is learn a lot more about flavor terminology and you know stuff like that aromas well I can more accurately tell you what this stuff tastes like see you start to get some vapor in there oh wow some good hits this thing always hits me so fast sorry to get sniffily feel it in my face no that's one really heat up see if I get a good old cloud maker going here oh my goodness man blow my nose again oh man so I'm that bigger hit I'm starting to get a little crazy fruit coming through maybe just a look at oh man it's like barely even cooked dang we're gonna be here for wild boys well that'll be here for a while boys and you really got to work this thing it's like it's a it's analog for sure you know it's not your digital normal digital bait this isn't the kind that you just turn it on and you do whatever you want to you got to play it like an instrument and man if you play it right it rewards you it really does so you gotta learn to play this thing oh hey kitty kitty hey baby kitty cat yeah this isn't for you baby you're gonna have to go away for a little bit be right back all right I'm back had to give that little kitty something that Thanksgiving on a little sour cream did the trick all right oh yeah it started crank out that vapor that was a really smooth hip for how much paper I got surprised usually it's usually be really killing me just a couple light coughs I'm deal with that yeah this thing is all about changing up the speed of the draw and the duration oh wow it's now it's getting a lot more of a greener flavor to it like all of a sudden maybe even a sweet peas flavor like a sugar snap peas that kind of thing interesting you'll see what we got in here now starting to get to it mmm I'm starting to get through this here almost done with it man I'm feeling pretty good um I'm a little surprised you know this is a lot more clear-headed than I would expect from nine pound hammer I feel great but in a very clear-headed way which is interesting like I don't feel groggy so you know take from that what you will I guess it can vary person to person but yeah I don't feel tired and groggy from this I feel just fine and it feels good really good I've definitely felt a lot more indica indica like effects from like Starkiller's a good one for that another one off the top of my head well let me know gee cush there you go I took a really good one for that I'm not getting very much vapor off of this and it's tasting pretty toasty so I think I pretty much cook this goose even though it doesn't really look totally toasted here let me try during this up a little bit no give it one more hit and if that don't work then I guess we're doing oh yeah that did it just give it a good stir Oh firmly into toasty territory now definitely at the end of the bolt it's a nice vapor there oh very toasty oh yeah it's starting to reduce in volume - I'll buy a lot probably buy a third at this point which is great I mean think about that that means all those trichomes were taking up a lot of physical space all right well it looks like I've cooked this one looks like I've cooked this one all the way through I'm not getting very much off of it and it's brown all right so there we have it get these two things on the plate again nine pound hammer minis versus full-size minis effects are great they don't feel really heavy to me I feel awesome right now I don't feel tired or you know couch locked or anything like that so this is nine pound hammer minis these are $27 they're about 24 bucks with 10% off and about 2160 with 20% off this is an excellent deal especially if you get 4.1 grams out of it like I did these are the nine pound hammer on the side full-size these costs fifty three dollars and eight very expensive for what it is beautiful buds it smells really nice nice effects I wouldn't say they're on the sedative side or anything like that I'd just say that it's a really nice high and so yeah if you get these on sale and you could get it down to what let's see 43 bucks so 20% off they're around 43 bucks or something like 42 for the jar it makes it reasonable ish but it's still way too high so wait for the minis I mean you know it's such a good deal all right guys thank you very much for watching y'all have a happy Thanksgiving you guys I just wanted to show you this bud it's out of the Florida Medical system it's a legal bud what do you guys think about it what's that but make you think does it remind you of anything any strains any dispensaries any effects how does this bud make you feel when you look at it what would you say about this bud if you had to say something about it does this bud look good to you you look like a high quality bud all right I'm going a little bit closer all right let's get a really good close-up of that bud what do you think about it you think of any names or places when you see this bud any feelings or experiences what's this bud remind you of you think it looks like a good bud how's this but make you feel what do you think about this bud alright thank you for watching you have a good one", "4dqlvu_pXWc": "you guys know the struggle right you're at the bluegrass jam and some vocalist struts in and calls nine pound hammer in the really tricky key of b-flat when you've only ever played this song before in the key of a so what do you do well you just give death stares to all the banjo dobro and guitar players as they slap on their dirty capos and you mentally prepare yourself for the onslaught of wrong notes and inner despair that will commence when it comes your turn to take a solo well maybe not exactly but the struggle is real what's up folks my name is david if you're new here and in this video i want to show you how to approach this really common but stressful transposition issue when it comes to a song like nine pound hammer and as it's generally a bit of a faux pas to use a capo with a mandolin we're gonna have to plan ahead here to learn some of these classic bluegrass singing songs and some different keys because we're always at the mercy of the vocalist to pick a key that best suits their singing range so first up here i'm gonna show you how to play a melodic solo for nine pound hammer in the key of a go something like this this is the key that tony rice played the song and off of that seminal record manzanita so you'll probably find a lot of other people who play it in this key as well but we're not going to stop there we're going to take this exact same solo and rework it to fit within the key of b flat which is another common key for this song in fact ronnie bowman recorded the song in b flat off of his record cold virginia knight but check out my version here and lastly good old bill monroe played this song in the key of b major so we're going to take this arrangement up one more fret to see how this sounds in the high and lonesome key of b [Music] and the keys of a b flat and b are probably some of the most common keys that you might encounter at the bluegrass jam for this song so once you've got these learned and memorized you'll have a lot of your bases covered already but even by doing this transposition exercise you'll start to see the working parts of the melody a bit more clear which means that'll be even easier to transpose to other keys and you might find yourself learning the fretboard better coming up with new ideas to play over this song and other songs as well so let's cut the chit chat because we have a lot of heavy lifting to do here if you think about it you know nine pound hammer times three that's 27 pound hammer it doesn't really have the same ring does it so grab your mandolin because we're getting started right now before we get started on those solos let's review the chords here and we only have three chords in the song but i'd recommend using the chop chord shapes when you're playing this at the jam so to start with in the key of a major we'll need these three chop chord shapes here we have a d and e and you probably know where this is going right for the key of b flat you can keep these shapes the same just shift them up one fret so now we have b flat e flat and f and you guessed it for the key of b just move these shapes up one more fret so now you have b e and f sharp so not too bad right that's where these chop chord shapes come in real handy because since they're closed position chords you can just move these shapes up and down the neck to change keys really easily so super helpful if you find yourself playing a familiar song and an unfamiliar key like we're doing here now let's get our head around this solo in the key of a to start with take a listen as i play through this up to speed [Music] do [Music] so let's break things down here a bit and first up you'll see that i'm using that open a string quite a lot to flesh out the sound of it throughout this arrangement i'm doing this at the beginning and the pickup measure as well as on the first measure when i'm sliding up from the fourth fret to the seventh fret of my d string we'll do a similar thing here on the second line when i'm sliding from the fourth to the seventh fret on my a string and letting that open e string ring out a bit also over on the d chord i'm still using that open a string because the a note still fits with your d major chord so it sounds good here as well now this first line is pretty similar to how a vocalist might interpret the melody but on the second line here i'm changing things up with this kind of crazy lick and this like harkens back to that fiddle kick off of the manzanita record that i mentioned earlier but don't tell anyone that i stole it next you'll see that we're using some different notes outside of our a major scale that's what these accidentals are letting us know here we're playing some c naturals and some g naturals which are both the lower third and the lowered seventh of your a major scale these are great bluesy sounding notes that a lot of bluegrass players use in the key of a to make things sound i guess a little bit more bluegrass and keep an eye out for a couple hammer on triplets here as well now on the next couple lines here we're starting off with a backward slide from the third to the second fret on your a string while that open e string is ringing out but after that this line is pretty much identical to the very first line that we started with then here at the bottom is where things get a little weird right we're playing an extended tag lick to fill in that extra space between the end of the solo and when the vocalist starts singing again first we got these really quick hammer on and pull off ideas to start with then we're sliding with our middle finger from the third to the fifth fret of the e string to get into this a major chop chord position where we'll be playing this last lick and all these notes fit really well within this chalkboard bluegrass box shape just watch out for a few c naturals and g naturals sprinkled in there but that's really all that's going on here so take some time and study all these little bits with the transcription and by the way if you like pdf copies of all the transcriptions that you see here on screen you can find those over at my patreon page and you can also download these mp3 play-along tracks for this song and we have them for all three different keys i'm just kind of realizing now that we recorded three different tempos for each of the three different keys of the song so we have nine tracks for nine pound hammer but that was totally unintentional anyways you can check out all that stuff at the link above here but when you're ready let's try this a major version of the solo a bit slower with the transcription on screen [Music] do [Music] well great so once you have this down let's take this up to the key of b flat and just like those chop chords that we're looking at earlier all we have to do is move this entire arrangement up one fret to play in this new key but since we don't have our open a and open e strings to work with here we'll have to change our fingerings and we'll have to change a couple other things to suit this key a bit better take a listen here and see what's [Music] different [Music] so let's break this a bit down too first off instead of using that open a string like we did before we'll have to have our first finger on the first fret of the a string to play this b flat note to fit with the new chords that we have same idea over that e flat chord here too also we're barring down with our index finger on the first fret of the a and e strings here in the first measure just to get a little bit of a bigger sound and right before that we're using our open a and open e strings kind of as this incidental starting place for that double stop and even though the open e string doesn't usually fit within the key of b flat it works here because we're playing it so quickly and we resolve to that first fret that f natural on the e string and we'll play that same man's needle lick on the second line here but now on the key of b flat the fingerings are all different and it does get a little bit tricky you'll have to use your fourth finger a little bit too which i apologize for also same idea with this open e string on the last measure of this line it's just kind of this incidental embellishment that resolves to the f note on the first fret on the next line here first measure we'll have to hold down the f note on the first fret of the e string as we make that downward slide with our ring finger now and then at the very end here we'll actually play the exact same tag lick that we did before in the key of a but now we're having to slide our middle finger up to the sixth fret to play the same like over the b flat chord but really the fingerings are the same we've just shifted it up one fret to play around that b flat chop chord instead of the a chalk chord like before so take your time digesting all that stuff and when you're ready let's try this out a bit slower with the transcription as well [Music] all right well 18 pounds lifted and nine more to go and now shifting this whole arrangement up to the key of b is going to be even easier all we're going to do is shift up that b flat version of the solo up one more fret to get to the key of b and we can actually keep most of the fingerings the same check it out here [Music] so just a couple nuances here to check out first in that very first measure we still have our open a and our open e string as the starting point to lead into that double stop same as it was in the key of b flat but now we're playing the double stop on the second fret it's weird here because the key of b doesn't have an a natural in the key signature so now it's the a string that doesn't fit within our key but it still has the same effect as it resolves to that b double stop and now for that tag like here at the end we're actually going to slide our middle finger all the way up to the seventh fret to play around this b major chop chord shape but the fingerings are going to be exactly the same as they were for this lick in the key of b flat and for the key of a we're just a little bit higher up the neck now but that's it you got this let's try this out together [Music] so hopefully just by learning the solo in three different keys you're going to connect the dots even better and eventually you're going to be able to see those patterns between each key so clear that you can do this a lot easier you might even get pretty comfortable doing this on the fly where you're not spending any time thinking about it in advance and that's a really good goal to shoot for because who knows what's going to happen in those jams right the best way to get better at this is just to do what we're doing here you know spend some time learning some other classic bluegrass songs and transposing solos into different keys as well and by the way if you're looking for even more standards like this to learn might i suggest some of the other videos that you see here on screen tons more coming soon thanks so much for watching thanks for the likes the subscribes join us over on patreon huge shout out to all the patrons who are already there i'll see you guys in the next one", "rq-_iG9soRQ": "you to navigate it back again in the 4k garden we're starting week seven everything is looking really nice right now getting that flush started like to use does freshwater and says he's armed in week seven and I'll move on it's just nothing but straight ro water in the eighth we've been looking at some of the nine how hammers that are in as you guys can see it's super frosting stuff every little bit of it you guys have seen in the past I like to do a really good lollipop job on these buds they don't extend too far down but even the bottom lowers on stuff is really killing no signs of any kind of pollination bananas now that [ __ ] everything has been really smooth sailing you guys probably remember I had a little bit of an issue a few weeks back but there has been no sign of anything since since this is the very beginning of week four you know and I [ __ ] off a couple of those little nail polish tags off pretty much every one of these nine pound found a couple sacks what all the one that is and you know I just pluck them off and I haven't had any kind of recurrence so this one right here is that cut that had that really bad clawing from nitrogen now I've been told by the breeder that they really do not care for nitrogen when it went when they go into one you know when they're in flower so I'm going to take that under you know under advisement for the next run and definitely cut back a little bit on my base nutrient and consider not even giving them cow Matic because I don't think they needed it now again that's really the only cut Murphy know that I really saw it that dramatically on but just about all of them showed some signs of a little too much nitrogen maybe it's a nun lowers crawling a little bit but that's you know it's still a good sign that you know they had plenty of nitrogen more than enough let's take a little stroll around the around the room here you've also got this blue widow just pretty much full-blown now she's starting to really get dark and weeds and stuff like that I really like when she starts to turn and finish off or with this out of the room you look at some of the things over here this right here as you can see she's starting to fade quite a bit already she's only had fresh the fresh wood since he's on one time already that was last night and she is already starting to yellow out a little bit but this is one of my favorites right here and just super stinky and real loud it's super frosty to all of it like I said footwork [Music] and it's got some nice colas here that one over there with that nitrogen clawing and that [ __ ] I can tell that shit's going to be purple as hell when it's done she's frosting your [ __ ] though as you guys can see I mean just about every part of the leaves are just coated it's that number seven we're looking at right now it's getting on the lowers there is crazy I can't wait to start trimming this stuff because you know it would be very very liver when it comes to filling up my my bin for you know the stuff I'm gonna blow for oil and stuff material here doesn't look like I'm gonna have a lot of popcorn or anything like that so I'll be using pretty decent but it's man and I think it's going to be some real fire a similar female this year is actually pin number six not filling out like some of the other buzz but then again this one could have been lollipop a lot better a couple of these Pinos definitely stretched a lot more than the others though I like this one right here stay nice and short I really only seen to Syria like distinct phenotypes in this garden the rest of it's all pretty much just the same as those you know you've got either something like this or something like the last one we looked at back here we got that Doctor Who doing really really well this run phenomenal my doctor who's got a very very unique flavor it's really nice good and strong super-healthy grower too and it doesn't even need that tomato cage you know that's the only plan I've got that I really don't have to worry about any kind of staking not also the case I've got to say it's a lot like that too but I don't really have to use that gauge but it puts on so much weight that I find that it's it's definitely good to have the security of a cage there you can see she likes to put something put together some really big colas she's hella chunky there's a ton of Amarna to I mean the ace really really yield at this time the final final pool twelve or fourteen ounces off and I'll be really surprised there's just we got them - back there the right there man I really like that I don't care so much for the one back in that corner it's a lot like to cut directly in front of me but it definitely has a hard structure building all these plans very similarly this one here just decided to do its own thing and I doubt that I can really show you guys what I mean where I'm standing but it's spread out like just crazy there's a nice uniform shape to most of my plans you know Viet some of them may be a little bit taller some a little bit shorter the way that I basically build my plants is it's the same with everything and if a plant doesn't really conform to the way that I do that I generally don't like that cut too much anyway there's not a whole lot else to report you know I wanted to make one last video or I'm really talking about how things are going and pretty much from this point on on this craft you guys are probably going to be seeing something other sides and stuff like that until I finished so look forward to that and you know if you guys have any questions or comments about how this 9-pound everything like that's going you know feel free to leave them I'll try to give you answers especially for you know the good questions a lot of people have lately been asking me questions that you can really have answered if you just watch one other video of mine for the most part I mean there's I tend to really go over everything in every video you know if I miss something just watch the last video you probably be in there you know what I mean everything went great though guys I've got to say you know I thought in starting week four I thought things are gonna get really bad in here and things turned out great so far I think we are past the point where anything bad can really happen you know I don't see any of the harmony issues coming back even if they do I think we're good to go I think everything in here is just about done to the point where we'll finish the next two weeks out and it's harvest time so lots of question to do I have lots and lots of trimming to do and a whole lot of extractions so I want to thank you guys for watching I'll see you next time you", "qV0hTq9rFaA": "[Music] it's a little too heavy holiday for my son from my side we're alone buddy don't go slow [Music] it's a long wait harlan dance along with a hazard just

cannabis related if you want tips on how to grow some really bomb bugs or information on some of the world's best marijuana strains then you've come to the right channel here at bob's bomb buns we select the world's best marijuana strains to be a part of boz bomb bud's collection on today's episode of boz bomb buds i'll be doing my day 21 flowering update with the spyder farmer sf4000 in my 5x5 mammoth tent i'm doing weekly updates on the growth and progression of the plants under the sf4000 during the flowering stage the plants started from seed in my 3x3 dual 90 mammoth tent and under my mars hydro ts 1000 they veged for 8 weeks and seven out of the eight weeks were under my ts-1000 from mars hydro then i moved them into my 5x5 the veg for a week if you want to know more about the vegging process then check out my videos on growing from seed until ready for flowering under a mars hydro ts-1000 the sf4000 is about 14 inches from the plants and we'll stay there for the rest of flowering the light is on a timer for 12 hours on and 12 hours off okay it's day 21 since i flipped them the flower and the plants are looking super healthy and super happy it's really starting to smell great in here i'm trying to maintain a sea of green i topped my plants and did some low stress training during veg topping is a high stress training technique if you need help topping your plants then check out my video on topping your pot plants the buds are starting to stack up real nice the strains i have are two master cushes two strawberry blues and one gelato 33 the buds are really starting to come along and they're really starting to smell great i love my lasko fan it's doing a great job moving the air around in there i liked it so much i even ordered another one from my other tent if you're ever interested in checking out or trying any of the products in my videos check out the description section for the links for the products you're looking for or comment what product you're looking for and i'll send you a link also don't forget to check out my website at www.bobsbombuds.com where you can find all your legal cannabis needs like cannabis flowers extracts concentrates edibles cbd products grow equipment vaporizers seeds and more we have everything you need we even have cannabis products for your pets the grow medium i'm using is a cocoa and perlite mix i use about two thirds cocoa and about one third perlite with a teaspoon of fossilized guano mixed in with each plant at the beginning of the plant's life and mike and dynamico mix into the soil and on the roots whenever i transplant the temperature has been between 75 to about 80 degrees fahrenheit with the lights on and 73 to 76 degrees fahrenheit during the sleep cycle the humidity is still around 50 percent and it'll stay at 50 percent for now but in the last three to four weeks of flour i do like to turn it down to about 45 percent the nutrients i'm using are all advanced nutrients the ones for cocoa or their cocoa safe products for this week i've been giving them big bud bud candy scentsy zyme bud factor x and rhino skin all by advanced nutrients and their two-part scentsy cocoa bloom i'll also be adding nirvana and b-52 to the mix for this week i like to give them a little organic cow mag from general organics the two-part advanced nutrients cocoa has calmag in it so i really don't need it but i like to give them a little extra cow mag anyways just to be safe they are getting full feedings and i feed them about twice a day once when the light comes on and about one hour before it shuts off they got about a liter each except for the gelato it gets about 1.5 liters because she's a very thirsty lady when i water or feed them i always make sure it's ph that's 6.3 advanced nutrients has ph perfect technology and will be perfectly ph every time at 6.3 or at least it is for me but i always double check anyways and i use some ph down and some ph up to correct it if needed i use an alfred garden ph meter but recommend any blue lab ph meter out of all the ph meters i've ever had in my years of growing they are by far the best in my opinion i've trimmed some of the leaves and got rid of some of the larger fan leaves to allow more light penetration i like to do some on day 14 and then some more on day 21 after today i'm done training and trimming leaves and the plants are just on autodrive from here on out i have this tmb naturals the co2 enhancer i put in my tent on day three and run it for the first four weeks of flower it's good for about two weeks and then i use a refill which gives me another two weeks i had to refill it a few days ago you shake it every day for the best results i like to shake it the second the light comes on so my plants can get a big breath of fresh seal too when they wake up i find the co2 supplements are best used in the first four weeks of flower i don't see much change in my results if i use it past the fourth week when i water or feed my plants i make sure the water is around room temperature i use filtered tap water filtered with a carbon filter and then i let it sit out for at least two days that way the chlorine has enough time to evaporate have you had the chance to try any of these amazing products i use for my grow if so let me know what you think of these amazing cannabis products or what products you like to use in the comments section below well that's all for this episode of bob's bomb buds featuring my weekly update on flowering under an sf4 thousand thanks for watching and if you

giant number three the third phenotype made by malik spider go check them out Instagram and YouTube yeah and if you're not subscribed to red pill yet you can also look down in the description you'll see a youtube link for him you should also see some links for without those links it'd be hard to find me trust me I had a hard time finding you yeah so we're gonna take a couple tours here if anyone cares to look anyone who cares to more that's when I'm dabbing on looks like this [Music] and I can't tell you what it smells or tastes oh I can tell you what it tastes I can't really share with you what it smells like but it's like pouring out orange soda and sticking your nose up to the bubbles that's exactly what it's like I was like amazing alright so far we got three people watching us guys we're gonna get started here in a minute we're waiting for you know finish this pipe real quick and red pill to take a damn and then we're gonna go to this right here root production we're talking about different traits that people breach for or against and this is the letter G so there were a b c d e f g this is the seventh one it's really cool seventh letter they'll that yeah I'm really enjoying the section learning things yeah this is perfect we're talking about having a little cheat sheet or something I don't know if that's the way it word for it template a template yeah that's not showing up good I'll do this and then show a better dad I'm smoking some fire Paris Oh G right now Coolidge 829 somebody else had Paris ot you simply maybe it was somebody ate too big a bellows or maybe yeah Michigan busy forget we take your word for it that it's fire I'll or just Vokoun at some time enough you can't go wrong with some SG can't go wrong with no G No unless there's something wrong with you if anyone didn't see the first time that's when I'm dabbing they're on our soda okay now we see orange soda people and I'm gonna come visit you one of these days that orange soda grape soda know what what I've had recently that I haven't had in years there we go that's better cherry 7up mmm that helped out a little bit a little bit Cannabis Cup winner all right let's take a DAB and then we'll get started on waiting for the production or do you want me to just start I'll mute myself for dad but if you want to start going who j29 says yo Keef I've been wanting to read this book thankful for what you do are you planning on reading other books that have a lot of knowledge and I have tons of ideas how can i maybe contact you guys we're on hangouts Google Hangouts I think everybody has an account of your have a youtube account then you just find our names on there or at least try to it's difficult sometimes but it's the best way to get a hold of me but yeah I appreciate your comment man I'm learning something too you know I've never read the book yet I'm probably gonna want to read it in on my own two or three more times second at their time there's so much information I'm kind of leaving the books selecting or the books selecting up to read bill at this point but we there's a few I have in mind we might do a follow up to this one Roth Clark's latest book or there's another even older book than this one that talks about the diversity of cannabis it's actually it's called diversities of cannabis but we are willing to take suggestions absolutely let us know would be really cool I mean and I wouldn't have probably read the book if it wasn't on here I was telling right they were left our forest in the house she says hey you're back laughing out loud look you think you have too bad wanta thanks for stopping by you getting me here my voice again meaning whoever thought I'd be new years old sitting at home reading a book about life a life man that is really tasty that's how I love reminds me that's all it's almost close to sinning it's all good that tastes to uh close to what sinning sitting sinning yet it's like forbidden fruit okay when she says yo Thank You red pill also appreciate all the knowledge I personally would like to link up sometime this is my goal in life I love learning spreading the knowledge cool great that's greatly appreciated like hearing that any any time we get a positive comment that makes me feel like to keep on doing the show and that it's not just going into some empty void in the YouTube or the internet exactly that's how I feel to read cool yeah I mean even if it's just a couple people hanging out with us and they're there listening you know I'm satisfied you know yeah it's good to know that it's just like being ignored or something and we're doing this for nothing when we could be doing this and private hangout and I'd read to you yes but anyways I'm medicated pretty much for me and I don't know about read though looks like he's going well you can go ahead and continue but I'm doing the old you break it your dabit rule I just tore that off so that means I got it damn right there that's your glob mob official entry right there oh yeah yeah it's look is there receiving with this it looks prettier when it's like a long dangly slab but this is more like yeah I don't know it looks like a SAP but when you dig your dagger into it the kind of butters out I was gonna say yeah yeah we're gonna get to another tree that we can breed for root production I'm not sure if everybody can see this I apologize if it doesn't come through clear I see if I can maybe zoom in a little bit more don't quite make it verse 250 ah there it is looks better so root production - the size and shape of cannabis root systems are very greatly although every embryo sends out a tap root from which lateral roots grow the individual growth pattern and final size and shape of the roots Theory considerably some plants sent out a deep taproot up to one meter or 39 inches long which helps support the plant against winds and rain most cannabis plants however produce a poor tap root which rarely extends more than 30 centimeters or one foot lateral growth is responsible for most of the roots and cannabis plants these fine lateral roots offer the plant additional support but their primary function is to absorb water and nutrients from the soil a large root system will be able to feed and support a large plant most lateral roots grow near the surface of the soil where there is more water or oxygen and more available nutrients breeding for root size and shape they prove beneficial from the production of large rain and wind resistant strains often cannabis plants even very large ones have very small and sensitive roots recently certain alkaloids have been discovered in the roots of cannabis that might have some medical value if this proves the case cannabis may be cultivated and bred for high alkaloid levels in the roots to be used in a commercial production of pharmacy yeah I'll jump in right there if anyone knows or has seen John Breaux fellow I think John H for fellow on YouTube here as a small testing apparatus and one of the hatched church discussions one day was if cannabis roots contain any cannabinoids and so he was able to that night test some roots and show that yet by weight cannabis does have about one percent THC and its roots so if you are growing DWC and you have those giant five to twenty gallon bucket root balls it's probably worth saving that [ __ ] out and processing it as with many traits it is difficult to make selections for mood types until the parents are harvested because of this many crosses are made early and seed selected later each branching the branching pattern of a cannabis plant is determined by the frequency of nodes along each branch and the extent of branching at each node for example is consider a tall thin plant with slender limbs made up of long inter nodes and nodes with little branching like Oaks Akaka Mexican which is a Mexican strain that would be walking Oaxaca my bad Oh caca Oaxaca Mexico strain I forgot that X is an H like Mexico compare this with the stout densely branch plant with limbs of short Internode's and highly branched nodes like Hindu Kush for she strains different branching patterns are preferred for the different agricultural applications of fiber flower or resin production tall thin plants with long Internode's and no branching are best adapted to fiber production a short broad plant with short Internode's and well on one went next page well develop branching is best adapted to floral production right exactly and that's kind of what in the planets that I'm growing now that I'll show in a little bit I have three different phenotypes two of which are more similar on the two similar ones the only difference is one has better internode spacing they both have good branching in the branch buds the side buds are all good so I'd like to narrow that down to where they have the best branching from the one and the closer inner note stacking of the other and then there's one that has a completely better inner node structure than both of them so yes um that's kind of what I'm going for is to have more lateral branches but keep shortening the internet spacing it says here and this is for outdoor branching structures selected that work that will tolerate heavy rains and high winds without breaking this is quite advantageous to outdoor growers and temperance temperate zones with short seasons some readers select tall limber plants like in Mexico which bend in the wind others select short stiff plant so I can do Kush which resists the weight of water without bending I have a story for that too growing in a residential area in Wisconsin one time I did managed at mid-august have a nine foot tall hazed plant and the first big rainstorm we got it was mainly made in the three big branches it got topped and away it out three tops and then got trained where those tops got dedicated and the four big branches in themselves pretty much three plants all together and when the weight of the rain got on top of him they spread like the one branch went one way one went the other way I want to want the other and while me and my dad were trying to maintain it it did break one of the limbs just literally snapped right off right so I was that sucked but is probably because it was a blessing because now the tallest for him was six feet tall right under the fencing so I'm thinking are those than in the car in the car what am I talking about our our plants the ones we're talking about here the ones that are more resistant to weather and all that elements are those more of hat jeans or like are we are we now partially producing butter marijuana because we're we're selecting and breeding and growing indoors you know without to insert about wind heavy rain and stuff like that you know what I mean is rather than I know growing outside that definitely factors in and all that but I'm just wondering if if it's forbidden right out so no you can still find it like right now like even out of these three plants and if I were selecting the bigger population I wouldn't grow the ones that have long internode spacing like right just right now I'm his hybrid hybridized as they are I can already tell I wouldn't call it doesn't have that good of you know know it spacing so I'm guessing with more wild plants and outdoors with the wind and rain and all that but but I really what that came from is where it in climate it is an indica sativa doesn't really matter or even the difference of narrow leaf or broad leaf or wide leaf aspiring as far as to do with cannabis because there is broad leaf or wide leaf hemp and narrow leaf hump and just like there's narrow leaf cannabis and wide leaf cannabis the way the plants got shaped by nature or whatever is the amount of water that the plants have to be used to shedding and like said the the wind strength so so plants that either had to deal with high winds in the first place like if they were like on face of a whole mountainside or like for some reason I'm more of a plane in the wind just rolled over it constantly every day those plants would probably be more stocky and branchy but thick you know so they would be less more maneuverable in the wind whereas plants that are growing mourns in an interior of the forest or in some type of valley or something or the wind passes over it and doesn't really blow straight up through it both plants can be more manipulated by the went so they need to be more floppy or something you know because sure that only a little bit of amount of wind is good for them they need to be have their paw and be able to fly and the leaves move around there but it can go inverse like those same environments can make broad leaf or wide leaf traits if they get a lot of rain or I'm sorry yeah if they don't get a lot of rain right if it's down in an area in a valley where it would normally have to grow you know kind of more narrower more maneuverable by the winds way not a lot of wind or not a lot of water would be would make the leaves wider so more water makes the leaves thinner so they shed water faster so in the same region where you'd have not a lot of wind I'm sorry where you'd have a lot of wind and it's opposite where there is a lot of rain they would be stocky and thick but they'd still have thin leaves so that becomes a shed water yeah sorry that was a little don't gloat in the jungle kind of leave it alright so I just wanted to shout out the people who are in jad we had Coolidge a cannabis hypocrisy pull into our forest mr. Bob dog or just Bob dog and Purple Haze and it's a lovely group of people yeah purple he said he just stopped by to say hi what's up what's up replace what's up for blaze good to see you in here I really appreciate that so this next subject is my seat Ron the letter I and the sizer and the subject is sex oh I'll start reading about that should have seen that one coming if you're younger than eight can you please read the room what's it called ears letter I sex attempts to breed offspring of only one sexual type and led to more misunderstanding than any other facet of cannabis tonight discovers the discoveries of McPhee from 1925 and Schaffner from 1928 showed that pure sexual type and her arm of hermaphrodite conditions are inherited and that the percentage of sexual types could be altered by crossing with certain hermaphrodites since then it has generally been assumed by researchers and breeders that a cross between any unselected hermaphrodite plant oops and a pistol at seed parent should result in a population of all pistillate offspring this is not the case in most cases the offspring of herm of hermaphrodite parents tend toward hermaphrodite um which is largely unfavorable unfavorable for the production of cannabis other than fiber health this is not to say that there is no tendency for hermaphrodite causes to ultra sex ratios in the offspring the accidental release of some pollen from predominantly pistol at hermaphrodites along with the complete eradication nearly every stamina and stamina - hermaphrodite plant may have led to a shift in sexual ratio and domestic populations of since Amelia drug cannabis it is commonly observed that these strains tend towards 60 to 80 percent pistillate plants and a few pistillate hermaphrodites are not uncommon in these populations however a cross can be made which will produce nearly all pistol it or staminate individuals if the proper pistillate hermaphrodite plant is selected as the pollen parent and a pure pistol at plant selected as the seed parent it is possible to produce an f1 and subsequent generations of nearly all pistol at offspring the proper pistillate hermaphrodite pollen parent is one which has grown as a pure pistol at plant and at the end of the season or under artificial and environmental stress begins to develop very few staminate flowers if pollen from these few staminate flowers forming on a pistol plant is applied to a pure pistol at seed parent the resulting f1 generation should be almost all pistol it with only a few pistol it hermaphrodites this will also be the case of the selected pistol it hermaphrodite pollen source is selfed and bears its own seeds remember that a selfed hermaphrodite gives rise to more hermaphrodites people but a selfish delayed plant that has given rise to a limited number of stamina flowers and response and vyr mental stresses should give rise to nearly all destroyed offspring the f1 offspring may have a slight tendency to produce a few staminate flowers under further environmental stress and these are used to produce f2 seed a mono aja strain produces 95% plants with many pistillate and stamina flowers but a dioecious strain produces 95 plus percent pure pistol it or plants a plant from a dioecious strain with a few intersexual flowers is a pistol it or stamina hermaphrodite therefore the difference between mono that word motto and MAF Road ISM is one of degree determined by genetics and environment comment yes I was interesting because it's talking about it you particularly wanted to make this strain that half its powers remain our female you could do that and going the opposite way you could feminized or almost feminized a variety like I said it didn't get all-female as you go get some percentage of plants from doing this that still turned out to be males but that's odd as we went over a little bit of the last section to of how to breed for female or majority female seeds bob-dog has showed me how to spell this mono Shushan what dioecious is anonymous yeah malicious indications so yeah cannabis hypocrisy says all true using old thumb tack alright where did we leave off oh no wait we read this part there for them between my hundreds okay this is one word I didn't understand here we probably learned it earlier does therefore the difference between mono a schism and oh you know what it is this book sometimes has these errors and spelling where they have spaces where there shouldn't be spaces so I'm reading math Road ISM what's this mat road isn't words are coming up with out of nowhere well there's the word her is before it so it's actually hermaphrodite or I don't know people in the chat can see that it's been all over the place like this and I have to like piece together words usually I catch them crosses they also be before to produce nearly all stamina offspring this is accomplished by crossing a pure stamina plant with the stem in a plant that has produced a few what let me read this again it sounds like these plants are okay let me explain this and I have a picture to show it to once in a while a male plant when its first flowering throws off a couple pistols which means it can get pawn it we can get pollinated by its own pollen that can get pollinated by another knows pollinated so yes you take a male plant and pollinate another male plant that has an [ __ ] out produced of you at dude plants game dude plants making drugs yeah go ahead what alright Dan interrupts no you're practically reading the book for us like it it sound exactly what you were just saying okay but my bad no it's fine you're gonna get um those seeds on there but it's kind of funny because it's - dude plants making baby see but regardless yeah you can do that too and you never see that on the market because people are like in fear of male plants that's why I feminized plants I've come to because like wait you don't have to [ __ ] your you don't have to grow a mil you know I [ __ ] with having males plant male plants so why I didn't go through that hassle and then that's why it was the selling point of feminized seeds it was for like people who only grew like four plants and they didn't want to like start four seeds out of a 10 pack and get like three males and one female and I'd have to plant more seeds and dick around doing that and trying to have like four plants and they're the closet all uniform and you know obviously it takes plants to get clones someday you don't always know someone with the clone so in the beginning you have to start seeds at some point where people had to back in the day so feminised seeds were like a savior for like the closet growers and like at home hobby growers because they're like that yeah [ __ ] I've got a girl plant never again yeah but the same thing can be done if you really need it to for if some genetics like I said would have meant to be kept for doning pollen like if he always wanted to say if you're super familiar with the strain that you knew was almost true breeding to true breeding what you could do is take new females that you acquire throughout the years that you know whatever trying to eat comes around and what you do is you pollinate those and now you have like something in the background that you already know and are familiar with so you can select phenotypes you already know how which ones are leaning towards the male because that's something you're used to so you can figure out using that or to breed against so your females from that first generation of seeds that are more like that calling you acquired are like what you want to stick with because you're making usually an increased version of that but say if you get like purple kush that has seventeen percent THC and five percent terpenes usually a point of crossing it with the male you're super familiar with would be increasing that you know by some percentage like nineteen percent THC and now six percent terpenes that would be yeah that would be the testing results of a male to keep I can't just select a male before you've even bribed with it you have to like make seeds with it and see if they'll see its or even better than the female plant that it came out it cuz you know you can water it down too right yeah if you obviously take a ham strain you take a male plant from a hops tree and put on Girl Scout cookies you're gonna [ __ ] up what's good in a Girl Scout cookies so it's always been my philosophy that it kind of like OCD thing once I get into the point contests everything that can afford all that I would only ever use male plants that came from a gene pool of higher THC you're hired terpene value than the female plan on pollinating you know I mean otherwise I feel like I'm just gonna decrease whatever's the females got so I can this will say like uh like uh like a Sour Diesel is fifteen percent THC and we know I got some like og males that females the og females are twenty five percent THC right I wouldn't take a male from the Sour Diesel that comes from plants at the highest fifteen percent THC and pollinate the twenty five percent THC og I'll do the opposite I would take males from the 25 percent og population and pollinate the 15 percent Sour Diesel female at least in for my theory that's the only way of increasing the drug type or you know the our point of consuming cannabis but carry on my dad to gone in a tangent go back to the males no it's all good we're stimulating to make debate in the chat that's awesome crosses mail will also be performed to produce nearly all staminate offspring this is accomplished by crossing a pure stamina plant which another stamina plant that has produced a few pistillate flowers due to environmental stress or selfing the later plant the latter plant there's readily apparent that in the wild on these switch here maybe blue like that it is readily apparent that in the wild this is not a likely possibility there 'if you stamina plants live long enough to produce pistillate flowers and when this does happen the number of seeds produced is limited to a few pistillate flowers that occur in the case of pistillate hermaphrodite there's that example real fast you see that's a male and there's a few pistols on it it's not our hurt it wasn't a hurry male because it didn't continue to shoot pistols it was just that one and a couple others right out at the top there so that's what it means and what you're eating there here it's like even if you keep track of it and remember where they were and pull them you know you extract them wavelet to extract them from the plant you're only gonna get like four seeds there it may produce only a few staminate flowers but each of these may produce thousands of pollen grains any one of which may fertilize one of the plentiful pistillate flowers producing a seed this is another reason that natural cannabis populations tend toward predominantly pistol agem distillate hermaphrodite plants artificial hermaphrodites can be produced by hormone sprays mutilation and altered light cycles I think somebody mentioned without much phrase in the chat they can be produced by hormone sprays mutilation and altered light cycles these should I think somebody mentioned altered light cycles - these should prove most useful for fixing traits on sexual type sweet we have we have an informed crowd today drug strains are selected for strong dioecious tendencies some breeders select strains with the sex ratio more nearly approaching one than a strain with a high fistful at sex ratio they believe this reduces the chances of disturbed plants turning am Aphrodite later in the season now this is interesting seedlings and you know this I'm thinking this might be good if you're doing a lot and you can just eliminate a bunch of seedlings pretty quickly but let's see if I'm right no that that is what I like to do I mean it's kind of obvious once you start out a big population you get ones that are growing beautiful and then ones that you can grow or hotel or just runts compared to something's wrong with them that's yeah there's like three tiers right away in the second you start a bunch of seeds giant done I'm just saying from seeing what other people can can do you know observing other people's results they're gonna get like three tiers right off the bat which the first tier is easy to eliminate right off the bat and you're already weary of the second tier so and soon not long after that first tier is gone you might get rid of that second tier that's no good bosses elimination or something so how do you guys feel about rock Clark's theory that we smoked all in because it's probably a rental question there but I did what you want me to save that or answer that no what's up should I save that for later or that's real hell oh we're starting seedling traits here so it's the best answer for that is it all depends on what started all the hybrids we smoked today and if you follow the lineage of it it all comes back to like three countries but there's more but three main ones being Colombia Thailand and India okay so the India one is special because that's where at the most tourism was at the time and it also has the most range in latitudes and the most diverse micro climates and sub climates so southern India is way different climate than northern India northern India is more mountains it's like where the Himalayas start obviously and the southern is more of like Plains and jungles hills not so much mountainous at all and it's way more hot and it's right on the tropics yeah so it just so happened to be when people are taking strains out of India which all were indica that's what indica means is India some were more narrow leaf because they were growing in southern India some are more widely because they're going to the mountains in northern India all right so anyone that there any variety that has you know Indian genetics and it far enough down the line it depends on where they come from there so technically yeah everything somewhat is kind of indica but there's also subspecies that really didn't get labeled because unless the weed from Thailand came from India at some point then it's not the same then there would be tile indica or whatever however you would say some Latin phrase for Thailand you know there would be a subspecies just for Thailand or Southeast Asia like there is for China which is China insists China who Chen Ensis okay so that's the subspecies of Chinese wheat because it's totally different than indica and it's not Afghan occur subspecies it comes from Afghanistan is Afghan occur like we're talking with Amara and in your last interview yeah Australia there's yeah there's Australian varieties too so that it kind of depends and as far as anything we smoked I'm pretty sure yeah it either for a far enough down line either came from the mountains of India or the farms of India in the southern part of the counter I think that answers question yes we're moving on by the way we've had uh eight viewers are watching now and we've had a consistent viewers watching here for a bit six to eight and so we're really happy that people actually appreciate the information number two seedling traits seedling traits can be very useful in the efficient and purposeful selection of future parental stock if accurate selection can be exercised on small seedlings much larger populations can be grown for initial selection as less space is required to raise small seedlings than mature plants we all smoked in Tuco's I'm sorry I'm going back to the chat here I've seen some comments what's up mr. sparks lot good to see you let us know if you want to invite to say yes or no and I'll send you an invite and then we had another comment here by Bob dog he says they all smoke in because narrow leaf drug cultivars are cultivars are of indica ancestry historically interesting for those who study the fossil record Nitro no bat says enjoying the strained Wacka Wacka 88 says very interesting stuff right on appreciate that the backs of seedlings here and I think if I was pretty much right makes it easy because you can grow a lot more so this is like early selection like it says here so less space is required to raise small seedlings and mature plants corraled philo taxi and resistance corraled who what's world horeb I will taxi yes don't know I don't know if the world is sorry I know some people one person when they say world this air world maybe that's this person's way of saying world okay philo taxi and resistance to dampening off our two traits that may be selected just after emergence of the embryo from soil Wow early selection for vigor hardiness resistance and general growth form may be made when the seedlings are from 30 to 90 centimetres which has one to three feet tall leaf type height branching or other criteria for early selection these early selected plants cannot be bread until they mature but selection is the primary and most important step in plant improvement phyllo taxi is associated with subsequent anomalies in the growth cycle like multiple leaflets and flattened or Club stems also most horrid plants what is this horrible thing awesome was torold well when you read those flat and Club stems maybe that's like a agriculture term for mutated because what you just read there the flat and earth Club stems that's like it's not really like a disease or anything but it's like a bad gene in populations of certain varieties all around the world the flat one is more popular I don't haven't heard a clogged stems yeah well I don't know I've seen a lot of weird stands for I've seen cylindrical growing stems are great I've seen stems that are cylindrical and they have like a ribbing like some kind of like hexagonal ridging and then I've seen ones that are almost square shaped like they're bridging is like a [ __ ] and then the stem almost grows like squared straight up so but I've never seen flat I've never had that problem mr. sparks a lot I'm sending an invitation so if you do want to hop on just feel free to do so and we might as well add Cyclops if he wants to hop on my mind right now I think at people going up we've been going on Bob how long have we been going I know just trying to keep track 47 minutes what why we've only been going 7 minutes 47 oh holy [ __ ] I heard 7 and I freaked out sorry what a [ __ ] is a spinning tool used by K people for making twine it refers to the spiraled arrangement of a design okay yeah see that's some weird stem mutation then cuz I see a lot of weird things going on it with stems most common is just a normal cylindrical one with the little hexagonal ridging you know it's hexagonal or octagonal but I don't know but we're talking about that and roots for making clones for specific areas in there where the roots grow out of but at any rate but you're Bailey says I've seen a pic of a flat stem it's strange looking that would be strange multiple leaflets flatten or Club stems also most horror plants are stamina and whorls Philo taxi maybe sex-linked I don't know man welcome oh who is it mr. sparks ah okay thank you for blessing us with your presence how's it going still trying to get settled in I guess can't hear us we can hear you sparks lot can you hear us oh my bad it's all good you know I put my well I don't know why my settings changed oh but we're at a new camera and a new microphone but I think he's trying to use my webcam mic and I couldn't hear anything so I had to fix it my bad I mean no interrupt you guys but cheers everybody cheers man yes I think sir thanks for showing chase we appreciate it hey hello she in the bed now good okay she saw you earlier I think kwame's in so oh yeah yeah Matt Shannon you dare I said hello yeah carry on Keith going on and hopefully Green is back in the chat guys hopefully greed I believe he just started the channel and stuff so yeah check them out maybe give them some tips or whatnot it's got some good kind of consistent content too so ripped Purple's in the house yes I some purple let me know if you would I can in right in fact I'll invite you and you just hop on if you'd like to how about that ad people all right take this quick opportunity here to going on another dab mmm stop so fragrant man it's crazy I think it's because it's like at the very very first stages of buttering so the terpenes are the most volatile right now still good right you got there mr. sparks laughs a blood yeah when stuff is buttering I just like use it up all right I just go through it faster because to me I seem like it's uh something about to go steal something completely buttered out doesn't taste that great at all but when it's going from a SAP or shattered to butter that's usually when the terpenes are the most volatile and on a low temp tab to get the tastiest experience yeah that's what I like um the only thing just as good as that is fresh chatter fresh chatter will have about the same amount of taste but it'll have less smell because for whatever reason it's stability doesn't make it very volatile which means you don't get very much smell off a piece of shatter compared to like what you do with this butter Cheers red pill and everybody in the chat um we're gonna probably read this last part here Oh read about leaf traits and either end the show or chill chill for a little bit since we do have eight viewers so part three here or number three is leaf traits leaf traits vary greatly from strain to strain in addition to these regularly occurring variations and leaves there are a number of mutations and possible traits in leaf shape and may turn out that leaf shape is correlated with other traits and cannabis broad leaflets might be associated with a low calyx tweak ratio and narrow leaflets might be associated with a high calyx to leaf race ratio if this is the case early selection of seedlings by leaflets shape could determine the character of the flower flowering clusters at harvest both compound compound and webbed leaf variations seem to be hereditary and our general leaf characteristics a breeder may wish to develop a unique leaf shape for an ornament ornamental strain what's an ornamental strain or increase Liefeld for pulp production [Music] this justice no no no what I was trying to scroll down on on the text I'm like hurry up a read faster let me scroll down I couldn't hey you didn't hear the question what is an ornamental straight go like gonna pick it up on the tree just reading some more flowers we're talking about Canada so I don't know pretty strange whoa usually ornamentals are described as plants that aren't meant for like food production like they're meant for horticulture but not food production so I can't think about there's a few varieties I can't think of them now but some are you know usually the flower ones some are like meant to eat some remember like culinary dishes but other varieties are meant just for like a bouquet or something or like lon right landscaping right even though they're the same genus or species or whatever they might be so how does that marijuana who would want ornamental okay are they talking about in general or are we still talking about cannabis now that I think we're talking about like the old duals of weed now right we're talking about weed that looks pretty but there is aesthetic but might not have THC and that or it might not be good for hemp or might not be good for seed or you know yeah I gotcha I understand now a purple bud or something you know exotic looking but right if it's purple okay yeah if it's purple but it has no other good traits it has low THC both CBD low terpenes isn't good for fiber isn't good for seed yeah but think about it it with opal yeah Bob dog is saying uh ornamental strains are the variety pretend Iike pretend to God there you go that's a fun way of saying it and they look good but are not necessarily drug cultivars might be purple might smell like lemons but it's not making mass hatch right on their roots at the bottom of a button oh no I just got look for me Bob dog I'm dog I see them everywhere I know but looks familiar it's the odds of pictures oh but I'm looking at this Google crust or this might be as you to read in the protec module Lionel Richie yeah I know which is but his avatar icon looks like I see him everywhere too late I don't know why I'm not subscribed to well I'm probably not subscribed to Lucas he doesn't have a lot of videos out but he's always like answering questions when anybody has questions and then it's trippy I see him I'm alive too yeah I may hit that subscribe button but I know he's in a chat on your YouTube page are those roots like in the bottom like busting out at the bottom of a pot like inside of a bucket I don't know I'm coming off into it like it intrigues me they're gonna have to go to his channel right I mean I can screen so really it's crazy everybody go there Bob dogs YouTube page and look at his home page look at that this damn yeah like roots busting out of a 5 gallon bucket bits inside I don't know if that's on top of a lid or some sort or if that's like in a shallow give me some baby boots you know you might have been doing like a deep water culture maybe and he's already harvested and those are you know the roots that have aged it were just talking there's one percent one tip some nonsense they look like they're coming out of the bottom of the bucket that's crazy like he at the bottom of the bucket open or something yeah yeah what's up what's up with that bob-dog he says it's a five gallon bucket DWC that's what I said oh yeah I'm learning so yeah I'm actually gonna be my first DW or a hydro I give a whack I want to make my own bubble bucket or do you a PwC bucket just to try it out for mother plants and clones I don't see why I wouldn't do that cuz my favorite way of cloning is in a arrow kroehner and it would be most easy just from arrow cloner to go to ewc bucket and when the plant gets big enough again fill out a arrow corner ladies and gentlemen miss Plymouth the forest is in the house hey hey can you hit the clappy out aww applause soundtrack summer now you gotta find it let me see is it still on here I thought they were getting ready that [ __ ] I'm gonna moderate it called his videos running the app if he's already hit it like three times today you should already have the cursor right on it yep that was purple entire forest tripping yes hey Palooza guys we're gonna pick up next time at a peculiar leaf mutation alright pink 68 he works to keep these at an hour okay but you know I'll remember that but kill your leaf situation I'm the new guy yeah I can't wear out my voice you know oh so I got him heaven forbid beware out the voice surrounded by keeping them because nice then he can intervene nobody three times I'm gonna be the first thing in these three times baby oh you know maybe comet is after you gotta be everybody twice and I'm gonna hunt you down like gonna be me now hey you know how you said we'd faster you were trying to scroll down maybe you write that I should read faster one page 68 of a hundred and sixteen 68 well how long have you been with episode I'm already hitting it I think this is 1414 yeah months and months and months that would be like a year for hours sometimes from you being a blabbermouth in between each section though so don't feel so bad it's it's it's you with the restrictive time limit and me talking too much I know right it's all about the time I'm I could talk just as much and we could go to ours or I could talk less and we can keep going one hour yes you could I think we're doing fine I just the way it looks from the outside is funny you know all that where you mentioned yeah that's reality of it so it should be a connected it's just interesting we got a way to go I don't know I was actually thinking yesterday it'd be cool after all these are done if we're like around 24 of them obviously they're more that there's a few that are went over an hour but it would be cool to stay up a whole day and just watch him back back back only a psycho would do that don't do that well no don't no one keep I mean you could go back and edit all the videos and just I got the part of the great instead of yes and then have like aa audiobook of this our audio video audio video look I don't know what's your card and I'll be pretty cool man good evening yes won't get more sophisticated as time goes along maybe on our next book hole both these screen sharing and have pictures overlaid with the discussion in reading at the same time you know they said look the audiovisual I want to start doing another like two three-minute video segment like different uses of cannabis than him all right why did which industry doesn't want us to legalize hmm you know I want to start off a big formula I'm coming for you Big Pharma keep every movement as a man behind the curtain think of it that way I'm sorry we said everything every movement has a man behind the curtain think of it that way you're the man behind the curtain oh I didn't know that was a laugh man they need to like put it oh look they do and I get a pop-up that says that these little sounds are gonna go away in like two days no I think that Google effects are going away that's only one thing though I think Google effects I thought it was something else that they were taking away you're taking away our rights okay doesn't mean that wasn't that funny red pill I know you don't read the chat so just a couple cool uh what you call it comments in chat Bob dog said thanks for reading us a book but your baby me says yes I hate lead reading but I love to listen gain shutouts oh yeah I have that problem too sometime is that why you read short segments that that will make sense like can't we even yeah otherwise I become cross-eyed yeah Oh audio/video books with surrounded by teeth hey maybe people don't realize like being nod not distressed by reading at all as like it's skill or you know not like a possessed trait that everyone has what we're talking about traits breeding genetics I don't mean like literacy I just mean like if your eyes start to hurt after an hour reading some people maybe the reason they read all days because after an hour their eyes don't hurt our there are people like that we don't look after and I'm sleepy I'm not a big reader I've never been a big reader like I'm gonna [ __ ] what is about I agree about cannabis cars porn like cooking recipes it no matter anyone it's important one yeah porn like a dog okay not literature you know anything right yeah what subject my favorite subject the subject I hate the most like I hate reading you can show me I'll watch all day long and I'll pick up like that little bit as far as reading about it yeah I got books over here right now that I purchased it like it come it's in the book reading rainbow I can fly twice as hard it always comes back to that gosh levar burton in the Reading Rainbow you show me your age when peel that's awesome I feel like if it's a good coming day each moment when you can sing that and sub you're really talking about you know it's funny like I made a video the other day and I said somehow et I'm like literally today I'm looking at somebody's video cover and who the [ __ ] is on me et and I don't know if I inspired that person to do like a show or a segment or something about et but it just ripped me the [ __ ] out like wow just speed things up man and it happens so you guys always be positive don't be negative because you speak negatively good negativity is gonna happen so I ET says man be cool hey guys I have a special guest here with me without revealing too much information he's don't tell them anything okay oh that's messed up in the name okay you got a special guest though that's what's up yeah special guest I'm supposed to be a very dear dear person he can't hear you but I'm up with the microphone bye it's gonna just something out of his dad taught him this his dad's an awesome person by the way [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] that was great yeah we're live love you buddy yeah thank you you're awesome Oh what are we looking at rental is this live guys are awesome and chat who's our seed bearing plants bearing bearing somebody's breeding are there many breeding songs we need more breeding songs people rap rock whatever but yeah we're gonna end this over here with red pills beautiful garden experiment beading experiment and mr. sparkling for your visit good to see you man here help me and happy and rolling you're going good these days bro [ __ ] the could work with the grows oh yeah you promised me a cloning of video so they take your time with that no pressure I'm just saying I'm looking forward to it more advice I can get the better thank you for everyone showing up today Thank You sparks lot stopping by and thanks for Keith for doing some live music or thank you your son I think it was supposed to be a special guest thank you special guest I'm surrounded by key you seen a guy you big shout out to the chat man big set out to the chat but thank you it's round like you even know I think my garden is doing super crappy right now I appreciate it I'm in this super busy that's why you guys have not seen him out of uploads for me lately but there will come a time where my season slows down so I can get back in the garden love one I'll make that video as soon as I'm I don't know it'll be a while for I take walk home with Keith but I'll get him out I'll make the videos as I next time I call it probably a couple weeks they'll learn that these there I won't know what I know the nest yeah so I had to when I plant it clones is at that same time in fact some sometime around 4:20 or before 4:20 yeah man thanks again mr. sparks watt look for him sell them up red pill here - thanks guys shoutouts to the viewers guys Bend reach out to everyone till the

talking with you longer time to smoke one taking the message to the people down do smoking man growing and watch it prohibition fall down we can bake America what's going on how's it going grow talk this weekend cannabis you know stuff yes sir all combined into one one fine hour of entertainment guys who got the good show today I always say that I mean dude what day is it Monday today Monday Monday everybody it's yeah starting off you see wouldn't start the Schomburg hey we have a we have a half-assed show for you today so hang in there whoo it was not a well no no no we're all good to go we're all good to go guys no yeah let's get into it man we're gonna talk a little bit about I think we talked a little bit you uh you visited the doctor I'm gonna talk a little bit about that today no absolutely man absolutely should we shout out to our crew first man our sponsors the EP all that good stuff man and you know what's going on because I will all right here yeah I'm throwing you curveballs yeah do it no I'll give it up as I usually do to recharge dude I got a story man recharge the soil microbe knock you know inoculant and did I went to renew my med card man and the guy there was filling out the paperwork and looked at me had no idea or anything like that whatever and then I was right my egos what's your email address is Scott at real growers calm it's like Scotty real recharge you know and whoa man II had no idea who I was no idea who the about the podcast but knew about recharges like I love this product I recommend it to everyone he goes I give it away to people and I was just like [ __ ] yes man that makes me feel so good to run into people yeah that's totally awesome totally caught the micro vibes so shout-out to you Andrew right on oh you know what your end of the cares as well see a re s is a place if you're in the Fort Collins area these guys it's just a super cool doctor that runs it just a little simple no frills hundred bucks you get your medical recommendation and just a great guy man you can really talk to him he's you know just been in the business for a long time to where it really understands a real compassionate doctor that's that ask you yeah you think cannabis I'll help you yeah you're medically you think it'll help you okay great and so do I mean what more could you ask for man really cool guy more research dude give yourselves a win-win people help support the show support your garden and pick yourself up some recharge over it real girls calm or just go ahead and yell at your phone Scottie says while in Amazon real growers recharge pick it up or at Amazon Prime as well absolutely man check that stuff out it feels good to turn people on to that man I'm gonna talk about some rx green solutions actually I've done that in just a little bit if I could recommend checking out man I can't say recommend checking out one thing I do like I've told you guys there axiom harpin protein great pest manager will say IPM pest management integrated pest management product as far as making your plants stronger more resilient for when things do come into the garden they can be like f off you know I don't want you in here man this is not lexan homeboy lexan you want some of this that's a spray solution guys that you can use in almost any point your grow doesn't really have a residual that's left a stinky smell or anything it's one reason I really like it as well as if you haven't checked out my brand right guru Mike here what it's the ISR it's doing yeah it's triggering its a its immune system to pretty much activate all its defences and just get ready for any it's treating as if it's completely covered in bugs when there's nothing there so when something comes in its ready to fight off and it has a better chance of fighting off whatever's coming in interesting stuff man I like it tricking the plant guys really good base base nutrients really simple program if you want to run it as easy as just their two-part like I did you can as well around there a and B and recharge and kick tasks gruesome great island sweets now came up with the executive producer oz chat and just yesterday with Paul man Paul former glassworks he has been hanging out on sitting right here so I might as well hold it yes second if you're watching the video show check it out because it has things that like Paul is so different like I don't I love the fact that we've got a couple blast blowers in the crew Matt is like a bulletproof glass guy like I go mudding with Matt and he's got you know he's just like he's like I build the glass to withstand me you know so that's like the daily driver stuff this is a piece of art right here I guess these are called shower heads inside there I mean there is so much intricacy going on inside this bong [ __ ] I want to call this a water pipe guys this thing he's always rooting for us man we're at BS and he wants to support the show with making a couple more pieces of glass like that to try and do what he called which we haven't fully done a membership drive you know let's try and auction off some really nice glass but I also I'm working on getting the pollen the pollen collector is that what they're called just work on getting me mine that he already gave me man how about that bro him I think I do I do have one here you can have that one the one that was maybe yours I gave the van rip stir I don't know you know what I still didn't stole your bong but I don't feel like giving that back to you you guys the nectar collectors it's like a mini handheld rig kind of if you will for hitting the most efficient way to do that it's my personal favorite way to take dabs dude that's the same way a trip stirs been loving it so as like screw this so we're trying to get a grip of them in guys some they'll be DGC at not etched on I think it's either extra baked I don't know which way but custom he'll say DGC on it some little nectar collectors we're trying to come up with some more merch ideas to help support the show and whatnot plus people are digging it and I need something man I need something I have rosin here of great rosin here and I don't think the pen is maybe in a pinch you're going somebody are doing something the Pens good but when you need to just be chilling at home you gonna have to get a torch I never thought I would own a torch but you know what a shout-out to who is it females is that right who's the nail guy that somebody we got Dee nail and then B nail as a Fort Collins company I'm Dyslexic - man that ain't no good for me man you know anyway we got a couple of email guys we're gonna check out and man that might be better for you the torch does make me feel a little [ __ ] up man when I got to light the torch up and I get you know but with the nectar collectors you can get those really small torches and they're hot enough to get it hot enough to take a DAB now I just feel like a really see [ __ ] up you know man let's get into what's going on guys yes sir you know a little bit of this a little bit of that so you went to the doctor and what is your what is your ailment sir what was the requirement did you have to bring paperwork did you how does it work we just said hello to each other this time man I was kind of like the I dig your style dude and he goes yeah man yeah but I have a sacra Aliya a swollen sacroiliac joint that's constantly inflamed so I have an MRI that allows me to qualify for medical cannabis but this guy is really cool man I like the way these doctors play it and they're not you know how do you want to got to go in there and you're trying to make Trump everything up and make up a story guys like I was like yeah you know doc few years ago I fell off my motor you know 10 12 years ago I thought my motorcycle had a little bit of a limp ever since man you know oh yeah we got a lot of common meat too here you go BAM oh okay so it's not really I mean depending obviously different doctors can be different in different states different laws etc look like he would smoke with me abscess because you're a doctor what's that mean you went to med school right how does that mean that you don't like Potter you don't smoke weed why is that mutually exclusive and I mean I can see probably for insurance regulations of your surgeon or something like that you probably can't have THC in your system but if you're just a guy right now med cards man smoke away enjoy your life I think that's a whole boys doing so it's a I forgot the doctors name but it cares see a re so now do you have a plant count too yeah that was interesting I had to redo my paperwork because it goes that says here how many plants do you want you know do you want to be able to grow so what would you put is that a trick question or what well we 24 for me I put I mean it probably put I put 36 I wasn't too greedy but what he said to me was that there he goes I will give you a 12 plus 4 is the most we can give you so 16 plant count is the most that the states recognizing but he goes honestly I've been hearing stories about people getting their doors kicked in and they don't really are just getting their paperwork checked in their gardens checked they don't give a [ __ ] about going slightly over the plant they give a [ __ ] about going hundreds over to plant County goes there's a guy that you got caught with 410 plants he's going to jail but if you're just a few plants over and this is just hearsay you know but what they said was what I heard was that they don't really give a [ __ ] they're not about to bust your balls for a few plants over the count what they are at least in my town of Fort Collins though the town that I live outside of now they're lucky you yeah man the town I live in is mostly under water thank you but in the town of Fort Collins there's an HID band that's what they're coming after they're coming after you trying to give you a fine for running HID lights because it's a lot more clear-cut than taking you to uh yeah but didn't you guys say no you weren't you weren't including so you got a six by sixteen plant count now I have a sixteen plant count now yes sir okay so officially no I won't say no more excuses about plant count that still wasn't the greatest plant count for when you're trying to I was told it's a gray area sir I tell Evan I've been mentioning that on the show man I said there's not all these you know if it's a I don't know what would you say so it's like what Larimer County but Fort Collins police that would actually probably be enforcing it a plant count or would it be it's a criminal code or is it some type of code and it is code enforcement I really don't know I'm pretty sure they hid is code enforcement because that's not a criminal charge at all I feel like it's like a traffic ticket I got a good prank I can play on guru to find out though man I don't like where this is so at that point now you don't know is it still a gray area with 315 so those H considered hid that is the gray area I really don't know 315 is a very efficient light and I mean dude I have a 400 watt metal halide outside above my barbecue that they installed dude definitely I mean if any tennis courts or any any kind of outdoor lighting it starts with what 250 watt and at 400 Jesus I need 400 watts to barbecue when you put a light up you know twelve foot up like it lights up the whole area dude outdoor lighting this and we growers didn't invent HID lights they came from outdoor lighting they came from warehouse lighting till LED came around they were the most efficient lights going that's why when you had a warehouse say you know a Costco they had to run a hundred lights in you got a hundred six hundred watt metal halide lights and that's that's what you had a decent sized power bill to your Costco is one hundred lighter yeah I hear you I hear you yes sir yes sir conclusion look I just want to smoke some weed now and so somebody else talking go ahead go ahead and smoke some weed I'm working on member looking at my you know my camera here working on somebody in the youtubes said that when we were hanging out there was sub sub cool that I looked constipated and bored I don't know if I've ever seen you constipated so I can't I have to defer anyway I'll work on that today I'll try to be all smiles for you guys you know what man people are gonna appreciate the differences between me and you man I sometimes will talk to folks that watch the show and I'll be like man we're pretty a pretty damn good friends and we sure [ __ ] are a lot different man opposites attract thing so yes sir I'll be the bubbly one man well I did go to so exciting a recently a baseball game actually my wife got some tickets through work and it was actually like kind of a work thing I take a half day at work and take your family to the ball game if you'd like and hang out with coworkers the people you don't want to hang out with outside of work anyway so we go over there and I'm like whatever screw it I got a couple edibles down here I'm gonna try and I think I don't have them in front of me there are 18 milligram gummies so I was like okay I'll take these or something like that yeah exactly I took two and what are you and are you ensuing that we should give edibles to kids Scotty anyway the two and I was pretty much on not a light stomach actually I just eaten some yogurt and stuff so but regardless I knew within 45 minutes an hour that starts again and then they were starting to kick in a little bit as I was going into the ballpark and I haven't been in a crowd crowd space in a while and that in its own I'm not like a person that fears crowds at all I could be in a busy New York city intersection or whatever and be okay it's not yes - it takes acid and goes to a bullfight there the so the UH ya know just they're kicking in a little which makes for interesting people washing you know anyway when you're in a crowded space people watching it and just sitting there and being like man I'm getting pretty pretty high up here and then like you look at you look at different people's face and then I just start telling my brain the story behind like who they are who they might be alright could I have been could I have been that person you know smoking weed I score I knew everybody I walk up to everybody and be like dude it's you oh sorry man I don't know you everybody really yes so anyway we're standing in front of the elevator getting ready to go up to the suite and then I listened I felt like I looked over at my son and he's like whoa like it like a way like whoa something just came over me a little bit I was like okay you're good deep breath deep like almost like you're gonna feel a little faint or something right and then I was like what do we call this dude is it's like an edible flash you know like the women have their hot flashes you know in the emergency room I know because I'm come because I'm comparing no no no I'm just saying that it sounds like gonna wake up on the ground one day man you know it wasn't super uncomfortable or painful is just like okay right I think it was just that I don't know if you've been on a double spurt forward it was to the point what happened really is okay took some deep breaths Mike I'm okay I know what that is I just need to get myself and I got an iced tea in a ballpark dog or whatever and I needed to get some substance in me you know and the Le yeah they had ice tea there that's the problem man you need to drink a beer you're the dude um I did have a couple laughter lay a little bit later but regardless it is fun like that the point was one edibles sometimes in a crowd people watching festive situation as always I give that a recommendation and then also yeah just plan ahead it definitely i one thing I forgot is for me edibles always for at least when they're coming on I need to have water no matter what oh my like ass or something it's like cottonmouth from inside it's like water just exam it's hard to counter that yeah oh man I can't believe you're eating a 250 I mean a 250 I think would make me be one of those people that calls and I think I'm dying but listen listen time's going by really slow this is what's [ __ ] up about it though so my mom came into town who's very very straight she's got no problem with me smoking cannabis because I'm not a complete loser but if I was she probably would have a problem with it but it's very straight man and I only did like three I went and did three dabs yesterday I just wanted to did one about eleven you know maybe another one about four in the afternoon and I think one about eight and I didn't think I wasn't like I was like Jones in the smoke more those three dad's got me highest [ __ ] as a matter of fact there's this look that I've never seen from her that's your high now look you know it's like a little bit of confusion a little bit of verification you know and what's it called it's a it's a like you know like I just came got some coffee showed up it's you know 9 in the morning maybe a little bit baked and she just looks at me a little confused look you know like you're baked now it's it's 9:00 in the morning Scotty but I don't expect didn't understand everything sir I tell you what yeah it's not it's not a time of the day the thing per se it's a little bit different if yeah you wake up and you crack a crack a beer at 80 I mean she's comparing it to manically an issue there but yeah dude I've had to try to explain you know she's under 70 so I'm trying you know I try to explain things right delicately or whatever so Oh meme she was asking me what a meme was and so I so we're laughs at the bottom and stuff like that and then my 12 year old goes yeah meme she goes uh memes are dank dank memes man she just says the word dank and memes together and I'm just like gulp man gulp isn't that a such a sight or something isn't that a meme site dank memes or gay no but my mom just looks at me and goes ooh what okay and I like [ __ ] now I have to explain this man you know you explain dank rather well without using God's [ __ ] or skunks [ __ ] yeah it's not that easy to explain what dank is man so yeah I just went with you know it's kind of like smell yeah it's the smell smells good you know and then so she just proceeded to misuse it about 12 times in a row by talking about things that smell good you know these roses are boy dinner sure smells dank tonight man Scotty here homemade pizza oven his day oh [ __ ] yes we do Urban Dictionary dankmemes is an ironic expression used to mock online viral media and in jokes that have exhausted their comedic value to the point of being try the che do dank means it smells so nasty I want to smoke it that's what thank me it's man this is dank originally coined as a term for high-quality marijuana Sarris Tarek Lee used as a synonym for cool yeah but you smell any like Jesus Christ man you know I mean it's like a disturbing kind of smell it's not it's not like Pleasant you're not smelling roses you can't bring it over to anything you can always cross over with the the the sexual adjectives like it's what Solaris that people like man how was how was that run man dude it was doggy but it was just I got one thinking thinking whatever that terpene is that makes cat piss alright you know what I mean you ever smelled that Alaska Thunder [ __ ] the ATF weed has a cat piss kind of terpenes smell to it where like if you smell that bag or if that those bags are just sitting around your car or something like that you're like you get in there you go man your car smells like cat piss smells [ __ ] dank man let's smoke some of that [ __ ] you know you wouldn't think of cat piss as being something that you would want to [ __ ] get close to right I'm gonna start using it for everything dank dank day man yeah you and my mother the windows dank jumped a shark man when my mom starts using it I think so hey dude I know I was just at the cup but uh man there's a lot to talk about there I kind of want organize my thoughts I got a whole bunch of footage that I took from there so many cool people thank you so much Malik bro for for hosting and hanging out man and man I'm just gonna shout out to everybody tomorrow I got my notes I don't have them all organized so can we just hang out on a cannabis cup talk till tomorrow but just want to say very cool man very cool event and nothing but positivity in there I even like rap music yes we can do that I was just thinking I wanted to ask goober to that uh we just had a quick a quick edit in the show guru if we if I were to change like my shirt or put my face right in front of the camera wouldn't that make a really fun edit where it's like it would switch from us normally talking to then when you do an edit on on the show like you obviously take some time out and come back so that would be cool I think I'm have to do are just like a you mark an edit and then it would change to me just sitting here with no shirt on or just something goofy I'm just thinking of fun things to do in the future market I'm thinking Roos already guys work cut out for him and he's not yelled at me for my green shirt I'm wearing will see it really a bench green on here just sure to check out straight out shout out to shout out to Hawaii I know Hawai is listening but I got a little souvenir Hawaiian shirt on let's get it on track brother what else we got what else we got oh my god Scotty real wants to get on track today so sir yes card renewed I guess we'll wind it out with that was just a sign of the time sign of the times going to the bank you know the bank's a place of business don't have to be perfect people got kids so one of the ladies not that works there but a lady doing some banking she was up at the counter and she had one younger kid probably two-year-old like popped up on the counter with her and then she had like I don't know five year old maybe four year old sitting on the floor on week with her iPhone looking at some sort of animated [ __ ] with her phone turned up as loud as it could possibly go so everybody could hear it you know why not just let everybody enjoy my five year olds cartoon time the kids on the floor looking at her phone he's not even looking at which I noted ahead he's not even he's not even holding like the rotation right on the phone to look at the cartoon properly again showing it was just making the kid dumber and a stupid distraction yeah what's up folks is st. normal have a little just have a little respect not only for the people around you but for you just don't I mean I understand it's a younger child but you start teaching kids [ __ ] all the time all the time depends on the parent knows man if the parents don't know then the child don't know if the parent wasn't taught to child want to talk it just drives me crazy when you do you have it more and more these days where we didn't grow up with it and probably whatever I don't know what we're gonna call this square I guess screen generation you know once we'll call them the screeners this tiny new way it's just so much reliance with parity murder like oh my kids not being good hold on here Chuck your phone would Adam turn it up all the way put some stupid [ __ ] on it it's just kids man I was when I was getting my medical card I was sitting there and there was I just looked over every single person was on their screen and I was just like I just finished filling out the paperwork and the option you know the immediate reaction is to pull out your screen but I just looked over I was like [ __ ] I'm gonna be that one guy that's not on this screen because I force it I do that do I have that feeling like you want to be the person like you just said go ahead this chick comes in and she goes hey how's everybody doing and everybody just like looked at her like she was like they're like dude that was like it took a minute or two to register so you're like good how are you cuz everybody was just staring at through screens man it was weird yeah I have a couple sayings I've said before in the show where it's interesting now not all places but if you go belly up to a bar and get a pint or something look left look right nobody's talking everybody on the phone and then this just this is just last night actually I went out and did like 15 mile road ride a little road ride with the pit stop at the end at a brewery that's by my house that I like called locavore go in there go outside and I want to sit on the patio and there's no picnic table for itself so there's one picnic table with a girl sitting in I'm like you mind if I catch a seat here so of course so we both are sitting there and then I pull out my phone of course and we're both look our screens I'm like okay don't be this guy so put it down for a little bit and I'm like so you know and you ain't got a menu it makes anything good anything good automate I kept trying to make me think conversations like the light conversation if y'all want to start a conversation just kind of yeah so I have herpes yes no it's pretty clear do not whatever I'm not trying to hit on this woman just make conversation etc that's what you do the herpes thing for it makes you totally disarming right off the bat man she knows you know I thought there was uh yeah I'm not gonna go there I got some good jokes but this is not that show anyway so it is true you gotta sometimes force it in this day and age where you're like damn man this you know it's it's it takes away from from stuff if you let it it helps with other things I know you like the phone Scotty with its connections and conveniences it has to be able to talk and network and with socialize with love be able to say to the DGC hey I decided let the last minute I want to go to the cannabis cup anybody wants to hit me up just you know leave your

these using their life and the coning gel right time nice pitch these in rip stirs pictures i don't know man okay so what's on the bottom guru hop on the mic for a second man and tell me what's up with TG a genetics i know it so there are so many breeders that go under TGA genetics how does it work it's like a collective of breeders they were work i guess under sub cool and they all sell seeds through the sub cool name and i guess they all have a common lineage right weird it's a ton of growers that just one person with a breeding project wouldn't be able to go through and do everything so that they distribute it and have a ton of testers and ton of other breeders that'll come and then come together with something and then they have that as their final product now that makes sense to me man that makes sense so this is a jinx proof genetics right here is what that is i guess that's one of sub cools guys one of the disciples yep nice very cool well let's do notes for you rip stir like you know net nine pound hammer i'm a time and you can use those over in the DC just click on DG c shop so where you burn your nugs you know it's where you hang out and burn nugs yes I can get some gear can get some nutrients there's some silicone containers in there actually I know rip stirs been experimenting I'll say with using the nectar collector right in the silicone container and he did hear the episode where you said your container guys says be wary of that he said well he's only bringing it up to like 250 degrees is like look I'm only bringing it up to like 250 he's like can I've tested it I've heated my the end of the nectar collector up like a shit-ton and just held it on there for the hell of it to see if I could get burned into it yes he's like he left a little mark but he's not dabbing that hot anyways you know I'm rolling in the 250s yeah yes yes sir perfect all right guys thanks for the tank nugs there see here this is interesting man all right so check this out there's a little growers love man and we got you know the DTC is awesome and there are strengths stoner Steve thank you so much for this post man this is a really interesting cloning exploding experiment dude gross dot-com cloning - experiment what's up what's going on DGC so I've been hearing a lot about a low and cloning coating the stem with recharge etcetera so I tried so I decided to try six slightly different methods first ones a low second ones clone ex third ones a low and recharge fourth one is clone ex and recharge a low clonic sand straight scraping the the epidermis off the bottom of the cuttings they have an epidermis - that's cool it looks like the clone x plus recharge + scrape maybe work to the base yep okay so that's a six method yeah I mean that it's pretty awesome I just love the fact that we're getting guys that you might call your said you'd better watch it stoner Steve you might get that stoner badge removed - man pretty [ __ ] and pretty analytical here man so what he's doing is multivariable testing this is what brought us out of the dark ages man is once we started figuring the scientific method and a and B testing testing hypothesis is when we figure started figuring out what worked man and unfortunately in cases there's so much stuff that's just anecdotal we're like it worked I just use it and it works and there's one obvious difference what's that after four hours all the clones on the clone x side looked like they had been cut off the mother slight wilt and kind of thing leaves not praying okay the a low side didn't even look like it had been amputated and continued to pray interesting yeah let's see if that aloes thick it must seal up that on that or that wound so that the moisture can escape but if you notice like clone acts kind of looks like aloe gel doesn't it yeah this is really good detail here guys beautiful isn't it man I'm right go visit it over in dude girls calm where's this ad on the site cloning experiment cloning do grows like calm cloning - experiment it is in the blood blood is in the growing section cool check it out guys and men really concerning information I'm not gonna be cloning anytime soon I was tempted to clone when he popping someone out yeah I was just getting all stressed out on it like it's dude I gotta clone this Harlequin out I don't not really fitting into my garden schedule right now so I just do what you do when you don't want a clone I repotted it into a 30 gallon fabric pot and threw it in the bloom room you know what I mean I'm saying I know what you're saying dude yes sir hey can I just real quick man DGC hashtag DGC guest is to try to identify guess we're trying to do a little bit better as soon as the studio is finished and I'm back in it I will be just trying to get as many people to talk to me as possible man as many guests I was talking to dirt man Dan this morning who's got his own podcast very cool check that one out I'd like to get him on the show and I don't want to get also let's keep in mind we do have the studio in Fort Collins there was and it's not all the time did it's a modern world there is a point being made and whoever listens that says here I go I'm gonna I think it was said I maybe I shoved my head up Joe Rogan's ass or something like that when I talk about him or something sometimes but regardless I was listening to show the other day and I forgot which guess was on it might have been wheeler Walker jr. or something but they're making the point and I felt this when we interviewed mr. Sol from Brothers Grimm yes sir if that would have been a Skype interview with him we still it still would have been good would it have been nearly as good as having somebody sit next to you get the vibe off them you can you know see what they're wearing you can kind of you know you can get a feeling I really love it when we have the opportunity to interview people in studio so if you guys we're at that stood in Fort Collins anybody coming through Colorado coming through Denver we'd like to hook up because this is kind of a hub so keep that in mind - I'd love to be able to interview people in

total cook it up guys in your I guess the notes you put the hashtag dude grow show and we're trying to grab some tank nugs off Instagram and just say what's up to you guys appreciate the hanging out yes Rosie doe don't forget groves Ito thank you for pulling on our into the social media realm it's what should we do before go talk yeah this one's interesting check this out okay what's one the mother new store I got okay yeah yaoi man you can talk about this man right yes his thought is critic and say know that in a court of law the title of this is out of the Washington Post officer who shot falando Castile said smell of marijuana made him fear for his life dude so did you see the footage of what have this know if you didn't you want to talk about it because they just murdered assassinated him basically I could that's what I thought it was unbelievable about the fact that they're I mean they're trying to go for any defense possible but in his quotes the officer Jeremy no Yanis he says I thought I was going to die I thought if and I thought if he he has the guts and the audacity to smoke marijuana in front of the five year old girl and risk her lungs and risk her life by giving her secondhand smoke and the front seat passenger doing the same thing then what care does he give about me and I let off the rounds that was his life he's trying to tell me that he used launched it and he goes and I let off the rounds and the rounds were off the little girl was screaming so pretty captain Insano I can't believe it but he knows this it's pretty [ __ ] and you know us against them they're the enemy and sometimes the enemy has to be fired seven shots into a man reaching for his wallet that if if he had a gun and he planned on using on him there's no way he would ever be like officer I just wanted to let you know I had a gun I have a gun on me it's it's disturbing me it's extremely disturbing yeah what's the guy at Trevor Noah did I know there's like a little I honestly didn't I don't normally don't participate in this kind of stuff because it bothers me a lot and Trevor Noah had this thing that came on after the dude grow show it selected it for me and played it and also I'm watching this guy get shot it's 7:30 in the morning with my coffee Trevor Noah's I mean if anyone doesn't know he does a Daily Show on Comedy Central sure he's the comedian and in no way is he joking at all in this and I think it watching this guess what he's he's darker than me he's a different shade I would you know he does he have to worry about I mean I guess he's rich so maybe people might recognize him but you know people that shade to worry about getting shot man hey it seems like there's a lot of you know a lot of problems what cops want to shoot anybody white man here's the problem in this specific one because basically you know we know as marijuana claims are insane oh they go they go on in the article to explain that researchers know effects of marijuana use in numerous studies have demonstrated that marijuana tends to decrease aggression you know there's plenty of other drugs you'd be worried about and then it goes on that Jana Jana is the officer statement is puzzling secondhand smoke exposure with a clear and present danger to officers life like that's insane abut what isn't in say no say no law enforcement that was those I know those are words but he said those expecting that to work what world does he live know what world do we live in that he said that and it did work I don't know I guess yeah I guess that is a good question brother well here's the ending of it says he did get acquitted his attorney stated the status of being stoned and then in parentheses in an acute and chronic sense explains why mr. Castile one did not follow the repeated directions of officer honest 0.2 stared straight ahead and avoided eye contact pointless never mentioned he had a carry permit but instead said he had a gun and point four he did not show his hands the lowers rote and emotion so this is where the exact problem comes in I'm not saying anything's justified I don't know enough about the damn case but you cannot be and you know I don't know if he was just looking forward with hands on the wheel or what he said or how it came out that he had a gun but there were the words I have a gun I guess came out of his mouth is what they're saying here it's but even before he said that the officer probably knew he had he knows when you run his plates and [ __ ] you figure out that he had a permit to carry what's on you hear the audio and see the video you're like wow wow you know it's it's no disturbing that the cop got off it's and it's not like he says I have a gun he says I just wanted to let you know officer I have a firearm on me like that is the I guess he did leave out the part where if you are concealed carry permit holder you're supposed to say I have a concealed carry permit in carrying a firearm with me but even thin that's well here's maybe the last point that none of us will know because there's maybe not a video for it was and this isn't quotation marks from or this is out of the closing statement for the officers attorney and he goes had it not been for Castillo's decision to get stoned on marijuana before operating a vehicle while armed with a gun and further his decision to ignore the officer's commands not to reach for his firearm so they're straight up saying he was reaching for his firearm which you know I wasn't there I have no idea but that would be a major issue but regardless Wow I can't believe that they brought cannabis into the story I mean they're gonna do everything they can to get this officer quit rather rather insulting but anyway I didn't I was a unaware of the video so sorry if I brought down some bad news it's just amazing I was hanging out yesterday just trying to build the show I was listening to music in my headphones and I had one headphone in and one out can I want to try to participate in the family and my wife who's just kind of watching flipping the channels and I think she walked away from the TV for a little bit and the channel change and it was murder it was just some kind of like here watch when this person committed murder you might as well been OJ or something like that you know and they're like that you they can make something you know TV you know it doesn't take a ton of talent to make media about somebody's lowest point you know you just find somebody's lowest point and people seem to gravitate towards it this guy lit 46 years and then he killed somebody let's talk about him killing somebody man I checked out the newspaper this morning it's like named release for the dead body here you know this this person died here they loved guy guess cuz life's 100% fatal everybody's gonna die they love teasing you with that [ __ ] and scaring them with that [ __ ] it's just [ __ ] easy and it's not creative at all and now what's happening is it's poisoning people we don't know it just like me on the lead in the water poisons people this [ __ ] our TV is poisoning people where this guy says oh man I seen 10,000 images of black guy shooting cops on TV and in the movies and I seen 10,000 images of shootouts and even like the image of what I'm supposed to be as a cop has been shaped to me from TV and movies so yeah and drugs are bad by the way man they always told the drugs cool it's got smells like drugs he's probably bad he's got a gun two strikes man huh you know what I mean it's time you say that sound we have a hashtag [ __ ] on [ __ ] on sesame sessions you know it's a tongue twister as well you know in sessions I mean it's just you know these cops now I saw that my Fort Collins Police Department has it's gonna have a new chief and they're looking for a new chief and it's important man that they get it right daddy for chief you're right I don't want to hang out with cops man but it's important that they you know the culture of being a cop is man you got to kind of know how to be a bully a little bit man you got to know how to walk it you gotta walk into a [ __ ] place where a guy just beat his wife up and [ __ ] take control of that guy and rip them in the [ __ ] you know rip his hands behind his back and throw them in your car you better you know that's being authoritative you know so I understand there's different people in the world and you take the kind of people that have those type of skill sets and you make them in the cops you ask them to protect and serve the community I got it but we got to contain this as well you could understand that when you take those aggressive tight people that you have to put some kind of safeguards in there to make sure these guys aren't going nuts man and it seems this guy seems to be going not not in a bad way not in a freaking I'm gonna kill everybody Stephen Segal way but just in a way where he was haunted and as soon as he had you know as soon as he was threatened in that least bit not really even threatened just in a situation that could have possibly been threatened he freaking shot a guy four times so he's reaching for his wallet yeah yeah definitely I was reading yeah it's horrible that yeah the the witness that was in the car with him said he was simply reaching for his license and repeatedly said he was not reaching for a firearm no and one of the most like I mean obviously the shooting is disturbing but afterwards she has the presence of mind to still call him sir he has just killed her husband or boyfriend what about a four year old in a car no the four year old kissing her mom and telling her it's gonna be okay can we move on that's way too heavy all right well then what do you have Scotty take a break where's the happiness we can walk clear Anika's [ __ ] you got me home I'm gonna help bro all right taking a break to get high yes sir I've been getting high though I'm done with that and a [ __ ] doesn't mean I can't hire sure I'm not insinuating that we'll be right back guys check it out all out of dude gross dot-com and lived right back [Music] there's someone growin over there feeding his family while living with the fear cuz there's a lawman with a pen in his hand telling us what we can and can't grow on our land think it's time to light up and pass one round stop locking people up for smoking down [Music] there's weed still burnin in the ball it's a freedom we've been learning all along [Music] good people opening their minds get in so much resistance from the closed and unkind think it's time to light up and pass one round stop locking people up for spoken down [Music] in time the last fall in defeat I can't deny nature's truth in weed laughing and feeling good inside instead of by xanax bro urban get high think it's time to light up and pass one round stop locking people up for smoking just like all right man back in it I did not know that that Scotty real actually saw that that video for the first time recently so we had to pull it up or pull back on the break we're good to go we're he getting to grow talk to cheer us up and give a shout-out to get dyna-gro before I do dyna-gro which as you've heard recently there are enzyme there new enzyme I got to get my hands on as far as a very economical one I don't have many GGC reports on I know some people got some hands on products from them I just you know hanging out I want to try your enzyme yeah but man they just have such a simple formula I was just actually talking to Shannon so sorry I'll get I'll get the gross stories name but it's a badass gross tour in Oregon that's like dude I deal in 15 products man I know what I'm doing and you know we got a system out here and it was dyna-gro as their base they forwards Pro I'm trying to think what else they were using definitely the silica and then they were using just a really good quality fish emulsions or some oregon fish emotions they were using and we're gonna be getting this guy on the show yeah yeah and then recharge and it was awesome max it was Mac from max man that's who it was an Oregon interesting guide man knows a lot about microbes do oh yeah they're just like we said it's one of those it kind of falls it's like what we say about girl Mars first quality based nutrients economical like a good value nothing gimmicky with it just the straight quality nutrients so check him out guys data grows pretty much I remember it was one of those that they're like all over they'd be like it it'd be the first one like if your garden centers taken in something as far as a new tree not even full hydro storage it is but now their cannabis specific too which is cool over on their website you can click on industry and one of the images shows a bunch of like a canopy of a cannabis garden and yes we've said we do like people that are you know given respect to what we're doing it's cannabis growers and that's where we need your expertise in not you know other you know talking talking code and [ __ ] I also like cool people man I remember I don't know if they still have it but he's have a huge half in their place man like to [ __ ] cool people I need to give cool people my money man I like to see what they do with it well let's get into we're gonna base and recharge recharge add actually got a hydro store here yeah man whoo we got Selita Selita hydroponics in Salida Colorado you must know these guys I think it's the lightest sorry gets light up but so light a hydroponic support supply all right word yes sir yes sir hook it up guys always in any stores it sounds far don't forget that if you guys hook up recharge in your own store just the easiest way go over to real growers dot-com forward slash sample you can get stuff out to the store for you to get and then you can get samples or if you just hook it up we're also doing what was it I think mm nugs enough to get a dude gross t-shirt or whatever you want or in the store if you actually get recharge hooked up just let us know say my store want some recharge and much much appreciated out I'm spending my life savings on recharge samples I'm leveraging it man I hope it works out what is that a parlay in that a parlay bro sounds like done gotta do we'll see what happens man but so I'm getting a bunch of samples made like have to get like fifty thousand of them made so I will be recharge rich man I'll be giving it out I'll be whipping it out like dollar bills man make it rain recharge packets if you guys have any of the original sample shock on the shells man they're vintage they're going away so hold on to them there be like trading either just not economical but we're still getting Scott what Scott he's saying is reach or we're gonna so you're gonna have some sample packs that you can send out real easily in the mail or whatever have some little sample sticks because man misses real put a ban on the shells you think I have not make so many custom I get it I get it alright let's get me a Girl Talk here we got recharge for seedlings and guys get your girl talk up over dude grows calm please any and all questions beginner to advanced to even WTF questions I'll take it because I love going through them and we're doing it gets worked in to grow talk here hope a sir says I have some seedlings with our first set of true leaves I just voted with my dollars a clone stalkers my church I'd like to hit them with some recharge but one of the cruise ideas on strength to mix it been listening since to the teen episodes oh hell yeah man it's my favorite podcast don't know why I just take me so long to recharge it up sweet man thank you so much he's got his first true set of leaves that's a time when I am gonna water in my recharge some people use it to roll their seeds and make a slurry do all kinds of stuff I usually wait to my clones or seedlings get popped up second set like that leaves that the leaves I'm talking about guys are the leaves you can go oh that's a cannabis plant those leaves I'm gonna water and recharge and I just do the the lay I'm using the scoop which is about a teaspoon per gallon unless you're doing the once a week treat or something where you want to hit it double time two teaspoons per gallon now it's even a little more so when they're seedling I think use a tablespoon per gallon when you're doing a heavy hit right tablespoon when the Big Mac implants that you're just trying to beef up you know I can veg you know big strong video like a full pot to [ __ ] the pots completely full knowledge and that's a once a week treat and that's a shitload to man that's like that freakin you own the company formula man you're just too in the seedlings and early on when you or when you've transplanted you know and you're you don't have a full pot of roots to the label right there teaspoon per gallon you don't have a lot of roots at all I mean in those seedlings I would just try to get it on there what you're trying to do when the plants really little like that you can actually use the mycorrhizae mycorrhizae is like a fungus it's a beneficial fungus that forms a coating around the roots if you can think about it if you just have a tiny amount of roots like on a seedling and the mycorrhizae also shuts down when you put fertilizer in there so right now before the plant needs any fertilizer get that inoculation and that fungus to inoculate around the roots and what happens just like I need a better analogy but just like if anyone's ever gotten a fingernail fungus before as the new fingernail grows out guess what the fungus inoculates it you know it can tap you know in in you know pathogenic fungus it's not good in a beneficial fungus it forms this coating that actually provides nutrition so that's what mycorrhizae does and their great opportunity you got to get it on there is in the very beginning because as soon as you start putting a bunch of high phosphorus fertilizer on there it's gonna slow that [ __ ] down big-time right on good a good question there pacer I'm gonna take it on two grambo yes sir with the ppm calculator yes although everyone in my family has grown most of my life the idea of a ppm calculator by cow is like saying a pen a device to measure your parts per million or nutrient concentration because the idea of a ppm calculator was lost on them and it's essentially lost on me as well I'm using psycho complete line last run decided I was going to try and dial it in to my room as Harley Smith says spoon feed my plants their website has their ppm calculator but it's like some sort of backwoods spread what would she look like I just imagine like going on a band what's the spreadsheet at the bamboo farm look like man scroll down that's what they use I don't know guru probably knows about backwoods spreadsheet that's what they used to run like you know prohibition styles liquor white white white lightning [ __ ] the woods man you like they keep it in their head they don't anything I Whittle it on this tree oh there we go now we have created our own urban dictionary for backwards pressure that's what a moonshiner keeps in their head to get the brood down okay so he goes can you did you see help me understand is there any easy way to decode the best parts per million for your personal situation plants an environment or is this Australian hillbilly neut calculator my only hope cuz psycho is an Australian company good could good wording sir right now I'll tell you this if you don't want to have a ppm meter and you can understand a little bit looking at your plants you don't have to for example I use I mean hopefully see microscopes without using a ppm meter let me sit down like I was doing are extreme solutions I've done like that new mill and I don't get me wrong I do have one every once in a while you have jack but if you're running I mean you can drive any living soil without a speedometer and do pretty good but when a cop gets behind you you gotta know man you know I really let's say mister now my coffee cup Thank You chief if you have a nutrient I don't know about what psycho has but if they have a recommendation on okay here you want to be running seven Mills per gal to be it this how do you only Mary I know you could have the only variable there is what your water starts off at some people's parts per million off the tap is three four we wait mines one I totally disagree man dude what about your media the salts buildup in your media you have to know what your media is you have to be testing your runoff to see if it's if it's I never tested my runoff on multiple runs I mean it's I'm basing my experience off of what I've done and what I know works there's like not too many unknowns for okay last time I ran I mean this is like my third or fourth time running new mill new millennium so I know okay I put in 30 mils of this 30 mils of this put in some of this and like I know in my head it's blue ha I know others aren't like pH meters where like you pretty much to get a good one you have to spend the money to get a good one even the cheap ppm you know salt meters electrical conductivity yes it just measures the electrical conductivity between an anode and a diode and it's super simple to do and it measures EC and then from that it calculates based on either a 500 or 700 ppm scale I think there's almost no reason just to have one even if you're not gonna use it that often just to be able to double check yourself if you want right I got the analogy man it's like a [ __ ] thermometer man yeah I know I'm [ __ ] sick I know I feel bad man I got a fever but I gotta see if I got 105 I'm going in a goddamn Hospital man you know yeah if I go chest my run off and it's 2,000 like [ __ ] man I got to just put plain water in here man you know I mean I've been building this up too much I've just been holding too much nutrient you know if I test the runoff in at 600 I know I can bump it up to maybe you know one and a half times what I've been doing so here's what let me tell you Godfather 505 agrees with me a little bit and I'm not saying don't be nice since freakin baddies to his work man all right because I have the complete line of psycho as well okay the feeding chart on the website is pretty good they both have metric and imperial versions probably go with the advance metric options so you can keep things in milliliters if you have the entire line you'll need the advance chart don't even mess with the calculator the chart is pretty straightforward and telling you that when you add the different bottles by week I personally went light with the five mils per gallon for anything that says two mils per liter are two to three mils per gallon for all the others so anyway he's doing what I'm saying gosh you can follow it if for some reason you don't have and I mean it's a modern world gurus right these meters are not expensive you don't even have to take care of them like it's not like the pH 100 will make sure you clean it calibrate it you can calibrate them of course but they're durable or it affordable so get one if you can definitely yeah but I just think that you gotta go that the missing link or what we should try to help help people with I've known salts for a long time and it matters how much you water in and how much runoff you're getting each time in your system there's a lot of guys that are in a closet and they don't really want to vacuum out the runoff or whatever from the tray so they're just watering it so minimal runoff is going it's coming out and they're using the form yeah they're using the chart so what's happening is they're getting final minimal runoff you know I'm just saying you can it is possible I used GH a long time ago and it would happen with GH sister where I would every now and again I'd be you know sometimes I would be like washing out the pots at the very end can I'd be like I just should just test a runoff here and it'd be over mm you know like my meter couldn't even measure it it was so strong sounds like damn sure would I know that no wonder they were never flushing that kind of thing you know so it's nice just to at least to be able to get a representation you know I'll use my thermometer analogy I'll rely on that sir you want to know right oh no we're gonna say what's up to st. skinny with t5 arcing it was howdy guru dude and Scotty lucky duck guru goes first today you're the man man oh because in the order of saying with hello all right we do actually have a request somewhere social media which will we'll get to you guys too somebody wants to interview you guru so we'll have to interview goober or sometime so figure out a little bit about his background and if he really does know how to grow cannon or not no way wait got a state mysterious man shout out groan - sorry to do this the middle of post grown with fishies - guys I'm gonna go get over on that show but let me get back to Saint skinny here he goes I bought a used t5 bulb for bulb t5 when I plugged it in one of the bulbs started arcing and smoking so I plugged it like the good little stoner after the replacement sockets arrived I noticed the bulb that arced wasn't twisted into the socket it was melted stuck like that like straight up and down I think you know how you got a twist t5 bulbs and and according to my calculations the loose bulb was maybe the culprit when replacing the socket I double-checked the ballast switches and wiring which was all hunky-dory so guys these t5 bulbs we got a four ball eight bulb for fall but four bulb t5 has one ballasts the eight bulbs usually have two ballasts because you can have one go out this fixture I've had running for years now had one go out which I just took it and got it repaired so he goes that all looked good and after the surgery all four bulbs are happy campers do you guys think the loose ball was the problem or should I watch out for gremlins and leprechauns much love DGC stay i re st. PS ma st. is doing great in her recovery from the bone marrow transplant thanks to all of you that have been there through this it means a lot to us both right on man but great news good to hear good to hear I think the loose bulb could have been the culprit in this situation he reordered there's pitchers here guys on the post the little things on t5 fixtures the socket receivers I see more of those right I've seen that if it's not if it's not in all the way it'll start arcing and it makes like a little like a welder is an arc you know what I mean so it's just kind of melts melts the plastic and I wanted to just remind people like I still love these fixtures I got three t5 8 bulbs I'm not always using all of them I do a multitude of things from cloning to microgreens to over here which you can't see off the screen I got the pepper plant in a one gal I've had for almost half a year now and right now it's got they're not all mature but 20-plus Peppers on it in a freaking one gal under t5 Football upgrading these things I do run the Horta looks you viii the power veg bulbs to get the UV but as I'm as bulbs are going out now I don't wait for meeeeee to go out but replacing them I'm putting those LED strips in them so now I'm turning like my old t5 8 bulb 2 fixtures into LED fixtures and I still recommend I love that the the coverage these things give it's only what's right under them of course but great vegging fixtures in my opinion are Hobby fixtures get one t58 bulb if you want to screw around teach your kids how to grow their lettuce whatever absolutely just put them right totally repairable all the parts on them totally available so shout out to t5 fixtures yes sir yes sir ain't broke don't fix it all right where we at man dr. Brown's green there's more guru let you hop on this one it goes what's up DG see I decided to replace the CFLs that's just compact fluorescent lighting in my bonsai and mother clone chamber with Cree nine watt LED lights in order to get more direct light to my plants I cut off the white diffuser this exposed the diodes as can be seen in a pitcher I notice a plus and minus figure because this means I should be very careful when reaching under these lights someone with electrical knowledge fill me in on the potential dangers of having contacts exposed thanks by the way the plants are loving these just take a look at those diodes real quick you can really see what an LED is so take a look at that real quick it guru would you explain what we're looking at here I'm seeing threes those are just single I guess technically we can consider those discreet diets okay that that's what discreet dogs look like and with those Cree ality bulbs you really don't want to take the diffuser off um there's a chance I think you could just hit alternating current I'm like a live alternating current and arc between the two if you touch up there or even just water droplets could short out the light or trip a GFCI or something and you voided the warranty for it and that's one of the coolest part about those Cree bulbs is that if one goes out you just take it to Home Depot and swap it for a new one for free because they have a 10-year warranty on them that's honored by Home Depot right so my clothes that's what Ralphy say and don't touch them or get them wet yeah don't touch them or get them wet and if you get any more don't take the diffusers off so just black I mean what purposes I can't remember I asked spectrum King about a mic why do I need can I take this lens off for something when I get UV or I thought that I even made the light dangerous flight for me to be in there or something open about I don't know all right man so cool thanks for all the Girl Talk thank you docks Green docks Brown green phone sir get more growth talk questions over there guys do grows calm get the reports tamada from Scotty and the Cannabis Cup and also what's about it man I think we're ready to put it in the bag I know you got a mama mama in town I'm a real is in town so and I am going to go shred the Nair it rained up in the mountains you know what that means it is grippy for downhilling so come on let's do a thought I mean I want a shout-out peace out do some shout out to your guys play that funky beat if I like this it's not too funky pop play hey what's up Spartan grow and be patient he's mean producers people at support overdue gross combat no meat 207 shade where you at brother already 55 bowtie when I see is that careful cheaper yes we go there vapor for 10 your likes to grow a lot let's go not forget about Ralphie dr. J 303 up renew sage trade trading don't forget we are [Music] all right do they hire right back [Music] [Music] [Music] the day where the pill medicine [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] you [Music]", "GXidrVHteWM": "hey there friends brad kolodner here with my banjo and happy holidays to everybody i'm gonna play a song that i'm sure all of you are familiar with here on clawhammer banjo and i will teach you the melody as we are venturing into the holiday season really appreciate all of you who have supported my channel clawhammer corner and of course welcome any of you who'd like to learn more about banjo to join me there here's silent night [Music] so [Music] do [Music] [Music] there you go that's silent night and i'm playing it here in double c tuning that's g c g c d and let's walk through this tune piece by piece it's a waltz which is unusual for claw hammer banjo mostly because it's not a rhythm that we usually play in this style normally we play in 4 4 and have this basic groove which is referred to the bum diddy but when you play a waltz it's certainly doable on claw hammer you just adjust the basic right hand pattern to what i call the bum d diddy [Music] so let's first just break down that rhythm so i'm playing c chord which is my middle finger on the second fret of the first string and i'm just going on the second string bum lifting my hand up strum and then diddy so one strum diddy one strum i went to an f chord back to c it's pretty straightforward it just takes a little bit of practice to get into your muscle memory but the waltz rhythm is totally playable on clawhammer okay let's try and walk through this tune here piece by piece and i'll upload this to my channel as well and include tab there here's silent night broken down in chunks it's just one long tune so it's not a normal form like a b we usually have that in old time music but since this isn't an old time tune it's just one longer tune so we'll just go through it piece by piece so here's the beginning [Music] so there's that walt's rhythm in that second phrase but the first one is just open third and then a hammer on open to two and then back to your open third this time with your drone on the fifth so [Music] and then fourth fret on that fourth string now i'm using my ring finger there and then my index on the first string second fret and that makes a nice c chord so you have and there's your walt's rhythm so [Music] and then you repeat that so let's play that a few times nice and slow together here it goes [Music] a couple more okay now we're going into a g chord on that first string that's this chord here second fret fourth string second fret second string and we're gonna go so bum did diddy and then up to our fourth fret on the third string this is an inversion of our g chord you can play the g like this you can also play it like this it's a slightly different sound that's your ring finger on the fourth fret of the third string and your index finger on the second fret of the second string it looks like this and you want to make sure that you don't strike the fourth string on the strum or else it sounds quite dissonant so really just aim for those top three strings so we have open on the first g chord our other g chord on the third string so let's try that together a couple times you might have to practice these chords independently before moving on just to get these shapes you've got g your alternate g again let's just repeat that one more good now we're back to our second string open with our middle finger on the second fret of the first string that's a c chord [Music] and then your third string so second third so that whole phrase is great so let's go back to the beginning and play it all together here it is one two three one two go [Music] [Applause] excellent now we have a hammer on on the third string second fret and that's going to turn into our f chord which looks like this second fret third string first fret or first string third fret so hammer on d and then here's a nice little melodic phrase so that's open second open second again this time drop them to the third string fourth fret so your thumb comes down to that third string and then second fret third string followed by your drone [Music] and then you go to your open third so and then we do a hammer-on open to two and then back to open followed by your drones let's go through that phrase again [Music] again and then we're doing it this cool slide two to four with your ring finger on that fourth string and that's going to turn to that c chord we did earlier so okay so that whole phrase sounds like this f and you play that twice just like i did okay we're through most of the tune now the cool thing about this melody is it's probably already in your head which makes it a lot easier for learning i know i always learn tunes that i've memorized the melody and can hum along so keep that in mind you're really listening to the tune as you're playing it not just thinking about the mechanics exclusively so here we go we've got the whole first two thirds of the tune sounds like this one two three one ready go [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay we're getting to the climax of the tune back to our g chord and that's going to be that same g we played earlier bum did ditty and then we add our pinky to that third fret of the first string this turns this chord into a g7 [Music] so third fret and then i do a pull off so three pull off and then fourth fret on our third string with our ring finger so that measure so that's [Music] now take some nimbleness there with your ring finger or your pinky rather to get a nice clean pull off so you might have to practice that a little bit so and then we go back to our second string bum did diddy that's just a c chord second string and then a hammer on open to two on that first string so that's [Music] and then here's the ending of the tune it's just an arpeggio so we're going down second third fourth fret on our fourth string second third fourth and then open so that next measure that's open third drop thumb open to fourth fret on the fourth string second fret fourth string and then open fourth so [Music] so that whole last line again there you go let's try and play through the whole tune nice and slow you can play along with this i'll play it twice here it goes one two three one ready go [Music] do [Music] do [Music] again [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] do [Music] there you go that's silent night and it's one of my favorite tunes to play this time of year on banjo and i recorded this one with my band charm city junction on an album we released last year around this time in december of 2019 and we called it snowball and it features holiday music and it's the band bringing together clawhammer banjo there's irish button accordion bluegrass fiddle and bass and it's a really fun sound and we had a great time putting together that little holiday ep and this track is on there i'm playing a fretless gourd banjo on that recording all right thanks so much for tuning in i hope to see you in my channel clawhammer corner have a great holiday season and thanks to everybody at truefire for all the great work they're doing keeping the music alive so long", "AuViaMizLKo": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] hello everyone welcome to episode 4 I'm starting to lose count already and it's only episode 4 of mando lessons live I hope everything's coming through for everybody you can see me you can hear me I'm in sync all that sort of stuff I'm sure you'll let me know if that's not the case but in any case thanks for coming great to see you all here looks like there's a 20-plus people here which is always great to see hope you all are enjoying the holiday times getting to play music and if you're in a cold place hang out hang out by a fire or be warm in the cold weather got tons of snow up here in Northeast us [Music] alright I've already got a request for saddled the pony I don't know how that goes I know it's a super common tune and I can't if I know it it's not it's not in my head right now by that name anyway but maybe I can come up with it before the hour is over but I'll go ahead actually right now and add that to my little note here because that's I know I hear that name a lot Cooley's real that's a great tune I can play that tune saddle the pony I love doing this because you guys always give me great great requests and a lot of them I don't know so I can go take some time and learn them [Music] [Applause] all right more and more people all the time great good to see you all all right I got a request for coolies real lue a little bit of that but um if you haven't been here before ice recognizing some faces already but uh we're some names I should say not faces I can't see you but you can see me well if if you haven't been here before it's kind of free-range ask questions I'll do my best to keep up with the chat and answer as many questions as I can and the time that we've got about an hour and I just have a good time I love hearing what people are working on what questions they've come up with [Music] first up coolies Rio [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] all right so that was that coolies real was that first tune for anyone just joining in a great tune and I request and the second tune which I threw in it was unrequested but I kind of popped out at the end there was uh oh it's Nev that to miss miss Monaghan's miss Monaghan's great tune in the key of d another great Irish tune somebody said need the tabs if you're looking for the sheet music for either of those tunes check out my website mando lessons.com first tune called coolies real they're both in the I have lessons on how to learn them you know you can learn them by ear anyone is you know it's not a special skill you just got to work at it I break them all down you can either look up coolies real lesson on YouTube here or there on my website you can I can teach it to you by ear so you don't even need the tab and then you don't use just in your head you don't need to like have a sheet of paper to remember how to do it but that said there are tabs and regular kind of standard notation over at mando lessons comm all free all there all the time I've got a lot I've got a request from aniss TV for losing my religion a great REM song unfortunately I don't know it if I did I could try to play it I don't tend to know a whole lot of more of the pop stuff but I think there are some I think people have done tutorials for it so you could learn to do it yourself if you look up losing my religion tab on Google if you're at a breeder or I think there's even some someone on YouTube I think has done it so you can watch their fingers I can't can't promise that but I think it's out there somewhere cool drags hornpipe from Joseph that's a great tune I was just playing there with my friends the other day I can always remember one part but not the other it's good this is one of the parts never remember the other part if it comes into my head I'll plant maybe I'll look it up at some point Colerain great tune I know I know it I can't think of it off the top of my head apologies Jethro Tull again sorry I don't I don't know a whole lot of the kata the the pop side of things and the classic rock because there's some great mandolin stuff out there Jethro Tull losing my religion the Led Zeppelin's got some great mandolin parts I just don't know I'm more in the world of bluegrass and and fiddle tunes Scully Casey's can't remember that one okay got a question here um where is it um what's my daily practice well at this point I can talk it sort of about what I'm doing currently but also kind of what I can recommend for people if you're looking to kind of develop a daily practice at this point I'm kind of all over the map oh I mostly just kind of play tunes on mandolin anyway learn new tunes that I'm interested in I go to a session every week an Irish session then when I hear a tune I like I write it down come home and if I'm if I'm being a good mandolin student I'll look it up and learn it either from a recording or some on source that I can find and yeah that's I'm not doing it for me and again this is just sort of my current personal practice routine I'm not doing a whole lot of like scales or other exercises on mandolin I've been working on six string guitar a lot and that's that's sort of where I'm working more on kind of trying to get new shapes under my fingers because I'm not much of a I'm kind of a 3 chord 6 string guitar player but trying to work and get my facility up on that instrument a little bit more and a little bit of piano I've got this you can sort of see it in the background I have this folding it's a pump to read organ you kind of work with your feet it's got kind of like paddle board pedals nice droney sound and I picked up on Craigslist recently kind of and I don't know anything about pianos I know what the notes are called but I'm kind of trying to work out some tunes and some harmonies it's a totally different world very slow going but that's a fun project but in general you know working on a practice routine I think one of the one of the most important things at least the way that I tend to work and respond to kind of working on an instrument is a like number one is like have as much fun as you as you can because if you're having fun you're not gonna want to stop and that's gonna lead to more time with the instrument um so whatever you want you know if having fun me is just like sitting around and playing tunes or songs you've been working on that's totally great it's valid I think I find myself going through little cycles of really you know like I'll play a tune over and over and be totally happy to do so and then a hit a point where I'm like okay I'm a little bored with this tune it's time for something else and at that point I'll kind of find something else I'm interested in working a new tune or a new piece or same and I'm really not so good at plan in the key of B flat or or C or F or something like that pick a key that I might not be great at and do a little bit of scale exercises or things like that to get better facility and a new key or work on a classical piece you know kind of balancing fun new or fun material that you're already playing and having fun playing balancing that with working on whatever your wherever you're sort of your interests are taking you oh and from there you know I think again having having fun and you know not telling yourself I'd say picking up the instrument at least once a day even if it's just for 60 seconds 60 seconds a day or twice a day is gonna be much better than two hours crammed all together on a Saturday afternoon you know you I know that people's work schedules are busy but if you can pick up the instrument just for one minute five minutes 10 minutes a you're probably gonna get to the end of that five minutes and be like oh I want to keep going and that'll sort of keep that interest up but if you're you know spending time regularly with the instrument is gonna be more important than trying to it's kind of like cramming for a test you know if you if you put in two hours once a week you're not gonna get a whole lot of it's gonna be less enjoyable because you're gonna feel like you should be playing all this time on the weekend or whenever you have the time but think things like that you know lots of little practice times versus big ones all right I'm gonna catch up with the chat here sergeant Early's great tune I'm having a little trouble with the second part yeah that one that's an OD tune it's in a weird key it's in D minor [Music] [Applause] [Music] yeah so that's that is an OD tune it's kind of all over the fingerboard a little bit you had some uncommon patterns D minor it might be a little unfamiliar you know I think if you've got the first part just take that second part nice and slow like you know when I was learning this tune you know play at that slower play it slower even and that'll really work out there's a lot of right-hand stuff going on but take your time play it nice and slow and I think you can you can get it underneath your fingers there can I talk about from this is from Christopher can I talk about right hand technique work hard not to plant my pinky but I find the heel of my hand on the bridge so as long as you're not planting hard with the heel of your hand you know if you're if you're doing this and you're finding all of the motions coming from your wrist that means you're planting too hard but I kind of scrape a little bit behind the bridge so you can sort of hear I'll put my mandolin right next to the mic maybe you can hear that a little bit that's kind of overemphasized but you know my wrist or the palm of my hand is hitting just a little bit behind the bridge mostly is just kind of a guide but again not not planting so it's great that you're getting your pinky up that's really gonna loosen up your wrist in your forearm and I just put out for people who are interested I just put out a lesson on my thoughts on whether you should plant your pinky or not that said great diggers like Adam Steffi I think is a pinky planter and totally you know it's not holding him back so to each their own but I go over a couple ideas about why I don't like to plant my pinky and I sort of see it as a technique that I at least don't tell people to do working on reading standard this is from TN mando working on reading standard notation on mandolin my neighbor introduced me to salvation real herbs retreat Josephine's Walt's great that's great these are all great turns and nice work on the site reading that's a that's a great thing to work on from Rob Luciano he learned old Joe Clark any chance you could show how to improvise a little bit on the solo maybe a scale walk-up yeah I'll do a little bit of that I'll play a little bit of old Joe Clark and then I'll play it nice and slow and then sort of throw some kind of improv of the ideas and do it great old-time tune for people who aren't familiar with it there is a lesson on my website [Music] just the B Part B - you can do a little bit of scale jump [Music] that's a lot of scale sort of stuff some devil stops so taking that double stop from the end then five to seven for things like that be part I think one thing that will be helpful working on double stop I'm working on kind of creating solos and filling out that melody it's a great tune to work on that skill is really filling in those gaps there's a lot of space in that tune so turning those are all quarter notes turn them all into eighth notes and see if you can create a line that sort of uses scale and scale patterns to get from your starting note to your ending though so is your starting note and that fourth fret of the a-string is our ending so something like that creating all eight notes or you know some sort of pattern that gets you from point A to point B and then go back and just play the simplified and then kind of go back into solo zone that might be a helpful thing um let's see you're gonna catch up with the chat here for a second um cool lessons from rolling white the first thing he had me do is plant the heel of my palm on the bridge yep so that's like I was saying kind of maybe I again I personally don't recommend the like heavy plant but kind of brushing behind is a good way to keep your hand your right hand in line and give it a little bit of a waypoint the chats jumping on me okay gonna catch up here to do but it how soon is it is too soon to bring a mandolin to a local open Jam I've got a couple songs down in the key of G only been playing this is from Matthew when ttle I've only been playing for a couple months got a few tubes in the key of G wondering when it's time to go to a jam I'd say go for it you know as long as you're you approach a jam with sort of being aware of not kind of if you if you don't know it's a song or a tune at a jam it's it's okay to work on it but you won't you'll want to do that quietly and you probably know this just to you know you don't want to interfere with the if there's a song or tune happening that you don't know and you're playing loud trying to figure out what the notes are and you might be throwing other people off you know if you know a couple tunes in the key of G I when I first went to my first Bluegrass Festival and there was a lot of like picking in the parking lot I knew a G chord a C chord in the D chord and I would just kind of wander around and wait until I saw someone playing in the key of G and then I would join in and then they'd say all right another one and this one let's go to this Quixote this time I dug alright see you later and wander around until I found another one in gee you may get asked to play one of the tunes you know that's always exciting and maybe a little nerve-wracking but it's great practice to kind of get used to playing out but I'd say you know the sooner you jump in you'll probably meet people there that are around the same level as you maybe you'll create an offshoot create a little band something like that and the more you can play out and play with other people the better so I'd say as soon as possible whenever you can and not you know every session has their own sort of rules so if it's if it's clearly an advanced session but it sounds like it's the local open jam totally fine I'd say go for it is there easier ways to play chopped chords this is from s hade in the 77 apologies or Shaden maybe apologies I'm not saying your name right my fingers will not stretch that far I keep trying yeah there's lots of great kind of two finger or three finger chop chords so I think what she's talking about is this big G chop chord which gives lots of people trouble I think it's it's fairly gettable um it takes a little while sometimes you can kind of approach it try putting your pinkie down first and then ring and then pointer then middle kind of working backwards but that said there's some other great chopped chords so oh I love this G chop chord it's fourth fret on the g string and fifth fret on the D string and then you can use that your C chop chord five two three a nice three finger chop let's slide that up to 4d and then back to G take that D that D chord which is seven four five move it back move it sort of towards your head like you would go from a G to a C and you're never playing the E string a lot of times even if I'm holding this big G chop chord I'm not I'm not using that high e-string I find often it just kind of gets in the way of whoever's playing the melody or singing the melody so yeah finding a little too big or chopping boards like that they're kind of scattered all over I might have some lessons on that if you look up my lesson how to play every major and minor chord I've got sort of this bar shape which is jet equally equally good I'm not quite the same sound as the blue kind of the classic bluegrass chop but it works in a pinch there's much kind of closer together for your fingers so I hope that's helpful is old Joe Clark on my website from Joseph yes it is on my website mando lessons calm if you look in the tunes fiddle tune in section it's it's in there you can sort it by alphabetically you can sort alphabetically and it's down in oh I cannot strum and sing at the same time and lose the rhythm any tips to improve this is from Siam ten apologies I'm I know I'm not getting your name right but uh yeah so well I think one big thing it's a really common thing you know kind of trying to get you know it's like scratching your head and rubbing your stomach or whatever that's saying is you know getting I think part of it is getting both down independently at first so if you're gonna play somebody requested I'll fly away so I'll do that so we're just gonna doing this key G G C and D chords so what you want to do is first get used to the chord progression so maybe it's so I'll sing the melody but kind of getting used to the chords [Music] so just using that little bit making sure you've got a nice solid rhythm in your right hand first and I've got lessons on that basic strum patterns lessons on my website there's one in the beginner series and then there's a couple on the technique and fundamentals page on different strum patterns and then you want to be able to have the melody in your head and be able to kind of sing it so if you can get yourself started and then I think doing that together um you know just playing one chord every time it changes and then from there you know just slowing everything down and staying on one chord [Music] that's uh that'll get you going in the right direction I think okay I'm gonna catch up with the chat here it's got way behind apologies there's someone on the roof shoveling so if you hear some thumps that's what's going on oh boy I missed a lot here let's see okay let's see well I'm totally lost myself okay is that something your website yes always jump Irish walk request for Irish washerwoman I can probably get to that cool cold frosty morning can i play that tune yeah appreciate a short lesson on the big names of mandolin play definitely that's maybe a good idea um also you can a great resource for that sort of stuff ISM so this is from Joan just requesting some kind of big names of mandolin players I'd check out mandolin cafe.com I don't know if they have a specific particular page that would be cool because they have pages for like builders but I mean you could ask on a mandolin cafe they've got a great forum just say like hey who are your favorite mandolin players or look up you can there's a great search function so you don't ask the same questions over and over but uh yeah um I could maybe also make a lesson on kind of some of my favorites there's so many out there but um might even just be a kind of a google list somebody's put out so anyway I'll go play a tune here real quick a lot of yeah key cold frosty morning one of my favorite tunes great old time too [Music] [Music] [Music] all right there you go cold frosty morning one of my favorites great tuna I've been working on clawhammer banjo as well it's sort of someone who's asked about my practice routine I've been playing clawhammer banjo it's a great tune I love working on that one on clawhammer banjo heck Porter says was gifted to mandolin two weeks ago completely new to the music watch a couple your lessons already do you have any specific advice for someone like you I would recommend check out my I mean there's tons of great resources out there if you love learning from books there's great books like mandolin for dummies by Don julen or the complete mandolinist by Marilyn Mayer if you like watching videos I've got a beginner series mando lessons calm has got I think there's over 200 lessons now totally free to watch lots of toons toons are a great way to kind of work on learning by ear getting some facility under your fingers work on picking faster and they're just a lot of fun and you know people all over the world know fiddle tunes so wherever you are if you find people to play tunes you've probably got some kind of language in common even if it's not a spoken language you can maybe play tunes with people so yeah welcome to the wonderful world of mandolins and thanks thanks for joining us today [Music] they make the chat so jumpy yeah Christopher says to heck pick up the mandolin every day even if it's just five minutes exactly that's that's the way to do do it the more time you can spend just concentrate most on having fun it's kind of a weird thing to say but if you're having fun you're just gonna spend more time with the instrument and if you keep playing you can't get worse you know the the biggest hurdle for a lot of people is just picking up the instrument and if you can if you can get in the habit of just picking it up and do and whatever comes out of your fingers whatever you're enjoying that's great um and also spend a lot of time listening you know if you have particular music that has a mandolin in it or that doesn't the more time you can listen to music that you want to play the better and easier and more surely that music is gonna come out of your fingers shoveling the roof title of my next tune is a great tune called shingling the roof I don't member had goes and I think it's got like four or five parts but it's a really cool tune that's on my list of tunes to learn but shoveling the roof is also I actually can't tell if it's someone's shoveling or if it's just we've got a really steep roof in my apartment and maybe it's just falling off because it's getting warmer I can't tell but it's consistent I think it's channeling anyway do I have anything that inspires me that's not an instrument or something musical great question from Rittenhouse again apologies with the names yeah I mean I love I mean I'm definitely mostly musically minded I love I really like um I like films I like filmmakers I love watching how people kind of use cameras and I loved the world of just kind of I guess technology in a way and like the way that's kind of a big driving factor behind my website just the fact that you can like learn anything online I've learned a lot about using cameras and kind of video equipment and like how to make films online and just the amazing stuff that people do and the way that they put put out information on the internet it's a kind of a golden age of information if you kind of if you have an internet connection you can kind of learn how to do anything that's kind of how I learned to play the mandolin was I got a mandolin and there wasn't a mandolin teacher near me so I turned to the internet and mandolin cafe and then started making this site once I kind of had had the instrument under my fingers for a while yeah and you know you just learned so much from the internet and that that's really inspiring I love people like know the vlog brothers Hank and John Green really inspiring stuff I love reading I love folk tales from kind of all around the world fairy tales folk tales whatever want to call them kind of traditional stories things like that but yeah great question kind of hard to hard to choose but lots of good stuff out there [Music] Christy so somebody's putting out some great names of mandolin players for people that might be new to the instrument Christie Lee excellent Bill Monroe classic the kind of the father of bluegrass David Grisman Mike Marshall Sam Bush ought to get you started yeah that's a great great list to start and east admins another one of my favorites a little kind of further out a little maybe weirder Shannon but I love what he does cattle McCain with cold frosty morning that sounds like a great set play a Christmas tune I don't know any Christmas tunes unfortunately I apologize it's one of mine maybe I'll call it a New Year's resolution but I kind of decided before New Year's next year I'm gonna put up some cement some Christmas tunes for you guys all to learn and so I can learn some myself Oh Red Wing great tune oh crap so I'll play a little bit of Red Wing from Mike Wilson jeido bud says cry cry darlin that's the tune that I'm actually really excited to work on soon it's got some great harmony lines and I want to kind of work on peace and all of that together I've been listening there's a great album that just came out a little tangent here real quick so Caleb clutter and reap Wilms from Foghorn string band just put out an album with joel savoir it's called goodbye alligator man I'll see if I can find see if you wait is it called goodbye alligator man there okay so it's called farewell alligator man and it's a great so well who's the third Kelly Jones and they do an awesome version of crack ride Ireland so if you look up farewell alligator man there's a link where you can download the album really great I think it's also on like Apple music and spotify and stuff like that but they have an awesome version of the whole album is great and the great birds from the crack right Ireland but let's see Redwing [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Music] go now - you really threw me [Music] there we go that's better sorry about that it just happens sometimes David Beaty says any chance you could quickly cover or do a lesson on moving between chords when doing backup I've noticed good players play in between chords to make standard progressions sound more interesting yeah what I would recommend kind of a long subject but on my website I have some lessons in the technique and fundamentals section of my site and I'm just looking up what they're called so yeah if you look up the strum pattern series I I go over especially in parts two and three cross picking Irish real and Irish jig accompaniment I go over some of that sort of moving moving baseline stuff another thing you can do it's kind of a little side project if you look up tenor guitar lessons calm I've got just a sort of a basic intro you know it's kind of the beginners series on mandolin on mando lessons but it's for tenor guitar but the bottom three strings GDA are tuned the same and you can use that and I talked about some moving chords over there and yeah just I think what you can kind of think about is think about kind of bass lines running so [Music] sorry I think that's sort of the stuff David's talking about somebody says is this a new mandolin it's not a new mandolin it's actually a very old mandolin but it's new ish to me I got it about a year ago and it hasn't showed up on any of the the lessons yet maybe at some point this is a Gibson a junior which was sort of their budget model from 1924 as very beat-up got cracks and lots of wear and scratches and dings all over it and I feel like I got a good deal on it so I could afford it and I've really been enjoying this great for it's not so much of a bluegrass mandolin doesn't quite have that F F hole chop but I really like it for Irish tunes and some old-time stuff a little more kind of tubby sounding and less focused and projecting them than if that F hold instrument but maybe a little kind of softer and warmer and richer maybe I don't I don't know how to talk about tone really but I'm enjoying it making Kevin suggest making some lessons on kind of modern Americana style stuff like mandolin orange mandolin orange is great yeah I don't that would be a good project for me cuz I don't know exactly what defines that style so much but it would be a good project to sort of work on like kind of fundamentally with music theory and kind of specific examples what what's going into that style that's a great idea another learning tips another learner is from Tian mondo another learning tip is trying to play melodies of tunes or songs yeah that's a great thing I'm always amazed Christmastime how easily can pick up the melodies of Christmas songs yeah and he said that I've heard all my life and I think that's a big a big part of it is with learning melodies starting with things that you already know I start with you are my sunshine for a lot of people because most people already know that tune but um if there's some kind of folk melody or Christmas Carol and you can forget the first couple notes often you can kind of work your way through picking out that melody on on the instrument just because it's in your head already I kind of think of learning by ear as a two-step process where you kind of start and you've got like oh here's a tune out here coming out of a radio or another instrument or whatever it is and it needs to sort of go into your head and your brain needs to kind of translate it and then you need to kind of come out through your fingers on your instrument and if you start with something like you are my sunshine or a Christmas carol or whatever it is it's already in your head so you have you sort of you don't need to figure out what's going on out here and translate it into your head because you already know the melody and you can sort of bypass half the equation and just sort of get right to like okay like often it's the first couple notes that are the trickiest you get the first couple notes down and then you uh you can pull out kind of the rest of the tune by ear that way so that's that's a great suggestion from TN mando how long have I been playing from Ashley I have been playing I guess almost eighteen years um I started around the year 2000 when I was in middle school I started yeah it's easy to say the year 2000 because it's easy for me to count from the year 2000 but it was I think 2000 maybe 99 maybe 2001 so yeah 7 17 18 years somewhere in there any players in the Irish traditional music scene to check out yeah that's actually something that I wanted to suggest I've got a couple YouTube channels that I've been really been enjoying someone for a long time and one that's kind of new one is Terkel 14 its te RG IL 14 puts up a bunch of great irish tunes on mandolin maybe play a little tender Manju I can't remember mostly mandolin great Tunes I've learned toons from him so check him out and the other youtuber that I just discovered somebody pointed out to me is bike mod let's be i ke mu TT all one word it's got a bunch of tenor banjo and mandolin and maybe some other instrument tenor guitar tuned like a tenor banjo um he's got a bunch of great tunes out it sounds great new new one to me so go check out those guys and beyond that kind of in the more kind of commercial a little commercial world but um kind of people you'll come across albums marla fish great irish mandolin player paul brady andy irvine great Irish legends that play all kinds of different instruments there's some great tenor banjo players that I'm blanking on their names again mandolin cafe is probably gonna be able to give you a more exhaustive list Simon Mayer yep he's great yeah things like that cool let me just catch up with the chat here cross picking is tough any tips from from AC m AC Mullane again apologies with the names here yeah so there's on my website in the technique and fundament fundamentals section I've got strum pattern series at the bottom of the page and I've got those again there's three I referenced them earlier parts two three and four cross picking Irish real accompaniment and Irish jig accompaniment those are gonna get you some great cross picking I might even have some other lessons scattered throughout the site that I can't think of right now has it shown up on any of the stolen instruments list I don't I don't know if you're referencing this mandolin I can tell you this mandolin wasn't stolen but you might be something about something else AC Mullane okay how about adding greasy coat to your I think maybe someone was talking about this maybe being stolen because it was beat-up I think it's just that it's almost 100 years old and it that might have more to do with it greasy coat to my list yeah that would be a great tune to add I'll play that tune because that's a good tune [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Griese code great old-time tune fiddle players will tune up to AE AE I don't tune I don't cross tuned for the most part I do have a lesson on cross tuning if that's something you want to do I don't recommend just hauling your G strings up to a and your d up to e I would usually tune down my a and E so I get djidi djidi and then capo on the 2nd fret if you're interested in that sort of thing in the technique and fundamental section of my website there there's a lesson on cross tuning ok so uh I didn't quite get to the sorry sometimes I miss out on sarcasm so apologies that AC just lose it in the chat but no no problem one way or the other Azealia waltz that spring and I feel like I used to know that I can't pull it off the top of my head is that it might be in one there's some great waltz books called the waltz books I think it might be in one of those I can't remember but oh great tunes maybe I'll play a waltz there's nice waltzes out there oh let's see what's a good [Music] I can't quite remember the be part of that day that's a beautiful tune that I'm butchering called what is that called April waltz by Selma Kaplan um all right I've got some greasy puns going on in the lot lots of great waltzes out there I've got a couple waltzes on my website what do I have on my website for waltzes here play one of those instead of teams I can't quite remember oh should make sure more is a great one start of the county down south wind Tombigbee some big bees nice how does that go play a little Tombigbee so I can get it back of my head [Music] lovely old time waltz called the Tombigbee waltz it's on my website in the waltz section thank you for putting the spelling up there kind of a hard one to pronounce and then know how it sounds oh sorry you're just joining this Tom but it will be up if you got any questions throw them out there now but this we're about out of time we got about five more minutes but um you can always watch these later on they always end up in my video feed so if you're subscribed to the channel you'll see it kind of pop up a couple minutes after it's done once YouTube can kind of get the whole thing kind of coded up for itself you can always watch these back any time you choose you just can't get in the chat at that time you can always leave comments I can try to answer there or in a future one wow this is I think maybe the first time I've ever been as far as I can tell caught up on the chat guys are being too quiet I'm just kidding just want to go back make sure somebody asked me earlier if I had played any Bach I've played some Bach in the past I used to know the the prelude to the box-to-box first cello suite I don't know anymore [Music] that's where I start to lose it now great great tune and that whole that whole cello suite you can find sheet music for it there's either books or you can find it there some what does it cut is M I I s MLP is it dot I think calm I can't remember is um a great online I think there's resources on my website if you look in the links page or tuned resources page I'm not sure exactly let's see where is it so I can okay tune live under the resources tab there's a tune library's last link in that drop down menu [Music] yeah imslp dot org and it's kind of it can be a little hard to wade through but you can find standard notation for the Bach cello suites written out for violin so Sam tuning is mandolin it comes out in D rather than G because the cello is down to fifth but it's still really beautiful music great stuff to work on doesn't get any better Margaret's Walsh waltz great tune is that the Pat Shaw tune no oh no yeah that's um oh that's that tune yeah hate my waltzes mixed up yeah great tune let's maybe add that one to the website oh it's my list right now cool thank you for that suggestion all right see if I can do I know any Stanley Brothers bluegrass white dove etc I know a little bit not not off the top of my head I love they have a great album called what is it longer it's not long ago and far away see if I can pull this up real quick it's really beautiful I think it's a radio performance of them [Music] I can't quite Oh an evening long ago live in 1956 a great album they have some really beautiful stuff on there really awesome sound that's one of my favorite albums of theirs anyway need to learn those chops yeah there's some great I've got some got some lessons that won't match for their quality but I like them there's some lessons on chop chords over at my website if you're looking to get to that sort of thing what song should I play two Kooks snow out here in California oh I don't that's a good question no you gotta try I'd say try it try them all see see which one works and let me know been to a fuse from Rob Whitehouse been to a few bluegrass jams but there's one problem everyone's playing loud and I can't hear the tune in my head I get completely lost yeah that's the thing with bluegrass is though people tend to play loud and fast I think I think it's sticking with it you'll you'll start to kind of get a sense over time you know whenever I go to sessions for the first time it's a lot of stuff that I don't know and when you know the first couple of times you know half dozen or more times to a session I might not know any of the songs but then eventually I get to the point where is like oh that one's familiar or oh I think that one's in G or I've got the first couple notes and it kind of builds from there so give it some time let it build up and and you'll be rewarded for your patience cool the mint mandolin player from shell does a very beautiful version of the Bach cello suite first Prelude on octave mandolin very cool why are there chords that are limited some Tom Walker I'm gonna enter a couple more questions and then I'm gonna have to hit the road here but uh why are there chords that are limited to three strings like a D chord play with the C shape you could bar them especially the minor ones yeah um any chord you use you can you can kind of play like three or four chords so you can take this D chord that I think tom is talking about so you could make that up add in the fifth fret on the e-string a lot of times I don't play the e string even if I play you know if I put a finger down so I guess a chord 2 2 4 or 500 a lot of times I'll just kind of play and I don't even need my ring finger or that whatever's on that East ring people use different fingers just because a lot of times it's the melody is up there and you're playing that high string it's gonna kind of get in the way of that melody in my opinion so a lot of times I limit myself to 3 string even you know with the G chop chord you got all four fingers down but I rarely play I usually play two or three strings very rarely will I ever go I'm just kind of minimize it leaves more space for other stuff in the group in the group look around real quick I apologize if I can't get to everything today same for the major and minor Barre chords from the G shape it's a question of style yeah I think it's just it's a style thing more than anything it's kind of personal preference things like that cool I'm glad everyone's been enjoying enjoying the lessons thank you a lot of season's greetings to everyone Christmas Hanukkah whatever I guess Hanukkah is over now but happy holidays to everyone try an octave mandolin great father didn't mandolin bouzouki thing right here I've gotten the slightly different tuning so I can't play that maybe I'll get this out longer on a future lesson but super fun instruments cool

but he'll be calling arrest them I'm sure if I catch a couple tears the water's like two foot lower today it's way down and I always liked the higher water but hey sometimes you never know sometimes they bite when it's low and all we can do is try Oh killer you got the lowdown what they say people bring him in oh that's a good jump Oh super dog bag look at that that's uh supreme sho'nuff huh look at there that's just a frame sure enough look at the size of that fish fish coming in to move all that sun's bright hey it's a beautiful day a lot of banks showing because the waters waving but it's a beautiful day a lot of people fish and I couldn't believe it I guess they watching my video they weren't gonna come out and get a little bit I've seen a dozen boats already on a Monday morning hey I reckon they're taking off the end of the year I don't know that's some down there people hey I believe we own the nest up don't y'all God bleed we own the nest up Oh mine loony baloney believes it - let me tell you he's already calling buddies over here I guarantee he's already called his buddies over here next thing you know you got ten random they call them in Lou Nico lo Nico okay there's the bottom we go really nothing y'all I'm really liking this power power braid I don't mind a boy that's a loner delight there's shown up efficient gotta change everyone up he done got him I seen scoot across there he doesn't got it think the bubbles coming up that doggone lowness something see you don't need that little one went right straight down here had no trouble with in out in the sandwich Oh God it was to hit one here now Stu you won't be longer be three next thing you know before and just keep adding up and the suckers get up under my boat what they do and they try to attack my fishes I bring them good bite as I bring them into hit metal Oh going one reason I'm not using the sponsor with that spun on the bottom and the Fugees above it you looking for disaster with lowness I decided they do two double rig this year seven that triple ring like I used to do because of that reason it canceled only and then we got problems with people we got problems if I cancel only on this also like there's no getting me I can't get him in on a big rock so I don't want him to do with breathe it line all I can do is hope that eight pound leader breaks that's all I can do the best I can do hey they bite they bite a little bit for low water and clear conditions a little bit we ain't in the super dollar Magnum tonight I'm not throwing this back I need a little pop all the way out of hand hey we might have a Christmas dinner fish fry we might have a christmas fish fry instead of turkey and ham I think I'll just have I always go over to my wife's Mama's on Christmas Eve we always have hams turkey or roast or something so wait Christmas Day Mike you children come to my house so I might just fried my son loves and beer batter perch can't ask nobody just in quite the right size he's a lonely fish I guess I'm gonna have to feed Looney I hate to hate that was to lure fillet though maybe here make it bad Luna's like a pack of wolves I ain't in a lonely hole right here this morning Loney whole zone up down a little bit that's what I know I'm going to stop first and they always waiting on it so they probably up there scratching their little heads where's the old fish why won't you stop here when I come by my hole that I know i'ma stop that it was a bass boat in and so I just bypassed it went somewhere else what I done so I'm somewhere else because it was somebody in my way hey listen hey the only place they bite I'm catching anywhere but they that might be the only place of jumbo magnet off that's the thing in magnums in this lake like certain places David everywhere and you got to get where the big ones over and right here so far we get we also fish we need on the big fish no I'm saying the big Superdog magnet that I like mammoths though Warren said mammoth mammoths first thought to be a new name mammoth perfect I did catch some big ones at last we're down by until I caught some jacks last week hey man hey yeah idea trying Oh loaded I'll run them off you go run along that's what happens to my fishes as Lily got here used to be I get on fish and I can't hammering for a while last time in 50 60 foot of water Loney will run them off I'm convinced for that and they gonna see I was catching it moving no I don't see loner y'all messing with me again you messing with me again loading why you got to start my morning off be an aggravator huh why why don't like the way I talk don't you I think they like my voice that's warning Duke I think they like my boys every time I jerk in this fishbowl up dive down and this point they ride up under my boat looking for the fish come up right that one popped up get the dope down again oh they hit it but he just popped up looking for the fish and I jerk so their fish is put two and two together and they know every time my journey it's an opportunity an opportunity means they might get a meal they know that them suckers this small now I'm telling you they probably smarter than me that's what I'm thinking I hate to say that it's probably true loading is probably smarter than the old fisherman Oh this fishing ain't the size of goldfish my whoa hors d'oeuvre fish Bologna don't go slider g-got dive down together fight for the fish if one of them come out the water scoot across the water trying to get away from them then he swallows it real quick that's that's the way they do it he'll go out to thirty yards and swallow him down he puts his hand up there straight and the doggone Joker goes in his beak and down I got three up hey three up that lies around here and it gets oh damn it the gulls gets on them when they're small birds are diving no bigger than wood when birds are diving let me tell you something they own fish you gotta watch it babies so it's got three different species out here you got lone two girls and it's low-pitched diving birds I don't want you in cold but every little one says the ones that when they dive down apparently they can dive down they kill the shed and then the lows like to get on top of them and he what sandy they lose on top of the water so those the ones that a main birds to watch a little bitty bird they dig at all them joking that every day you won't see them around the boat that's Kiedis they don't like people and when you drive up on them they're gonna leave they like looting Dave team like looting lonely lonely's team now right there forty eight foot is a drove of firsthand the people I'm talking yeah is a pile of percent I ought to be getting one every bite on what ain't bite 48-foot fish everywhere I ought to be kissing there's no water Commission's just like yesterday they shut these fish down live here they're not feeding there where like they normally would something must be wrong in my genes catfish they could be catfishing there's a lot of nice paste and seafood Fisher's don't fisherman knows what he's looking at buddy whopper but he's a fillet hey I promise you that yes sir that's a good hey we'll take him now I got him on the triple rip you on camera look at that pretty bird ain't it pretty don't be alone no oh you a good boy say are you a good mole I told my like that you want me talk to you are you good Bowie say good night your fisherman that bird loves me Hey I'd like a pet oh my goodness it's fish every other people 49 footing whole bottom coming what 49 foot and the whole bottom is good and we're gonna try to catch I don't wanna get back there oh my gosh stay everywhere it's a good fishing net I taught to put out my dog going on a puppet smoked might be something big old catfish I caught that nine pound catfish on the bucket boom yesterday they'll hit that bump is gone for TIG catfish I just hope you don't don't you do it nobody's right on his trail they come up fighting right there they trying to get away floating right on his trail that right there's team every so often I'll get warning I think we remember me from last year they have come here they super super team they'll get right up to my boat and I at one time I can almost feed about my hand he'd come within 2 foot that bird so they almost ting drop it down hey we're catching a few you got to like a few my goodness I appreciate all my fans watching me out there now some wonderful comments I'm telling you right now I have some good people out there to comment and I appreciate y'all liking my show hey we tried I know we're doing the same thing but I'm talking a lot of different stuff and you never know what's gonna happen you don't never know what I'm gonna hook up on loading and I don't want to do them just break my life I ain't got enough with a couple of jigs to lose so I probably just snatched my line just braids won't break I don't think he could there's a name for 10 pound test but I believe the 8 pound mono a brief before the breeze and I won't lose nothing but a crappie jig and it should be ok loading to be able to get rid of that strategy so glowing that was fine just eating no call some on low water conditions now tell y'all the low water conditions making it difficult these big night and I'm making these suckers by nobody tell you they they're too but we gonna make a little video here us being Moody and Monday morning another good day to be alive I got to love it man look at that Sun coming up in the eyes and just got to love it I tell you I love life oh my life is good I'm not rich by no means but I'm rich because I know what I like to do and that is fishing I'm Jordan I'm going everyday hey I'm pushing every day because I don't have any more days I got it I don't want to lose out on no that's good action a fish Oh late run a seller you know hey you don't want to thank it but when you get in the sixties you got a date Hey time flies you ain't got much time left and you better cram in what you want to do because hey it might that might be the last day you get to go you don't want to think about that but it's the truth so take every day is so precious every day I don't tell you fish better they not biting people let's teach everyone how my circles about dude oh coming out of circus when they get used to me but it's there they there and bunches up - let me tell you bunches up all we got to do is make them back I don't be simple enough oh oh run up there and almost gets away in grab we got my start we might change around we might have to change clothes they get kind of used to this although I have been at this spot I bet this spot is here it's a whole new place and but hey they should be used to me here I think they just not be taught that one the culture the dogs on low water you got to turn it to make them that line do the different direction I've talked about I need not be everyone same MO same oh they won't get you've got to change direction good luck to you look at that that's a jumbo magnet and he hit the triple rippled old blue triple drop it back down I'm loving this my wife's over dad's boy she was making let me tell you she was making some dad going pecans in the oven with some kind of praline stuff around I don't know my cook I mean I knew ku but I don't know about I like making and if things were sugar-coated brown sugar on him dead things good she wouldn't let me have but about two up she taken to our office Carter what the old fisherman ought to have priority over any kind of bacon at his house don't you ring oh there it is a no you can animal cut me off I mean all I wanted was a couple more beacons cut me off and I heard give me just enough to tease me and cut me off what that's typical for a woman what Oh Fishman cutting a fool I hit a day Oh late selling him and loaning in loving life let me tell you loving life all we need is some jumbo baby delight to go along with life oh man everything a big hey have a think we try to change their race and we spit in the boat in a circle the dog won't be some tender look at that McGee I'm not taking it and I know what and I know it I'm looking at him I'll fish the food warm up put a spoon out there it might be a big old 20 pound catfish you either take that spoon I think I'm gonna put it down there just to see if I can get one to bite a spell why not give them something different hey then I got a mute it is I'm seeing Pierce I'm not catching fish let's try the old spell we might not catch fish I did that yesterday journey by folk soon guess what now and the Browse phone oh yes I got a silver spoon over there white silver we're gonna drop that right and silver down today and we gonna what we gonna do is we gonna drop it to the bottom Windows moon ride I like to use the open faith I'm gonna casted ride not a spinning rod why just mash the button let it down like I use my 3 rig oh I have it a little bit heavier rod not much heavier than what I'm using just look at the most out on the end but it's fun yeah we got a point oh nine which is a little bit over half ounce one just a fraction over a half pound we just yo-yo it real soft let's see we can't see if they'll bite that they might not touch it let me tell you these fish are feeling here today I can tell you already you know I'm all finished like that I need to be catching when I'm not catching that tells me they're gonna be really hard to catch I warned him David probably aim hit up better they not gonna be easy what we gonna do is one puppet he didn't want it no he just kind of no daddy you got I'll take it that's code fight million hit again I'm taking it they hit that spoon go it's a good chance to we might catch the big kick may not be like sandy the snow em suckers I can't watch you do you do it none of you go catch yesterday we're the low water the water fell from Saturday night to Sunday morning and I got over here Sunday the water just like it is today no water whatsoever now if they was to start pumping just water back in the fish will get red hot they was going to feed just like the tide coming into ocean right now they don't want to spook you see that they got on hey don't and they showed me they don't once they hit the date I pumping it they just bump it out tell you hey popping it ain't a so this little spoon activity working at all I once catching a couple owners on a Jeep hey bumping it but not take hey just costing feed see it didn't take me that long I mean I've had a couple bites yesterday I picked it up bump me a couple times that big old catfish they don't want they don't want spunk it's not the day for the spoon I wish I had a girl trampled 1 1 G here I'm gonna trample just to give it a try this ain't working now you tell you hey see Mike don't go trolling motor don't spin around told me to leave he got one he's a nice one too hey he's a nice-looking him jump oh man let's watch out there it just ain't right look at the size of that jumbo man super dog on a dog going bumping phones which into the lamp you only went after my plug leader huh you get good enough to realize what you looking at on that fish man and I wish I had two different technologies I could have ice cream toward that fish finder and me at the same time have it up in the corner and I know you can do that and I can really do some teaching then I've even thought about just putting my dog on camera on the fish finder and talk but y'all won't see me catch the fish I don't want to do I wish I had a thing on some kind of pivot where I get returning that would be Shannon on the fishfinder and I'll be different times and I can really teach you how to fire them but I like to blow my screen up man I don't know if I've told y'all that but I like split screen I always go on my fish finder to the split screen which means one half of it is four times bigger and it only shows from about halfway to the bottom the other half shows from top to the bottom and I'm always I hardly ever look at the screen that says top to the bottom I could have a full screen really if truly I can be having a full screen half way down to the bottom but I do split Kate something a bunch of up high and I want to see what's up high but most of the time I'm assuming in with my eyes on the split screen that was fees right now it's important people it makes the same thing is on the right side at the bottom but it's four times the bigger on the screen you can see stuff real close to the bottom and that's the key being able to know what you look at split screen view crappie fishing shower a few inch I love water looking at a fish finder a 15 20 foot DP fight what a half full strength top to the bottom all the time but when you deep water fish you want to grow up that's close to the fire that's where the position so you want to see what's down that way your fishing is what you want to do that's what we do it this just but this phone thing working they don't want this pump I'm gonna have to put the crappie jig back in everyone everyone that one everyone they just don't want this folks I'll tell you that right now they just don't have water so we're gonna go back with triple ripple and see that's a lonely order I was hoping I was gonna catch catfish what I'm hoping I don't like funny no more I think I'd rather walk conductors with the triple room that's what I believe and let me tell you if I believe it that's what we're gonna do I can tell you that because what I believe my instinct always leads me right always it's cold now I took my hat off through this video and I kind of wish I would winds getting up it's alright to the wind gets up wind gets up it's free and fresh but hey we aren't let you go in a minute we ain't caught me in a fish we tried but it's slow and I want to show you this slow you got low water conditions you got Tony playing around you everything's against you right here but when they raise that water that's gonna be a killer from banila good but oh he robbed a pump they hit this one crappy cheap but I'm into that spoon I'm promising they're getting crappy cheap better that's fun triple ripple slide they hit better especially if they think it's getting away from hey show you the difference sometimes when they bite me I use photo that's the fastest theories they bite that's a lot of time you got to do something you might catch you a big pass on that phone cuz I've got some nice bass on the strategy - I had one man asked me on the show but he wanted to know if I've told when the camera is off do I talk to myself well the answer to that is sometimes but I don't carry on a conversation with myself you know so sometimes yeah I might say something but I don't carry on a conversation and I was replying to him on my cell phone but I hadn't been used to doing that I know I'm gonna do it on a computer can I accidentally wipe this company at all so he probably thinks I thought bad about that comment but I did and I accidentally not knowing what I was doing a dog on cell phone accidentally white just coming off trying to come in I want to apologize for that no board did I told you I'm better cannabis pores work for Gregory electric he I forgot his name on the camera I wanted to say his name was Travis and his last name started with a P I can't remember his last name but I remember Travis Pete and I wanted to have a shout out for Travis because he was a delight to talk to Academy sports and I appreciate all you people that see being and come up to me and talk

they come get they come to business go fishing every day a week I guarantee you that birds can recognize the old fish no question we will have a hard day we will be cleared with Loney a lot today

"mzlnEZiVawM": "[Music] [Music] and we live oh yeah what go makes them not only one too but for easy cupcakes hey they're like pop Hawai yet I'm gonna take a rip first with you guys and I'm gonna wait and see if Michelle comes in because I got her package today and I want to open it when if she comes in so I will start telling you about this one how are you guys ok these are so simple they're so simple - isn't that what Mary Jane always says they're so simple dude okay all right the first one we're gonna make I call the coffee walnut cup cake hello running from Scotland now you can put them in a coffee cup okay I have my coffee in here and I'm gonna put all of them in little containers like this okay and in here I'll tell you what I have so I don't read what's going on it's because I'm trying to teach you something hey show okay so the first one is start out the coffee walnut cupcake okay now you're going to me your bowl two tablespoons of camera butter or regular butter whichever you prefer melted so I'm going to come out in here [Music] I'm gonna leave that because we're going to use it again in the next recipe now we're going to use three tablespoons of condensed milk and you know condensed milk is really really thick [Music] so there's one [Music] there's two daughter ball the fall over [Music] now you can buy these containers at the Rite Aid or you can buy a Mac CVS or the 99-cent store they're like I think they're a container full of their microwavable safe and they are dishwasher safe okay so now we're gonna add the 4 tablespoons of coffee now in this recipe you can use two tablespoons of dry coffee powdered or you can use a liquid like I did and now we're going to get four tablespoons of flour one to three are now in the bottom of this little container when I started was a pinch of baking soda and a pinch of baking powder now I'm just going to stir it up and make sure all the lumps are out that's why you want to melt your butter okay I love these double-sided spatulas because there you have the bigger side you can make wishes hey you're really grow welcome okay now is mixed up so we'll leave that one there you're gonna cook it in the microwave this one you're gonna cook all these in the microwave with the exception of the last ones gonna go one minute in 40 seconds but all the rest of them are going to go for about two minutes okay so we have that one mix now we're going to move on to the second one now the second one is called Stars Nutella cupcake okay in the bottom we have the pinch of baking soda and a pinch of baking powder I have one tablespoon of cocoa powder you can use dark or light whichever you prefer three tablespoons of flour now in this one we're going to use four tablespoons of milk where's my milk I need to get another spoon one [Music] to three four and 1 tablespoon of Nutella [Music] make sure you get all the goodness out of there she tablespoons of butter cannon butter if you want or regular I'm using camp there's too [Music] now I'm just gonna stir this one up this one's are going to be a little bit thicker and harder to stir up because you're using the Nutella but it'll stir up just stir it up get all the mumps I'll make sure you kind of scrape the bottom because you want to get your baking powder and your baking soda now the trick with this one if you want to UM add chocolate pieces let me get a paper towel if you want to get make chocolate pieces in it like I do I can I you can choose little heath pieces or you can choose Reese's peanut butter pieces or chocolate little Hershey's pieces so I I got cacao pieces okay so I'm just gonna throw in some cow chips okay and now this one I'm just gonna give it another stir okay now that one is done that's number two okay now here's number three for you this one I call my chocolate deluxe mug and cake okay let me rinse mine's my spoon I probably wouldn't have mattered because this one's chocolate but I don't I'm out about cleanliness you know okay so now that one's done - all right let's move on to the chocolate one okay here's our container we have nothing in this container we're going to put three tablespoons of all-purpose flour one and a half teaspoons of cocoa powder dark or light your pinch of baking powder and your pinch of baking soda in here all in this little Bowl is going in now I'm going to add two tablespoons I've can of butter to this one you guys you can make these after dinner in two seconds two shakes to a lamb's peel you can have these done for your family for yourselves or for whatever now this one's gonna have some milk and I didn't pour it I thought I had everything [ __ ] [Music] this one's gonna have four tablespoons of milk - just regular mouth [Music] now just stir this one until you get all the lumps out this is the thicker one because this is a really deluxe chocolate cake and it's amazing you guys will love it now all three of the ones that we've done so far you're going to cook them for two minutes in your microwave at about 855 degrees now you know depending on where you live your microwave and is going to be a different temperature than mine your humidity is gonna be a little different than mine so just kind of watch it and you want to just make sure your cake is fluffy and kind of looking somewhat dry you can always put a toothpick in it okay now that one's done so that one oh those are done all right let's move on to the last one shall we alright we're gonna cook all of these live because they only take a couple minutes okay now this one I call my I've given you guys the cupcake in a cup before on my channel I'm gonna give you a brownie in a cup okay this is kind of like a brownie this one you're gonna cook at about a minute and 40 seconds just until it looks dry - I'm gonna just pull my ingredients over here what you're gonna need in this one is one egg just whisk it up I'm gonna put it down here [Music] you can have fun with these you can make them your cupcakes in a cup they're yours okay now you're gonna add four tablespoons of sugar to this one just regular sugar okay there's four now we're going to add instead of cannabutter we're adding two tablespoons of kanar oil infused and I've melted it so I'm going to add that in there I'm going to add one tablespoon of flour with this one and I'm adding Q tablespoons of cocoa butter again now you can use light or dark okay so I'm going to mix this one up and then I'm gonna go over the recipes again with you as I'm cooking them okay and so just so you know them all and we didn't miss anything now I'm just gonna stir this one up this one the reason I called this one kind of like a because it's like I call it a brownie because it's like a cake cake like brownies weird if you cook it a little too long it would be definitely a brownie but if you cook it you know just the minute and 40 seconds just until it looks a little dry and you can take one of the you know these skewers that you have and just pop poke it in the cupcake and see that it's done and the reason I used all these so you guys could see what each one looks like I can definitely smell the cannon in them okay I'm gonna mix this one just a tad more I think I want to add a little condensed milk to this one one tablespoon because it looks a little dry to me and I want its my cupcake right so I can make it any way I want I like the taste of condensed milk because it makes everything sweeter that's better because you want all your cupcakes about the consistency of this this one looks like mud you guys this looks like something that your kid would bring in from the yard mom I brought you a cup of mud that was perfect okay this one needs a little more stirring let's stir her you definitely want to make sure you on the first one the coffee walnut one you definitely want to make sure you get all your lumps out because this is gonna be a lighter cake and then you're gonna have walnuts on top you don't want to put your walnuts in the oven unless you've roasted them is there just they're not gonna taste that good okay so all of them are ten okay so the first recipe are you guys ready it's the coffee walnut cup in a cup or cake in a cup okay two tablespoons of butter cannabutter or regular butter it's up to you three tablespoons of condensed milk four tablespoons of coffee you can use your coffee from the you know the morning when you had coffee and you have a little cup left over you can use four tablespoons of fat or you can get a powder coffee mixture and put two tablespoons of that and two tablespoons of the liquid coffee and you're going to just stir that up and then you're going to add your four camp spoons of flour to it and your 1/8 of a teaspoon of baking powder and a pinch of baking soda now the reason I said a pinch and all of these because if you google it 1/8 of a teaspoon is a pinky so that is that one and you're going to cook it for two minutes on the microwave at 855 so we're gonna put this one in the microwave now the two minutes okay now then the tabla one is one of my favorites this is two tablespoons of cannabutter or regular butter 3 tablespoons of condensed milk four tablespoons of four tablespoons of milk 3 tablespoons of flour 1 tablespoon of cocoa 1/8 of a teaspoon of powder baking powder and the pinch of baking soda and then one tablespoon of Nutella so because I didn't add 3 of the condensed milk I only added two because I thought it looked dry I missed that and I should should have added 3 and I only added the 1 because I thought it was dry remember so I'm gonna go ahead and might add my other two to this [Music] oh yeah that's much better [Music] much better we've got about 14 seconds [Music] now for the one that's coming now they have the walnuts here to put on top and all my dirty dishes away not Extra Butter still gotta make better now if you want to take them out of your containers you can you can take them out if you want to cook them in a coffee cup and take them out of the container and turn them upside down you can certainly do that I would spray them with a little bit of mic spray okay there is our coffee cake let's see if it's done oh yeah completely dry so we're going to let now and cool and if I can get them all cool then I'll flip them upside down on the plate and show you so now I'm going to put in the Nutella now this is the same two minutes two minutes and at 855 degrees okay make sure you try to get all your stuff off the rim so you don't make a mess in your microwave these are perfect containers okay that's the second one you guys have any questions on the first two the reason I'm letting them cool and before I add anything so I can flip on the only one I added anything to was the deluxe I added the chocolate number okay this one here it's the chocolate mug this is a deluxe really this is three tablespoons of flour one and a half tablespoons of cocoa powder light or dark an eighth of a teaspoon of baking powder a pinch of baking soda stir that up at two tablespoons a can of butter or regular butter 3 tablespoons of condensed melt and four tablespoons of regular Mountain to that stir all the lumps out of that one and cook that one for two minutes as well if you're gonna add something to this one I would add it now before you put it into your microwave I'm gonna put a little tiny bit more flour in helmand got ten seconds that's what I love about these they're so simple they're so simple do and you can make them with your friends you can have a party and everybody can make the type that they want or the flavor they want or the toppings they want you can put caramel and nuts and all kinds and nice goodies on them they're very inexpensive to me and the thing is they're all [ __ ] homemade everyone every one of them okay this one's almost out you ready we that's the Nutella Oh perfect okay now we have the chocolate mud cake we're going to put in okay now we're gonna I'm going to tell you the recipe on the brownie okay if you're ready for the brownie the brownie is a more of a cake brownie type it's not if you cook it longer it's gonna be really brownie okay this one I use one egg and I whipped it then I mixed four tablespoons of sugar with two tablespoons of kanar oil infused you can use whatever oil you want I now write one tablespoon of flour and two tablespoons of cocoa powder again you can use whichever cocoa powder you choose to use light or dark and that is it this last one only cooks for a minute and 40 seconds though because you have added the chocolate pieces to this so you want to be really careful that you don't know did we have them to this window we didn't we're adding to the other one I just have the bags sitting there I'm sorry discard that discard that it's why I don't edit my ship and that's it there are four different types of cupcakes you can make for your family I have walnuts here I have caramel balls here I have cacao chips here I have hurt heat or chips here Reese's peanut butter soy nuts and caramel syrup and chocolate syrup on your welcome grain grower thank you for coming in you always put a smile on my face dude this one is my favorite this one's my favorite the chocolate mud cake that I call the deluxe mud cake ah I wish you could smell this one I really do now this one will make a little smaller but I'll tell you what if you have a chocolate this will fix it this will face it dude okay now this one this one actually will make up enough for two people so I'm gonna put this in for a minute in 40 seconds to a minute and then up to 40 seconds see if I can find it a tray or at least take one of them out of here so y'all can see let me get rid of these really quick [Music] I'm going to put this one back on for another 35 seconds or so because this one on my microwave doesn't go in increments of 40 goes in increments of 35 so I'm going to put it on for another 30 minutes or 30 seconds I think I can use this plate for the mom that's why I like these you just tap in when they come right out that's not quite done so I'm gonna take it back in okay now this is the walnut one so I'm gonna take a little bit of time let me see if I can get this one off really quick oh yeah I'm just gonna take some walnuts on this one and I'm gonna bring it up there and show you it now this is the walnut coffee remember [Music] let's go another 30 seconds so you can add caramel or you can add chocolate if you want to I am just gonna add a little bit of caramel because I like like hazelnut caramel cream on my coffee so I'm just gonna stick this on there you guys can have so much fun with these they're so simple and they're a beautiful beautiful desert look at that it's a beautiful beautiful tank right there and it took how long a second to make right okay so much that is the coffee walnut so let's do the Nutella I'm not going to show it to you until I got it all decorated in Nice okay now then the tell them then the teller you can choose whatever you want okay you can put walnuts if you want walnuts you can do whatever you want but I chose because I'm so organic about everything join us and I am going to take in drizzle a little bit of chocolate and a little bit of car and then this one I'm just gonna pop on some these are honey roasted soy nuts and that's that one and I will definitely cut into one and show you what it looks like okay so now let me check this girl in here not quite let me get one more plane this one you can have fun with this one is my favorite and I put caramel or heat or whatever I want on it but I'm telling you it is a little smaller it looks a little smaller sometimes but it's not and when you start eating it if you need some chocolate this will do it I'm not kidding now this one I'm just going to take and throw on here these are a little chunk sofa they're called bits and brittle what they are is little heat bars that are just crunched up the inside of the heath bar but it's not a it's not the chocolate on the outside and then I'm just stick a little cup of caramel balls and that's that one I love these and you can put caramel not too so let me get the last one I think it might be done now ooh hot hot hot I think my that what I really enjoy a lot too is the walnuts the walnut coffee cake now this one I'm gonna do a little bit different and I'm going to take just a little bit of powdered sugar and I'm gonna sprinkle it in my hand but I'm just gonna sprinkle it over the over the cupcake and then I'm going to add some cacao there - cow chips and then I'll just drizzle her with a little caramel and that's that one see if they're amazing you guys super super super simple now let me cut one open which one do you want me to cut 1 1 2 3 or 4 because I can't hate them all so I gotta go find some neighbors that are hungry you want me to do that coffee cake oh sure come on down money number four you want me to do number four I know it's the [ __ ] bomb right shell okay we'll do number four okay now number four remember number four is the one that we put the can of oil and not cannabutter okay so let me show you the inside Oh God that's gonna be crazy good you guys crazy good ah that was a good pic to shell because it's still warm and the chocolate pieces are melting on the top oh my god okay I'll have to show you this one though okay ready this is my favorite one of my faves look at that now you can when you cook it put walnuts in there but oh my god that one is to die for so good so so simple now you can get these little boxes like this at Walmart they're like a cupcake box and they have little dividers in them and what I love about these containers is your cupcake will fit right down on there and you can fold it up and you can cellophane it and you can store them in the refrigerator or in the freezer for three months if you do that just make sure that um you mark the date that you made them so you know when they're no good after three months okay because what I like to do with these is when I have girls night or girls over everybody picks they're kind of cupcake they want to make we run down to the store everybody picks out their toppings and their flavors and whatever they want and we come home and we do dabs we get lifted and we enjoy social hour with the ladies the men are all gone they're usually down to Lake fishing or something and it's a lot of fun and we I have a very very big kitchen as you can see this counter goes from here all the way over to there to right there and you can't see that portion of it so and it wraps around my whole kitchen and then I have chairs all on that side like barstools so everybody gets their own station with a placemat and everything it may set up their dab rigs right there because we have plugs right here it's a lot of fun it's a big blast to do oh I wish you did too let's take a rip me why I mean wave it my my sticky mess and I'll take it I take a rip with you guys I hope that you guys enjoyed those recipes they're so so simple anyone can do them and by all means you do not have to have any of these infused you can certainly supplement regular coil in the last one and butter regular butter salted butter than the other ones if you want to make them with your grandchildren or your daughters or anything like that or your or your sons I'm gonna be making I thought about bringing you guys the pancake recipe because the pancakes are really simple it's only three ingredients for pancakes and it's a nice sultry breakfast in the morning to have with your family and you can easily whip it up but I thought I want to bring you guys more than just one so I said [ __ ] it I'm gonna bring it forward why not to do these four in less time than it would have cost would have taken me to bake a complete cake in the box correct cuz the cake in the box probably would have taken me 10 maybe 12 minutes to mix up preheat my oven and then bake for what 25 to 32 minutes or something like that these are all homemade from scratch with your beautiful hands and your loving heart and your family can decorate them any way they like that's what I like about them and you can have them cannon or knockin and don't matter I have I still have yet to make my son I have seven soaps to do CBD soaps to do today and about 20 20 lotions with our 20 creams and 20 lotions so everything is all over my kitchen table to do that I haven't began yet but I will once I started it goes really really fast and I would video that for you guys but unfortunately that's my recipe that for my products that's my line and my mind I'm having branded so I really cannot share that I can share the product with you though I'm happy to do that I've been just trying to make them up as it as I get the orders because I don't want I want to be stuck with a bunch of stock that I can't get rid of because everything has a shelf life even if you put a preservative in it even if you add an additive it still has a shelf life yes it's longer but it's still going to have a shelf life and I've been watching a lot of people on YouTube saying that vitamin E is a preservative no it's not so you cannot go to invite him in the e in your sab and expect it to observe it you'll have nice fuzzies all over your sab or your lotion the next time you go to open it or black around your rims and I I just I don't don't get me started there because I just there's a correct way to make product and there's an incorrect way to make pottery and if you're going to spend your time making the product and putting your name on it one we should be spot the [ __ ] on with your products - you should be accountable and tested for everything you do and you should be commercially regulated and if they're not I probably not gonna bite cuz I've gotten rid of too much too much 150 dollars I've paid for four ounces to CBD you guys 150 bucks I paid as high as 180 dollars you guys never buy that stuff I want some different way I want I mean I'm gonna get another one I want to do please let's try some or what so here let's try some in this one oh yes that's the madman [Music] they don't have a clue my um my my goal is this is I'm I'm trying to get into the doctor's office like my first one I went to is dermatology because I want my line there I want my skincare line there because my skincare mine is ten times better than anything they're selling in that store or shop or doctor's office and mine is a tenth of the price than what they're charging their customers for I I have even thought could I spin and outside and just hand people samples I couldn't do it I couldn't do it because I thought I was doing something wrong you know here's a business that's trying to sell product inside and here out here offering samples I I thought that was a little tactful so I didn't do it so but I did purchase some of their products I have purchased for their products because I've been a dermatologist patient for my whole life my whole [ __ ] life my mom took me religiously and it was because I had cystic like cystic skin and so my father and my mom they would not let us wash our face with soap ever we couldn't use my regular bar soap to wash our faces so we made so far we use Noxzema or witch hazel like the extension with witch hazel so we just learned to make our own soaps now I have button I bought the bar soap for as much as 18 to 20 bucks for a good bar soap that I wanted brought it home looked at through looked at the King ingredients compared it to the ingredients on myself one they used to lie in their soap which I don't know about you but I don't want to bathe with lye I'd rather have a cold press soap than lie welcome back so I do cold press soaps I don't use lye in myself they use products like carriers that are not the proper carrier to get through the seven layers of the epidermis or I don't know I find really weird stuff on the label so I said [ __ ] it I'm gonna start making you know I did I stopped doing it when I got married because my husband thought it was kind of weird and then he passed away and I remarried and I started making soaps again and and you know conditioner and face creams and Sam's and things like that and it was just a matter of time before I have an opportunity to get mine skincare line out there and it's a skincare line from everything from your feet to your face you can use the same bottle from your feet to your face why do I need to buy ten different [ __ ] kinds of bottles for ten different kinds of things that should be doing everything I need cracked heels dry feet eczema psoriasis itchy skin oily skin you know if you're doing it right if you're doing it right I cannot keep the motion the bath salts and the CBD SAP creams now all my products are CBD with derivative all of them on the shelf which one Shannon I have cream I have the lotion I have the sow the bath salts which one did you want right because I'm you can you can instant message me on IG I should post pictures of the mall and pricing but I didn't they stirred as low as like $15 $18 for this the CBD bath salts for two ounces because you only use like a teaspoon in your bath it's a lot about so and you really don't want to buy much more than that because as I said things have a shelf life to them now on bath salts your shelf life is gonna be quite a long time oh hey show your bath salts are gonna be much much longer than anything that you're using you know my motions in my Sam's have a year i heerd she cute Mike I would say the SAP probably you could get away with for 15 months but after that it probably starts losing its proprieties in the CBB I'm breaking down because it's been set out at room temperature so it's best to start get a new one okay sure I can yeah the bath salts you can do for yeah it's 15 for the bath salts Shannon and I'll show you this is a lot of bath salts it's a lot of salts and they're so yummy you'll want to eat it you'll want to eat it and the motion the lotion is I have two ounces and I have four ounces this is um this isn't quite full I would fill this up more well now it's full it's pretty full and so the two ounces are you know the I think these are four ounces I'm not 100% sure these are like 15 bucks 20 bucks Michelle thank goodness you're

shouldn't be taken as many times [Music] hammerhead X I never had that what is that is that an indica and sativa right why not five I was thinking of taking it down I'll take a cap before before I leave you guys have to let me know if you try these recipes because I've already eaten probably two cup two of these myself one with the two tablespoons of coconut oil infused oh you're working on your room how's it going doll that's exciting well it's funny that you say that because med man is across from the white rhino that's what Mad Men is but it's off that's an f1 and then it was back crossed to a purple kush for f2 and it still took on them it still took on the Med men THC content in it really heavy hitter above 19 above 21 percent THC if you look at my my vast harvest now the one before it the one before this last harvest that I did I have the med man and you can see how well she is and I'm holding her as a bouquet that was one plan that was one plan I doubled down book dude high eight I ain't almost all of this one the walnut one I've eaten half of this one and half of the brownie the only one that's still sitting here home is the Nutella it is and what was really weird about it is it had one main stock and then it had a couple branches right like most plants do you know one this way one that way how they do she had 14 made [ __ ] branches where she stacked but all the way up to the apical of those stems as if they were the apical stem and her apical but if you look at the pictures where I'm holding her it might even be on my Instagram too I'm holding her as if okay or not because I did trimming live with her I cut her down live and showed everybody I keep saying I'm gonna drop more of those beans because what I love the way that plant grows it's a beautiful [ __ ] plan I would buy well I did one I did I did I have cute right now you want them Michelle I have two Mendo males right now endowed oatmeal's I don't know if I could grow a good male I don't know um I give it a [ __ ] good world though you know I'd give it my do my best because my garden is what saves my life every single day and I'm telling you if it wasn't for me being in there working in my kins I can't find my emails either right now I probably wouldn't be doing as well as Williams yeah I know about males too I'm all about males but here's my thing yeah here's my thing I don't breed I don't yeah I don't think it's no waste of water or anything like that because especially these plans they're absolutely [ __ ] stunning and they're beasts and I just I haven't cut them down yet I haven't killed them yet because it's breaking my heart that I have to do them but they're away from my [ __ ] inside of my house they're outside I did give him some water and some nutrients did they outside after I [ __ ] with my tents on the inside because those [ __ ] pong sucks today outside they're open so I caught them I kind of suspected it the night before last where I saw it just like one and I wasn't sure cuz it wasn't all the way out but I could kind of I kind of my gut was like I bet you Europe ma'am and so the first thing I did when my lights came on at 1 o'clock because you know when they're sleeping there they're [ __ ] growing you would get busted for why you could do it in your closet dude no one would know no one would know I grew I grew it for friends for them bet your

happening because I I live on a private lake at all at all right Wow and I come up the road all the time and I see like little pop-up birds that just happen just pop up and then all of a sudden they're gone I'll bet you because it's Oktoberfest it's hardest fest how bet you you can drive down the road the drive and probably see a bunch that are gone just abandon that's I've gotten lights and hoods and pots and tools and Grover yeah there are parts of Grover I think it's called the the district and what it is is it's an industrial portion but they actually put the ganache is on letting the

cherish this forever please be sure and tell energy I said thank you and Michelle dude thank you so much and I really mean that this means the world to me I had no idea that I was doing what I was doing to help you and I'm just so grateful that I was able to do it's gorgeous isn't it it's just and it looks so stunning as a choker and I'm gonna be a cat for Halloween so I think it's gonna be perfect for Halloween Oh make him make him one of these cakes make him the one that won the walnut coffee before he goes to work in the morning he'll love you for it it's this one here and it'll take you like three minutes to whip it up in two minutes in the microwave and he can eat it on his way she is oh we should you should the chef a channel or does she know my channel or can I look her up on Instagram cuz I would love some ideas about the cat cuz I'm blonde hair blue eyes I mean do you guys see many albino cats probably not not with blonde hair and I'm not gonna dye my hair black although I could probably wear a week but I don't want to spend that much I'm all about doing it savvy you know saving money so if you have ideas or your girl has any ideas look me up on IG tell her to send me a message I'd love to talk with her that'd be dope man albino cat right and albino cat like put my hair up in a really high ponytail and paint [ __ ] face all white when that happy brilliant because have you ever seen one I've never seen one that we were discussing that today we never see one and everybody keeps telling me do it and like they have oh yes yes we got some like this where are they [ __ ] they're in my truck still I've got they have they have like it's kind of like you know where the pupil is and then on the side where like if you saw us donors I and it was all red it's black and the eyeball is red they're [ __ ] it's like tripping Alice in Wonderland theme show yes last year I was Raggedy Ann we were Raggedy Ann and Andy and the year before that we were no last year we were Dorothy and Toto and the year before that we were Raggedy Ann and Andy so I was trying to figure out something because we always go as a couple and I you know he gets into it when I get his costume and [ __ ] so if I could think of a creative way for him to come up to be a tomcat like you know one of those Tomcats they're always running around and chasing the [ __ ] in heat if I could figure out something to do that would be a pretty pretty dope costume I'm thinking about it I'm saving my paper towel racks and I got my my Harry Potter candles done and I got Murray sky all done and I got my place and that's all done for the party it's it's going down Friday so I have to be done so yeah the sky is done I've got one two three four five six six candles about this big that already hang from my chandelier and then I did the sky on top of the ceiling with bags like a trash bag and I had a paint party in my living room and then I used paper towel wrap you know as paper towel holders like these when you run out I saved them and I hot glued them on like hot glued just like glue kind of run down it in different patterns and then I painted them like a candle and in the end of them I put a little you know those little tea lights that light up they have like a little candle already in the center and you just turned them on and so I hung those in there and I'm hanging them from the ceiling so it looks like when the lights are off and the candles on the candelabras are lit that the candles are hanging by themselves because it's from a wire it's [ __ ] dope so the costume has to be spot-on it's an awesome idea because look these are the these are the [ __ ] these are the candles see the candles already those are candles already and that paper better the trash bag fit we had to measure it but the trash bag fit up there perfectly and we just did that square so where we're eating where everybody's eating they will come they will have it underneath that with candlelight so those candles are permanent they stay there and I always like them when someone comes for dinner and so the other ones will go the bag goes up around that and I put it out on my floor and i taked it after I measured it and I just did like a galaxy paint party with stars and whites and blue and really pretty sky colors and then we measured it again and we put it up and then you just kind of hang it like a ceiling just just hang it it's easy and then we're gonna hang me we took the coat hanger and we hung a coat hanger through each one's of the candles now I'd show you the candles but like I promised them not God wouldn't show anybody anything until it's completely then I already showed you those but those are permanent those are there all the time those never come down because I've been painting as you can see all this paint on me I've been painting candelabras because you can make them any way you want and then I went to this 99-cent store and I got these skewers like this but I got the round ones you know there were the dowel like ones that are bigger I think they're a half inch or something and you can take those and you do the same thing with glue and then you can put any kind of Halloween decoration you want like I did skulls on one and what they are are little Harry Potter magical ones and each one is decorated differently yes they are all from the dollar store all of this is from the dollar store because I'm about doing it cheap because the dinner I throw down is a good [ __ ] $300 so if I can decorate for under 20 bucks I'm happy and I love doing it it's so [ __ ] fun going there in fact I'm trying to go there today I'm not gonna make it I'm not gonna make it today [ __ ] because then I've got a lot of ideas about other things but I've already been told I better just continue doing what I'm doing because I got too many ideas going on right now so which means my mind has been too busy I can't [ __ ] sleep it's insomnia man whoo you should make a caramel apple infused I make an apple butter that's Oh got him I'm not gonna talk about that yeah right here see the caramel mmm-hmm this will this will fix that you just put a little bit of this Hershey's caramel syrup you are set to go okay guys I've been on here 95 minutes I know you're bored to [ __ ] piece one plan one love country thank you so much for coming in Michelle I love it love love love

going to discuss why only true full spectrums should bother putting the strain name on their label choosing cannabis that's right for you is a truly personal experience the way cannabis cannabinoids terpenes and flavonoids smell taste and make us feel is the result of specific compound combinations interacting with your body's unique endocannabinoid system both cannabis and our bodies are so complex that when you find a strain that offers an optimized experience you tend to stick with it that's why people purchase products featuring strains they recognize and why most producers advertise those strains prominently on their products but what about products that only take a few of the desired compounds from the strain you like and then pose them as a reflection of the complete strains offering well the real full spectrum concentrate should be a complete and comprehensive reflection of the full spectrum of terpenes cannabinoids and flavonoids found in the strange you seek but there are several distillates and co2 extracted vapes that leave out a lot if not most of the compounds offered by your favorite strains yet they still call themselves a full spectrum that's straight up

guys thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you cheers guys so i can't tell you how therapeutic that is bro you have to smoke it yourself no no no like extra cough it's not rough on the way down it's not rough on the way out that was a big ass blowing rape too that was a huge bomb rip you don't even need that much you can just use a little bit of it and get smacked that's why i like it in my eyes bro instantly instant like closure that's what this week is it gives you a lot of closure you're like whoa whether i've been smoking my entire life now i don't know i think this is gonna be my new favorite that one the sunny g is close to my favorite one too ak-47 is my is probably one of my favorites too um genado headbanger when it's cured is good but man i killed it i killed it with this one you killed it i'm smacking like one hit bro instant instant smack my girl smoked it instant smack my boy bought two strains he wanted mines more he won he bought ak and and gelato had banger and when he tried my bud he lost his mind he lost his mind he was like what the [ __ ] he was like that's just the strongest sweet that i've ever smoked i was like i know me too no jokes no pun intended that's the strongest [ __ ] wii that we've ever smoked we and i've smoked a lot of [ __ ] weeds bro i've only come across maybe three strains that have made me feel that way and my brother introduced me to one of them uh a jamaican strain that that he got that broke up into powder as soon as we broke that [ __ ] to the bong no as soon as i grinded it it was just powder weed and then the [ __ ] keith off out the bottom all of it and then i just [ __ ] scooped up the keith and we were hitting keith bong rips and i think that was the first time that my brother smoked after like months and he like i think he threw up if if not thinking because we were drinking too but dude he was he was on some [ __ ] bro he was on some [ __ ] he saw that [ __ ] was like like when he smoked the the jamaican weed he was like and like another planet so was i bro there was no i don't think any street weed could compare to the jamaican weed because the only other weed that i smoked that was as good as that was a girl scout cookie and it was um you know when i used to trap my heart and it was like an official girl scout it was a super super duper sticky like it was just nasty it was just nasty it smelled crazy it was just a nasty weed man like nasty in a good way you know and blue and cream is kind of like up there it like this looks like what that would have been like if it was um vacuum sealed because when i got it it was like sealed in vacuum right these aren't a vacuum seal they just throw them in the jar which is the [ __ ] reason why i love this weed so much why is it that like some other weeds look like they're vacuum sealed i don't get it i don't get it some of the weeds be looking vacuum sealed from from other dispensaries they look like they're vacuum sealed there's no hairs nothing like i'm like why are these buds so different like are they original strains it's because they're original strains probably like some scientific [ __ ] going on i break water that like no one understands that they're creating these like strange specific strains some of the strains you have to like cure a little longer though i'm not gonna lie gelato they got a little cure um for some reason they got the ak down perfect but like the lemon g was like the second best one and it had the lowest thc the one of the kush is master on i think the kush four is mad strong but it's kind of rough uh kush 8 kind of they're all kind of rough the only ones that smooth right now are blue and cream and ak and i smoked oh i smoked all the weeds bro last one cannatonic i smoked them all except for the box one that came out b-a-o-x or something i haven't smoked down one but as far as like harmony and like other dispensaries bro that's one of these [ __ ] i never even saved all the stickers from harmony and these are actually mad dope they should create nfts man harmony if you're watching this nft your [ __ ] bro these are dope as hell these are actually really really good ideas this is actually an nft like you know it's like this is an nft you know these aren't anything is nft uh these are nfts you know you could turn anything into a non-fungible token bro that's what i'm realizing anybody could crowdfund into your token and make mad money and other people could just hype it up and it could just be this hype thing that eventually turns into a real currency because once you get real money in there it's at the end of the day you're chilling you know like you give yourself a few tokens i don't know i don't even know how it works i think you just collect all the money and the money's just there and whenever you take out i guess that's what happens it drops or goes and i don't know i don't know is crazy i bet you people what they do is they take profit from one crypto go into bitcoin and then go back into the crypto they just go back and forth and strengthen each other up it's like weird it's weird how you can move money like that but that's the future you know nft non-fungible token you guys need to break water you need to create non-fundable tokens harmony you got guys are bugging if y'all haven't created nfcs and you have these lined up already you don't even need to create them anymore you got to put the guys behind them it's over that's crazy you probably had an artist draw those or like in some way manipulate a picture so it could be what it is that robin hood survey [ __ ] out of here let me get that 750 though [ __ ] trying to tell me i'm gonna get 750 from doing a survey let me let me get that anyways guys we're out here blue and cream look at look how smack that [ __ ] gets me oh i'm sorry you know i'm i i grew up in the hood so it comes out i try to be proper and i try to be hood at the same time it's like you have to find balance you know you sound a little crazy i guess you sound like you're trying to be it's like i gotta try to be in the middle somewhere i can't be full hood i can't be full white you know like not white i mean yeah i mean that's how you can kind of like it's kind of racist but you know full i'm gonna say like full american i don't even know full of fully proper like what is that well what is proper nowadays you know what is the threshold of proper like how how much of a complete human being do you really have to be can you have one flaw that it's just okay you could be 99 good but your one flaw could be the worst thing in the world but you could just have it because it's your one flaw come on dawg we all got problems we got more i got multiple problems you know i don't just got one problem we all got problems bro you know some people just deal with them differently and i guess that's at the expense of other people's well-being and that's that's where things get kind of [ __ ] up and wrong yeah i've learned to not try to even um sell weed to people at dispensaries because uh yeah not not anything anything but just you know that's not my my place to be selling weed that's like you going to like a drug dealer's house to sell weed you know that's the same difference like they could just call the cops on you but if you're not doing doing illegally you're going to get in trouble this kind of the whole thing that they were telling us they're like yo if you're getting trouble here you got to move over there and then once you get legal here you move back here all right that's what the that's what they were telling us but like um yeah they're i've i've like spoken to people at the dispensaries and like spoken about like making oil that's really the one thing that i talk to them about i don't really like try to sell them weed try to sell them a lesson more more than anything look at that you know the [ __ ] hairs bro there's hairs coming off of this weed like these little aren't look at that is those strands i love those pictures there it'll be so good i'd buy this again i just buy it just to hold it not not not even smoke it this is crazy weed nah i think i think they're i think you guys are going to win an award i don't know breakwater deserves an award for this week yo i swear to god you need to like pat in this bud and like i don't know bro this is crazy i never smoked a wee like this yo i never smoked a weed i've never smoked a weed that wasn't vacuum sealed like in the street every single weed that i've gotten in the street was vacuum sealed every single week this is the first time that i've smoked that i'm smoking like a crazy [ __ ] strain that doesn't look vacuum sealed at all like even other dispensaries and jerseys look like looks the weed looks packing shield looks compressed as [ __ ] you're like why it's like yo they draw these things you guys dry these things up right after they're done curing that's crazy and then they put in the uv jar so you still keep it in the dark crazy [ __ ] bro this is the best week bro you guys deserve an award i'm sorry again there should be a movie this should be a [ __ ] movie about you guys and it should be at amc look i i i'll do this too it looks like a red eye i like my eyeball i am see you because my name is embarrassed you know a marriage a man just could see i don't know i don't know doug this is crazy i haven't sold my shares to my my stocks been going up and down like crazy i'm like when i realized the math of what's going on my 2000 that i invested when it was two dollars is not worth ten thousand so every time that my account drops 1 000 it's really 5 000 being paid into the account and then when it goes down when it went down when it went down to 4 000 it's like i paid them 10 000 dollars you know a loss is like a payment like a a a loss within the the red when you're in the red you're paying them you understand that so when the loss is great the gain is greater i guess you could say that you know other people explain this with mathematics and with like finance like they give you financial advice essentially but then they say i'm not giving you financial advice right but i'm going based off of a feeling i'm not going based off of anything else i feel the stocks i'm like what do you have to offer anybody right and what is value to who's going to be in charge in the future the kids bro a kid who's 10 now in 10 years are gonna be 20 they're gonna be in charge well they're gonna be in charge and i don't think anybody understands that i think they're taking this [ __ ] as a joke some people aren't a lot of people are not and they're making nft everything everything is nft everything every everything i'm gonna make sure this is nft at ft nftnt this is nft i'm gonna [ __ ] post it up on openseed.com you you'll be able to buy it for some ethereum save mc is going to be this symbol right and i'm i'll probably make just one or i'll make 20 000. like one nft token or 20 000 of these so 20 000 people can buy it you know or bid for the one and i'll put some gas behind it it's an investment you're investing in art and you're posting it up and you're having people buy it or not buy it but it gets views anything gets seen that's why i'm trying to take pictures of everything and just alter them take pictures and alter take pictures and and alter that's it or just post up a regular picture i posted a picture of my girl i hope she like likes it i don't know it's her holding a bong and like hiding her her her body but it's nft you know

[Music] what's up guys Brandon Johnson here again and thanks for joining me today I'm joined by one of my good friends credible musician and one of my bandmates kind country Mike heading from Mike heading music calm good to be here it's great to have you here we're gonna be covering some some basic concepts that we've kind of acquired over our many years of playing this bluegrass style of music where we were chatting that band practice right and I know I had some questions about how to transition from back up to your solo and how to get successfully out of your solo into back up and Brandon said hey I've actually had a couple of those scheme questions so I thought it'd be perfect you know you can't really demonstrate leaning back up by yourself right so you need you need another music musical partner to help so that's where we're gonna work on this one together yeah we're gonna cover that and we're gonna cover nine pound hammer we're gonna kind of use that as an example so hopefully this helps you out and I hope you enjoy this one let's check it out yeah the two of you chose to illustrate this topic is the classic bluegrass song nine pound hammer and this is a really good one because it uses the three standard chords the one four and five in whatever key you're playing in and it has basically an eighth measure phrase that gets repeated over and over again so it gives you a lot of chances to get into your solo and get out of your solo and get back into backup and get into your solo this is a really good one it's a jam standard you're definitely going to come across this tune if you've been going to some jam sessions generally nine pound hammer is I think it's played usually in to keep a although I've heard yeah energy yeah probably here in the G position I mean on guitar you know actually same with banjo yeah we both got our cheaters on that cable too ya know so nine pound hammer is a one four five chord progression generally your chords are a D and E if your cable - that's gonna be a G shade a c-shape and a d show so it's really important to know not only the capo cords but it's also I always tell my students it's really important to know the real cords yeah because if you yell G to a bass player or fiddle player you know that's not going to help them at all so I always say it's the responsibility of the person with the capo to know the real chords yeah so the real cords are get our a D are ke pakore SAR G C and D we're probably gonna call the capo chords right when we when we call the song so it's just played through a really slowly okay so here we go one two ready go [Music] so what we really want to focus on is it's good practice to play through the whole song but there's two measures of G at the end of the solo before it starts over and that's really you know we want to give you an overview of the whole song but let's really zoom in and focus on that one part of the song because that's where your pick up to your solo would be but that's also where you would transition into your backups so it's basically the same two measures of G and it's really important to know what we're working with and how much time we have because then you can make your intro longer or shorter you know we know the bounds of what we're working in and then we can hopefully be creative within that so remember we're talking about the two measures of G at the end of the solo before it starts over that's where you're going to do your pick up to your solo and that's where you're going to transition back into your backup two three four two two three four [Music] basically I just played kind of a little chromatic run they're starting on the a string second fret and I'm ending on the root note the open g string and this in this case but we're in key day but and that's a little diets Doc Watson action there yeah that's where your solo actually starts and that's your fresh no D or solo that open yard Street and that makes it easy to start your solo that way because you're just dealing with open string so your left hand is free to kind of go wherever it wants to go you're not actually holding in that so that's why that's cool you're also getting out of that G chord a little early it looks like two you're kind of getting ready to get to your solo if you're not you're not trapping yourself down in that core and that's that can be valuable to is get ready you know and get your hand in position to get to get to your solo yes yep and so that that's just kind of a one-bar transition that you could use coming out of rhythm going into your solo one two three four two two three four [Music] so the the second run I did was again another kind of Doc Watson influenced run but we're starting on the low e-string this time and this is a two to measure run so this is a little bit longer and like you're saying you can kind of you know back up that that pick up a little bit and extend it a little more so that that's the typical you know G run that's kind of a variation of that and then what I do is I go to the g string second fret and I slide up use that open B and then again we're landing on that open G which is you know I like that I like using that open string to start your solos because your left hand doesn't have to do anything right away so you can kind of think about where do I want to go after this and these are these are pickups yeah quote-unquote pickups so you're kind of playing these runs going into a section where you're just gonna maybe improvise so our third strings are starting of our solo right so so one thing I used to kind of jumpstart my own creativity is okay there's two ways to get to our note right we can go up to our note or we could go down to our notes that's kind of what you kind of combine those two because you went you went past the target note down yes that's another kind of interesting concept you can explore just think very generally okay my going up to my target notes so maybe you start on your low string and you run up or maybe you start on a high string you know you walk down to your note so you can basically work those intros kind of in two different directions that's how I think of it so you can basically go up to your target note or go down to your target yeah that's that's an easy way to basically jumpstart a little bit of creativity if you don't know where to start I've absolutely one two three four two two three four [Music] so the third the third transition run that I did here again we're utilizing the open strings and like you said the target note yeah and in this case the target note is the roof note you know and that's kind of the easy yep that's very don't blame yeah very cop go to the root and I think it helps you other musicians to just get everybody on the same page but you know again with this this third transition run we're sliding up here from the second fret to the fifth fret d kind of using that that string underneath it so I'm going down down and you're kind of letting that that fifth fret d-ring a little longer that's classic so where does that come from yeah you have no idea that's a fiddle that's a fiddle bowing technique okay it's a little shuffle bow so I think they call the Georgia shuffle or the yeah Nashville shuffle one of those I forget but basically it's it's the guitar or the banjo equivalent of doing that bow that bowing technique so it's a very down it's a long short short long down down up down down up that's sometimes they call that potatoes and that's a great way to start the song basically you get that's that's also a very good way if the song hasn't started yet yeah to basically set the tempo so you would you would slide in that that's just basically again it's kinda you get the bluegrass equivalent of the drummer clicking their sticks to start the song or you could do you could do it down here yeah exactly yeah but I think it's more important is the rhythm that you're doing is that is that it's called a shuffle rhythm so it's very important and I think that really helps set the tempo yeah it kind of just gets everyone in the feeling of that of the tempo of the song I think so yeah and so you'll do that that kind of that shuffle really I'm talking about and then you can go to the open D and angle that your target note that open G which is you know the root note of the of the eight and that's kind of part of the G run as well a great way to start dealing the timing of the song if you kind of need to get yourself into the into the rhythm of the song that's a kind of a good one it's just okay this is the rhythm that were feeling and then I don't know really helps me anyways [Music] um you know I'm kind of using some signature Tony rice moves there Clarence white moves really because Tony rice got a lot of his allegiance white so I'm using that second fret bead of first fret B as a pull yeah that's the I think I call that the Blue Note right no right all right and you can you can bend that basic what I'm doing there is is um doing a pull off and then with my ring finger landing on the g string third fret and then again another hassle Tony rice uses a lot of half-steps I mean a lot players do but and then from there you're sliding from your third fret G to your fourth fret G so you know that's that's one way that you can kind of you know transition out of your solo if you're if you're in the higher register if you find yourself soloing in G and you're up in the higher strings here you can kind of start to access some of those half steps and maybe throw a little Tony rice run in there and again these are we're kind of you know covering some of the same concepts here like the open G bringing out that's that's a real nice go to when you're soloing kind of in a bluegrass style is that open G [Music] and then from there you can just throw in the standard jiron or something like that and again these are these are the same notes so you're landing on the root note of the key of the chord that of the court or the key that you're playing in [Music] it's also important what fingers you're using to that because you're basically keeping these two kind of hovering over that G yes that yogi chord and you're basically kind of ready to go into the that G chord you basically so I think if you use the wrong thinkers for that lick it can kind of trap you in a bad position that stores if you use the right fingers then you're kind of always they won't work on banjo but you're kind of always hovering over that shape exactly to where you can kind of fall back into that even if you missed the licked a little bit basically yeah use that as your safety net to get back into the core right right and sort of like you said hovering almost like you're you're soloing out of the chord shapes mentally but also literally yeah even if you're not playing them your hand is almost in a G shape right there yeah I always watch your your two fingers basically just kind of yeah hang out there ready to go back now it's ready to go yeah and also you're reminding yourself of what yard you're on so [Music] so this the second transition run here is actually one that you showed me actually but it requires kind of an interesting syncopation so it's it's basically the standard g-ronn like that but where that G is ringing out right there what you can do is you can play the G run then quickly while that G is ringing out you can play that first fret low E which would be like an F yeah additional added seventh note which really loozy yeah really blues not attention that sound of the G and then ringing together it creates that tension and then you get back into your rhythm and it's that tension this is a pretty bluesy song yeah I wouldn't do this on every song right so it's a one-time thing yeah and a bluesy song like this or a man of constant sorrow or something like that a lick like that could work really cool yeah so thanks to you for that one and I have yet to integrate that into an actual solo but I'm going to real soon because I'm getting better at it now so another thing too is when you're coming out of a solo and you know I've seen Tony do this and other other Pickers do this too but when you come out of your solo maybe you can kind of emphasize that first chord when you're going into rhythm yeah with with a smash I call it that yeah that's G smash you know we have all kinds of different terminology for this stuff but but you kind of just that confident downbeat yeah where you're sending your solo home you're you're sending it home but but then you know you might smash that G but then you kind of dial it back a little bit for the next picture yeah but you can kind of send it home with that you know and that's kind of what we were talking about with this you can kind of do do that for your when you go right back into rhythm and yeah I think it's it's also it just it show it illustrates to the rest of the band or the jam session where you think you are yeah in the song so even if you're not right or if you write it wrong at least everyone's knows like hey this is where I think I am and then it's easy to everyone do it just to you you", "vHbUMCcUygI": "[Music] what's good YouTube geez what the [ __ ] was that what's good you - there we go that's better it's your boy the guns of got ganja vape here once again with a brand new video for you all lovely people but you already knew that right I sure hope so today we're gonna be taking another trip on over to the dispensary and looking at some more crumble because this guy cannot get enough of crumble and I got a shout out true leave once again for these packages because they are just top of the line I mean come on you know you got your [ __ ] from the dispensary or from somewhere legit when you got a little ziploc pouch I think that's all Ivy's if he said now without wasting any more time let's just go into it and see what we get shall we and we got some indica but what flavor you might be asking this here is some 9 pound ever boasting numbers of eighty-two point one and zero point two CBD and those are pretty much the main two numbers that you're looking for when you look at this yeah when your hands are sweaty and you just can't get that grip there we go oh yeah smells amazing we got to get a camp shot of that crumb but we got to get a camp shot of that crumble look at that look at out there who might write an episode of Dave Chappelle with the yellow cake don't you drop that [ __ ] don't you drop that [ __ ] one thing I will say and note I do like the different colors of crumble that I have I have here some of it looks like shatter some of it looks like crumble and I mean it's just amazing like I got to get a picture of this afterwards cuz what piss already but anyway y'all not here to see me geek unless I'm on the damn thing gonna go ahead and load it up this micro pal ready now that that's done secure the care package go what I like to do because I've noticed with these type of lids do that that's how you make sure it's closed is by testing it one time I did that with a bottle whatever they had the same concept opened up - this fell out anyway got a last honoraria some of that lemon non-living when with that Jack error mmm there is your so cuz I'm thinking it's something I'm already bout to start doing I'll just save that for I'm never gonna say not about that but what I will say it's time to blast off with some of this 9 pound Hema that red on red I mean come on man just look at that put the red trim in the back come on come on man Cheers how am I gonna cheers with it empty empty cup coming on Cheers all right so that one didn't really catch all of it let's hit it again oh alright analysis first real taste like medicine and it's a indica so it's gonna put me to sleep soon especially since I just got off of work and I'm extremely tired but doesn't really have no real taste of it in the medicinal taste and by that it means by that I mean that it tastes it's just it's just pretty much how it sounds it tastes like medicine but that taste doesn't last long it's now fading away so that's what ten seconds that might just be the coil from this that I'm using but let's see I'm gonna go ahead and uh I'm gonna go ahead and set up a new a new coil since this one has already been burnt with jakir and whatnot so I'll get a fresh coil out and then we'll get a fresh grip for fresh tastes have that sound folks also quick reminder before I I guess I'll say that after at that's it that's all [Music] [Music] so something I wanted to mention I don't know if anyone else notice but when you buy these you can evolve coils from the truly dispensary they don't come with what the guy called the oven you get a pack of five chambers coils five of these but you don't get not one of these which is the top piece that you literally need to use it so I let the guy know and he little it blew his bite a little bit because he didn't realize it he was like oh wow like hey you know I never I've never realizing no Santa another associate I never realized that it doesn't come with the top piece and then the other associate that was on the register was he was looking he was like but he was looking in the display case like he couldn't even like he couldn't even believe it but I mean like it ain't like I was lying I mean like I'm an actual customer who show face they're like and it's like my second pack I bought so ain't like I'm talking [ __ ] or anything like that but anyway I loaded up my rig and we are gonna try out this nine pound hammer on a fresh coil but before I get that I'm gonna put on some lip balm because somebody in my comments wanted to talk about how I had chat livers as if everybody don't get chapped lips like I use lip balm and I drink water you can still get chapped lips just sayin and then if you go look at one of my other videos somebody put in the comments and say greasy ass lips like you ain't gon ever win it's like it's always somebody to say something about something like it did they don't know the story like my lips are greasy though they're not greasy I just put on a lip 3\u00b0 lip balm besides the point nine pound hammer cheers everyone see that medicine taste is still there and it kind of has a little bit a little bit of a numbing on the tongue in mouth 9 pound hammer just hitting in in jaw huh I don't have no taste I let into medicine I gotta say I rate this bait big I rate this crumble a 8 it could be a 9 I mean [ __ ] it me personally I love the different coloration of the crumble with the light in the dark the light in the dark light the light over here in the dark right there I just love it I'll give it a 9 if it gets you up there keeps you up there I mean [ __ ] I would say this is a nice vape for well [ __ ] you're gonna sleep so you have to remember that you can't really I feel like you can't really rate sativa buds muscles here indica buds and in the cup products too much because they're all gonna have that sleepy effect you know oh god see what I'm getting that vote last little bit of mucus wants to resurface at the end of this video well yeah I give this a solid 9 and there's that numbing effect in the mouth again I love it but I love it so go out and get yourself some non power hammer it knock

Tim 420 this is a medical marijuana review for those over the age of 18 all right like say hi to all the new subscribers and big thumbs up to all the old subscribers we're still hanging out with us this long makes if you haven't subscribed make sure you subscribe we still got the 17 giveaway coming up and we're gonna do a giveaway at a thousand subscribers we're not that far away so hopefully we won't too long I haven't nailed the a before giveaways guys I've been really super busy I did take tomorrow off work that's on the list of things to do tomorrow I didn't even make the grand opening of move and Fort Myers on Saturday I put online order and they're made it down there so like I said it's been super super busy so have you seen the thumbnail we've got 1/2 ounces of flour this is tasty our crumble this up through the trash once let the tags on the bag I'm $79 for a half ounce 14 grams that makes a 1975 and 8 that's the cheapest so far around so we got a bag of flour and I took a sticker off get back in there so it's a bag of flour it's coming out with the name modern flour I don't know what the hell that is but this strain is jet a there it is coming at 16 percent THC they said it was a sativa dominant I found very little and I didn't look long it was just on the car ride home but the only Jedi I could find oh so it's usually an indica dominant varieties so we'll have to wait and see they have been known to be wrong before at the dispensary and they usually change it the second week out or so [Applause] so we're gonna do some more surgeries when the bags I don't want to come open and we're gonna put it in something else anyways so so like I was saying some of the dispensaries when they come out with new strange you know moods done at once or twice where they've misdiagnosed restrain or misjudged it it doesn't smell bad which isn't always a bad thing that's which actually got me to like a couple sativas they put a couple sativas it was actually sativa sativas under hybrid and I tried them and they wasn't bad and then next time I come in they're like that's a sativa you guys can see in there's a bag of little popcorns we'll dump it out but they're not looking bad you can see a lot of them so you gonna focus on that you know that on the finger there there's a lot of the trichomes or whatever you wanna say on the inside the bag there little bit of shake left in the corner of the bag down there and if you see that little guy in there is a seed height and looks like maybe another immature seed there but that looks like a decent one there so we will have to watch this for seeds they are little buddy buddy but most of them left on that one yes it gives you something to hold on to show it off your friends probably the biggest but there pull the camera up here and get one that looks decent and some decent sized one there you see some crystals on there see if I can hold it and let it focus the light on a little better yeah not bad looking bugs grinds them up real quick we did get a jar out to throw it in so throw some of that in there it does seem a little dry we'll have to wait till we break into it though you never really tell until you break into them sometimes that crystals on the outside make them kind of harder if there's crystals dry up and stuff I've seen might be talking out my ass but you never know alright let's so somebody from the grinder we got to the bottom there I got kind of real dusty not too bad but a lot more little small pieces about didn't bud I really don't see that much leaf there's a lot of little pieces of broken but it's not the dark green leaves so I said let's twist it up and get a little taste on this real quick and we'll call it a wrap I had different video playing for her today but couldn't quite pass this up so now this was the harvest in Northport so and I think they get their flower earlier than some of the other stores I think some of the other stores will get them Wednesday and Thursday I'm not real sure I don't think too good track on the other stores but I know they was doing it at a different delivery day break they're pretty good good things that means it'll last for a while we have a paper we run out of all the elements we had this protective zigzag the double white elements which are the smaller papers that come like that are hard to find around me so and once again I've forgotten where I bought the last pack at I did get some blunt raps today though so we'll have some maybe a smoke sesh tonight or tomorrow night try out some new flavors of button traps ones a new brand I've never seen before some of you guys might have seen him before but I have it yes that doesn't smell too awful bad doesn't taste too bad either that's more of that gorilla glue kind of flavor which when I kept putting in jet a it kept popping up jet fuel so you would think I'd easily grill a great be kind of or gorilla glue not gorilla grape sorry yeah not too bad like I said more of a glue type taste to it I'll figure out the facts here when I'm done with it so that'll be eight guys if you haven't subscribed sorry that one caught me if you haven't subscribed make sure you subscribe we are getting some giveaways going like said I will get that stuff mailed out tomorrow guys I apologize about that I might try to hit a vape store and see if there was one little thing I was trying to find if they comes in all throw that in as an extra bonus for everybody if it doesn't sorry you just wait longer for nothing no she's a kid so that would be eight guys make sure you subscribe for all the giveaways and all the content if you haven't checked out an artist like centered cheapest now so prices are starting to come down which is a good thing probably should start with that [ __ ] so we got rise vitac and truly move harvest so five of them now we're doing popcorn buds so it is a way for the price to come down so that'll be eight guys make sure you subscribe and until next time hopefully you guys are toking on something good so keep on talking my friends", "rocoVNoRLwM": "what's up guys is the campus inspector with another video today we're gonna review a product from truly called White Buffalo I'm excited to try this product and we're also gonna try a pre-roll called nine pound hammer this is a high break this was a sativa I was hoping to get a product from flew in a move but I've been busy I haven't been able to go to I have held this to the side for a review and it's been kind of dying to smoke it but I left it for them to view first we're gonna try the nine pound hammer now this one is known for its immediate effects the set is that able to sleep barely live and the taste is also similar the buds are supposed to be neon green in color and be shaped like grapes the genetics come from a sativa Jack the Ripper a hybrid Hells Angel G and indica Dewberry the effects include or comments we'd be filling so this was a hybrid the THC content percentage alone this is 17.8 is known to be anywhere from seventeen point eight to twenty five and it's supposed to be extremely potent looks pretty consistent like the past rules I'll show you guys still pitches in between the edits so you guys could see it this was not as packed as the movements were but we'll go ahead and see a higher hopefully it burns good I'm not too much of a fan of these back to the joints but for the purpose of the video investment now the white buffalo excited to smooth this one has a 25 percent THC percentage now this one the scent is often sweet and sour so is the taste it was are often large and have a layer white crystals all over it that's why they call it Gwen Buffalo and the genetics come from IndieGoGo Mulan but I very courage indica and sativa bale of it it's supposed to relax your mind and body so this is also supposed to give you a calm relaxed feeling so this is the full if I haven't touched it yet for the purposes of videos now I'll give you guys do shots during the in-between edits so you guys can see the bud better now by the way these are smaller buzz in the whole line then I copped last time they're more little nuggets but it is very tense I see the crystals right away it smells really good too so I'm excited to try this one this one I actually smell it it was a pre-roll and it also smells pretty good so just stay tuned to the video and between don't be the still shots like and subscribe if you haven't already please do so if you liked the video remember this is for informational purposes and you must be 18 and older to watch these videos okay so stay tuned in a couple of seconds I'll be able to let you know the effects on both of these right here once again I'm gonna roll a grande blood to make it consistent I'm doing the blunts because as far as the gram as much as the gram has been very fluffy so I'd rather just roll it up in their blood and makes it easier for me but to stay tuned to the video and I can subscribe thank you guys you what's up guys back to the video I hope you've got like and subscribe and I hope you enjoyed the videos now before we start to review I wanted to touch on the point about calling the local dispensaries unfortunately they don't seem to have a local number and they have an 800 number and it's hard to get in contact with your local dispensary as far as the online pickups truly live on there twice Thunder online it's been quick and easy been a good experience so I would recommend that for you oh he's carry cash they do have the campaign but once again I wasn't able to work it had a problem so I wasn't able to activate it now another point I wanted to touch on mister bugs this is the top grade white buffalo and I got a bunch of little popcorn white buffalo I was expecting bigger blood so the scripture said that there would be big bugs with white crystals all over this is actually the Hawaiian touch that I got don't be some pictures in between you'll see them compare side-by-side and it's not a biggest but I got the same quality supposedly but the buds have a big difference I didn't like that too much and I supposed to review the 9 pound hammer now the taste was fruity a nerdy kind of like fresh soil the effects would kinda immediate it was a it was a good high decent high I knew I was hot but I was very clear minded but it didn't last one so I want to give this one a three point four it was decent I'll put it in back my list when I pick a flower I'd rather get the skywalker first I really like the skywalker so i want to show you guys everyone and then white buffalo so the white buffalo it had a sweet and sour taste to it very good one thing I could say about it I'm still actually smoking on it I like I like the higher gave me it's a relaxed high I would recommend it for like watching movies or just chilling at the house 9 pound hammer and you know I would recommend it for you if you were going to work wake-and-bake it was a very focus hi I gift it I want to give the white buffalo or four point one is actually I liked it better than the Dutch [ __ ] why so it's it was really good the only thing I've been kabbadi was the birth size and the type of boy I got now for the 4-1 other videos I might want to do a food salad if you don't know what the fruit salad is mix up the two flours I have a bunch of Keef that I wanted to mix in so I might throw that in one of the videos and for the future review and let you know how that goes thank you guys for watching the video like and subscribe once again next time hopefully I have more product for you guys thank you once again", "01mj71-7it4": "[Music] [Music] welcome everybody to a brand new edition of tasteless train on this episode of tasteless train if we have a wonderful indica called 9 pound hammer this strain is 80% indica is a mixture of a bunch of different strains especially the main one is blueberry mixed with Jack the Ripper so it has a little bit of that blueberry and a little bit of spice with it and as you can tell I'm pretty hyper right now and need to calm down another thing I learned about this strain is it's got a little bit of a grape and wine taste to it so I look forward to those two tastes mixed together now let's see what the buds look like on the inside from what it smells like this is gonna be a very powerful indica it's got a little bit of a wine smell to it so let's see what fully tastes like oh well these buds are a little tiny it looks like from the inside it's very dark the strings very dark with the with the green there's not too many red hairs I see on this one it's mostly all just a lot of crystals I see I definitely see a lot of crystals compact on the inside I look forward to tasting this strain all right it is time to calm down I just want [ __ ] slippery let's get moving let's take a look oh look at that pretty it's pretty soft so you can pack it pretty easily nice and packable making new balls as you can tell it's it's got a little bit of light look to it but a lot of crystals everywhere in this and it's gonna be dark let's test this out shall we why isn't showing them we're about have lift-off her own taste the strain on coop and this is not it's not as powerful as the dang strainer but when it comes to it was hard for me to breathe right now now I still see a nice clarity but eyes are been tweaked a little bit this is really hard to breathe right now so let's take another Bowl I do taste that lime flavor to it the great taste it feels like more of a of a a green grape more than just like the right and the right it's definitely one of those hardest strange smoke I still see everything clearly it's not as powerful when it comes to see a seaside we'll see we'll see the the downer effect probably like maybe it maybe it's got a little bit of an upper right now and then goes into that smooth relaxation state so I feel like right now after after coughing out all out my vision was still clear a bit but it's probably gonna go into a little bit of that down time where it's a little bit like that's what I feel that's going let's smoke one more Bowl shall we and once again I want to thank all the people that have been supporting this series from my producers on patreon that goes up to indigo crystal I see I'm already feeling the [ __ ] down see there's there's the [ __ ]

producers of the show you're the ones are getting us these strains that we can test out for you guys and see the effects second bowl of nine pound hammer here we go thanks everybody for attending news it's a string you guys are awesome hmm too sweet", "0EK9fDuN5JA": "hey what is up canna fam and check it out for today's video I'm gonna be trying out some of this 9 pound hammer this is the 9 pound hammer by emerald extracts I have not yet tried this company before this is a new one for me but this is the more budgeted end of the spectrum here in Oregon as far as dabs go meaning that these are $13 a gram for rec and it's like eight or nine dollars gram for medical here in the state of Oregon and so these are the more budgeted lower end and the reason I picked them up is because they have such I don't know if you can see it right now through the package but they have such good color to that I mean that's it looks good it looked really good so I was like you know what I'm gonna try it I'm gonna see if it's worth a damn because sometimes just because an item or a product or whatever is cheap doesn't make it shitty there's a lot of a lot of you know heady dabbers or whatever you want to call them that are like my gems don't cost forty to sixty dollars of gram if I'm that smoking live resin or if I'm at smokin Diamonds then [ __ ] your shitty oil then get that kind of ignorant [ __ ] thinking out of here that's [ __ ] and so anyway we're gonna try these out and we're gonna see I'm gonna let you guys know what I think okay this is just my honest opinion of these follow these guys on Instagram emerald extracts and again this is the nine pound hammer so if you're a fan of the nine pound hammer strain at all let me know in the comments section below and this is coming in at 72 percent THC which is fairly good for a lower end product so to speak so most products that are in that kind of price range usually they're like 50 higher 50s you know anywhere in the 60s per cents so if you can get a product that's 70 or or higher that it to me already is like a big plus okay so I'm just gonna point that out there we're not oh it's got 0.6 C like just a little tiny itty-bitty little bit of CBD in there uh it does not tell me terpenes or anything like that here on the back of either or so that is kind of like a whatever you want to say you know I wish I like when companies tell me the terpenes and stuff like that but nonetheless regardless 72% that is still makes me happy all right so I'm gonna go ahead and open one of these up these bad boys up see this this kind of it's not paper even though I'm like this kind of paper it works great I forget what it's named the science name behind it is the technical term but I do love this I love when they come on this kind of paper so there it is I said paper if you know what this is this material right here then let me know in the comment section below I forget somebody told me a couple times I forgot the name [ __ ] stoners right but anyway that is not bad especially for a $13 gram that is definitely not bad looking like that's why I picked this up I'm sure you can tell and see now why I was like you know what I'll try it out oh it actually has like a actually has like a little sweet smell to it it's already starting to be like okay okay not bad good test results good you know got some good color to it it's a little sappy it's a little you know I wouldn't touch it with my fingers or anything like that it you know probably get a little messy but I mean overall it looks so far so good alright let's do this for this for this product review or whatever you want to call it I'm going to be using this deep sea break here by Empire Glass Works it's one of my favorite favorite rigs just because of all the detail you got dory you can see dory in there little cameo but i mean it's just a really nice rig but then you got the drop down with the turtle and all that I really enjoy it and then uh I don't have my uh not my light on me right here but this treasure chest is actually UV reactive so that's really cool as well a little bonus to this rig but I like this if you'd like to pick one up and go to Empire smokes calm right now and get your own if you like this rig right here really nice rig and again shout out to Empire Glass Works they make some really good good petty stuff that's very affordable so I oh right oh right if you've ever had emerald extracts and you've ever tried this company before any of their products it doesn't matter doesn't have to be this nine pound hammer or not but if you've ever tried any of their products let me know your thoughts your opinions in the comment section just let me know because I'm always open to feedback man always like to hear what people have to think maybe somebody had a bad experience or maybe somebody found some kind of product that they have this you know ultra amazing you never know you never know using this OPEC OPEC quartz pinger let's split them using here got the blue bottom on it ask me about that Wham all right okay we're gonna let that cool down here and I got an all right sighs stab I'm probably gonna get a little bit more of this on this - stick there we go get a little bit more a little bit fatter of a dab some all right sighs Deb I mean look at that color that is bright look at that is that is a nice color I like that I do that that's to be honest this is the kind of color that you get with a lot more expensive you know higher end dabs so to speak you know like the 30 40 dollar range this is kind of so to be able to get that for $13 so I'm just already kind of blown away now I really hope it tastes good that's kind of the big deciding factor in all this to be honest if this tastes like [ __ ] then I'm gonna be very disappointed because you know looks can be deceiving so I have had some stuff before that has looked really good but then tasted like a burnt tire and it was just uh you know what I mean so looks can be deceiving but overall so far I mean good test results good looks it smells good so we're gonna put it to the test right now and again I hope you guys are all having a good day I love you guys thank you for watching my video let's put this to the test in let's see what we got here we might have found a gym [Music] [Music] Wow Wow look at my face hug wow that totally sweet it's super sweet like overall it tastes just like ninety pound hammer I just I'm really shocked this is awesome [Music] that's it's really good that is and it's got a really good height to it hits right away immediate it's not like a creeper or anything like that like it it's nice it's nice and definitely uh definitely tell it's in a 70% I'll Dean definitely tell [Music] that's still good even even as a reheat it's still the terpenes are still there like wow hats off to emerald extracts like you guys killed it with this one [Music] yeah no they did a great job with that I'm very impressed I'm overall very like I'm really happy I got it and I'm really happy that I got two grams and not just one something just told me that hey this stuff is gonna be pretty good that's all I just went with my gut feeling on it and it was right sounds great man like that great product I just gotta say that if emerald extracts ever actually watches this video then hats off to you guys you guys did a great job and you know the fact that you know it's a very affordable I mean that's even more amazing like oh I love it so that was a little bit worried like I said because looks can be deceiving I've gotten product before that has looked amazing like super transparent you know nice beautiful golden amber color you know what I mean like some good test results like 76 78 you know around there and then it just tasted like a burnt tire it was it was so bad that you you didn't even want to smoke the rest of it you take like one davon you bet you know what I mean so looks can be deceiving with certain products here in the cannabis industry so you know just you know forewarned you know not everything is as it is advertised or as it looks alright there is a lot of false advertisements here in the cannabis industry as well so but anyway besides all that great job - thumbs up I give it a - big thumbs up amazing job Emeril extracts again I'm happy I grabbed two of them it's a it's a nice sweet nine pound hammer terpenes are great test results great 72% I mean the overall look I mean it's like I said it's a little sappy you know it's not totally stable or anything like that but at the end of the day it's still a great product and and the price point is to be icing on the cake okay it's like the icing and sprinkles on top so to be able to get something like that good when usually that that would be like 25-30 dollars if not maybe like 36 or something like that around there that hats off to you again to big thumbs up in my opinion I loved it let me know if you guys have tried this company before let me know if you've tried the nine pound hammer strain before do you like nine pound hammer let me know in the comments section below on this video and I hope you guys have a great rest of your day I hope maybe you guys found this video somewhat informational maybe next time you're in your dispensary browsing and you guys see these on these shelves you're like hey I remember that one weird white guy who's like they're not bad you should try them come on I'm gonna get one do it alright I say do it [ __ ] it boss the wall I love you guys hope you guys have a great rest of

able to come up with so many crazy strain names well that shit's another level smokey right and then they're like oh what's this one let's call it anything gorilla glue right arctic monkeys [ __ ] what's the craziest name and strain that you've heard there's so many now i didn't want someone what's the one that's what's a cat piss oh that's a good one that's a pretty crazy one when i first heard that i'm like what the [ __ ] i've heard a crazy name um well the one that's really good is ball family farms i don't know if you tried the de la russo that's strange it's like inspired by karate kid it's ball family farms and they're that's their whole thing kind of thing and it's daniel larusso and did they come out with this with like the cobra kai [ __ ] yeah yeah that's why i like them because they have something to go with well i like yeah and they their fire is really good weed oh [ __ ] well i'm about to get [ __ ] kicked by larusso oh you literally will i'm not kidding that's why i haven't bought it since because the last time i smoked it i was put out i was out for the night oh that's a great one for insomnia for sure because right we smoke weed for more than just to get high yeah for sure relaxation sleep why do you smoke weed i like it that's a great answer no but there's so many reasons like you're saying but like but like especially at the end of the night that's why i like doing some edibles at night just do that or i've been doing a weed honey and tea lately like a wee tea do that with a sleep you know what with some sleepy time tea dude of wheat tea and i i forgot about it and so i didn't get to try it you know it went bad yeah but i was so excited to try it but you know why i didn't try because i was so high on edibles it was like a like a like a secret sesh kind of like a trap shop kind of sesh i've heard such good things about the secret session san diego yeah well that's something different but just i'm just saying a backyard yeah yeah yeah and there's just like trap stars you know but they had evil edibles and it was cool it's cool everybody was just vibing and [Music] you know at the even before all this it was like cannabis was illegal and people that come in they think that they just step in and like be culture vultures essentially and expect like with a bunch of money that they'll be able to make a brand and then they focus on just selling mids like who's gonna buy meds like well i was gonna ask are you insulting me with the type of quality of weed like i'm not gonna give you my money that's just how i feel no i feel it yeah but what what are you i just it just kind of blows my mind you know because in case when i was in kansas grow like in high school mids was a common thing thrown around like if i asked if people like oh is it mids or whatever it's like i'm just surprised out here even that people were just mids was just that around like right because you thought it it made sense that you would get me because i'm in the middle of it yeah yeah because i don't know but this is true buzz that mary jane now we ain't new to this for my stones and from my cannabis enthusiasts never heard a show as good as this number one is the best bringing in many special guests in the industry of cannabis business owners to growers even artists you know of so sit back and just roll up perfect show for my smokers [Music]", "KG6_m8eNIE4": "hey we're back Doctorow here the masked crows TV and got another update probably not the final one we're in about seven days of caution as you can see these leaves and them

nice big fat awesome butts with super dense and they're in their big soggy even the small ones that are down here below also very tense there actually we had the green crack plant in here a small one

Marijuana review for Florida patients you guys know if you haven't subscribed you gotta hit that button or I'm gonna keep saying it until you do it so leave me a thumbs up comment down below alright we're gonna roll up some rice flour I also like to say I did get some free crap little water bottle they was letting some people take out their t-shirts but I was chatting with the girl about the products and didn't pay attention and I got a crappy white t-shirt but I do a lot of paintings of Miss a little paint surface I like to try to wear white so it just says rise it doesn't say dispensary or anything like that on there that's the okay and we don't go anywhere without that how about some of their projects we might go into that later new patients and veterans get 25% off seniors get 15% off also their rhyme arise but I think it's like move moves the company altmed makes the medicine so I think this is rise and rhyme makes the medicine so got a lanyard I might use that for my Y okay definitely won't use it it's colorful there's some I heart Jane stickers that's a lot of the people are using this for their online ordering now some rhyme they feel collection did you guys rest all that cup anything oh and we did get a stopped at the hedge um I was trying to stop at every hedge shopping around town see if they have anything new they didn't so we got a cyclone wonder Barry Cohen figure we could put some of that PCK or something in there that we didn't like the taste of that well alright flour we know you want to see the flour all right let's take a close-up of it got some of it broken up this is the UH the White Queen I forget what you said it was it was a dream Queen and something else makes this it was pretty much balanced Hybrid come in 18.3% THC it's the popcorn ugh for $30 so this is the biggest one in there but it's not bad let me see if I can't get it too brighten it up a little bit yeah it won't focus on it well you gotta be a pain Jeff it was focused that was a nice little bud there why you gonna focus let me just put it back up here real quick see if we can get her to focus in on it yeah that's a little bitter well this just like the other ones a tight little butt I mean I said that's the biggest one but a lot of the other stuff around here's being kind of loose and you know these are real tight nugs and not a bad I will say one of the better trim jobs out there can see a little leaf look right there the darker stuff I pulled some out there was a little bit over here but for the most part it's nice manicured little nubs you know like that [Music] tight and my fingers are still sticky let me put this back over here sorry guys so I think it's gonna give duct tape a run first money as far as stickiness goes because my hands are still sticky on the lighter I did weigh amount all's I do have his dangly scales in a bag they both come up to right at 5 this one's just a little bit over 5 so I'm guessing they're about a half gram over because the bag should weigh a gram so let's roll this up and see what it tastes like again we're gonna take our paper crease it there a little bit scoop up the flour put it in there and this is it felt a little dry on the outside but once you start breaking it up it's real you know it sticks to your fingers so this one you want to be careful not roll it too tight because otherwise they probably won't burn with a crab list it right up does have an interesting smell to it so we're gonna see what she tastes like I don't know maybe a grassy diesel II smell to it yeah probably not the best tasted Oh a good thing we got some wraps maybe something like a gorilla glue not quite big bats had it out there this is uh thinking whatever it was the White Queen you been send it out there and try it let me know what you think it tastes like not quite a gorilla glue but kind of close to it I don't know how to explain it different not super terrible or not I'm not strawberry switchblade good either you know I mean but we'll see how well it medicates somebody said some about the color of the eyes just ashes gray so that makes the difference hmm yeah it tastes different that's not bad so what's everybody out there token on tonight hopefully everybody's token on something good and bad out there tried rise yet where they think of the products I know there vape carts was a little bit more expensive than everybody else's but you know it's like five dollars more is forty further disposables and their bells is like 35 for the 300 but if you compared to true leaves true leaves smaller when it's thirty four dollars for 250 milligrams so pretty extra five dollars you're getting extra fifty milligrams basically that's why some stuff truly it's not the best prices but we'll get into that later all right yeah we'll definitely say it's a different and interesting flavor on that one I want to say almost even a waxy taste to it but well different alright I'm in this one here so I can post the two videos I just shot I can finish token on this I'll leave a comment down below and how they effects was of it you know good bad okay basically I won't get into a bunch of details but because I don't like typing that much alright so guys if you haven't subscribed hit that button leave me a thumbs up in the corner you guys subscribe I'll quit saying it probably not using something to do and keep on talking guys until next video a little more weed porn for you here I said not bad looking there's a queue and like I did group them together there so those are the ones that haves a little a couple little leaves on but for the most part they're all you know just small popcorn hugs manicure pretty good so I given points for that this is our first batch of flour so maybe this stuff's supposed to taste like this you know they all taste different some of them I don't like I don't care for that Gorilla Glue that much or the Haze's or kim hound whatever that crap was alright guys keep on token I'll see you later on tonight", "995Al0bTjK4": "[Music] up youtube welcome back to the garden the day late in a dollar short it is monday morning and we're in here looking at sativa scream nice and frosty looking excellent i just kicked the light off to do the video real quick and then back here is the nine pound hammer um get a little bit of fade early um this is just me not feeding it every time just kind of trying to uh conserve my newts and figure out the strain but big old chunky nugs and i still thoroughly think the clawing that we see is um from it being way too close to the light at first so we'll see we'll see on the next go around if they uh act like that again and we'll run it under the other the 6 30 and uh and we'll see actually as a matter of fact i gotta turn the pot for today pluck a leaf i uh i do try and come in here and like do this i came through the other day and uh i got what i thought was most of it but i see i missed uh a couple that were all the way in the back but this is not bad this this is like interesting that this one is so much more green um pretty much being fed and and done the same way so i noted for next time to feed the nine pound a little heavier and this one pretty much i mean uh it's it's pretty on point it's nice and frosty i'm i'm really looking forward to that never had it so we'll set these down throw them away in a minute and then oh i can't see my screen oh and i can't brighten it up oh well it's okay so our dream on needs to be transplanted for sure um i decided i didn't decide i just i got super busy i picked up a second job um making some cash on the side so i haven't really had the time to go and like pick up my stuff and transplant i should be doing that today actually i'm gonna get paid this afternoon and uh hopefully if i remember i'll stop at the hydro store on my way home the two on the left are sativa scream and uh the one in the back right in front of us is the nine pound hammer um they're definitely ready to be cloned now so we're gonna take like five of each uh sativa scream and nine pound and uh get them going uh we're gonna kick this light back on now there we go yeah and uh we're gonna aim to do four in each four by four spot of sativa scream and nine pound hammer and that's gonna be the rotation that we aim to go on and i'm gonna devise something for a trellis net i'm probably just gonna take like some 2x4 or something similar and i don't know maybe even pvc i'm not sure yet and just make a double layer trellis for around the outside of this because uh you can see the nine pound leans a good bit it's getting pretty chunky and it's not even at 40 days so that makes me pretty happy just the fade you know i gave this plain water i think two days in a row the first like two weeks i would feed it once give it two days feed it once [Music] so that that's probably more of what we're seeing there and i'm still i'm only three-quarter strength feeding it this tells me i could definitely hit this full strength and it would be pretty happy uh this on the other hand is like perfect i mean we wanna in about another week we would wanna start to see uh some of this color maybe starting to come out of it but you can see a little bit up here if the light doesn't contrast it out the colors just fade just a little bit which it's all right i don't know i'm pretty happy with this run then we got dream on coming right behind it i'm really happy with this light so far it doesn't put out a whole lot of heat but for what i'm seeing on here even like as i'm rotating them you know the little little bud sites look pretty nice and that's smells delicious first off but that's even pretty chunky already so i i don't know i got some high hopes we're gonna stick with the led game and uh expand on that as we keep moving forward so that is just a super quick update i hope you guys enjoy your monday go smoke something awesome smash the subscribe button as of right now i

"welcome to another doctored green thumb strain review I am dr. greenthumb know it's been a while since we've done a strain review but the doctors been busy no I'm saying go in here go there but none of that really matters today we have what is known or what is called the Hammerhead og this hammerhead og is an indica its THC percentage is 24% so it should be pretty good its CBD is 1.1 percent people that have smoked it says it makes you sleepy gives you the munchies makes you confused yeah this is real life they sound like some [ __ ] cherry lightweights but you know nonetheless I'm gonna smoke it because I don't get none of that I'm immune to all those crazy little stereotypical stoner things that people talk about you know like confusion hunger and giggly and pression and [ __ ] like that the doctor doesn't get none of that man we've been smoking too long down here at the temple alright so um the Hammerhead og looked pretty good the Nugget you know was pretty tight it's very dense a lot of orange hairs if you will so we're just gonna light this [ __ ] up and the doctor will tell you what he thinks of it incidentally the funky field tip on this is not actually a funky field tip this is a dr. greenthumb tip by nish coming soon my good friend niche glass mm-hmm dr. green dumped tips but I gotta tell you this we put that [ __ ] phone on shut it up [ __ ] well I'm sorry to say that not even this cool ass tip could save the taste of this so-called to hammerhead weed this ain't even hammer and a tic-tac it's actually quite brutal I don't know why I'm still smoking it but I can't stop there must be a magnet on this foot by this [ __ ] niche tip right here because this is [ __ ] torture this is like listening to an hour of Shiki raucous battle raps and [ __ ] oh I'm sorry that was it for you but I got to give this this stuff a - two thumbs I mean at least it gets that because it still has me smoking it somehow even though it's not really up to up to the doctor standards you know if you could see through my glasses there'd probably be a tear coming through my eye like that Indian who [ __ ] it didn't like people you know littering everywhere man people who start pollution people can stop it it's [ __ ] weed is I mean it looked awesome man what what did you guys do the Hammerhead the [ __ ] out of here and go [ __ ] yourself [Music]", "NYZsGSgaabE": "hey guys it's Florida MJ 4:20 here and today I've got some shake from Liberty Health Sciences finally it got my hands on some it's super Silver Haze at thirteen point three to three percent THC and less than 0.1% CBD I think they really don't care about their CBD and the regular flower because they all say less than point one percent CBD no matter what you get usually see what we got alright looks like we got a full container of ground-up flour in here and the smell huh interesting it actually kind of smells a lot like the vanilla berry pie that I had from one plant which is surprising it's got a little bit of that gas eNOS in the background that you would expect from the super Silver Haze it smells pretty good it's a little bit different than I'm used to but that fruitiness is kind of interesting let's see how much we got I've been waiting on this stuff it's even cheaper than true weave we'll get into the prices and stuff in a minute but man oh man I'm happy that we finally have some more choices oh I should have used oh goodness I should have used Oh hey Katie Katie you back again 7.1 grams hope you can see it I gotta take care of my little baby key cap oh you're a sweet baby be right back I'm back and I must apologize for my detour there you know I'm no zoologist but I think it might have been a bad idea to give my kitty treats every time she jumped up here while I was doing a review because now she seems to want to jump up here every single time right at the beginning so hmm I guess I'll have to treat her up first I don't know anyway last out 7.1 grams and let's see what it looks like looks pretty good um I would say this is not quite as dank as the normal jars from truly I'm not gonna of drowned flour I'm not going to compare this to the that super jar I got with the Keef nugget in it you can check out last video to see that if you want to but yeah this is it looks decent there's a decent amount of leaf in here and a mixture of blood it looks like there are some stem pieces as you can see like the stem piece here a couple more stem pieces in there I would say this appears to be a little greener leafy er mix than what I got from true leave if I had to compare so let's take a close-up look and see if there's much tricone coverage to this stuff alright let's get a nice close-up look and you can see some trichomes on there definitely not as dense as the true leave ground flower that I've been getting and certainly not the mega super Keeffe nugget jar either you can see that this one I think has you know a bit more leaf to it perhaps less bud then the um true leaf mix and you can see that reflected in the THC content as well you know there's thirteen point two three percent THC and this whereas a lot of the tree leaves come in at least over 15% a lot of them 17 to 20 percent so it's a little bit less a little bit less dankness to this and I'd say this is definitely more of a you know more trim to it more more leaf enos some you know a nice amount of sugar leaves in it alright well since this is definitely definitely not as dank as the true leaf stuff I'm a-gettin I'm going to use my big old bag vape here today because we've got a nice decent sized bowl on it I'm you know pretty sure that toe to toe this isn't gonna compare with all that daintiness that I got in the last few orders from tree leaf so we'll just see how it is if I pack a nice big ol bowl of it and yes I have my vape bag no the vape doesn't go stale it's only like a few minutes for me to vape it mm-hmm everything's fine I'm sure you folks I coughed no matter what I get yeah I get a lot of comments that it must be the stay of 8 making me cough but honestly guys I thought a lot no matter what actually out of this thing right here which is straight out of the source all right so I'll get this thing inflating now these are cheaper than true leaf which I like these are twenty three dollars apiece which is pretty awesome and since today's flower Friday I got 10% off which brings him down to 20 dollars and 70 cents apiece so normally these are 1150 $11.50 per 1/8 or 23 per quarter 7 grams and on sale today I got them for 20 70 per quarter or 1035 and 8 so it's a pretty dang good deal ten dollars and thirty-five cents for an eight I mean obviously this is not quite as dank as if you get a big ol nice crystal e bud or if you happen into a Keefe jar but over there let me move this bag either way so you'll be able to seal this see this thing fill up right here eventually anyway they're lovely jars right here so overall I'd say it's a pretty good deal want to see how that potency is well let me tell you a little bit about the strain so this is super Silver Haze it's a sativa dominant hybrid and it's a cross between skunk number one and haze strains it was bred by greenhouse seeds and it actually won the cannabis cup the High Times Cannabis Cup three years in a row 1997 1998 and 1999 so it's a pretty classic strain you know well-loved strain I love it myself like I said this is a little bit different this honestly smells a lot like vanilla berry pie I got from one plant you know 10 dollars and 35 cents for an 8 you can't really complain too much now canyon I also got from Liberty Health I got some gelato and biodiesel oh my goodness that is some low THC holy cow ten point seven six percent THC what the heck is going on there boy I don't know hey what happened to my gold bag I thought was supposed to get that in a gold foil bag or something like that it looked all snazzy huh sometimes you get what you ordered sometimes you just don't there's some nice dense vapor coming up in this bag here a leash down there you guys every cheer stems seeds in here that's a good thing I have found a few seeds and true leaf ground flower but not very many that's a good dealio this bag is just about full got a little bit of a corner over here you shall Randall away look at that sucker right there it's too big for the camera boys too big for the camera boys and girls ladies and gentlemen catching kittens it's just too big all right let's start emptying this sucker I'm gonna have to move this out of the way so I don't spill it all over the place all right it's got like a really mild like gassy peppery kind of flavor to it it's pretty Pleasant it's not a very strong Clure all right so we train here [Music] so what is that three or four heads now smells pretty dang good in here besides just the weed cuz I've got a uh oh crap pork butt reheating in the oven not smoked yesterday oh man well I'm already feeling this really well which is very interesting because it's only thirteen percent chce I did pack a bigger a lot bigger bowl of that so there's that but I had the feeling I'll be pretty good after that one big bowl starting to get like you know sweaty in my face a little bit we man oh man it's doing the job that's my shoe I got a spicy on the back about throat there I don't know make it boys and girls camera here see me holding out like that it's because uh when you inhale it you want to hold that to keep it straight or else it'll get all crinkled up dang well I feel a bit harsher the vapor feels a bit harsher than the other strains up again for truly holy cow and you know I think um finishing the bag off real quick like I did really really kicked it in at the end so what we got super Silver Haze 13.3 2% Oh three to three percent total of 933 milligrams of THC boy um I give it a thumbs up this I'm gonna level with you here guys this is not on the same dankness level as true leave it's just not but you know I had that you know one half of that bowl there because you can do it again get another bag out of it and I'm feeling pretty dang good it's very effective I know that was a big bowl but like I said it's just not as try Co me not as dense with THC so all in all I'd say it's a really good deal ten dollars and thirty-five cents if you can hold out for that danker stuff from truly you might want to do that but you know it's just a crapshoot with any of these places having the ground flour and shake in so you kind of just have to go with whatever comes available I definitely recommend it though it's a really good deal so I mean think about it if we're at ten dollars and 35 cents now what's it gonna be in a year are we gonna be down to $5 and eight hey hey hey that sounds good to me folks it sounds really good alright thanks for watching guys I hope you have a good one I did take a moment to say something about what's going on all over the country right now and I think that we've come to a point where it's just become too much you know everyday black Americans have to deal with some really crazy [ __ ] all over our country and it's just too much there's a breaking point and so we've got to find a way as a society that we can treat our black Americans better that we can treat our fellow black American citizens like our fellow black American citizens and not like some second-class piece of crap and we have court rooms for a reason right we have court rooms for a reason we're supposed to be judged by a jury of our peers and not executed in the streets it's not supposed to be like that I just hope that out of all of this can come something better because the way that we're going is doomed we can't we just can't keep going that direction any longer and you can see it all over the news there's a local guy who had a campaign for a while and he still does I don't know if he still gets out because of the corona virus and he's the spread the love guy and that's what we need to do we need to spread the love because we just can't we can't handle the alternative we can't it'll break us you", "4YZDSazas4E": "so i ended up getting that pound in my closet

we came up with the idea very very early on like january 2nd 2016 we were still working for a vertically integrated cannabis company right near aspen colorado great experience gave us great insight into the industry and really what the cannabis market kind of demands uh and everything has come from there it was like it was one of my first very first trade shows i think when i walked over and saw you guys um it was a funny story we we bumped into you uh quite literally um saw your shirt and were like oh we know bobito we love that and we just started talking with you brett and i actually got invited brett's my business partner everybody in case uh nobody nobody knew that uh brettgelfan shout out to you buddy um brett and i actually went to that convention for free the cannabis company had purchased tickets for us and we had left before the show happened so we got to go on their dime and you know that's kind of when our world turned around and how did you how did you guys get into the space again um what was your background before pack case funny funny story uh i was working tech i was uh working for apple at the time i was an engineer um doing some annoying stuff on the phones with in between customers and engineering kind of realized that uh corporate life wasn't for me i needed a change and i was helping brett work on some website for some cannabis company uh two weeks later he said hey we need a director of marketing are you interested i jumped on the opportunities like all right we'll pack your stuff and get to colorado next month uh time to start so went out there a little bit of nepotism uh brett's uh brett's dad my dad and the guy that hired us have all been friends for 30 35 years i guess he wanted some smart cheap labor at the time and that's uh kind of how we got our invitation but a few months later unfortunately he got sick and it put brett and i in a position where we were running the show uh in our young 20s which is absurd to put 20 year olds in charge of a 15 million cannabis company but hey you know you got to do what you got to do in business it sure is yeah we have a similar story too um you know i want to hear it how did you get started please yeah no i was i was in tech as well like straight out of college um under the fluorescent lights in a cube sea of cubes and i was like oh yes i'm getting out of school i'm gonna you know work and sell stuff and pay off my loans and you know it's a big fortune 500 company and uh after about a year and a half you know i was going through started out as like uh you know basically a quote guy you know early on learning the sales process and then moved through quickly but i know i wanted to to sell and to really own accounts and quarterback stuff and i talked to my boss and he's like well that's probably eight to ten years away for you and so i'm like oh i can be patient but uh not that patient [Laughter] and uh yeah luckily family friends um one of my family friends lived down the street from my cousin again nepotism here lucky right place right time but um kate holstein who's in charge of our international business she's been uh she actually got me to sidetrack even more she got me my first job um working like as a banquet server at weddings and so i've just i've known her since i was a kid basically and she's like hey i worked this company boveda and um now we make these humidity control packs we're in the cannabis space we're in the tobacco market and we're in the music industry and i heard those three things i said cool i mean yeah i'm in so i interviewed with them long story short um you know as employee number 12 and i think we're over 65 now and that was just four and a half years ago so um really fun fun place to work similar stories here we're basically um very similar in what we do our products and our services are very complementary to the things we're trying to address here to the cannabis industry 100 peanut butter and jelly uh especially for for pre-rolls we make something that's uh great for protecting them and you guys make sure that they stay fresh and tasty for as long as absolutely possible longer than most thought would be possible exactly so anthony i mean we've been talking we've known each other for a long time but really i don't know the the story behind boveda how how did that come about what is it like tell everybody what bovita is yeah so um it's a really simple product and that's that's what uh that's what we like most about it but it's very effective and it works pretty well um it started 25 years ago a couple of guys in the tobacco business they were cigar smokers saw a problem with uh humidification one-way humidification for regulators for cigar humidors um they said there's got to be a better way to do this so they worked um with a couple of engineers from general mills here in minnesota on coming up with a product that's able to basically self-control it's not you you don't have to add anything to it um and it's a two-way controller so in a deficit environment it'll add humidity and then when there's not enough it'll or when there's too much it'll it'll absorb some too so it's it's really getting rid of those peaks and hills and valleys of humidity um and so that that technology started for the like i said for the the cigars and tobacco business and then over time and we i'm sure this has been talked about on many of our other podcasts but um you know we started seeing these tobacco stores uh selling a lot of products in northern california um to the traditional market and um there's like wow there's there's a demand for this on the cannabis space too and that was probably 10 12 years ago now um and so we came up with our our 62 formula and um you know from there the the technology has really stayed the same but we've been finding out more about how this technology can um you know not just protect weight and help you know manage the moisture content or water activity but to also preserve terpenes and trichome integrity so it's been fun to to watch how it's how it's grown and what we've learned um that's that's really fun there's a huge feast of thought culture here feast of learning love of learning um that's that's something that's at our very core um and we have a lab down in um the basement of our hq here where a lot of these tests are being ran we have a lot of partners um different labs across the states and even internationally that help run tests and it's it's really cool uh so yeah that's you know it's a bit of a ramble there but that's uh no it it it sounds super cool i mean we did we've we've been doing r d on our products for four years you know always trying to come up with new stuff but we just have to make a really interesting design and make sure it's structurally integral you guys you have to do some chemical engineering which i can only imagine just ups the level of difficulty by you know to the umpteenth degree so good for you guys it's great that you guys can do everything downstairs and run humidity tests and i know that's a great segue into what we'll we'll talk about next because you can't really run a humidity test without measuring what you're trying to contain the humidity within uh which kind of leads me on to what we do over a pack case and we make these really amazing joint cases this is one of our awesome hemp clients father obsidian but check this out we call this product a jpeg it's our flagship so you'll notice inside this is what's amazing to bovida and everyone who uses it there's a gasket seal that lines the actual case to hold five payrolls um so when you close it you can actually hear the click that's how you know it's sealed and then our favorite part not so boveda is central but we have a extra little place that you can store roaches so you can't finish a joint you don't want to stink up the rest of uh the fresh ones inside the pack that was a really cool idea um so as we were developing this the whole reason we put a gasket in there was to make sure that pre-rolls stayed fresh unfortunately in this industry the pre-roll has been an underutilized product skew for so long such an easy product to produce it's something that from a beginner to an intermediate to a super heady everyone loves smoking joints everyone loves smoking bloods and when we first got in the industry back in 2016 everyone was just taking trim that shitty extra leftover whatever stuffing in a pre-roll and saying okay good enough today now it's totally different story people use only flower premium everything sometimes they're even caviar which means that they may have a core with some hash or are wrapped with some keef and some extra little bits on the outside and can exceed retail values of over 50 bucks in fact last time i was in vegas at the show we went to a dispensary planet 13 and they were selling a can of cigar for a thousand dollars uh so the pre-roll game has totally evolved now think about this anthony what would what would you do if you went out you bought a blood that was a thousand dollars and it was dry i would immediately want to return it right and can you probably not probably not so products like that have to be in something that's airtight and gasket sealed and if you're doing it the right way you have a bill vita pack in there as well yeah no doubt um you you brought up some really interesting stuff cody um do you mind expanding a little bit on how you've seen um you know we're we're more on the you know we certainly work with a lot of companies that manufacture pre-rolls um but also you know people that are just packaging grams or eighths or quarters or ounces or pounds um but it seems you know i mean you guys have a focus on pre-rolls do you want to elaborate on how that's changed throughout like the last four or five years um you know going into this more premium stuff versus just the consumable hey you know the dispensary is running a deal and you get a free pre-roll and it's kind of just like everyone expects oh it's it's probably gonna be dry it's probably not gonna taste very good but i mean how is it where is it changed and where is it changing where is it going yeah absolutely like i had said before when we first got into it no one really cared they just took a pre-roll they were sometimes even making them in the dispensary with leftover whatever after bagging out you know an eighth for a customer there's maybe another gram or two in the jar so the manager said screw it let's grind it up throw it in some pre-rolls and now we can sell it today the pre-roll is a main sku in the industry i think it accounts for maybe 10 15 20 somewhere in there depending on the month of total cannabis sales in the entire country so clearly they're here to stay and it's a product that people love so very quickly back in 2016 and 17 when we were starting pack case we realized that the pre-roll was super underutilized it wasn't really given the appreciation that it should have i mean it's a top level sku it's a real money maker and it doesn't take a lot of money to actually start producing them so we created our product because there wasn't any premium offerings like i said everyone was just throwing [ __ ] in a tube and or a bag and that was it there really wasn't like a uh a big demand for people asking for quality pre-rolls and we didn't understand that because as pre-roll enthusiasts someone who we smoke joints all the time especially when we went skiing or out for hikes or whatever joints are the way to go um no one really had anything that was nice or worth talking about bringing home so instead we just buy flour and roll our own but it left a huge amount of market opportunity for all these cannabis companies who weren't doing something to make a premium sku that addresses a huge market need so there was an incredible amount of demand and no supply whatsoever and that's where pac case came in to fill the gap and give opportunities to companies like this to be able to sell a premium pre-roll so was pac case kind of born on the mountain per se it's funny uh we quickly came up with the idea late at night uh the second night that brett and i had ever met um just because we were talking about going skiing and taking joints before we ever had a prototype uh i had actually uh three or four joints like in my chest pocket um took a little kicker while i was skiing and totally yard sale ate [ __ ] skis went flying worst part though uh i was kind of hurt and the joints were all broken so not only was i like in pain i couldn't smoke so it was it was rough so brett and i very quickly jumped on finding someone to help us out with the design and we quite literally used our prototype our very first one which i have right here super basic shitty design but uh this i used for an entire winter to hold pre-rolls and make sure that they wouldn't break so connor was uh was born out of uh two things a we needed a person we had a personal need we needed to be able to carry joints on the mountain or going for hikes or wherever uh and at the same time we knew that the cannabis market needed it too so it was a little bit of a selfish uh build it was kind of doing it for us and then realized there was a business behind it too that's that's exactly it though i mean that's how great products and ideas are born what's what's uh what's a problem i'm facing in my world today like some broken pre-rolls and then you know there's gonna be thousands of other people that have the same problem so cool stuff i've always loved your guys products um and you guys um you have your your five pack obviously what's what's more of your consumer facing um your duo right do you have you don't have a single though because who's gonna smoke a single joint i mean you're always gonna have one for a buddy so you would think that we uh we do have a we may or may not i cannot confirm or deny that we have a single in the works um but it won't be ready for a while if in fact we're working on something uh really though like one is never enough right like two is always better than one three is better than two and [ __ ] if you can have five will have five um so it's it's what's most amazing and what i find most interesting about our product and why it it works so well on both sides of the aisle um it's a packaging product it was always developed to be a packaging product and whole allow cannabis companies to sell pre-rolls but over the course of a year or two as we were our social media was growing and people were starting to find out about what we were doing people started asking for these just like hey i don't live in a cannabis state how do i get one um so we put them up on amazon and let it ride and uh two years later we've sold you know more than 50 000 units and are absolutely crushing a thousand reviews which blows my mind and we have over four and a half stars which on a product intended for packaging that gets sold as an accessory yeah blows my mind every time 100 and um one thing that i've always loved about your guys product is that um you know you can you can customize it um you know the the business can go put their branding on it and customize it however they want um that's a huge thing especially up in canada and some other markets that um you know they can't necessarily advertise or brand do you have any experience there um helping companies really market their brand with your guys packaging technology i'm glad that you asked that anthony pack case technically is a packaging company right that's the product that we sell but really when you get down to things we consider ourselves a marketing company we give our clients an ability to brand and promote products in ways that they wouldn't be able to before our packaging may be slightly more expensive than everyone else on the market but that's obviously because it's a premium feel what other packaging can go out and say hey i sell for 20 on amazon but instead you can come to my dispensary take five of my best highest quality joints with delicious flour have my brand on it and then now go and walk around with it so we give these companies not just an opportunity to create beautiful packaging that's going to create an amazing customer experience but we also allow their customers to then become a walking advertisement for their company think about it you buy a jpack from somebody that means you have five joints so you take one joint out to smoke with a friend well you're obviously gonna close the pack put it back in your pocket again you still have four left so you're gonna hold on to the packaging for a long time which means anytime you smoke with somebody and you take that out your brand as a company gets exposed to their friend who's now likely to become a customer their self themselves yeah well and let's let's back up to a second so let's talk about um the premium aspect so and what that value can can mean not only to a business but to the consumer so your guys you go i mean let's and we can even back up to that leap down study that we helped you guys do so that by let's explain this to the the people so yeah boba can take uh packaging and put it into a um a dry chamber put above the pack in there and then we can basically estimate the shelf life or stability how long the boba packs can last how long the product is going to stay fresh um versus no active humidity control versus having a boat pack in there and then we can compare that um against the control and give you hey this is going gonna you know add an extra week two weeks a month some cases um let's should we chat about uh how that went and what that kind of means for brands and consumers as far as you know brands are gonna be able to go into more inventory and that's something that we've seen on on the boveda side is um you know a big concern or a big problem facing a lot of these operators was hey we're just trying to get product on the shelf because the supply and demand chart is totally kitty wampus and you know we've had cultivators operators say we're we're trying to like they're torn especially these commercial ones because they want to have a longer cure on their their flower and they wanna couldn't really control that quality um but then they have um people in the supply chain saying hey this dispensary's been out of said strain this amount of flour for x amount of days and like we just we need to get on the shelf it's just flying off the shelf that we have seen as i have seen personally that's kind of slowing down and people are able to go into more inventory and carry more um but our products together can help assure that that shelf life is there and so product isn't sitting for two three months and then it's sold dry that's one of the benefits of being able to use pack case and boveda together um these operators who you know think about it if you have a production team of 10 well you don't necessarily want to have two people doing pre-rolls and two people doing edibles and spread out your labor force a lot of the times it's more efficient and our clients have told us this that you know i want to put my entire production team have them do an entire run start to finish bang it out and then move on to the next project now when you do that with flour with pre-roll with something that's not necessarily super shelf stable like a concentrate or an edible you have to have velocity so not only do you have to package it up quickly you have to get it out the door you have to get it to the dispensary they have to shelve it and then they have to get it out to the consumer now that process can take a lot longer than it would take a cannabis to dehumidify and then dry out lose terpenes lose flavor lose potency and mess with um with effects right like if uh some thc converts into cbd that flower that you smoke once it's converted is gonna make you feel totally different than if it didn't exactly so with boveda and pack case because they're such a tremendous seal these producers have the ability to make an entire run of pre-rolls leave them in their factory if they have to and as long as it's properly sealed and the boveda pack is fresh these pre-rolls are going to last a lot longer which means that their production problems that come along with having to do massive runs and then making it like sit on it as opposed to doing smaller runs and moving them quicker and making a regular process makes life a lot easier for them they can sit down bang out all of their pre-rolls that they need for a month and two days and then not have to worry about the quality at all because of the protection that pacquiao boveda provides yeah and a term that comes to mind that i hear a lot is consistency um and that's that's what a lot these brands want to deliver because they know in a lot of these markets especially on the east coast where i've been working predominantly it's medicine so uh you know it's if you can the cannabis plant in the flower is not a it's not a pill and it's very volatile and so like you said um you start getting that trichome degradation and you're gonna lose medicinal benefits um and it's like you know going to get your prescription and your short your short two pills and there's an extra one magical pill tossed in there you know it's like you you want to make sure that the product is consistent and delivered same same smell same taste same flavor same effect every time and uh yeah i think i think our our two products definitely can help um in that in that regard absolutely cannabis obviously is a product that affects headspace and if you find something that works for you and you find something that you like you want to make sure that if you buy it again it's going to have the same exact effect uh there's only one way to do that in terms of flour and pre-rolls and that's control the humidity making sure that the product stays the same on day one as it is on day 30 and potentially even out to day 60s so it's important i know that a lot of people that consume cannabis for medical reasons um which there are many that's how this whole industry really started right um they need that they need consistency of dose they need consistency of effect and you can only do that by controlling terpene and humidity content right yup yup there's no doubt about that and then um you know let's another thing that i've been seeing um and sorry this is so salesy just because that's the world that i live in every day is just sales but um you know competition between brands um i i like to think of the cannabis industry as a more friendly um competition uh than any than any other industry that i've been in or or seen where it's you know really we're we're all in this together with one common goal and that's to bring uh relief to a lot of people and liberty to a lot of people um to do what they want with their lives consume what they want and um just not step on anyone else's toes but competition on shelf space um is the pack case boveda combo is that something that people can use to set their their brands apart from others is that can you take these these two common value adds and educate the consumer to say hey i'm gonna my pre-rolls are gonna probably be better in here by the time i get them depending on when they were packaged and you know i'm gonna have an extra two three weeks to go through these um with the boveda pack and then you know i have the pack case forever um these are these are things that consumers care about and are gonna want is that messaging from the consumer is that getting driven to these brands that are making these decisions on packaging yet it's a good question some of the brands who really have a premium focus and a premium attention absolutely they understand that their customers keep coming back to them because their products are so good some of the there's a lot of a lot unfortunate but there's a lot of cannabis companies out there that really don't cater to a premium market um and don't really care about the quality of their products um you know like i said a lot of them are still back in the model of 2016. let's take any leftover [ __ ] that we have let's toss it in a pre-roll put it in the doob tube and just send it whatever happens happens i don't know about you but whenever i consume something that affects headspace uh alcohol cannabis whatever else it may be i always want to make sure that i'm getting something that's quality and consistent um price isn't so much uh a concern of mine right i would much rather pay an extra 20 or 30 bucks to know that uh the quality that i'm getting is there versus having to deal with some [ __ ] for a much cheaper cost i believe that if you're gonna intake something it should only be the the best quality you know it's affecting you like you as yourself not a car not a house you and your health so for me as a consumer i always want to make sure i'm getting high quality and i think that there's a lot of companies that value my sentiment and cater towards a client like me when you have a customer that doesn't you end up with shitty product and that creates a negative loop sure you're going to get the sale once or twice because it's a cheap product but i doubt that person's coming back to you there's no consistency there's no flavor it's all dry harsh smoke it's no good no one likes that yeah and that's i think that's changing too i think as more people get introduced to cannabis i mean we talk about all these people taking baby steps i mean i was down in in florida i had a dispensary doing a visit and i i witnessed what i always knew was going on down there but never had witness for myself which was a woman that looked just like my grandma going into a dispensary for the first time and she has all of her paperwork and she looks at the the person at the front desk and she's kind of you know pretty coy and her her husband's behind her um you know they're just kind of looking around and she goes i'm here to um purchase some marijuana it's so cool to see that but there's so many people that need to be become educated on you know multiple different aspects of cannabis um but it's there's so many new people coming into it and uh that's that's a that's a big piece of the education piece and you know knowing what you're consuming how it's gonna make you feel um you know what you like essentially there are a lot of people figuring out what they like and um you know here in minnesota it's tough for me uh because we don't have um you know like we don't have adult use here so i can't just go in and say hey you know i'm wanting this today and that's uh that's something that a lot of new states are having which is is great um and uh sorry i kind of lost my train of thought here it's all good those are those were always my fate when when i was back at the cannabis company those are always my favorite people you know there were times and days where you know as just a higher level employee at the company uh the dispensary was short-handed so i'd have to go in there and maybe put a quick shift in and just talk to cool people about wheat all day it was honestly not a bad way to uh spend a couple hours outside of my normal role my favorite customers were always the older folks who really had never id any idea they'd walk in they'd always be like hey can i like can i buy some weed yeah and it's like you don't have to whisper it's legal welcome to the cannabis store let me show you what what are you what are you interested in what would you like to try are you interested in smoking something would you like to vape something would you like to try an edible it's always great introducing those people to the entire world something that as an enthusiast we've been living for decades right but i don't want to date myself but [ __ ] it's been a long time um yeah it's it's it's remarkable the clearly the direction of the country the world is totally changing our neighbors up to the north were a lot smarter than we were legalized a lot quicker and look what happened now they have five or six companies in cannabis worth over a billion dollars you ever think that there'd be a unicorn in cannabis now there's five it's insane yep ellen what do you think is i mean comparing the canada to the u.s right now um especially these last couple weeks um just these these larger operators and what what is that what does this mean for cannabis in 2021 um as far as these these bigger companies you know that and you know four or five years ago in the grassroots cannabis movement semi grassroots cannabis movement um you know a lot of it was the the buzz around trade shows in the industry was all these you know these big companies are gonna come in and they're gonna start getting swooped up and the commercialization does cannabis in your opinion cody does it kind of model what happened uh recently this last decade with beer craft beer and you know your big domestic beer is there gonna be a commercial side of cannabis and then also room for the craft cultivator um that's really focused on small quality good stuff um that's gonna be competing against you know price and volume from some of these giants that's a great question the beer model is one that is perfect to use as an analogy um i think myself a lot of these major cannabis companies are swooping up a lot of the smaller ones there's a lot of conglomeration that's going on in the industry obviously when you kind of grow as a company or you want to expand you either need additional growth space which requires additional licensing so a lot of the small guys or the guys that were in quickly did some decent growing started as a startup and made it to mid-sized company those are ideal acquisition targets for the big boys so i think what's going to happen at least the next three four years is that all the big boys are going to start to swoop up a lot of the smaller guys that's where you emerge the budweiser the coors light all the the general high volume lower quality lower price type products from that will come the grassroots movement again so i think everything is going to kind of go underground for a little while and all these craft companies in maybe three four years will start to emerge when people really care about quality and it's not so much about bottom dollar anymore yeah we have a huge canadian client that we love working with when we first started with them they had a huge huge initiative and focus on innovation it was 2018 they had an opportunity to really try and control the market with an innovative awesome product uh cost was no object they said [ __ ] it we want the coolest best highest quality product that we can provide and it worked out great for them they quickly jumped into one of the leaders positions in the industry in canada and everything was was great it towards the end of 2019 and then with uh early covid uh early 2020 uh their share price fell dramatically they were you know their balance sheets showed that they were just outlaying cash left and right for the innovation without necessarily realizing that when you spend so much on innovation it takes a long time for it to come back right roi on innovation is a year year and a half process minimum for us for example you know we started designing jpeg trio in 2018 it didn't get launched until you know mid 2019 it took 12 16 months 18 months to get the product out there so with this cannabis company even though they were so amazingly focused on innovation for the first part once legalization happened now they realize that it's all about bottom dollar and how do we reduce cost of goods so now instead of trying to produce flowers that may be tastier but take an extra two weeks now they're producing lower quality genetics that harvest faster that they can just turn around and sell and cheaper packaging and i think that's now the start of where you see the the budweiser and the the coors lights versus like uh you know a small batch brewing company really focused on delivering a delicious tasty product i mean one has consistency one has flavor yup but you know which would you prefer to drink budweiser or the the local craft beer pretty easy decision in my opinion yeah well for me too it's a time and place thing sometimes uh you know being from minnesota and uh going up to the cabin a busch light just kind of brings you back you know i love those you mean can't hate on that i'm a big coors guy i went to school in colorado spent a few years in co i love course especially like any tailgate absolutely but then you know you're trying to drink 16 18 beers potentially and really have yourself an afternoon that's not so much the case when you're drinking something that's a little bit tastier and perhaps next to a steak and maybe you're gonna have one or two very different days though the pairing is everything bingo and the season two i'm a big seasoned guy when it comes to those things absolutely you brought up uh i don't know how much time we have here ramsay um but you brought up uh kovid um how do you think that's been um impacting i guess pros and cons um your guys customers people you've been working with um you know if i can touch briefly i can just say what i've noticed is um i think a lot of these quality things sops standard practices best practices a lot of these procedural things are starting to really get drilled into um on paper and people are starting to like really figure their their [ __ ] out um and that's i think making a little bit extra room for products and services that focus on true value-add and um you know roi that you know we can bovada specifically too can can really tell you hey your flower your inventory your entire inventory weighs this today um and here's the percent moisture content um if you added two percent moisture content to that entire inventory here's the literal change in fair market value of your inventory i think those things now it's not it's not everything's not moving so fast where it's hey package it get it you know it doesn't matter if it cures on the shelf whatever we just we got to get it in stores because we don't have any and people are buying it anyway um i think covid kind of or the lockdown specifically um kind of help people really look at their what they're doing their day-to-day operations and where they can make changes have you guys noticed that too absolutely it gave you know business operators a chance to sit back and not be surrounded by the buzz of a hopping office and they actually had a few moments to think about like hey what can we do better what can we do to improve like our everything our process is top to bottom from growing the production of packaging to sales yeah um what's interesting is that you know this is what makes me happy is that a lot of the country deemed cannabis in a central industry um okay would you ever have been able to imagine that 10 years ago probably not i mean even back in 2014 but government said hey people need cannabis especially in california and all the cannabis companies stayed open so i think having those cannabis restrictions that got imposed on everybody required all these business operators to really sit back and understand how can we do things more efficiently because [ __ ] i used to run my growing operation with 40 people well now i can only have 15 in the building so how are we still going to manage the same output but with less than half of the labor staff forces you to sit back and really think about what you're doing and if you guys are cutting short you know corners trying to take a shortcut when that's not necessarily the best thing to do or neces or even necessary you know small little changes in process like adding a movita pack into your curing box can potentially generate an extra 300 000 a year for a mid-sized cannabis company it's substantial and that tiny little you know how much could that really end up costing you a couple thousand dollars over the course of a year when you can end up you know that can let you back a couple hundred thousand so a lot of these guys with cannabis you just you've been running and like you you ever try and get on a treadmill when it's set at 10 you there's no warm-up time you just have to get down and start sprinting yeah college a couple times yeah i'm not sure if those ended well but that's that's what working in a cannabis company is like the moment that your product goes out the door for the first time it's off to the races you have now an endless uh endless demand for your product and you have to continuously handle that that with good supply um and they don't haven't had a lot of time to think about it as soon as they got on that treadmill it's just off to the races full sprint covent gave them a chance to sit back take a second step off the treadmill and try and figure out what they should actually be doing yeah i completely agree um definitely notice that as well on our end um all right cody uh what's next for paccase great question we have a couple cool new packaging products coming out but that's not really what what tickles me i get very excited about the consumer market i love bringing products to people that will actually use it so we have a really awesome new case

change that [Music] you", "Hkz0AQzsU2A": "[Music] hey everybody how's it going today this is the second video pressing video i promised this one involves cresco lime sorbet ringing in at 31 i'll give you a nice close-up of that look at that again super crystally let's see what we got here we got a quarter of this same deal as the last time 180 degrees fahrenheit nug smasher 120 micron branded bag and a whole lot of crystally delicious looking flower from fresco i don't press a lot of cresco flower but this stuff the price is right it was on sale at raw or not it rise over it um the healing center in monroeville i was the second stop i made that day um they have this in stock a lot of people like cresco flour uh normally i find a little out of my price range for for the performance it gives but this time everything just worked out got it on sale and now we're going to press it so just get this all kind of prepped up here get all those voids out of the way there and we got our paper ready to go a little pre-tension on those plates there all right and just like with the last video it's going to get to be a point where you're not really going to see anything going on because the plates are very deep and very close together so i'm going to move this into place here so that you get a good view all right so there it is 7 grams 180 degrees and we're going to take it a little slower than we did the other one had a major major blowout on the last press and even though i lost a bunch to the cleanup process of decontaminating the rosin from the plant material i still managed to get 34 over 34 return on the uh banana cream from gti so hoping this one will produce close to the same amount just without the blowout i had last time and loss of yield um but 34 even after a cleanup is pretty damn amazing for that flower so you want to get some squishable gushy absolute beautiful rosin making flower get yourself some banana cream from gti uh i get it at rise in monroeville but you can find it at other dispensaries i highly recommend you do um it is good stuff i'm gonna put the focus of the camera right there [Music] now you're gonna lose the picture i'm going to try to get this right up to where i need to be slow enough that i don't have a major blow up i just did before hope everybody is staying safe staying medicaid and being good to each other out there if you're in the pittsburgh area you're medical patient you watch green turned into gold i'm in penn hills i'm always available to press for patients just get a hold of me not hard to find and i will definitely help you make some better medicine having a good day today just making some of my own um had a good weekend hope you guys did too hope the rest of your week goes well hope you get some really good meds [Music] now the finesse starts now i know you're not seeing anything really but now it's where you really have to kind of figure out where your limit is on your pressure okay i went entirely too fast following somebody else's advice another rosin presser that suggested i'm doing it too slowly well when i go too fast i have major blowouts so going back to doing it the way i've always done it because guess what that works for me my way isn't necessarily the best it isn't necessarily uh everybody else's way of doing it but the results i get to speak for themselves most of the time blowouts not withstanding um i make really good rosin from fire and i'm going to continue to do that doing it the way i do it regardless of what other people feel about my process and how i do things um there's plenty of other people out there pressing rosin and they all have their own techniques their own way of doing things this is just mine so i don't i don't put anybody else down for what they do and i don't expect it either all right so we are creeping up nice and slowly on the pressure i want to be at i'm just going to let that heat do its thing in concert with the pressure hopefully we won't have a blowout this time really be nice to just pull this apart about another 60 seconds and see some really amazing rosin with no glove so that's what i'm shooting for and uh hopefully we'll get there hope you guys say put the comments what you guys are uh leaping on or dabbing on and uh please don't forget to like subscribe to my videos my channel uh that way you'll always know when i'm putting out new new uh videos and content i was just on a really cool podcast today on linkedin believe it or not that was kind of cool it's also been posted to uh youtube as well so we are right in the middle of this getting towards the end now i still want to give it about another 30 seconds at this pressure and hope that i didn't do what i did in just a moment ago with that banana cream very disappointing to get that blow out but 34 after post blowout cleanup yeah that's that's good flour no matter how you slice it and definitely should get some let's see what this cresco has to say for itself here you guys ready to see it good lion here we go [Music] all right well let's take it down take a look just get this kind of out of the way here all right did we have a major blowout this time well we had a blowout not bad like last time but look at that rosin oh my god yep still blowout still dialing in that [Music] that pressure but this bigger press still a learning curve for me it's all right though making mistakes is how you continue to improve make a mistake you don't make the same one again i reduced the pressure from the last press still had a blowout not nearly as severe i'm not gonna lose a whole bunch of yield off of this i'm just going to clean this up real quick you can see what happens when you have a little blowout it's never the end of the world it's just annoying i'm always more conservative when i'm present for other patients because i really don't want to have them lose yield to something as a bummer is getting a blow out like this but you know what it happens and you just clean it up best you can again luckily this happened under my watch with my meds for me and this isn't going to affect another patient uh with a bad deal so it is what it is let's gather it up and see what we got wow stuff shattered up a little bit a little bit and that's a 180. i oh wow if i had pressed this at 200 degrees it would have been done it would have been just almost impossible to recover it intact because of the shattering effect of it so this is going to be another one of those i'm going to have to take some time to clean this up i'll do a follow-up video on this with a yield thanks for joining me stay safe stay medicated and be good to each other having a good day today take care", "Loa7ttdktmQ": "[Music] what's up mortals it's your favorite florist coming through with another review for you today we're talking about galactic gas by alien labs not only that i want to do things a little bit differently and start things off with an interview in fact the first interview on the show i'm very excited to have such a big name in the youtube universe as my first interview today i brought on an alien specialist for my alien labs review street fighter patriot scott mckay mr scott mckay how are you doing today i'm doing fantastic zero good to finally get a chance to meet you great to meet you also so we brought you in as an alien labs expert please give us a little background regarding your expertise there are influences on this planet that are not of this planet you know when you go down the secret space program rabbit holes and i actually did get some information from this group that showed me proof of what i'm referring to you know the off-planet influence that's happened to mankind since for a very very long time that that that that so when you start to learn these realities and you learn in these programs there is an off planet human sex trafficking operation off planet human slave trade operation that are outside the races of just human beings how could people possibly come to grips with this scott what the f are you talking about because look the simple fact is the way the world works and the way the minds of people are programmed everything is a sound stage literally everything that everybody has ever learned about the world comes from a sound stage what does that even mean that's what this do they program us computer program tv program program program program program program so that's how the whole thing works i was happy that i wasn't them i was happy that i had the capabilities to think farther at a higher level than even they do and my thinking wasn't driven by an intelligence or an academic from an academic perspective yeah that's pretty obvious it was from an awareness perspective but i wanted that awareness i chose that awareness i wanted to know the greater depths of all of creation and god's creation and the question of why am i here scott i can answer why you were here at least on this show it was to talk about alien labs thanks for joining us moving on let's start the intro [Music] much what's up world hope you're doing well today like i said we're getting into galactic gas by alien labs alien labs was started in 2014 in northern california with the intent to create a lifestyle brand focused on quality i reviewed them a few times in the past but it was long before i figured out how to use a camera so i'm really happy to revisit them now when we start talking about the genetics of galactic gas it's going to be a cross of gelato 45 and gelato 41. um you know when we start talking about the appearance to be frank i was a little disappointed um i got a lot of tiny buds there was a lot of stems it kind of felt like i bought a little eighth you know and not only that it felt half smoked where um you know a lot of budges had stems that were just sticking out it's just you know what i'm gonna have you take a look let's roll the tape let's go 36 holes leave you bleeding words and i'm 36 0's in a kilogram blunt tip orange like caviar now fish tail and subaru rally card [Music] and did i mention guns from red dead redemption 9 mills 50 clip extensions coke is like the mattress in the hood i'm flipping on it and the money's like a chair i'm sitting on it i think i'm big meech larry hoover [Music] regretfully though i found the aroma incredibly subdued when digging in deep you could discover a fantastic italian ice-like nose but i wanted it at least 10 times stronger also noticeably absent were any and all gas notes i would describe this nose as a faint tropical citrus complemented by some delicate sweetened berry notes [Music] you know what let me uh get my heat wand ready here and we'll get into the inhale and exhale cheers [Music] went in a little too hot with that one there wow thankfully the inhale had a little more representation than the aroma but was still slightly muted relative to where i would like to see it i found the inhale to be a mix of sweet gassy tropical citrus notes that evolve into some creamy earthiness flavor during that exhale man through that smoking experience though you can see these are quality flowers grown the right way they burn very clean with a very clean high i just need that aroma to be much more forward and the flavor profile too i would have liked that flavor profile to be just a little bit stronger you know i'm going to roll a joint and tell you how that translates in the meantime once you take a look at some of my more recent crypto work [Music] so all that crypto art is available on wearable as well as open seas let's get down with this joint cheers again using a plasma lighter i've broken free of my butane chains thanks to the fire scale [Music] [Music] ever since i switched to a plasma lighter i'm getting such a better flavor profile on every join i smoke even all the way up into the end of the joint i'm finding it's tasting so much better i recommend plasmaliners for all your joints and bloods [Music] so i am continuing to see that sweet gassy tropical citrus notes and that inhale as well as those sweet creamy berry notes on the exhale delicious and like i was saying this is a very clean burning eye it almost reminds me of a dab that's so clean really an indicator of quality flowers i just wish the flavor profile came through a little bit stronger [Music] so what's the verdict am i a fan would i buy them again if they had a stronger flavor profile and i didn't get so many small buds and stems i would definitely consider it but based on my experience right now probably not so where can you buy well alien labs is found all over both northern california and southern california these days a bunch of high-end dispensaries you are going to pay a pretty penny for it it's probably going to be anywhere from 65 to 85 [Music] and that's before tax so um ask the budget you know check the date make sure it's fresh buds i'll make sure it's a good batch and hopefully you can have a better experience than me either way thanks for joining me today stay stoned [Music] you", "9at3Iiw5VPs": "[Music] hello and welcome to the north coast journal preview where we take a look at the stories being followed in the upcoming edition of the north coast journal i'm your host dave frank and i'm joined by north coast journal's news editor thad greenson and arts and features editor jennifer from mikko cahill welcome guys david how are you doing right on doing well a little sunshine out there today and got some good news friends family news about more vaccines in the pipeline so i think people are starting to look towards that fourth of july weekend as a potentially uh you know fulfilling and rewarding date on the calendar where we might actually have some degree of normalcy so hopefully that's permeating your guys lives as well fingers crossed yeah stay optimistic right as best we can do um so that let's dive right in what's going on on the cover this week of the north coast journal well this week is our annual cannabis issue so um it is about all things uh all all things cannabis news um recently um but occupying the actual cover space of the paper is a story um following up on some reporting we did a couple years ago about the roanoke park public safety department to the police department at roener park and um some cannabis interdiction activities they'd been doing that became raised a lot of questions from the article it looks like there's been a federal indictment handed down on one of the local police departments in the 101 corridor can you tell us a little bit about the background on that and kind of what brought us to this point yeah so two two officers have been indicted in the case so far um and their indictments were unsealed friday um and so that's a lot of the documentation was was the actual charging document that we built the story on but the story takes root back in um in december of 2017 when a man by the name of zeke flatton actually a movie producer was looking to dabble in the cannabis industry visited humboldt county bought three pounds of cannabis and was transporting it south to a lab in the bay area for testing when he claimed that he was pulled over by an unmarked suv and by two officers who were wearing kind of tactical gear but no badges no name no name tags no patches kind of affiliating them with a specific agency they identified themselves as being with the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms and um asked if he was carrying cannabis he said he was asked to search the vehicle found the three pounds and basically said we're taking these you can expect to receive a letter from washington dc and we're going to go now um and zeke flatten is is a former cop himself um and um and a really sharp guy i mean just from interviewing him he's one of these people who has a pretty meticulous memory and an eye for detail and he said that it just didn't feel right um something felt really off about the stop he noticed that the officers never ran he gave them his license but they never ran his name um back to dispatch to see if you know there was any warrants or anything out for him didn't seem to run the license plate of his car um and didn't give him a receipt for the seizure of his cannabis um and so he said pretty quickly he came to feel that he was robbed he also noticed that while they said they were from a federal federal agency the car that they were driving had california exempt license plates which didn't line up again he's a pretty sharp guy who picks up on these details and so um he pretty quickly came to feel that he'd been robbed by what he figured were actual law enforcement officers but out acting outside the scope of their duties so he made a complaint to the fbi um and to the mendocino county sheriff's office because the traffic stop happened in mendocino um and that's kind of what got this ball rolling that now um you know two pl two and almost two and a half years later has resulted in these indictments almost three and a half years later so one of the things that he said was that um it wasn't the actual loss of value um that really triggered this it was his thoughts about something bigger must have been going on if this is how he was getting treated that maybe other people were getting treated the same way so you said he reached out to federal um law enforcement but there were he also reached out to local media is that right and kind of what element did local media play in bringing the story you know the momentum that built around this original complaint yeah it played a huge role and certainly zeke zeke flattened feels like it was it was crucial that it was really the tipping point um but i guess to your first point yeah he said that he really felt like um it wasn't the loss of three thousand dollars worth of weed it was the the violation and as somebody who'd been a police officer previously i mean he kind of understood that oath of office and he also just started wondering like if these guys are so brazen that they are going to impersonate federal officers outside of their jurisdiction and stop me in broad daylight and steal my weed like what else are they doing and who else are they doing this type of thing too um so worry you know he said that he made the complaint to the fbi and felt like it was initially kind of taken seriously or whatever but he was worried that it would just kind of die quietly that it would make it from kind of the the the main fbi office to the field office and then just kind of be quietly go away and so he decided um i think about a month after making the complaint to contact kim kemp a reporter based in southern humboldt and um to her credit she she took it very seriously um and um and started you know vetting his story and making calls and one of the last calls that she made before kind of going public with his allegations um was a call to the to atf just saying hey did you have officers in the field this day in this area and were you involved in this traffic stop and um while some of the other agencies had kind of been um i'd say a little bit evasive or a little bit squirrely or not really you know didn't seem terribly interested in her inquiries um atf did and atf i think seems like really kind of its ears perked up but the the idea that somebody might be out there impersonating its officers and so not only did they they give a statement to kim but they also um immediately kind of reached out to zeke and asked if they could contact zlatan and i think he said that they were on the phone with him within an hour of kim contacting them um and then come to find out they then exerted some pressure it sounds like on the fbi and on local agencies to kind of saying hey this is something that needs to be taken um seriously and and zeke really believes that that you know kim's inquiry and her subsequent reporting really got this ball rolling um and after she reported i think one or two stories on um on zeke's allegations um the um the lead roner park officer um who's been indicted uh or former officer uh jc tatum who headed the the roanoke park interdiction team um took a really kind of interesting step of issuing a press release kind of in response to kim's coverage trying to explain away zeke's allegations um and um the fbi the f the indictment certainly says that this was a fraudulent press release in a fraudulent police report designed to kind of cover his tracks um that's the allegation anyway um but there were some things that just didn't match up about the press release and from just a journalist who's seen gobs and gobs of law enforcement press release releases it just was strange it didn't have an exact date it didn't have an exact time it didn't identify the kind of car zeke was driving it didn't name him you know didn't have his name in the press release didn't identify a quantity of marijuana seized it was just it was atypical and i think a lot of people noticed that and then it brought a new attention to this case so the uh the charges are cons for two officers tatum and huffaker are conspiracy to commit extortion under the color of official rights and then officer tatum former officer tatum also faces additional charges of falsifying records in a federal investigation in order to cover up alleged theft right so what and then also a charge of tax evasion as well oh right exactly yeah like uh al capone the tax man will always get you um so you know what kind of transpired in this investigation um that that you know what are some of the elements of the story that kind of sent out to you like that you said he was the head of a of a interdiction task force yeah and so yeah what what are some of the details that kind of stand out in terms of the 101 court or interdiction team so i think there's three things i'd want to hit on there the first it was actually not in in the indictment but was uncovered by kqed in an investigation it did after kim kemp's initial reporting in this um and they requested gobs and gobs of records from from roanoke park and and they found two things that were kind of interesting one is that roanoke park was kind of nationally awarded for its interdiction efforts at the time um for just the amount of the quantities of cannabis it was seizing and the amounts of cash it was seizing this was from a law enforcement perspective an enormously effective interdiction team um headed by tatum and then um they found that um basically when when a law enforcement agency seizes say 50 pounds of cannabis it's kind of impractical to expect them that they're just going to hold all that as evidence until the case goes to trial and so what they do in these large drug seizure cases is they hold on to a sample of it but then they destroy the rest and there's a really meticulous process they have to follow to do this of getting a court um destruction order and then they're supposed to you know um transfer the the drugs to a specific officer who's then um uh kind of ordered to destroy them in a very specific way and then document it with a destruction um with destruction documentation and so what kqed found is that for at least 800 pounds of cannabis over like a two-year period rohnert park was unable to actually show documentation that it was destroyed they had court orders telling um the department to destroy it and they had documentation that it had been handed off to jc tatum the sergeant in control of such things but there was no actual you know proof that it had been destroyed so that raised a lot of questions um then in the um in the indictment itself um federal agents um reviewed lots of body camera footage from the roanoke park police department and they were able to document numerous cases i think they identified five or six of them in the actual indictment itself but where officers seized cannabis or cash from drivers i think tatum was involved in all these traffic stops and did not provide them with any documentation did not provide for them with a seizure receipt and then also um for which the agents were unable to find any other documentation of this traffic stop so within roanoke park police records it was as if the stop had never happened it never existed there's no police report attached to it or anything like that um but they have this footage of them actually taking custody of cannabis from people um so that raised a lot of questions and then the last aspect is just the irs investigation um the irs did what seems like a pretty exhaustive investigation over several years of um officer sergeant tatum's um financial records and what they claim to have found is um hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars of cash deposits um into his bank his and his wife's bank accounts and family members bank accounts um all of them in sums less than ten thousand dollars which and if you over if you deposit over ten thousand dollars in cash the bank is required to report that to the irs and so the they're alleging that this is very much a pattern of somebody trying to conceal illicit profits um and so all of these three things together i think really raised questions about the scope of what was happening in roanoke park um over this time period and um while the indictment is really related to two specific traffic stops in december um and um and then for um you know for sergeant tatum the um you know the tax evasion and the attempt to cover up as well i think the um other information indictment really kind of leads one to believe there might be other shoes to drop and there might be other actions coming gotcha well there's so much more in the article um hopefully people check it out thank you for sharing uh your insights on this with us um i know these officers are facing a lot of time and and it you know we'll see how it plays out and we'll see how you know i'm sure you guys will follow it down its uh path um yeah so what one other thing i wanted to ask you about um there today actually breaking news uh happy st patrick's day there's breaking news in the sacramento bee about the eureka police department a few officers communications can you tell us real briefly a little bit about that breaking story yeah real briefly um a reporter for the sacramento bee um obtained from from an unnamed source um screenshots of group text chats with six epd officers that include um just lots of very vile things uh misogynistic and um really dehumanizing language um directed at uh people that um that these officers were in charge of protecting and serving so it really raises a lot of pretty alarming questions absolutely something that we at the journal are following up on as we speak and we'll continue to do so and hopefully uh bring more of that to light well fantastic thank you yeah that's available online like like north coast journal sacramento b's also online check it out um how about you jennifer what's going on this week on the arts and features beat with you you know so for our cannabis issue um i you know i had wanted to include something about you know people infusing foods with cannabis for a while but i'm not sure if you're familiar with jessica ashley silva if you um she's written for us before she covered the guy fieri barbecue contest at the fair the sweaty meat fest i believe she called it and um i i saw that she had posted a while ago a fail and you know i love a food fail but this was an infusion fail and so i asked her to jump in and write about it and also i want to say that i feel partly responsible for this fail um i asked jessica to write about a cannabis pairing dinner which was a virtual event usually you know cannabis dinners you go and you get a whole infused multi-course meal that i don't know how you get home from but um you know when people do these really fancy-schmancy meals infused with cannabis but this was a virtual one given our times and so she cooked at home along with a chef who was you know using fancy oils and swirling things on dishes and it was you know very very fancy and it it gave her a sense of maybe hubris and so she and some friends dove into some cannabis cooking and everything was going great and then she had this very cheesy burger that was so great on this some sort of infused burger thing and then she was like why don't i just make some infused cheese and she made this attempt and to her credit she made a really beautifully formed three fresh mozzarella balls and um you know they look great if you look at it in black and white if you look at it in color and she wrote about the you know the the hubris the fall the tragic outcome of trying to infuse it because it came out sort of the color of silly putty sort of a brown gray unpleasant and um when she described trying it she was like you don't taste brown please don't taste brown please and it tasted so brown it tasted as she she describes it as tasting like dirt hay and dead plants yeah and then of course you know like a good you know growth raised in the right family she tried not to throw out food and she tried to apply it to a pizza with a lot of garlicky pesto and hope no no nothing nothing could cover the taste of of swamp from that mozzarella but um you know she talks about sort of the basics of of how you infuse food and um it was a learning experience for me to read about um but also i really like her attitude um uh if you're if you're in humble foodies you know her it was one of the admins and um she's very funny and even honestly i always enjoy when she you know blocks someone or kicks them off of the side it's always great fun but she talks about the value of food fails and most of the time on something like humble foodies we're sharing you know our successes look at this amazing rack of lamb i made look at this fantastic fettuccine i made and people don't really share like oh jesus what did i do to this poor piece of meat but here she is and she was saying that she learned something which is that okay mistakes were made and here's what she could do instead next time like maybe a flavorless uh instead of working directly from flour maybe she could use you know a flavorless extract would be better next time or you know maybe mozzarella is meant to just be a mozzarella right it has that cure maybe we infuse other things um but she you know she took it as a learning experience and she also was like well you know what i did figure out how to make some cheese so hopefully she'll be back to do that again but um yeah if you've if you've ever tried failed or tried to smile through someone else's failed infusion meal i strongly recommend it i mean the only thing that i forgot to ask her is if it's i mean i would imagine that the thc quality was still there but despite that i think um despite the effects of cannabis it didn't make her enjoy it anymore which is too bad that's yeah which you know i i get the boost of um the boost of enjoyment that people get from you know having cannabis infused foods i i totally get the draw if it's a tenth of what i experienced when i was pregnant then i don't know why everyone's not eating cannabis infused food all the time but other than having to drive um but yeah it's a fun read and you should definitely check it out and definitely not do what she did that is amazing yeah so it sounds like mozzarella should be left as mozzarella you don't need to infuse it it's kind of i mean isn't there already a high to cheese isn't cheese its own drug so it takes more and more yeah speaking of uh own drug um you did a satirical piece maybe not so satirical uh cannabis strains we need in 2021 and wish were real tell us a little bit about that because that is hysterical i'm gonna say it's only barely satirical because um so i've done this for a few years in a row and i have had a couple of people who were like so i don't understand where can you buy these yes actually there isn't one that makes you feel like a disney princess that's not real i made it up um what i what i like to do is go through and look at real strains and look at their descriptions and how they describe the crosses and whatnot and look at some of the really hilarious names that they have and i must say that one of the challenges is coming up with names that aren't already strains so you know when i was looking up like there's a there's a strain that um a fake string that is for people who are really upset about dr seuss you know if you're like really upset about it which relax relax what happened on mulberries or what was it i can't what i saw on mulberry street i have a copy it's not great it's no cat in the hat but people are so upset about not making more of them you know the ones that are out there are out there but people are so upset about and i thought well i should have a strain that helps people cope with that stress and i looked up and i could not believe there isn't already a strain called who hash [Music] but evidently an opportunity missed um and there are a few other ones that are some of them that are meant to help you through the stress of the pandemic like darth vaxxer which is sort you know sort of my little tribute to thaad who is a very big star wars fan as you can see from his background um and uh legion of zoom which is meant to help you feel more more like you're really in the room with people when you're even on screen um which i personally don't want [Laughter] but some people might you know it can be very draining having all your interactions remotely she says as she's having a skype conversation with someone that she used to sit in a studio with truth but it's fun to do so there's one um q-tips which i think was really funny about q and on and there's some other contemporary uh references but others are just more like um you know broadly uh appealing i suppose like tell us about sofa cushion uh sofa cushion is for when you just need to ride out the rest of the pandemic just keeping it mellow you know a lot of people have tried to be really productive during this and personally i feel that's a mistake it's been you know it's been so emotionally and mentally taxing for us to go through the ups and downs and the sort of national grief and personal grief and all those things and yet we have all these things telling us you need to hustle you need to be working on your side gig you need to be and some of that is survival financially but some of it is just the social pressure of always be productive always be doing something and so this particular strain allows you to just uh what do i have that it's it's um a couple of indica strains inertia and lazy boy to help you sink deeper and deeper into your couch until you become one with it which you know let me help you with that tap into your inner fauchy one kenobi yes somebody feel free if people want to make these strains um you know just send me a small fee and we'll be good yeah you got to trademark that stuff well right on there's a lot more in that article definitely folks check it out that's just about going to do it for us this week it flies by unfortunately uh north coast journal is available on newsstands now available online uh pick one up stay informed stay safe jennifer thank you both so much and we'll see you guys again next week see you next week [Applause] do [Applause] you", "1iIENII-lVo": "everyone is talking about CBD and THC which are two important chemicals found in marijuana with marijuana legalization becoming mainstream what is the actual difference between CBD and THC inside you right now there's a biological pathway at work called the endocannabinoid system that helps regulate your mood appetite memory and pain sensation THC and CBD though hijack this system this is the chemical structure of THC also known as tetrahydrocannabinol if you are feeling fancy and this is the chemical structure of CBD also known as cannabidiol what you may notice is that their chemical structures seem almost identical they have the same molecular formula which is C 21 H 3002 and both of their masses clocking at 314 grams per mole but there is one extremely important structural difference where THC contains a cyclic ring CBD contains a hydroxyl group and this difference in biochemistry actually controls whether or not you feel high in order to fully understand why you need to first know about the cb1 receptor in your unstoned to sober body your cb1 receptor is affected by a neurotransmitter called an and amide which controls generation of pleasure motivation and feeding behavior in your unstoned body and manda mine is released after exercising and it's what causes a runner's high THC structure is so similar to Ananda mine that it fits in perfectly to the cb1 receptor therefore causing you to feel high CBD on the other hand because of the hydroxyl group is different in shape and does not fit into the cb1 receptor therefore it doesn't make you feel high but CBD does bind to other receptors in your cannabinoid system affecting you in other ways a lot of excitement came around a 2011 study where a few dozen people with social anxiety disorder were asked to speak in front of a large audience some were given CBD some were given a placebo those who were given CBD reported significantly less anxiety there are also many animal studies showing CBDs anti-anxiety and anti-inflammatory properties which can explain why some people say it helps with their anxiety and with chronic pain research is also discovering that THC can actually a head Grove eight psychotic symptoms while CBD on the other hand may help with psychosis so what happens when you consume them at the same time one study found that due to CBDs biochemical shape it can actually bind to the cb1 receptor and turn it off in a binding pattern known to biologists as allosteric inhibition this means that CBD actually makes the THC unable to bind as well and therefore decreases how high you feel if you vaporize marijuana with 25% THC and 0.1% CBD you will feel high as the THC is going to bind to the cb1 receptor with little interference from CBD if you consume marijuana with 25% THC and 12% CBD this more CBD will inhibit the THC from binding to the cb1 receptor decreasing th DS effect and leading you to being less high where marijuana is legally sold likely they will indicate what percentage of THC and CBD is in the product you are choosing which will help you to understand the effects that will have on your body in the end THC is a chemical found in marijuana with a chemical structure that makes you feel high CBD is a chemical found in marijuana with a different chemical structure that doesn't make you feel high but it can affect your body in other less obvious ways there is still conflicting research and a lot more to understand about both chemicals with more states and countries legalizing marijuana hopefully increased research can uncover more details about how these two chemicals affect us because weed is now legal in Canada we created a new series called stoned science where we make comedians get high and try to explain complex science concepts our first episode is about the respiratory system so click

of the presses from yesterday that i didn't finish it up got uh six bucks here we're gonna go ahead and start pressing these um i'm thinking at 200. yesterday we did a range of temperatures the lower temperatures were not cutting it so we're going to go back to our our higher tip that i like to do that 202 we're gonna go ahead and uh we'll see how that does got some more parchment so i got the uh pucks properly wrapped up now and prepped in the appropriate size parchment sleeves so we should be able to get a decent flow and we'll just have to see what we get and we'll adjust the temperature as needed i don't imagine we'll be going down below 190 so excuse me one minute while i go ahead and finish straightening some [ __ ] up it is [ __ ] chilly chilly really really really [ __ ] is cold in

that one [Music] [Music] i gotta now i gotta google this [ __ ] i don't know what you're saying but i gotta find out i gotta find out he said okay goodbye [Music] [Music] the power what pleasure strength i'm sorry is that being is that being culturally insensitive am i being stereotypical am i stereotyping i'm sorry let's get this press started i'm banked already [Music] um [Music] excuse me excuse me hold on the tripod get you guys set up and then um we'll go from there [Music] hey [Music] dabbing gloves big force the team oh the team sounds like he's trying to say like uh the team is strong like big up to the team [Music] am i am i right we just started working at amazon working overnights that means you're packing [ __ ] women's dildo orders and [ __ ] huh doing all the freaky [ __ ] overnight i got you on that [ __ ] [ __ ] it's okay boy what else could they use the overnight [ __ ] for at amazon that's gotta be it that's gotta be so [Music] [Music] [Music] my man said he's part of the ginyu force that's what he said until we figure out what he's saying we're just gonna assume that he's saying he's part of the ginyu force [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] foreign oh this one gets loud oh so good return puck feels uh pretty well emptied and got off the plates pretty quick and was the same color or lighter than yesterday a slightly better return feels like so i dropped the temperature a little bit but not much because this stuff does just come out darker because in the terps [Music] so i still want to keep the flow high [Music] myself [Music] uh wow i'm allowed to give you guys information soon but i can't give you information on pricing yet i was told i have to wait until science led makes the official announcement and gets them on their site and then by then they'll have like um shipping times and you'll be able to pre-order and [ __ ] they don't want to put out the information too soon so they told me to wait trust me i'm i'm so ready to tell you guys [Music] you know [Music] [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] [Music] i'm at uh 190 right now it's just looking off because the lighting is [ __ ] and this is a trim run bro here maybe this will help you guys with the color issue i know it's hard to tell but you'll see you'll see get this in the jar and then we're going to go ahead and start the next puck that was a good temperature and we're gonna run it at that time yeah i don't really have a good spot you guys where you're not gonna be in the [ __ ] way i'll try and move you over a little bit i think my laptop could be [ __ ] maybe let me see food grade month okay you guys if you say so you know what determines whether it's food grade or not how clean it melts when i show you how clean it melts you're gonna be like oh okay yeah that's not food grade the trichomes that come off of trim is usually going to be more mature because it's exposed to more direct light than the rest of the trichomes that are covered in the plant matter right so when you process trim it's going to come out slightly more amber too all right and then if you're dealing with a strain that's really really terpy and depending on what those terpenes are can also make it darker right so never judge judge it by the color alone and be quick to say oh that's food grade or that's not good like it's really really hard to judge it based off of color alone especially fresh off the press so oh yeah definitely people judge with their eyes first for sure you eat with your eyes first you judge off of appearance first but again this is fresh off the plates and you got to give me a couple days and work my magic on it telling you guys i'm telling you huh i want to mention just my lighting is [ __ ] probably back you guys the [ __ ] up huh um the plan is going to be to whip this all up and heat mat it and then burp it at um at a certain point [Music] so good extraction on that one too this is going to turn out just like the los altos did it's gonna turn into that like jam with chunks in it and i'm gonna love it we'll love every minute of it there's not good light over here where's the best light for me let's go in here oh no [ __ ] that room goes crazy let's try right here man the light [ __ ] right now there we go how's that color looking it looks like [ __ ] when you look at it from the top because the camera can't perceive the light the same way but it's just terpius [ __ ] so and you would think oh the lower temperature you go the lighter it'll be no because it just takes too long to get off the plates and we already tried 200 that was too hot then 190 is is the sweet spot it's the best it's gonna get for uh for this i mean i can go like 155 160 and press like five grams at a time maybe get a different result but i'm not pressing five [ __ ] grams at a time that's not what's gonna happen today i wonder if it would help so this is gonna get real silly if i don't put you guys down soon oh this is between 16 to 22 grams in every one of these bags how did you already know right my man saw the board behind me and added it up already my press is feminine thank you her name is bertha so yes she is feminine it's not the craziest smell actually because i'm not running it too hot but it's like a minty coffee lag oh there's some fat ass chunks in this hmm two more oh my goodness we always gotta get one or two huh you know actually i think that you've been on this channel being done before you are the weakest link bye [Music] [Music] i don't know yet my yield on this run yet because we're in the middle of doing it right now i'm not trying to be a smart ass but open your eyes [Music] how old is the material it was a couple weeks old when it was given to me about two weeks old i want to say sat in the freezer for a couple weeks i don't know if uh what the yield has been i haven't really been weighing anything yet so i'll just wait and see i'll wait and find out at the end and i get a veggie burger with uh grilled onions no tomato with fries with uh spread i mean i put my own beyond meat burger patty on it when i get home still enjoy in and out but do it the vegan way yeah buddy but also whoever did mention edibles for food grade i am going to turn a good portion of my cut into edibles or at least caps really potent caps rosin gaps no i didn't do anything today i'm working working working working working and uh somebody else says one more and then collection and then we're going to stir it all up and get it going on the heat map i'm gonna heat mat it at least overnight i'll show you guys i have no secrets no secrets whatsoever i don't time anything i don't look at the gauge anything if i don't know who you are on the gram or if you don't follow or like somebody i know doesn't follow you then i don't accept you you got to tell me what your name is so that i can go and accept you and maybe maybe if i've seen your name around here enough i'll accept it otherwise you gotta know somebody to know somebody to know somebody to know somebody to know somebody so yeah there i'm gonna start doing a lot more live sessions that are gonna be more interactive i'm gonna set up uh a streaming session in the new hash set so it'll be a good stable connection and we'll be able to have some proper lighting in there our windows uh vented sunlight and we'll be able to have some real good sessions okay so so yo i watched this uh hugh hefner docu-series with my wife and it was actually pretty interesting i didn't know that he was so involved in social issues it was really interesting to see that and how he went against the grain with racism and segregation and he would invite um all these black stars to come onto his show right and he had aretha franklin and um brain farting on the other person and but he had like a bunch of different up and coming artists and he wasn't afraid to have them come and perform at his club because he didn't care he didn't see color he just saw talent and he wanted to make it known what his company stood for and didn't stand for and so he interviewed like he did really really in-depth interviews with a lot of celebrities and at one point he did an in-depth interview with malcolm x and malcolm x was you know saying his typical stuff very radical extremist stuff and mind you majority of the readers of playboy back at this time are white and he published it against the advice of all the other people that were working for and he published it unedited and well not unedited like they edited it but they didn't like edit his answers or change his wording they left it all exactly how he said it you know um and i'm like yo that that's [ __ ] ballsy and he got a lot of support for it actually afterwards and a lot of readers wrote in and said that was awesome thanks for sharing that interview blah blah blah so yeah man that was that was really interesting to watch that and obviously to watch his back and forth with struggling to be um you know married and father and all these different things that he just couldn't [ __ ] do living in the [ __ ] mansion i think any normal man would succumb to that [ __ ] after a while especially after being away from your wife the man was surrounded by titties and ass 24 7. like i think he had so much titties and ass i would get tired of it i would be like [ __ ] put some clothes on like it's not even exciting anymore to see your titties they're just always out like put some clothes on surprise me i want to come around the corner and just be like ah titties surprise it's been three days then i'm gonna be like oh titties but if i see titties every time i walk around the [ __ ] house i'm titties like what like it's like looking at an elbow it's just not gonna matter anymore you know just doesn't [ __ ] matter anymore i don't know how that man stayed excited by i guess maybe there was just so many different kinds of titties i don't know i think i would get over it titty climbing wall bro you know how much i just pictured that [ __ ] on my head like a rock climbing wall but instead of rocks his titties yo oh my god you are creative you are creative that is funny he says my friend has a thing for elbows i mean i'm a classic i'm a classy man i i like exposed shoulders if my wife ever has like a shirt that is like has one of those wide neck collars and you know her shoulder starts to show a little bit i'm like oh that's classy sexy i'm an old man i guess but hey can we get a quick vote while i take this dab a quick vote side boob is 2003 but it's okay quick vote he said yes yo kristoff i wish i knew what you were saying somebody tell me what he's saying titty sprinkles by morgan you know desensitized from titties and ass yeah man i'm telling you bro why you

cheers i'm going to show you guys how [ __ ] clear this is too here you", "4E6mIX2qb6g": "[Music] my name is Brian s'more I'm the director of operations for nectar and Northwest cannabis trading company I think my role here is basically to help facilitate operations make sure we run a little more efficiently more productively and you hopefully have some fun doing it I think some of the hurdles that nectar faces a lot of folks in the cannabis industry face and that's just there's a newness there's an unknown element to it there's a stigma from the past there are still people in laws that restrict things that should be opened up now but there's just a chiral hurdles that you're gonna find as the perceptions change and the laws continue to evolve because we're figuring out just like the government's figuring it out and we're doing at the same time so but I think we're together we're doing a pretty good job of getting through those hurdles nectar is a very unique company in that we are one of the few Oregon owned and Oregon grown companies we've got you know a lot of other outside forces are coming into the dispensary in the cannabis industry and Oregon and our people are all from within Oregon so that makes it special our stuff is you have the largest grow in the state and so we bring our own product into our dispensaries which makes Dennis very unique and our product is something again that we are able to because of the variety of plants that we have 20 thousand plants and we've got more vendors that come to us because we are the biggest one in Oregon we're able to offer a greater variety we've got 80 strains minimally at any time and our dispensaries whereas some people provide four or five extracts we have up to a hundred extracts it available at our dispensaries nobody else nor can even get anywhere close to this I think everybody from seed to sale people who touch the flower people who are working within dektor packaging it distributing it and selling it bud tenders they take pride in it and that's a really marvelous piece of being a part of this is that there's a real atmosphere of pride that we're going to take care of not only our product but our people and that's something that nectar does really well bovid is a perfect example of this this is where the only company that I'm aware of an Oregon that does this this is next to our people are our product is the most important thing we have and bovid isn't an opportunity for us to preserve the 58 percent humidity on you know our flower so six days from now six months from now it's the same quality it's the same moisture it's the same feel the same sounds the same touch that you had when it first came it was first jarred and that's just another game another example of our commitment to quality to our product and to the people who support us we've used bovid from the moment the flower shows up in our totes the totes are airtight but at the same time they're maybe a little moist still maybe a little dry so before we even get to the bucking process we're using over two products to help you know maintain or equalize that that humidity level that we're seeking but anytime we have any of our products and even the top shelf products we bring in from from other vendors the moment they're jarred velvet is inside we want that to be something that is just it's our mark it's a signature of what we do to take care of again the product we provide it was a real family environment at nectar which I'm really proud to be a part of we take care of each other our owners really care about creating a family hi I'm Brian some more from nectar and this is our", "1IfWXjRLCDc": "go on I seem to remember you're not too familiar with can occult revolver so this would be your

[Music] so here I'm using this equal it is a cloth that once you wet it that's all you need to do it is 99% effective and disinfecting thing I got this from Grove collaborative and you'll see that I'm using a lot of new cleaning products in this video that are often Grove collaborative I'll have all the information links below I know they gave me a pretty awesome coupon code for you guys [Music] [Music] I'm just going to go ahead and wash out any containers that we had in the fridge [Music] now I'm just microwaving some water I know a lot of people mix it with vinegar as well but just water has worked fine for me this just loosens up any explosion hands or grime or anything that was in your microwave to make it easy to wipe out and I'm record on 2 minutes and 15 seconds and now again I'm using another ekwa and just wiping it down inside and here is my step stool because I'm short [Music] now I am moving on to the oven as you can see there's a lot of things taste onto the bottom my oven is pretty much brand new however this does happen you know things get caked onto the bottom and melt and leak off so I'm gonna just be pouring some baking soda over these spots and then I have a bottle full of vinegar that I'll be spritzing on top of it I'm gonna let it sit for a little bit and then try and scrub it all [Music] now I'm using this walnut scrubber this is also from Grove collaborative and I'm sure you realize scrubbed as hard as I could I actually went ahead and repeated this whole process a second time I got mostly everything off but my oven also has a self clean that I have not tried so I may try that another day [Music] now I'm going to use my glass and surface spray and steel for real spray both by method I'm starting with this deal for L spray and I really do love it it smells amazing and a lot of you actually requested that I try this because you really liked it as well [Music] next I'm using my bar keeper's friend multi-purpose cooktop cleaner this is what I've always used if any of you have suggestions on anything else to use I'm open to trying something new this is just what I've used for years now it works pretty well I'm going to take off the knobs as well because a lot of crumbs get stuck under there and as far as how often I deep clean my kitchen this is my first time doing a deep clean since it was a newer kitchen and I guess I'm just going to do it as I see need it I don't really have a schedule for things yet [Music] now I'm using my method glass cleaner I'm gonna use this on any glass in my kitchen and I forgot to mention earlier that the cloth that I'm using are from Dollar Tree I get a lot of questions about them they are two for a dollar in a pack and so far they do a pretty good job [Music] and here you can see I'm really excited about this new little friend that I met I believe it's a leaf bug but yeah he was really cute especially because he was outside and not inside [Music] [Music] now I'm just going to dust some things and knock them off the wall since my husband hung them up with a thumbtack this is also a new goodie this is the method and type back and it's in the bamboo scent and I really really love this and I'm just going to go ahead and clean all of the little doorknobs or handles [Music] and here I'm just using that stainless steel cleaner again on anything that is stainless steel in my kitchen [Music] this is also new from Grove collaborative and I'm just gonna say I don't feel like I love it and I don't feel like I hate it the scent is okay but I totally love makes you salt and lime more and I love my grapefruit method more so I could take it or leave it so as you see I'm just wiping down all of my countertops [Music] now of course it has to put lavender in my diffuser and I will have all of this linked below if you ever have any questions just check the description box first I usually try to include as many links as I can as the things that you guys asked me about but yeah here it is and it's so relaxing and you know I love lavender at night [Music] next I'm going to use this on my backsplash I know that it's for like bathrooms but it said tile on it so I'm going with it and I really liked it it smelled really amazing and I'll definitely be using this in my bathrooms as well [Music] [Music] I had to break out my method sea salt and lime as you know I love this at night so I just had to use this to clean my tables with and of course rookie wanted to say hi [Music] [Music] [Music] now I'm using my vacuum and I'm calling to vacuum out the store that we keep the toaster in it gets a lot of crumbs and I pretty frequently so I definitely do vacuum this at least once a week as I see needed after I vacuumed this I'm gonna vacuum up the drawer that would keep the trashes in [Music] I love this little bottle drying rack that I have which is also linked below in the description box but it does get pretty dirty under there so I have to clean this frequently at least once a week but I would say more my dogs love the vacuum as you know so here we have Romeo chasing me although usually it's rookie but tonight Romeo decided to step it up and be the one that chases me [Music] [Music] now I'm using my cedar mop to go ahead and mop my floors and I love this mop as you know I can't say enough great things about it and I am also using some water and pine saw for this [Music] I'm just going to go ahead and light my new blood orange suede candle I love this it smells so good and I just wanted again say thank you guys so much for subscribing for watching my

about welcome the weeds guys we are here to review some cannabis today we are gonna be doing another cartridge review we're gonna take a look at Humboldt uh choose kindly live give and grow this is Humboldt farms brand cannabis oil disposable 510 while this section disposable they're all five tens are disposable this isn't the sort of all-in-one this is just a 5-10 thread goes on your standard battery I've got mine here this is a half gram cartridge indica grape soda is the strain I don't really care um well we'll see if it's any good I hope it's mostly terpenes uh and then we have this nice little package here it's kind of adorable in a way it's a little tin metal package of some kind it's not a lot of material pretty easy to recycle this you know everybody's looking I don't know if it's aluminum I think it might be aluminum aluminum is always good to recycle so you know um in terms of packaging I quite dig it price point was pretty fair for the half gram cartridge I picked it up for $24 which is you know a little bit on the low end for a legal cartridge sorry that was pretext so this you know more than 30 after-tax for half gram cards which is still on the lower end for Southern California for four license cartridges so half gram 24 bucks pre-tax here in Southern California I've never reviewed anything from Humboldt farms before I'm surprised there aren't a trillion companies with that name there probably are but so far again packaging is pretty cool I have no idea what to expect on the inside but that's what we'll get to right now so I ripped off a little connecting piece of paper there and then it says squeeze and slide I'll try squeeze and slide squeeze slide it slides doesn't come on okay would you look at this Oh perfect here we go this is pretty cool on the inside we have our little ingredients list manufactured packaged date also it looks like maybe manufactured by loud pack a big giant company I think they make their own cartridges and have their own farms but I think they also do a lot of I guess bottling is what you'd call it they do the making of the cartridges for some farms so that looks like that might be the case here uh and then also it says not for world consumption I don't quite understand what that means because I'm going to be consuming this definitely orally alright well let's take a look at the cartridge itself which is pretty interesting it looks like this is the only the second cartridge that I have come across so far that has a wooden tip that's right the mouthpiece is it's wood it's some kind of it's some kind of wood not some plastic Enoch up it's really wood which is a really interesting material - you know to wrap your mouth around I guess I don't dislike it it's you know it's not as pleasant I guess as a good piece of glass or a good piece of aluminum but the materialist is as super sustainable you know what is it's no big deal so I don't fault it for that but well give it a whole try here screw it in our grape soda oil is looking very very handsome yellow there again doesn't really matter the color you know any color can be in any consistency or quality but who doesn't like to see a nice bright yellow alright well for the most important part let's give it a test and turn my battery on here there she goes would put this woody in my mouth hmm after sucking on that woody for a little bit I was surprised how much came out uh Jesus Christ what am I talking about sorry Wow okay um that is incredibly fruity very very very fruity not really grape but certainly fruity it does say that um this all comes from cannabis derived and natural terpenes so theoretically nothing artificial in it it is just has a lot of flavor in here I'll say that I kind of like it though I actually like the fruity flavors and I like I like a lot of flavor if it if it's a flavor I enjoy and I'm a sucker for the you know I've got the sweet tooth I'm sucker for the beyond the more sweet tasting strains and this one has it in spades other than the taste um it's great actually um it's just fine loud pack seems to know what they're doing making these cartridges actually it's really smooth too very pleasant to hit and while the packaging I forgot to mention this says that it comes in at a pretty high 81 and a quarter percent THC I'm gonna give it another couple puffs here and see if I you know if that sounds reasonable oh yeah I mean it's this is quality oil yeah I have no complaints about the potency and quality of what we've got going on in here - my first - my tongue into my brain these first couple of hits been super enjoyable um Wow yeah this has been a pretty big thumbs up from me at this point for the Humboldt Farms grape soda I've been forgetting to get down you guys are gonna kill me the comes through there [ __ ] I owe you a whole five-second draw before I go here guys um design kart design is really nice the wood is interesting the wood tip is interesting I mean if it's sustainable and it you know doesn't cost them a lot of money go for it it's just it's just odd it I can't really explain why alright I'm gonna do one more hit and then I'm gonna bounce but as you guys all know I'm not leaving you forever no no no I'm gonna enjoy all half grand I've got here probably over the next 48 to 60 hours or so and then once I've gotten through this humble Farms grape soda once I got the last drop out I'll come right back here to you guys and let you know exactly what I thought of the whole experience I say it every time but only because it's true we all know that these carts are prone to malfunctioning they can break the atomizer can burn out they can start leaking any number of problems I've seen them all and that's why I do the whole review to let you know to make sure the whole product was good from the top to the very bottom so I'm really looking forward to smoking on this one and I look forward to telling you guys all about it right back here in just a bit thanks for watching hi guys welcome back to wheats as predicted it has been 48 hours of moderate enjoyment with Humboldt Farms grape soda here let's see if I can get that zoomed in you can see they're still actually a little bit of wax there in the cartridge um I'm altum Utley coming away pretty mixed with maybe sort of leaning towards disappointment I like the oil inside quite a bit no oil was good it was the cartridge that let me down the wood tip I don't know if it was a function of the wood tip or what but the cartridge was routinely getting clogged meaning I would have to you know you would try to inhale and nothing you would get no vapor let alone air flow on and I would sort of it cleaning out or just really really keep inhaling until eventually I don't know whether the oil heated up and again I'm not even sure what was causing the headache there whether it was the atomizer not properly working or whether the oil just didn't heat right I'm not sure what mechanic wasn't working at a hundred percent but I do know that I had some trouble on more than some trouble with this cartridge which which is a bit of a bummer um taste you know III don't think grape soda is gonna be for everybody I I found it pretty enjoyable um but again the problems you know you don't you certainly don't want your twenty five thirty dollar cartridge having to go in the trash nothing this one had to go in the trash but you know the problems could have been greater also it did have that problem with the oil getting really hot at the bottom as you're getting closer and closer to completing you get that sort of almost burnt taste I know it's I can't quite describe it where you get this sort of harsher clouds this one definitely experienced that as well so ultimately I'm gonna say there are better options out there for you then humbled farms again this is just our first review of anything from this company if you guys tell me no man keep trying I know these guys are great I'll take another look at him but for now you know um I'd saying there there are plenty of other options plenty of other fish in the sea then Humboldt Farms take some you leave some you win some you lose some and that guys is gonna do it for this review here on wheats a bit of a mixed bag today but they're always sunnier skies ahead and that's gonna do it guys thank you so much for watching wheats and we will see all you find folks on the next review ciao", "EFh8P9u0icg": "youtube what is up your boy cushy here and this was a couple weeks ago we went and stopped at cookies in detroit and uh grabbed a bunch of different things i do not know why i opened that bag like someone was gonna come out i literally i don't know the guy but i know the guy that waited on me i was like bro i want the best wax you got what she said this is a new brand urban extracts we're gonna be trying this doing a review on this [Music] um i said the best cartridge you got he came at me with this was 60 dollars but i mean we got discounts on everything it was like 25 percent off they had a deal uh humble b never heard of it not a fan i never even had a um wooden cap cartridge before that i've tried so we got this coming up i was trying to say wood tip uh new stizzy we got the stizzy big battery it's double the size of the uh regular batteries and it rips like crazy and we actually got a new flavor uh blue burst [Music] i've never had this flavor yet but um grab that these two waxes we're gonna smoke this one today this is uh cured cured resin the kitchen sink is what is what it's called uh cured resin was kitchen sink the kitchen sink sauce on the rocks now like i said i did open this there was more sauce than uh i liked but i went and had some grass roots uh diamonds laying around and i went and threw them in there but take a little look at this we'll get you a close-up [Music] terpy but yeah let's go ahead and try this out monster extracts kitchen sink it just looks crazy nice and tarpy like i said could have had more diamonds in it but still good i still need to get a dab where i'm still working with this crappy freaking scissors but it is what it is how you guys doing today uh 9 11. sucks man so it just seems like yesterday and 19 years man just fly by like nothing it's insane but uh i think this was like 45 for the uh program maybe 50 somewhere around there but like i said everything was 25 off so it's worth it uh i got uh i got a half a terapin this this this [Music] oh yeah yeah two of these two different funfetti carts and the battery for was like [Music] under a little bit over 200 or something so i mean it's it's a deal going up there the stuff's quality this thing here looks crazy it's like almost 92 percent we're gonna be uh trying that out but uh here we go bust this thing down good old cured resin the kitchen sink i just like the name that one i picked that one i was like i need that kitchen sink one but uh he said this is the go-to wax i guess it's new i don't even know i've never even heard about it or this cartridge humble bee but gonna be shining both out let's rip this this is why it is fire it's phenomenal especially with me adding the diamonds in it really kicked it up a lot all right michigan just has like such a different taste terp profile i don't know about that's the right word but just has such a unique taste whoa definitely let me out oh it's coming in [Music] thc i heard a lot of great things about them i had to grab it i actually posted it on my instagram uh pa underscore cushy they got back to me and it was like oh thank you so much for uh trying it out this is that a third and um told me the one to grab for the most diamonds i forget what it was i'll have to try to find it and put in the comments but um it lights you up it's i'm coughing but i'm a cougher uh definitely motivating and gonna be talkative ready to go uh still another whack in there like this one more time definitely medicaid definitely definitely uh where i work out of uh crayon in my pocket who don't remember them they're still around i think spongebob squarepants ones had this dizzy in there with me and uh just bouncing around all over my pocket and the crayon got all over it i'd say it's a hybrid it's probably a mix because it's everything in the kitchen sink but yeah a bunch of new [ __ ] coming up that i never even had ub extracts this thing's supposed to be phenomenal and it's coming in like 90 thc it's an llr full spectrum liquid a lot of resin you're going to be like wow that's it numbers look good on this so hope

i guess", "1mKh4lWFSeY": "hello my name is Dale Campbell welcome to the second video in the percussive guitar techniques series this week's video we're gonna have a quick recap over what we looked at last time and we're also going to learn part of a song start off with last week we had a couple beats we have the bass drum beat which was in between the sound hole and the saddled wrist here and you can also play that on the saddle just here depending on how sharp your saddle is then you also have the bass drum beat down on body just here and you can also get that pretty much anywhere on the body just here I've ten multiply it up here because it's a bit unpractical you have to lift your arm up a lot so down here's just as good and it's a bit more comfortable snare drum beats you can get one just here underneath the sound hall kind of to the front of the guitar and you can also get that the opposite side at the top just here depending on what you're playing one is probably going to be more practical than the other you can also get a snare drum beat or maybe a rimshot type beat just underneath the side of the guitar here like so now you probably been practicing those up along with the hi-hat closing type sound we had which was generated by clicking the strings against the end fret or against the pick up depending on what you have like so now we're going to try and incorporate those into a song it's one of my songs it's called new song 2006 and you can check that out on my myspace site I apologize about the name it's not very good to start off with we're going to look at the chords that are in the song it's basically an E major chord with a couple of variations added in if you find the call that we're about to play difficult or new york guitar if it's awkward to play it because you have 12 frets to their body then you could just play an E major chord and it would pretty much get you most the way there and it would certainly allow you to practice some of the beats that we're doing without having to do a huge stretcher cord down here so if we're playing a standard E major chord up around the open fret so you've got open second second first open open hopefully everyone know that already and then what we're going to do is move that all the way up so that we're going to be playing open 14 14 13 open open so that's going from the top open 14 14 13 open open now because we've moved three of the notes that we were holding down up an octave you get a slight different sound but it's still basically any major chord at this point what we're then going to do is move one of the notes up two frets so we're going to hand open 14 this note here is going to move up on the D string to 16 this no stays at 13 on the G then we have open and open on the B and E so just one more time to recap open 14 16 13 open open now all of these chords are going to be written in the description next to the video so if you forget how that goes you just take glanced over there and you'll instantly able to see why you think it should be now that's going to be the first chord it's kind of a nice us 2 chord but as well as having the second in there we're also keeping the major third gives us a really happy chord and we're going to incorporate that with some of the beats that we look at last time so first of all we have to do an explosive beat where we're going to actually flick our fingers out across the chord as we do a bass drum beat somewhere around the edges here you can do it on the saddle but you tend to be quite close to the bridge beats just there so you get a very brittle sound I do it just on the body here above the sound hole explodes a beat look at your fingers in a sort of risk Wado type stroke and then let everything keep ringing now when we play this we're going to keep those notes ringing so it's important not to bring your hand back down to the strings to mute them afterwards so you just keep them going and then your hands got a fall down across the body missing all strings I'm going to start doing the beats down here I'll play you through a section of song so you can hear how it goes and then I'll explain what's going on so start off with explosive beat I do two beats with my thumb on the top of the body just there so that's just almost directly below the saddle and I just use the side of my thumb for that I've got a kind of double-jointed thumb so it bends back a bit if you haven't you're only going to find you're getting more knuckle on it but again it's going to depend on your guitar as well so you have to get a tone that you're happy with just by playing around you might find a different area around there works better so two beats and we've just come down from up here so we get [Music] your hands gradually moving down as you're doing that and then you go for a snare shot underneath the side of the guitar so you get one more hit back here with your thumb then two thumps for a bass drum like that so all that section again after you've done that you're going to roll up onto your thumb and you're going to flick your fingers out like that now the reason we roll up onto the thumb there is to position your fingers the correct distance away from the body of the guitar if you don't do that then you're probably going to get your hand too far away and miss or you're going to get your hand too close and not be able to flick your fingers out comfortably so the thumb acts as kind of gauge and that's always going to be constant so you know you're going to get a good hit if you put your thumb there like so the little finger probably won't hit because it's considerably shorter than the other fingers and I just accept that and make sure that I'm working into a song I'm going to get three beats there rather than four weeks you occasionally get it but not always so thumb down look at things out and then after you've done that your fingers going to be heading towards the side of the guitar again so you're kind of moving when you're doing that keeping the thumb there as a gauge and then going for a snare hit afterwards so that's a beat you might want to try just by itself bring your hand across after you're done two bass drums up on your thumb flicking out and then snare drum underneath the side of the guitar so that whole section one more time slowly [Music] and to finish it off we're just going to add two more beats in with the thumb as we're coming back up to do the next hit so all our section and then you just loop it around at that point all you can move on to that is chord now the next chord is basically the same it's in the same position almost and you got open 14 13 this time 16 open open basically what's happened is you've swapped around the two fingers that are on the D and the g strings so the g string was at 13 and the D string was at 16 now the D string is at 13 and the g string is at 16 and you do exactly the same beats over that chord as you did before so to put two of those chords together [Music] and used to loop that around now the next section of the song takes you right back down to the open strings down here and you get a different chord you've got nice us to going on there we're going to leave that for next time so they can just practice moving through those various beats there's one more thing that we're going to look at and that's the immediate term transition from this section into the section further down the neck in this section we're coming away from the beats here I'm going to start doing the beats around this area of the guitar just here we keep the same chords so we're going to be holding down open 14 16 13 open open so one more time in slow motion just wardo upstroke with the thumb slapping down with your first finger onto snare drum just there harmonic at the nineteenth hi-hat onto the strings and that's with the kind of heel of your palm just there bass drum and then you back to the beginning [Music] so to play through the whole of our section first part down here and then moving into that we'll get this [Music] next week practice to all of those beats you probably gonna have to separate some of them out by themselves so just go through slowly re-watch the video watch me play the beat and then just mimic it get your hands use the movements you've got to do and gradually speed up you should playing all this fairly slowly because when I first started doing this stuff I would try and play really quick and I tend to catch my fingers on different parts of guitar so I'd hit my kind of inside of the knuckles on the side of the guitar that really hurts and then I'd hit kind of just the nail bed just there onto the I know like the inside of the sound hole or catch it too much on strings or mice doing their squad oohs trying to get down for the Slayer so you've really got to be careful practice them slowly make sure your hands know exactly where they're going especially for the harmonic and for the snare drum just there it's a very precise movement and you've got to make sure that you really get it down otherwise harmonic just won't ring practice through all of those I'll see you next time you", "i6gBTVFDcSE":

message to the people down you smoking man growing and watching prohibition fall down [Music] yo what's up everybody hanging out in studio today we got Scotty Moby dil welcome and none other dude jinx proof man nice to have you on the line today and be hanging out here yeah like I gotta give you a good introduction we saw you over at the Cantor grow Expo recently and it was the first time I met you I know the Expos get busy not not much time to be hanging full-on but so I'm glad you came on today and it's one of the honored to have us with us I mean you've been a cannabis warrior a world-famous breeder of 9 pound hammer a little bit that's my secret stash right here I mean you got the jinx proof genetics seed company and you've been in the game for for many years and something we really want to acknowledge this a me yeah it is cool man homeboys different than a lot of other folks as to where he's got some causes man jinx I know you're real good to veterans I know you do a lot for Autism Awareness and that is cool as hell man so I mean we're all you know all it's different man as to where we're just trying to develop a reputation in cannabis and it's kind of we got to come on and make friends man we've got to be friendly here man if we come in and push our way in that ain't no way to do it so I loved I just love your way man yeah well done sir thanks thanks I do appreciate that to be totally honest with you I'm more proud and you know happy with the philanthropy work than I am with my breeding work to tell you the truth it's been a such a great stage to stand on this is you know before I used to do some philanthropy work and I tried to hit up big companies and stuff like that and then once I started hitting up the cannabis industry it completely changed you know sitting up big companies on hundreds of thousands of dollars and didn't even want to recognize it and then you know started working with these independent farmers who you know really just have enough to survive and are 10 times as generous I mean so it's been a great journey I'm really happy and proud of that and the cannabis community for being a huge part of that I love you know why because I think people in the cannabis community we see actual change we're not just you know running up and hitting against a wall all the time we're actually making some progress so it's it gives me a good feeling about life man that you can work for some change you know especially for the change for the better right let me take let me take it into the breeding a little bit from the beginning kind of you know as far as the breeding scene for many years you know you've been in there can you tell us about what foundations of the breeding of the genetics back then as far as like you know I don't know is there something with this game yeah yeah with you like is there certain I don't take it from kind of the beginning what you got started with genetic wise or what got you into it yeah actually become a breeder I mean I'll be 15 minutes I've been in the game while I started growing I think when I was about 19 I actually learned from a fisherman and a dentist a bunch of botany classes in school and the fisherman guy just in how to grow weed and it's a lot different than it is today you know I didn't start breeding till about 10 years ago you know I mean when I was young there didn't really it was hard to find seeds and people didn't really want seeds and what we sought after was completely different when when I first started growing weed we actually looked for the weed that smelled the least right young guys trying to make money and back then you couldn't go to a store and buy a carbon fan so you know I mean and the strange but then a lot of them didn't even have names it was just like you know and somebody called you for but it was like is it chronic you're a nobody nobody how fast does it an hour do that the only straight I've ever even dealt was back and that had a name was the Northern Lights and I wouldn't grow it because it would stink up the whole fam block a mile from my house driving home just but I know that's me it's changed a lot oh yeah these chains like with carbon filters and stuff like that we can grow stinky weed and hell you know what I was a kid you got in trouble for us no you got caught with a basement full of weed you're here going to jail you know I mean so hey I know here in Washington you know you get caught going weed you might not even go to jail you're just right the probation you know a little bit of this little bit of that so it's it's changed a lot along the way when I first started breeding my main strain was the GU berry which me and a friend created out of the black berry cush and the ass GUI and we just did it for fun you know for ourselves and then once I started distributing for some cool I got a little more into the breeding and that's when I bred the nine pound hammer and that's that was the first trade ever bred commercially and I it's just I know to you sub words I knocked it out of the park you know it was just an instant hit and it really kind of instantly pushed me into the limelight as a breeder you know and I'm a lot of people were kind of confused like you know who was this jinx proof do you know where the hell did he come from and all of a sudden people know who he is and it was you know I'll do to the hammer tell me the truth by the way man what part of the country you from you don't have to be too specific you don't want to be you a California grower though I mean I know you're up north so I leave an open-ended question man where are you from man no I was actually born in Sacramento that I've been in Seattle since like fourth grade or something like that so I was spending you know 95% of my life here and he says breeder for 10 years you said yeah give or take a few you know so we're like I said before the hammer I did a breeding so I guess maybe 12 years or so much that but yeah doing it strong for about 10 years now so from the start till now how's the attitude changed man I mean I mean I it's been a complete revolution man but how to do how you do how you do business has it completely changed or what not so much really it kind of has when I first started like I said I started as a distributor for sub cool and back then Seattle had coops so I would grab a box full of seeds and I would go from coop the coop and wholesale them to them and they would resell them at retail you know social media wasn't quite as strong then like it is now you know so that's basically how it started but now in Seattle there are no coops they closed it all and there's only recreational stores and you can't sell seeds in a recreational store for when you have to own a recreational garden you can sell them to other recreational Gardens right and not sell them to market once you resell them so you know you know the day they like literally I'm one day they closed all the coops and opened direct and like on that day I lost like 200 accounts so it was a little devastating that was that figure I don't know you know what day was that oh god yeah was recently it's probably maybe two years now or something like that's what's the first gotcha what's up with the process now is a breeder I mean what's your seed outlet I mean you got a connect I guess I say you got to connect with a distributor or retail front or I mean how you know just to help people out there that might be interested in this game well as far as America Miss Rose handles our last she just doesn't excuse me some people messaging her and she mail sales and takes orders as long as the place they're calling from is copacetic and stuff like that I'm gonna want to get any trouble sure and then as far as Europe because we actually have a distributor we just send it to you and he's like a seed broker so to speak and he calls all the seed banks and like redistributed to them you know I don't like a 10% markup so he's pretty much a wholesaler to it he got into attitude and choice seed bank and stuff like that for the European market coos to smell a pack of seeds from here to Europe is just a real pain in the ass and it's not cost-effective better I'm gonna know it's normalizing the business but it's still an interesting world there's a lot of ins and outs that that seed game so genetic preservation kits please the breeding man as far as can you tell us what you're looking for like when you're doing your selection process with breeding has I mean so we asked a lot of breeders this it's always different but like what's you know do you have certain okay these top two traits man ants is what I'm after for what I want to do well - I loved astray and I would love to breed it to something but it's kind of funny I used to be a lot of people don't know this about me but I used to be a professional dog handler I had a show dog myself and I was pretty successful so people started to it what were you like to handle there I gotta ask what breed nice joke I showed American Pitbull actually had a the number one dog in America in 1996 was pointsme was a Grand Champion oh can I consider Moby Joe excitement man yeah but I've had a little kind of dogs from Fox Terriers to American Eskimos so it was a cool but I hooked up with this lady who is the number one pit bull breeder basically in the world you know she has national grand champions and when we were getting ready to breed my dog she taught me that you don't just take to be dog and breed them together and it's very hard thing to do and this is how I do marijuana is you have to be able to fault your plants or your dog sort of speak so you have to be able to look at your plant and say well this is what's not good about it this is what's good about it and like say it's a small yield there maybe you want to find something you know that produces a bigger yield to bump that up right if you have something that's that you love but isn't a hundred percent stable then you've got to find something that's completely stable beyond stable you know to try and bring that Gino so like say you know like with the dogs you know it could be like maybe he's a little elbowed out or maybe it's tails to shore so you have to be able to and a lot of people can't fault their own peril and weed they just don't like doing it you know but there's there's a Fault in every plant well at least something that you'd like to change so to me that's more important to start with and then of course the the plant that you're going to beat it with obviously you want it to be chronic you know that's kind of how I look at it was what I learned in the dog show industry like a lot of mutts are the best dogs so you ever breed like a champion with a mud and get something awesome just sling some [ __ ] against a wall see what sticks man you know I don't a male so basically I did stud service you know i was very very selective with my dog but he only had a few times i mean after we became the number one stockholder in america i mean i got calls all day long but sounds like a good dog life that sounds like it is a life it's a breed your dog doing a bigger dog it's repair its reported on your pedigree so every dog that you have and reports those puppies who became champions who did not know stuff like that thank god man my dog sir certainly did mine you know because you know basically they gets that supermodels to mail my stretch for breeding comes from is that philosophy is being able to fall your plant and then I find a plant that's gonna hopefully relieve that falls yeah when you were breeding the nine pound hammer you know what made you select the Jesus og and you know when select what exactly what traits were you looking for in that plan I was gonna ask that the gooseberry is some of the most chronic weed I've ever smoked like I always joked like the flavor on that week if that we did not get you high I would still smoke it right it's just so very Misha sand just so you know it's so pretty but I definitely wanted something super stable and I wanted to bump up the yield because the gooseberry was not a yield right okay so that was a little bit concerns and you know I just kind of went from there you know I didn't put as much spot into that one is maybe that I would now you know learning what I've learned be because of the success of the mountain hammer I've got surrounded by more people who you know have a lot more experience than I do and got to pick up on their knowledge from from sub-cooled subs old partner dioxide just just all kinds of people and you know we always kind of bang heads and throw ideas back and forth and you know kind of went from there so but yeah I mean that was really it and I just you know I did anything I was gonna breathe it was definitely my goo because I just loved it so much this industry is still man just with like we're gonna have a big meeting today it's gonna be jinxed oxide and sub okay like just the names and it's totally legit don't get me wrong but it's almost like I picture superhero movie but in like Moby do breach I'm in another keep weed yeah that's all I got to say keep it cool what do you think in evolution of breeding has changed the most you know from when you started with the 9 pound hammer to you know what you're working on currently that's kind of a tough one because I mean there's once there's only really so much you can learn about breeding you know what I mean I mean it's it's not as hardcore as people think once you learn the basics and then a few really important things so as far as what it's changed I don't have so tough one for me to answer as far as the breeding there are you know when I started it was a handful of people that were really getting it done right and now it's just thousands of people you know I mean from from companies to just you know farmers that just want to breed their own thing you know I constantly get a little dm's and stuff like that at a shows and stuff people always walk up to me and give me like a pack of seeds that they bread and you know there they might be a company someday some of them are hoping to be a company someday so the main change is the influx ation of how many are doing it now and you know it's tougher than it seems a lot of these guys start people in companies and they're they're gone you know within a few months right rancid said it's more than just reading good weed you know I mean if it's marketing yourself it's you know getting recognized I've been pretty good at marketing myself people seem to enjoy my social media a lot you know I when I go to shows my main thing I don't even bring weed or anything I bring my sees the best you know to a cup anything like that my main goal is to meet all these people that I've been talking to you for years online and you know for me that's that's a lot of fun it is enjoy we have literacy community and I absolutely love hanging out and meeting people going and going to the different shows and hanging out with everybody that is really the payback man God drinks too because they get to connect with a lot of people on a different level besides just weed no cuz I'm you know I'm familiar with like my daily messages and stuff like that and I know but the biggest thing i get at shows is not people coming up and saying i love the night out hammer or this or that and most of them come up and want to thank me for my little videos what i do every day the morning in nightly oh yeah man I seen those shut up van ripztorn man he's like you gotta at least check out this guy's videos man I might make your day a little bit better so yeah that is very cool I'll switch gears snide what's really personal you know some people almost happy really either crying it's nice to personally connect with those besides just you know typing messages because I also get a lot of DMS of people looking for help or you know maybe a PTSD or suffering from depression and I believe it or not I answer every DM I get okay this is just me bowing old man you know I've kind of become this like secret Instagram counselor what's a DM DM direct message communicate my friend thank you I never knew until today about a Snodgrass Bob Snodgrass lifetime achievement award so I'm curious like what is up with that can you tell us about your experience with glassblowing and yeah what is a Bob Snodgrass lifetime achievement award well I wasn't wasn't am a glass blower for years way before I was known for you know reading wheat or anything like that nice um I was I worked in lathe when you see dudes do the little hand pipes it's called lamp work but I prefer to do a lathes work that's kind of my jam and I was doing it pretty strong when I became friends with Bob and if you don't know who Bob is he's the king of glassblowing he's the one who invented fuming and he was one of the first guys to really make glass hang I absolutely he's definitely the grandfather of glassblowing when did you get started when did you get started in glassblowing oh gosh I little over 15 years ago first time I ever saw a glass pipe and it blew me the [ __ ] away man when I was a kid I only ballers that glass pipes like usual but dealer yeah I think I got one I started I used to be a tattooist with my homie derange a lot of people see him on my team stage and uh we had this building we rented the back of it to a head shot in the head shot went out of business so we took it over and kept it running and then a glass blowers have come in everyday trying to sell us product which you know that's all we sold with local glass no imported you know we kind of became friends with those guys catches a few of them and then you'll be actually like a bro coming over and check out the flame and now watch a couple of guys houses and I was just loved it you know I was like man this is for me and I mean this is this is something that's been calling me and I didn't realize it so I went out and bought of torts and then I'm 98% self-taught and I'm pretty proud of that but uh hell yeah anyways back to the story it's a you know obvious I discovered to Bob was and you know actually in this industry Bob's a god and he's the sweetest he's an old dude I want to call my old man but he's definitely in his mid to late 60's and he's old school deadhead and he do - school - and he done so much for the glassblowing community so I used to put on a show here in Seattle called the evening with borrow and then I approached them and I was like well this guy if anybody deserves an award let's give him a Lifetime Achievement Award so I took a giant rod of glass like this thing was probably five inches wide I mean the biggest rod of glass you've ever seen I put it on my lathe and I just got as high as I could and I gathered it up into a giant bowling ball and then my buddy's really good at facets which basically meant we cut it into a giant diamonds and then we put that a diamonds we I got all the guys with big dogs back there and amber Pellegrini by Brian Dozier you know all these guys that were the top glass floors like that I'll donated a sculpture amber Pellegrini actually did a sculpture of Bob and we welded it to all the flat parts of the diamond and then on top of the diamond we made a solid bubbler like it wasn't a functioning Butler just like a sculpture the bow goes well with that on I'm gonna put that on a glass plate with a bunch of engraving and we actually surprised Bob we had no idea so we did it at the show and it was just so cool I'm sure they'll be awesome I'm just visualizing it hell yeah pictures he's so funny because you won't even bring it out to humble he almost didn't bring it cause he just cherishes it so much which is so awesome for me to know that he feels that way about it but yeah it was super cool there wasn't a dry eye on house it worked on you good work because like if you hate Bob you're just an [ __ ] you can't believe anybody there's no way you can't respect her like Bob I mean he's the sweetest coolest guy answer any question and he's just you know there's there's nothing I'm negative about the guy I'm not always a gravitating me towards him so I don't wear how that came about it's more of a lifestyle though you know really is really glassblowing you know breeding and and growing and I mean it's it's six complete life styles and tattoos I love that artist right there you know it's awesome I'm always enjoyed working independently at best yeah you know had plenty of jobs especially when I was younger I mean I'd rather make captain living working for myself and special living you know nearly to a boss every day and you know with cool people and doing the right thing I think about this a lot getting older man y'all got one go around there me and movida were talking about it we actually decided at the end of the conversation then we may have many go arounds on this one I might just be living in Moby Dill's dream like the rest my head on the pillow at night thinking that I did he did good with my day and good good with my life you know and I did think what you do with the philantropy man and what you know whether it's uh you know honor honor and Bob Snodgrass you know an OG glassblower or hanging out and doing what you do with the veterans I but love to shift gears and talk a little bit about that man cuz I got mad respect for you with that yeah they're always served and they're always searching the figures back you know that's why we kind of wanted to see if we can get any info it's hot and not a hot topic to see you know what does there when I say people try it when I try to get people in a cannabis and I click you can't just try once and give up if you're looking for a you can get too high whatever but with vets like what are some of the cannabinoid profiles that you find most effective like is there a certain strain you lean towards all the time I mean everybody's got different symptoms so I'm I'm thinking not but what's your experience with that well it always boils down to the vet because uh you know a lot of this is brought up with PTSD and CBDs but um I find the CBD strains I had Australia did called too many and it was a you know if you're a vet you get it free I don't care you know you can write me letter you cannot show up at the booth you know if you're a vet and show up you get it for free that's awesome and that was my thing that the most feedback I got from that was more for people who had ailments you like like back problems or maybe we got injured while they're in the army or sure attacked or so you say wait you're some your CBD strain with sorry what's the ratio I just want to clarify when somebody says CBD strain now are you saying like there's below 0.3 percent THC in there is it more one-to-one or what makes you call that your CBD strain it was definitely more of a one-to-one okay I call it that because I forget it you know like I call it too many out of respect and hopefully drawing a little more attention to that 22 many foundations who I work with Ally we do events for do but then I also find with some of the other guys the THC strains work better because not so much for the physical element as much as the mental element so it being able to calm down and rationalize and stuff like that so I kind of do both with the too many it's definitely one to one so they can get their medicine but also get their buzz on certain I mean obviously look along with that I'm gonna have a you know I have other strains that aren't dedicated to that but if you're a vet you still get them free you know I mean and they're definitely lower CBD even higher THC and those people tend to report that it helps them calm down usually but actually always indica based you know cuz they're usually looking for something to calm down relax you know sleep good you know not feel aggro and when in certain situations so or to race over the hewa sativa yeah interesting man that is that's cool yeah I've never had a better sativa no I can I'm not a I've read a few subpoenas but I am NOT a sativa person at all period I just I don't and I'm 100% indica so that's good to know it's good to know your own profile some people don't have a clue I mean how even how to get into the scene or what they want to try so I mean that's important and I could take that into the next thing was with autistic children I actually have some friends and Prohibition land that are struggling with you know we got into a conversation when they're out here and they came to what do we need to do move and I was about to say yeah you need to move but you know cuz we're trying to follow the law and they live in fear and you know that's a believe you gave a recommendation as well which I grew harlequin recently and I noticed and my friends that don't even smoke I made him try it doesn't get us high and you're saying I believe my friends that don't even smoke I made them try yes well you're recommending that well that one-to-one also I probably because of those properties in a 1 to 1 for autistic children yes and almost back to the that thing with autistic children I find that THC helps as much as CBDs I think the CBD helps more in the long term but I think like you know when a artistic kid is having a moment you know what I mean what we call them sounds like you know your kids fine and all of a sudden they are melting down freaking out raining maybe even be violent where the THC will take that away so we'll go ahead I don't personally discuss my story a lot just because you know I'm not trying to get in trouble like that of course but the story I do ever see or not but me and or a friend will make it brownies one day because back in the day you could sell brownies of Hempfest is like it wasn't it wasn't them came and it was kinda like Don't Ask Don't Tell yeah blame it on your friend you could make some dough with brownies like it's Jillian that sounds nowadays but uh and we were making brownies and we turned around and this autistic child had taken one had taken a huge bite well I go crap we took the brownie away from them Tim and then I didn't really think much about it and when we noticed about a linear like this kid was baked you know what I mean that we both felt terrible like oh my god that was you know it did not want Yusuf kid baked you're like his eyes are all banned he was obviously just Khurana fine yeah but Linden when that big were off this kid is always what we can industry caught stemming in the autism community which means they're overstimulated like this kid would sit down with a computer and I've had his TV a portable you know DVD player and he would have them all going and almost look clean full you know I mean it's going back and forth like struggling like streaking out of it when we noticed that after the the stone part of the THC we're not we're off to where he was just slightly medicated but he just sat down turned on his computer it was like laughing having a good time watching YouTube I didn't even compare about all the other didn't care about all the other devices so that's when we were telling Oh check this out it's totally helping this little dude like he's not stemming you know he's not melting down he's just chilling you know and the parents just like oh my god because half of their day is fighting those with your kid screaming at you hitting you're spitting on you knocking things over we're like only just chillin oh yeah that's the most people I know they've been medicating him with THC since then just small doses of like RSO oil you know me not enough to get him stoned surfing for that THD to take effect the calming effect yeah main show yeah what you're saying makes sense but the government says there's no medical benefit to cannabis so from you sorry guy sorry pal there's too much money involved pretty soon I will doubt if the entire country is legal but controlled by the government I mean cuz you can't you can't deny the revenue you know I mean they're gonna want that money so I was already patented the process of CBDs and these legal files won't be able to produce DVDs and then we thought of them as I don't I'm no politician but yes I won't be surprised as the entire country is legal but you know absolutely controlled or even grown by the government what was when you talk about I know with autistic children that they get this is my last question on it but when you know you want to solve the not the problem but what's happening quick so we get in the stigma of delivery methods with cannabis you know it's not like you're necessarily can have your childhood a batty I mean maybe you do I mean personally if it's you know yes I don't have a huge issue with that somewhere else if I'm solving a problem and I in your way at Disney World what's going on but you know you wanna you wanna a quick delivery method and it you have recommendations in that area I really don't because there is no quick delivery method without making a child smoke and I'm not gonna make my child smoke because you're still smoking right yeah you're gonna benefit you know smoke on a child's lungs so it's really about prevention about like knowing like well when my son gets home from school he needs a little dose you know yeah you know what at this time does it happen he's a little bit yeah I think is you don't want edible cannabis whether it's oil or cookie whatever it can you know it can take anywhere from you know half hour to two hours you're effective by then your kids on to melt it down and as a parent it is hard to go through meltdowns you just you know you just want to pull your hair out yeah there's times you want to just thank your kid obviously you can't spank away autism just because you're so damn frustrated yeah and so it's really about not waiting till you're already in that situation and finding a regiment that works for you or maybe at being able to see it coming on and time still help them out you know I'm in a regimen it works for you I'm about I just really I want to get in I know there's parents out there that look for this information so I just wanted to cover it and and go from there well I don't what else we're going on here Moby did you have anything that a TRD drew blunt get you know you know jingle what you said my man oh there's a lady named me echo tester Perez and she's on YouTube and Instagram and her job is pretty much marijuana and autism child advocacy I mean she is she's huge she's super smart she's been on Jimmy Fallon Diane so I mean you name it what's her name again show she's doing me a co nicer correct how do you spell in the ACO do you come to um mie K oh okay go on pester and grad school um and she's like basically she works for him or your company but basically they pay her to just answer questions and help kids out when she openly medicates her child legally in California and she's she's the Guru like you know if you send her a letter a question she will answer it and I mean so people out there that you know are having a time I need some kind of guidance check her out she's the queen she's one of my heroes awesome yeah man I love it I love it we're good man oh god Moby you had some men no jinx you know before we let you go you know could you give us what you got coming down the pipeline as far as genetics going and you know what's got you excited you know what are you looking forward to with 2018 and jinx proof genetics are just released a couple new stands straight fire and madcap you can see them on my Instagram underscore jinx proof they have just turned out like ridiculously chronic it's so funny I still kind of questioned myself this are these even real but my big thing that I love to do and it always drove sub nuts when I worked with him was I love to do limited editions where I do a run of something and then I just don't breathe it again you know I have nice things we're in shangri-la go time another time which will always be around sure but I love doing limited editions I've kind of got that collector Jean in me and like a what other tattoo as I collect the tattoo machines and I was running I collect these little dolls all day you know a lot of people in this industry seem to be collector still have kids send me pictures of like their box of seeds there's something about having genetics yeah it's more like baseball cards and I understand that so that you know because of that I do a lot of limited editions which I will not rebreather limit edition I've seen companies limited editions and then they're put out again I'm just like well limited to what mostly sometimes a limited edition might be 5,000 seeds then limited editions were 400 see so that's kind of my deal I definitely have a bunch of limitations coming right now I took a seat no time Kimbo good girl bunch of my strains a fire still on and I bred them all to a really nice Dark Side of the Moon now so that's what we'll be coming down for me next I just dropped them but I don't release anything until I have a chess call them and send them out to like maybe different ten different farmers make sure they're stable crawling acting any problems stuff like that because believe I bred strains and then just thrown them away to you because yeah they won't you know Cobra static so to speak how often is that happen that's how often do I just have to the end of the project I pretty much keep it going just like you go to grow room you know once you drop it down and I'll usually have a you know she's smaller plants like I put in the bedroom get him a little bigger and then the bottom out so that every four to six months no I'm saying how often that on a day if you do intend experiments how often do you gotta throw one away where the guy's a failure this weed sucked he's a twenty percent of the time thirty percent of the time no no so far only one stay true gotcha ok interesting make some educated guesses man all right it's called a hypothesis me then take the heat power social media now you give somebody some good seeds they'll tell five or six people you get yeah where you gonna be hanging soon anywhere they're gonna be out to Colorado or give us a few of are you travelling anywhere soon or we could find you yeah where can we hang brother yeah I'll be at the end o exponent awesome Sasquatch is putting on an events with great madam can I never remember the name something youth I'm on my phones like here let me this asked what event do you have any information on a sasquatch event is hey when you're at Indo man if you need a break don't forget this just look right out front for a black Land Cruiser with the old-school trailer on it that's our Smoke Shack that's that's our that's our podcast smoke shag there will be smoke coming out of it so or seven and I'm sure it will be there both days and feel free to pop in anytime we usually collaborate know Sam and she's always chosen to DGC when he's in town man so I'm sure otherwise yeah I take it easy the events I try not to get too big because uh that's talked to so many people yeah definitely know I follow you there that's how I feel with concentrates man sometimes I've had it ruins some days and I kind of lean away I'm a flower power man flower power don't say Scott it was [ __ ] up at that show I'd done something wrong man dad personally I liked a little bit of bubble hash and some rot and sometimes with them I'm not concentrating just four years ago I became athletic and I just worry with the you know the butane type of product there could be a you're making it worse yeah yeah keeping on that conversation there I bet yeah yeah to go into it but we're gonna wrap it up today and yeah catch you in a couple weeks out here in Colorado then at the end o Expo you guys check out jinx proof genetics out there if you're in Colorado and otherwise appreciate your time hanging out today and really good to learn a lot definitely brother pulled us up saying actually oh sure yeah we're you're kicking for sasquatch no worries if you guys don't want to know you know about where to find jinx brew see what I say you just find the booth with the guy with the cool creative glasses on all it's like the nice the nice signature look some people can have their signature look you know mobis rocking his signature look a little bit right now just a little bit I can take movie out of a crowd that's for sure almost give me a hard time like this one guy look like why do you have glasses with no lenses in them do you have fake contacts - we trying to look like a nerd I would be boyfriend's man why be different and it's funny you know so um once you guys hang out with me a little bit you're like I'm all about the humor sir I'm so the Southwest event is a Saturday February 3rd okay so in Temecula California it's fortunate youth with the banner can remember their name they rock there I would say full-on reggae but definitely got the heavy reggae influenced ice men do-don't would be there in more than a theatre killah priest vehicle Perez the lady I talked about will be there'll be all kinds of raffles in advance and it's just so just a big party but it's not a cup or anything like that so if you just forget any of that you can look on my Instagram page but there's other dance - the thrill the thrill killers and if it's blah blah blah so first thing do this good ranch rampage and there's there or go sasquatches page and check them and so it's a paid event I can't remember what they're charging to get in but every dime will go to to autism fundraiser companies one of those families right this is one I went and then another one down to calculate so shootings raised about $20,000 oh yeah man nice yeah nobody nobody gets paid in our charities you know you can have a non-profit charity and people stood and paid believe it or not the NFL is a nonprofit organization so they don't make a profit okay that means everybody every dollar has to be spent sir Oh Lincoln can

answer them or to the best of my ability I'm happy to take requests I stay away from copyrighted material and I can only play them if I know them but I'm happy to hear what people are interested in you got any questions involving mandolin or music in general love talk about that kind of stuff and yeah this happens every every Saturday on at noon as I said a couple weeks and May I'm gonna be out but I'll let you know you can always come to this link and see when the next one is lined up for it'll tell you right on the screen alright let's see I'll do it farewell I'm gonna catch up with my requests here see if I can keep up with all the requests this town or I've got Canada British Columbia Ohio excellent sorry so we got a request for a farewell try on a great tune in the key of C I'll play a little bit of that one Denise asked when you demo some ideas for jazzing up golden slippers I don't know if you mean like adding jazzy notes or just like kind of filling it in from the bare melody I'll just try to remember it there yes I'll do that for a second and then I'll get to some of these other requests so the bare melody of [Music] yes a lot that can be done with that in terms of double stops you can just hit big G chords in the beginning play to some chords like that do a little bit of melodic variation kind of stuff lots of fun to be had with that tan covering basis is still struggling with holding a pick I think you mention that in the past now I'd say like ultimately stick with it it only gets easier the more time you spend that if you're a basis that has played for years without a pick it's undoubtedly going to feel less natural but I feel maybe similarly unnaturally when I don't have a pick in my hands so to each their own but that med said you know also if you if you really feel like there's something that's just not clicking you can look into getting just like a one time lesson from somebody in your area or somebody on line and you know see if they can I'd say in person if you can because it's such a physical question that you have see if they can't point in the right direction alright so liberty rock the cradle Jo I can't remember out to Kate cradled you off the top of my head right now no I played it Giga slurs free little bird oh I don't but Bruce Muskies been doing that great if you haven't heard Bruce mol ski is very gonna free a little bird go check that out that's a good one huh Liberty was once considered for the American national anthem glads got real cool you've been working on that one Paul glad to hear it big Scioto Wow somebody requests this way I'm not gonna be able to get there all these is Red Wing on my website it is it also might be under the alternate title the Union made but I think it's under it Redwing first it's not I spell it with two words but you can go back and forth so it's in there if you look it up by alphabetically you should be able to find it in there Redwing is in the key of G but it's got some big C chords in it so yeah the a part starts on a G chord [Music] so it's got some some big ceeze nice little major to court opportunity Jones says I'm struggling with playing in the key of a especially moving back from E to a yeah that's um totally not uncommon its lightest you know I think one thing to keep in mind especially sounds like you might may be working either on chopped cords or kind of these bar chord shapes that you know it is some of those are kind of large leaps like going from that e back to a but once you get that down you know stick with it the more you do it the easier to become in a month you'll if you you know if you work on just kind of getting through like working your way around those chord changes in the cat kiya a for a month it'll be two hundred times easier than it is today mom and what's nice is once you get those chopped chords down was kind of closed position shapes where there's heaviest bar or this chop then all the other keys come out so much easier when you're playing chords because you just know you want to be a b-flat you just move up you uh you don't need to learn a lot of new skills to play in new keys but the first one which is often the kiya a is the hardest California upstate New York awesome another request for liberty awesome I gotta remember how that one goes do I know any Irish drinking songs not off the top of my head I'm not too up on Irish songs in general but maybe somebody here can point you in that direction I bet a good google google search could bring up some nice Irish tooth songs do I ever play mandolin or octave mandolin fingerstyle I know not a whole lot a little bit not really mandolin like sometimes I'll just noodle around but mandolin is really not that well suited because the strain tension is so high and there there's just not a lot of give to the strings to play finger style but it can be done it'd be interesting to hear mandolin played with finger picks an octave mandolin I'd do a little bit but not not a whole lot but occasionally it see it's easier on an octave mandolin because they're just more flex in the strings and it feels a little more like a guitar a little more natural do you suggest learning the chords first and then adding the picking um I would you know I'd say whatever you are most excited about learning that you know if you if you got into the mandolin to uh you know to sing songs and play chords behind the songs you're singing by all means like learn some chords and then once you start sort of either they're getting tired of learning chords and looking for a change or you hear a song you really want to learn the the melody too at that point jump into into melody but you know the great thing about the mandolin is it's well suited to to playing chords or to playing melody so whichever one is you're most excited about go for that I started with melody primarily and then at some point realized I didn't really know anything about chords so I had to kind of go back and teach myself a lot about chords when I was getting going because I had learned a couple dozen tunes and realized I didn't know how to play the chords to any of them oh and I think that's sort of a natural progression of you'll learn a lot about one thing and then realize like oh I don't know anything about this over here then you'll learn a lot about that and you say well no no more about that and the first thing and it sort of it's not a steady progression up where you just kind of ups and downs but with the general upward trend oh that's a good idea recovering bassist said it would be fun if you taught a particular song live some week yeah that would be fun I will think about that it wouldn't be quite as streamlined as well I could I could probably just sort of pretend I was sitting down in front of a in front of the camera for to like make normal tune lessons yeah think about that do you think it's necessary to learn to read music again it depends this is from Connell it depends if you want to play fiddle tunes which is really an oral tradition you know it's passed on from you know you somebody plays a melody and you play it back [Music] there's no need to know how to read music to do that if you want to get it tomorrow like classical music or jazz reading music is gonna be more helpful it's a great skill to have but that said it's not a necessary skill there's amazing musicians who play all kinds of great music that don't read a note of music if you do want to learn music I recommend learning to read standard notation rather than tablature temperature can be helpful and I know I'm not saying don't learn tablature but standard notation is so much more useful because you can read it whether you're playing mandolin or guitar flute or singing but if you read mandolin tablature and you give it to a flute player they can't do anything with it a guy I know has a metal into luckily like a ukulele that's interesting any opinion on that or alternative alternate tunings in general I have a whole lesson on alternate tunings or cross tunings it's on my website in the technique and fundamentals section I go through a bunch I don't go through that ukulele doing I've never heard of anyone doing that but that's cool might not really kind of play to the strengths of fiddle tunes but you know as long as they're having fun and making good music on it nothing around there when you chop do you use very little pick I use I don't really think about it too much I'd say experiment you know like hold the pic way out here and try to chop and hold it way down here I would say it kind of in the middle but you know just experiment with it see what sounds and feels best to you all right I got it looks like I got to get get on to Liberty I've got all kinds of requests for that one I gotta go look it up cuz I'm scattered enough that I can't remember how it goes but that's why I can look at my website now what does it seem okay yeah that one all right here we go [Music] [Music] [Music] there it is Liberty took me a while to get it back in my head but that's a great one a classic one highly recommend learning that one is it's a one that a lot of people are gonna know in the old-time tradition cool glad glad you enjoyed that Peggy let me just take a quick glance back through the chat make sure I'm not missing anything I'll play I'll go back through Raya I know there was a request for farewell try on back there somewhere play a little bit of that great tune in the key of C old-time tune [Music] so there's a little bit of a farewell trial great three-part tune that one's on my website if you want to learn it it's also on I have an old-time mandolin album called old-time mandolin it's uh in the shop section of my website you can stream it there and download it if you want along with a bunch of other old-time tunes put that out last winter not a couple months ago but a year in a couple months cool well there's a bunch of new people since last time I sort of said hello to everybody so welcome if you're just getting here it looks like there's around fifty people now thank you all for joining in I do this every week on Saturdays at noon Eastern Standard Time I'm happy to field questions if anyone has any mandolin related questions or music related questions I love hearing what people are working on happy to take requests so I avoid copyrighted material and I can only play requests if I know them but I'll do my best run back up here and see if I can find another request but keep the keep the chat going it's a lot of good stuff in there or if I missed a request from earlier just slur is cheap requested Giga slurs great tuned for part 2 n-- on my website sounds like this [Music] there's the slurs again that great Irish tune requested by chip one of the first tunes I ever learned really because it was a friend family friend of mine or a family band put out put out an album with that on it that immediately caught my ear it's on my website it's a great four part tune first two parts are in the key of D second two parts are there parts three and four are in the key of G it's a great tune to practice a couple things practicing you're down up down down up down pick direction [Music] it's good especially in that a part also getting your triplets gone Mike's got a good question is there a basic sort of formula for figuring out adding a double stop when they aren't shown in notation yeah so there's a couple I have a whole series on adding double stops to your playing on my website mando lessons calm and it's in the technique in fundamentals section on near near the bottom of the page near the bottom of the technique fundamentals page um but uh you know it kind of goes through a couple steps of trying adjacent kind of open drone strings to putting some fingers down to sort of thinking through the tune in terms of what chord is happening on top of the melody so check those out I won't go over it all right now but also in terms of like timing when you hear a tune and you sort of like oh I want a double stop where do I wear it where in the tune do I put them often a good spot to put them is when you see a chord written above the tune in the tablature or it's like on at the beginning of a measure so you know often double stops can be very rhythmic in tunes so with a shove that pigs foot which I played at the beginning you can really [Music] so you really get these like strong dude um sort of when you're often if you're tapping your foot along with the tune that's a nice spot to add in a double stop that'll sort of carry you through a couple phrases and then you can drop another double stop and then if you get into sort of more bluegrass style double stops that's uh that's more of kind of working out a chord shape often that that chap chord or the bar chord shape Sean says he's got a couple of ukuleles that were giving him given to him that's cool and to just think about trying to tune one up ji Dae so you can have it like a little backpack mandolin that's cool I've seen people do that that's a very cool sound it's nice mellow nylon nylon string sound it's hard to add more notes to tunes that are already you know it's hard to add more notes into that but if you have a really nice slow tune [Music] you can adults sorts of things into kind of play around with that melody do I know jazz music a little bit I studied jazz in college which certainly kind of has influenced my playing over the years that said I haven't really played a whole lot of jazz since getting out of college so it's been 10 years and I don't I'm not as fluent as I used to be I can barely barely hold on at this point pretty much just play tunes now and folk music hello from quarter week were toriko and from New Jersey awesome thanks for joining us I should write the skate boat song now when playing in the key of a what's a good turnaround lick when going into an E chord oh that's a great question I'll make up a little progression here and see what pops out is from the pelican so there's if you're going for 205 so whatever you're doing over your 4 chord your D chord you can just slide up two frets often chromatically and you get that nice but if you're going from an a [Music] you do something like this so we have a seven and five on the a E strings when you're grabbing that eighth fret on the E string with your pinky and then this little kind of sliding movement so you have first to second fret on your a string and then fourth fret on your E string so so far we have and then you can do some to end your a chord something like that opportunities are endless but that's kind of one idea I think you know taking those little moments and sort of doing what I just did of like slowing it down trying a bunch of stuff it didn't work and then settling on something that's like oh that that works kind of nice and then maybe work it out in a couple different keys take a nice take your favorite lick from a different key and that sort of same change and see if you can you can transpose it into the key you're looking for all right yellow rose farm is here I love from Maine recovery said I've learned old slewfoot you ever played it I I know the tune I I've probably played played it at some point but not in years it's a good one though all right Jason enough to head off thanks for joining us if anyone either can't make the whole thing or misses a week or just wants to watch it after the fact they're always archived so you can find them this is you know this is number what is this 17 this is the 17th one of these I've done that's great should keep you busy for a while if you watch you could watch 17 hours of these after today yeah they're always archived so you can come back later on and see what see what's see what you missed uncle Bobby's is still working on mandolin chord changes but then I got sidetracked when I got my harmony tenor all right tenor guitar that's great I was here a lot of fun I love tenor guitars Road to Columbus I can't remember that one off the top of my head that's one that I should I don't know if that's a traditional tune or not I think it might be traditional it so it goes up the neck a little bit I think keya a can't quite remember how it goes right now but uh that's a good why should look into doing that I'll write that one down make a little note here okay let's see requests for Wayfaring Stranger sure columbus stockade blues don't know that one all right I'll do a little Wayfaring Stranger and get back to throw these questions [Music] [Applause] [Music] my little Wayfaring Stranger a little rusty how does the key of G minor there's a great version of that tune on the Sam Bush and David Grisman duo album that's just totally totally a that's the one to know in my opinion they do really really nice arrangement of that tune the album is called hold on I'm strumming Steve asks what software do you use when recording your mandolin website play along tracks I just use GarageBand on my computer till I've got a Mac I've also used in the past audacity which is works for either either platform Mac or PC it's free it's a great program I've played around a little bit with Reaper which is an open-source I think yeah I think it's open-source but it's a it's a inexpensive audio recording software but I haven't spent a whole lot of time with oh wow there's all kinds of super chests flowing in here thank you so much Road okay cool key of e38 thank for the donation thanks for the great lessons and points out the road to Columbus is a Bill Monroe - cool that's good to know so probably can't make a lesson on that one but it is a great tune so I'm sure there's also tabs out there if you're at a breeder and there might be somebody out there that just teaches it like idea it's a fairly common tune or just find your favorite recording and slow it down you can use my favorite website tune transcriber dot-com where you can upload any mp3 or load-in any YouTube video and slow it down and make loops it's great website totally free andrew's gotta run gotta catch the rest later thanks for joining us as always thanks again as always for the the parting donation appreciate it um yeah you have played around with a little bit of a a couple different programs but I kind of always get stuck in a rut and just go back to - GarageBand and in terms of the mic I was using was the mic I used for this live cast normally which is an audio technica us like plug in USB I don't know it's like a 10 10 or something USB looks like see if I can sneak it oh there's not working right now but it's this one oops it's in a little harness here shockmount let's call it but it stopped working five minutes before the video started so I gotta get another one of those I mean it's less tits it's like 10 years old and I've used it hard for that amount of time so it's like $100 all right I like money it's not a super expensive thing little bum that it that it busted but uh I guess I I got I got good use out of it if you think of it on a daily a daily usage rate you know I think I got my money's worth it's a good mic and then so yeah alright now I'm just using a little road like mic on top of my camera then I might go so I'll listen back to this and see how it compares to the one that mics a little closer but we'll see oh but I wouldn't use that for play long tracks I don't know what I gotta make some more play along tracks and maybe just got to buy that mic again right now right after this how do you grid a great question okay I've missed a bunch of stuff here requests for Tamlyn I can do that Uncle Bobby says you're a bad influence I know I also I've got a tenor guitar problem myself they're just an instrument problem in general all the time by Bill Monroe also co-written by [Music] Pete Peter Rowan great song copyrighted so I can't do it unfortunately any chance of a slip jig butterfly fig for a kiss I shouldn't make a lesson for a fig for a kiss the camera ever how it goes off the top of my head yeah I'll play slip jig recovering bassist says how do you build up speed without adding slop great question um a little bit at a time I think is the the answer that's worked best for me you know I think so there's a couple things one thing that I probably said over and over and you've heard from me a million times is like play slow in order to learn to play fast which I think there's a lot of truth in that like playing slow really highlights your weaknesses and makes you fix things on a fundamental level that's really helpful and important also when you do speed when you do work on speeding up use a metronome you know figure out like okay I can do this at 90 beats per minute but then if I try to go to 95 I start losing it and just go up like two beats at a time and really focus on staying nice and clean Thank You Uncle Bobby for the super Chad donation I appreciate it but also I think one thing that's that's helpful to do every once in a while is really just push yourself to play too fast it'll it'll come out sloppy you'll hit tons of wrong notes it won't sound good but what it does is it it forces your right hand and left hand and you're sort of hand-eye coordination and coordination to just sort of get a physical sense of what that feels like to be going like way too fast super sloppy no really couldn't even hear a melody in there but uh but it you know it it is a little bit of time working with my hands just to like how fast can these things go and then you know it's not gonna create much in the way of good musical art but it is an important part of the process of this like pushing way beyond your boundaries you know don't push a little bit in that circumstance just like go for it play fast do that every once in a while don't hurt yourself don't do it for a long time but it does give you that uh that feeling of like this is what it feels like to play really fast even if I can't do it cleanly at this point so kind of combining all those things can be helpful when you and I were young Maggie a great song that I do not know how it goes off the top of my head unfortunately I gotta I'm always bad with your your bluegrass requests unfortunately I'll do us right so yeah I'm gonna add that to my list because it's a great tune thing for a kiss [Music] but I'll play a slip jig now one of my favorite slip jigs is the fair-haired Canada or kind of bum Bona something like that in Irish in the key of G sounds like this [Music] yeah clammed up that last little phrase there but that was a the fair-haired can ovens and then the butterfly both great slip jigs both which are on my website pelican says you have very good memory of the melodies for the songs you do sometimes sometimes I can't remember tunes like soldiers joy or Angeline the baker so feel like hit or miss but there's a lot of them in there it's just a question of whether I can get to them or not yeah so both of those tunes are on my website the first one is the fair-haired Canada's I'll just make sure that's on my website I'm pretty sure it is yes do I have any other I think I have some other slip jigs let's find out so yeah the four slip jigs I currently have on the website are the butterfly maybe the most popular slip jig then at least around here fair-haired can Ovens the fox hunter slip jig which is sometimes a four part tune sometimes a two part tune I did the two part version the four part tune has come to a lot of the same ideas just up at the octave and this kid on the mountain which is a five part slip jig which is a very cool tune but it's got a lot of parts to remember cool oh those are great tunes the gobby-o is one I haven't thought about in a long time Jefferson and Liberty I can't remember either of those tunes off the top of my head those are ones that I've played along with especially for contra dances around here people love playing those ones yeah uh Sean says they always have the butterfly weirdly yeah me too I totally yes it's kind of [Music] it's how I always ended there's like no real good way to ended because that third part is in the key of G or it has a G chord anyway you can in there see you can it's gonna end kind of unresolved sounding regardless but I think that's where I am most people tend to play that the cuckoo there's a bunch of cuckoos I'll play one of these out [Music] he's a little bit of a a version of the cuckoo that's got a lot of different versions Irish tune originally but then it also got picked that's more of kind of an old-time version that I played there John Hartford does it a lot of people do that one great tune though I should add that to the list oh the same are those the same team cool I'm just catching up with Mike's comment that the gobby-o and Jefferson Liberty are the same team cool they might they've I'll take your word for it cool thanks Jeremy I'm glad you're enjoying the website I'm happy too happy to share and it's fun doing all this stuff all right why should get on the road here but uh thank you all so much for tuning in it is whiskey in the jar' on my website or is it copyrighted I actually don't think it's a copyrighted song I think it's old enough all right that's a good question I don't have it on my website I think it's on my list I need to look into the copyright situation on that one but a good song so yeah thank you all so much again every week I think I'll be here next week let me just check and make sure so I'm not leading you astray yeah yeah I'll be here next week most most Saturdays at noon Eastern Standard again if you need to watch this in the future you can find it it's kind of archived on my youtube channel I'll get them on my website at some point but at this point it's easiest to find them on the YouTube channel so yeah thank you all for tuning", "1IDGzHKHtVk": "tornado how to play guitar rag

welcome to another episode of another week of mando lessons live looks like we got people coming in once again from all over the world glad to see you we got Oregon Charlotte West Virginia Michigan more Michigan Minnesota California Massachusetts Yorkshire London good to see you all here all right seems like things are working thank you everybody for joining I'm seeing lots of familiar faces and some new ones as well I think but yeah if you haven't been here before this is just an hour for you all to ask any questions you might have I'm happy to play some tunes answer anything you've been wondering about music and mandolins and all that kind of stuff have a lot of fun in the process all right look at all this Russia Ohio China that's grass a new one for me I think China might be first the least of people that have shouted out from Canada anyway so welcome Japan Oklahoma oh this is so good thank you all so much for being here James asks for a request for going to California I think you mean the Led Zeppelin song which I am NOT gonna do cuz I copyright reasons I've been getting all kinds of crazy copyright things going on and I'm brightening up the screen the Sun just went behind the clouds I'm just gonna do a little bit of this real quick brighten things up a notch but uh yeah I've been having none of traditional tunes end up getting tags I'm gonna steer clear copyrighted stuff like Zeppelin but what I will do is I'll play a great tune called off to California which is a Irish - yeah it's an Irishman called off to California the grave I'm I might be on my website I can't remember if not it's a good one to know it's a somewhat common tune at least around here in New England but I think it's kind of well-known and I the world of Irish traditional music cool we got Sean is in a field at a festival in the South of England that's very cool hope you're getting to play lots of music Alabama okay so yeah so James saying there's a fiddle team right any of me yeah there's a couple tunes there's a couple times there's an old-time tune may be called going I get on like California teens mixed up there's there's one that I'll play that's coming up to the top of my head and then there's another tune that I can't remember it's in a it's an old-time tune but uh I'll play the off to California that I know which is an Irish tune a little more catch up with the chant actually maybe what I'll do here I've had some questions in the past about play tenor banjos so I figured I'd pull out my carry banjo maybe hopefully not kind of loud instrument now keep an eye on the audio levels for anyone who's interested tenor banjos are cool for strings tuned an octave lower than a mandolin easy to hear in Irish sessions used a lot in Irish music and I've had some I know there's some people who play tenor banjo so I figured I'd pull that out this week and play a little bit this would be a good team to do on it off to California [Music] [Music] there it is off to California on the tender banjo tune like a mandolin just an octave lower gonna catch up with the chat here I saw some questions fly in that I'm happy to answer see great to see all you here almost 50 people that's great see requests for Liberty yeah I can play the Liberty as long as I can remember how it goes oh cool that's the one you meant James glad I could do it hello from Nashville awesome thanks for joining us alright Mack says can you show us how to play tremolo I can play on two strings but when I play it on three gets harder and strained yeah so that definitely takes some [Music] so I think that's sort of what you're talking about getting that nice big crema low in general it's sort of that nice rolling sound and I think the trick I have a lesson on my website on how to play and I would recommend what it sounds like you've got it under your fingers at least and kind of into your muscle memory for one in two strings which is grass totally the place to start getting that feeling into your right hand takes some getting used to but so there's if you're new to tremolo and haven't played and haven't gotten one string down that's definitely the place to start and watch that video on my website and if you're trying to expand that out to multiple strings if you've got to you've got the right idea and what it all it is is about maintaining that nice fluid kind of speedy up-and-down motion but just widening out kind of the path that your right hand is [Music] and I think you know starting I think maybe starting with one string let's do this let's take a G chord if anyone's got their mandolins handy let's start just on the highest string so the the e-string I'm a third fret with our G chord get a nice tremolo going and then widen it out to have the G and sorry the e string on the third fret and the a string on the second fret sounds like this we're gonna widen it out again with the open D string [Music] then the open g string as well so there's a couple thing I'm noticing this is a great question because I haven't really thought about this question a whole lot one thing I'm noticing is when I'm playing three and four strings often I'm giving little sections like maybe two string sections more attention and kind of going back and forth between [Music] because as you widen out your hand it does get harder and harder to maintain that speed that you need to get that sound but if you if you listen to what I'm doing you can sort of kind of pan around through the strings [Music] so I'm not always going I think you know that's silly good to practice as well and working towards that you know just take everything nice and slow see how slow you can play tremolo without and still maintaining that sort of sound and not sort of turning into but also just experiment with you know hitting those high strings and then coming down to the low strings and those low strings will ring out as you go so I think that's one thing to work on is get get a couple strings going and then add in another string just for a little bit and then come back to your higher strings and it really just takes time if you've gotten through one and two strings just keep working on three and four and they'll they'll do only get easier as it goes great question though hello from Michigan awesome Germany Dueling Banjos that's a that's another unfortunately copyright copyrighted one but I'm sure there's tablature out there if you're at a breeder I'm sure there's tons it's a popular enough to that I bet you can find it out there I'm on the Google or look it up on mandolin cafe a lot of this stuff that if I say oh I can't do that because of copyright take a look on mandolin cafe see if anyone over there has has tabbed it out or has a lesson on it or can explain how they how they do it there's lots of people who know a lot more tunes and songs than I do over there so if I can't help you mandolin cafe can be a big help that's where I go and I have questions just gonna catch up with the chat here okay recovering bassist says what do you recommend for pinkie stretching exercises one thing that helped me a lot with pinkie exercises is there's a website called Jasmine dough comm that has some some sort of practice PDFs called FF CP which stands for forefinger closed position and it runs you through all these scale these closed position scales [Music] and then scale exercises and so checking that out on Jasmine dough.com FF CPI I've got a couple lessons on my website about that in the technique and fundamental section I'm about those close close scale positions and those really give because there's no open strings it really gives your pinky a workout you're using your pinky almost as much as all your other fingers and really spending a lot of time using your pinky a lot will help you you know in a lot of traditional music you know Irish tunes old-time Tunes there's not a whole lot of pinky workout but it's good to spend a lot of time working on your pinky so that when you use it it's not gonna feel unnatural so that that's that that's sort of a short answer is check out Jaz mando and run through some of those PDFs they're they're really pinky intensive you know don't don't do it for hours and hours because you'll just stress out your hands but do it for five minutes shake out do something else come back and do it do it a little longer what fiddle tunes Martin Zell says what fiddle tunes are best for beginners in jams if you go to my website mando lessons comm there's a you can sort the tunes over there the fiddle tunes by by difficulty level and you can I've got a whole couple dozen beginner Tunes that at least in my area and the places that visited have been very commonly known tunes so I'd recommend checking those out it's going to depend on the genre whether you're playing Irish music your old-time music or a mix it's gonna depend on your geographic location it depends on you know I'm up in New England if you're out west it might be a little bit different if you're in Ireland if you're in England or another country it's gonna the the tune repertoire is gonna be a little different but I try to pick tunes that are fairly well known around the world on my website so just sort the the tuesd of my website by difficulty and look at those beginner tunes and also look at some of the intermediate ones as well there's there's no real hard line between beginner and intermediate and advanced a lot of it has to do with familiarity so if you play a bunch of old-time Tunes and maybe you know you know a bunch of intermediate to advanced old-time tunes and then you try to play an Irish tune it's a different feeling so you might need to go back look at some of the beginner Tunes so so look in the beginner and intermediate section of my website and that should that should give you plenty to work with andrew says do you remember what song you played at the beginning yes I played up I usually try to say that I played Billy in the low Graham sounds like this wow great tune gets played in old-time and bluegrass circles it's uh if you haven't heard I have an old-time album just called solo man oh it's called old-time mandolin it's on Bandcamp you can find it through my website through the the store shop page I forget what it's called it's also on my website if you on mandalas calm if you want to learn it [Music] recovering bassist says playing along with you my instructor really wants me practicing chopped chords yeah chop chords can be really helpful especially if you're gearing towards playing bluegrass it's good to just spend the hours and totally you know play along with everything you can just to to get those shapes and changes and under your fingers it's a great thing to do alright Jeff's been playing soldiers joy glad to hear it James says I saw a great jazz tenor banjo player recently seems to be popular instrument yeah a lot of those tenor banjo players will do this or that I don't play this sort of chord melody I'm just I don't play that style but I know you mean it's a great sound tae 1000 yes Dee says when do you applied tremolo to tunes if you have a slow one when do you play tremolo and when do you play a single notes so I tend I don't tend to use a whole lot of tremolo in my in my playing when I do add it is 99% of the time on slow tunes like you said and within those slow Tunes often I'll play eighth notes or short notes in the tune so if you have a tune that goes something let's see what's a good tune so maybe your maybe your bass melody I'll just make something up because I can't pull anything into my head maybe your bass melody goes like this [Music] do you have short short short short long short short alone so you have those eighth notes and then quarter or longer notes I think this would be I don't know what those longer notes are off the top of my head but take those longer longer notes in the tune and use tremolo on those or you can you can try adding it to the short notes as well things like that but just play around with it you'll find that the longer notes give you more space to really let that tremolo ring out a little bit versus the short notes if you try to tremolo over all the short notes it starts getting a little muddy you don't get that defined beat as much okay so Alex CHR says can you give me some finger exercises that might help with moving around the fret I assume you mean like around the fret board up and down I would again refer you to jazz mando comm and those F FCP exercises on their websites free PDFs it's super useful Martin also says to that answer check out Bill Monroe there's your answer yeah bill bill is great learned some stuff from Bill Monroe especially in the kind of if you're looking to move around the fretboard in more of a bluegrass context bill would do a lot of stuff out of kind of chord shapes so if you know your chopped chords [Music] nothing in particular but you know he would use those chop shapes and pick out little melodies within there so watch them Bill Monroe up that's the kind of sound you're after how tight oh my chat just jumped but uh where is that how tight are you holding the pic not very tight whether I'm playing melody or tremolo I might I might grip it a little harder for tremolo but what I always tell my students is if you drop the pick you get extra points because if you're really clamped down on the pick it'll sound you're the sound will come out really kind of stiff and versus nice loose when I'm when I'm playing and my pick goes through the strings I'll try to do this you know if my picks coming down to the string if you were watching it side on it would do this where it's kind of going along it hits the string and it gets that resistance it's kind of bends back with the string and then it gives the string a little kick at the end but that only works if you're if you're nice and loose so it can actually Bend in that that space that you're holding the pick and if you're really clamped down you'll get like it'll hit the string and stop and then chunk through verses getting a nice rolling action over the strings and that goes for melody picking chords Thank You Victor nice looking haircut yeah it was springtime here so it's time to get a haircut and clean up the beard but then we got a couple inches of snow last night so it's a little pre-emptive cool James Eppie from Austin's has been working on win the Shakes the barley it's a great classic Irish tune it's a good one to know glad you're working through it yes Robert says a tightly held pic will snag loose is correct I agree with that although there are probably exceptions to the rule cool the fans here after a couple busy months glad you can join us prickly thorn but sweetly warned by the White Stripes I am NOT doing any copyrighted material unfortunately that's will get me in trouble with YouTube but I appreciate the suggestion looking that sort of stuff up on Google can often yield some results also mandolin cafe can often find you what you're looking for if you're looking to learn those songs Alex CHR I hope I'm saying your screen name right says can you suggest some different strumming techniques yeah so I have actually a series on my website that I'll point you to rather than going to in-depth with this in the technique and fundamental section I have a whole strum pattern series I go through a couple things from [Music] this sort of what I call the guitar strum or folks from - a bluegrass drown - - more of kind of an Irish I can't effortlessly slide into this but more of kind of an Irish moving [Music] sound other cross picking that sort of sound I do I go through a bunch of those in the strum pattern series in the technique in fundamental section of my website mando lessons that come ah good question Steven says I can't recall if you have a lesson but how about a little bit of John Hardy that's a great tune now it's one I don't have like a real nailed down melody for I think of it more of as a song I know it's kind of a tunes a lot of banjo players [Music] something like that it's a not not some something I can really do a whole lot with I tend to play that tune mores in the context of a song with a little break here and there and just try to stick to the melody for the most part cool thank you Andrew thanks for joining us thanks so much as always for the super chat it's much appreciated appreciate the donation and thanks for thanks for joining and glad you can watch it later on for anyone that doesn't know if you can't make the whole thing or you can't make some week you can always watch these later on they're archived just on my youtube channel so you can watch them in the future if you if you don't have time now catch up with the chatting this is great tons of tons of questions I'm glad to see all this [Music] Victor says speaking of strumming what strum pattern would you use for Wayfaring Stranger followed the lesson but singing and picking is hard love to strum and sing and pick the rest without singing yeah so with with Wayfaring Stranger I would use a kind of what I call the guitar pattern strums I think in my lesson I did it in E minor I play it in a couple different keys but I think I didn't Imai nur for the lesson so I would do something like [Music] cetera so that's pretty much just the folk strum and then from there so nothing you know especially with songs slower especially slower stuff like that I really just stick to kind of the you can think of it as kind of boom chuck or guitar strum bass and strong you know alternate that bass I go through some of that in the beginner series on my website some of the basic guitar strumming patterns but also in that the strum pattern series michael says am I the only one who finds memorizing all the various arpeggios and scales tough suggestions um you are I'll say off the top all right right off the bat you know you're not the only one I'm not particularly good with that stuff myself I think it depends on what um what kind of music you play what you find to be fun as a musician I think you know for myself I tend to only practice what I use and what I find myself lacking in ability so at this point in my life I don't play a whole lot in like a flat I rarely play in the key of B b-flat sometimes but you know D flat E flat kind of weird Keys I don't play as much I used to play some jazz and I'd run into those keys then but at this point I pretty much just play fiddle tunes occasional song here and there but I think for the most part I'm not in a position where I'm called on to play in weird keys and if I am I often am NOT playing mandolin I'm playing guitar tenor guitar where I'm capo Eng to match a singer so I don't tend to practice things that I don't you that said you know if you're if you're working up to being a like a fluent jazz musician and you want to know how to play in the key of E flat and knowing all your E flat arpeggios all that stuff that I can't really keep up with anymore myself that's totally worth while by all means stick with it probably look up some jazz resources but if you're a if you're looking to be a like a bluegrass musician you know occasionally you'll need to play in e-flat but not for the most part if you want to just play fiddle tunes you rarely are gonna need to play an E flat I'd say cross that bridge when when you come to it I I find that you know in the past when I've practiced scales and arpeggios I've sort of practiced them for their own sake which hasn't been particularly rewarding to me because I'll practice you know getting arpeggios and all the keys but then I never use it in a musical context and again this is just my experience so I sort of stopped practicing that stuff because I'm not called on to play it I don't I don't play music that requires it and I think I can better spend my time learning to play more tunes or learning a new instrument or learning a new style of accompaniment or learning something new off of a record learning a solo off of a record things like that it's the same sort of with learning to play faster I've gotten to the point where I can play at the speeds that I need to play for dancers and for sort of the context in which I play I can't play at 150 beats per minute but I never need to so I don't feel like really feel the need to practice getting faster at this point so that's maybe if you're finding yourself sort of practicing something because you think you need to know how to do it and you're enjoying it that's great and it's great to gain those new skills but also don't don't beat the process to death just because you feel like you should know how to do something that you're never really finding yourself using that's my opinion and what I ultimately have if you can maximize the amount of fun you're having and the amount of time you can spend playing music with other people and kind of doing the important parts of music that's that's the important thing to do but that said I don't I don't know in terms of techniques to memorize scales and arpeggios again the FF CP which I've mentioned a couple times already cuz it's just a great multi-purpose resource jazzman dough.com look up the FF CP PDFs and work through those they go through a bunch of arpeggios a bunch of closed position scales that's gonna be your ticket I think but other people here might as well might also have some resources for you Andrew says B flat chord is hard so I don't know there's a couple B flats you can go for this is one that pops into my head is three three five six you might know this a chord two two four five move it up one fret you can also do this chop chord I think what it's gonna require is learning to play either this Barre chord I've got a lesson on my website it's called learn to play every major in minor chord and I go over how to play this sort of shape move around the fretboard and also I've got lessons on my website on chop chords but I say perseverance is a big thing you know when you first encounter a new chord it's gonna be awkward to get into it even you know I have to I've been playing for eighteen years now and when I learn a new chord shape that I haven't put my fingers in before it's always awkward because we get so used to playing the ones we play over and over again and when you reach a new chord you just like find out figure out a way to play that chord a lot that's that's remember my advice anyway recovering bassist says how do you play chords and be sort of same answer you can play them here four four six seven or you can do the chop chord with your pointer finger at the seventh fret but check out those those lessons I just mentioned on a more in-depth answer to that question Ryan asks do I have any F style mandolins and advice for me with my F style I don't know I don't know any F style mandolins I don't quite know you mean by advice I've just always owned A's because they're kind of less expensive for the kind of similar model but F styles are great I've played a lot of F styles that I've loved but mostly just have this mandolin and they an old Gibson oval hole also a style but nothing against F Styles they're beautiful instruments cool Justin just arrived glad to have you here Jason asked what thickness picks are you using it looks to be pretty flexible when you just showed it on our finger so I use a pretty thick pick it's a 1.5 millimeter so it's fairly thick I think that what I was sort of trying to say is my fingers move to let the pick flex you can sort of see my thumb and forefinger spreading apart when it hits my pointer finger of the other hand which would be the string the tech moves versus something like this which is what I use on tenor banjo it's a 0.6 millimeter and that you can actually you can bend these quite a bit more bendy but for mandolin I use thicker picks but Trott try a little bit of everything see what I always say picks are a nice inexpensive way to try out a bunch of different thicknesses and see what feels and sounds best to you you can get into expensive picks and they're great picks but there's a lot out there that you can find for picks they cost under a dollar under two dollars um better you got a lot of choices out there if you spend five dollars on a handful of picks it's a good way to have a couple different options under your fingers david says I bought a collar tenor guitar leaving it in CJD a tuning great addition to mandolin experience yeah those are cool interests played one but and I really enjoyed it but I haven't played a whole lot of them but yeah cg da is a great tuning to have mandola tuning I've got a mandola that's a lot of fun to play I wish I had more opportunities to play it oh I think I jumped down some here try to see you Oh a little bit of Barlow knife I love that tune I'll play a little bit of Barlow knife I'm gonna just catch up with the check here while I can trying to get errors and slow marches under my fingers awesome arthritis in my fret fingers after trying to play chord melody any solutions I would say just you know take it slow do lots of stretches don't don't overwork yourself I've had my fair share of kind of muscular nerve stuff as well staying nice and relaxed all the way through your shoulders I've got some fairly in-depth lessons on like how to hold the instrument kind of whole body experience check those out take it nice and slow and take lots of breaks can i play slewfoot not off the top of my head unfortunately okay it looks like I jumped around in the chat here a little too much I'm getting a little mixed up here I hope I'm answering everybody's questions the chat is just jumping around on me a lot cool Peggy's heading out thank you for joining us dark oh I don't really know any of the words - that was a great song but I would just mumble my way through I'll play a little bit of Barlow knife here [Music] there it is Barlow knife at least there's a couple versions that that's John Salyer full-time fit elite player more or less his version but I know there's a couple versions so some versions got three parks and some words that's nice that's how I play it anyway Stephen says I brought up a pick up conversation a while back how about your thoughts on acoustic amps I don't know anything about acoustic amps I've never played through the closest I've come is just taking I I got some amp for like $15 when I was in high school and at times I would take a little like clip-on mic that I had and plug it in through that I don't know anything about acoustic amps of hurt I would ask on mandolin cafe there's in the equipment section there's some conversations that I've read but I don't remember any of the names it seems like there's some nice sounding little small amps that are out there for just a couple hundred bucks that could be worth looking into you but again mandolin cafe is the place for that I've never used one myself but I've been thinking about it it could be a handy thing to have James says you ever had any experience playing an octave mandolin what are your thoughts I have so I play a couple octave mandolin scale instruments I've got the the tenor banjo which is that scale I've got a flat iron bouzouki I'll pull it out here so this is probably the closest thing that I have to an octave mandolin this is a I guess it's technically is an octave mandolin cuz I don't have it strung sort of the main difference between octave mandolin and a bouzouki is how it's strung whether it's got octave strung strings like a twelve string guitar [Music] but all of the instruments that I play that are like octave mandolins [Music] I tuned g-d a and then instead of an e I have a D on top just like down a whole step and I play them sort of bouzouki style [Music] so I don't play any long scale octave mandoline style instruments in ji Dae I use them a lot for accompaniment except for tenor banjo I tuned GAE and so I also play tenor guitar which is a four string flattop acoustic guitar that I tuned GD a deep but they're super fun instruments too I just saw that whenever I talk about gear I've talked about a little bit of gear I never I'm not you know sponsored by anybody I'd buy all my own stuff nobody's paying me to talk about anything I saw that Eastman is recently made an arch top f-hole a style who has a mouthful octave mandolin for couple it's like five or six hundred bucks it seems really reasonably priced for that sort of seems like the lowest price for anything around and I've played a lot of Eastman's that have liked that that's got me thinking but um a little more uncommon than your your average mandolin but they're a lot of fun see here Jan says can you do a series on theory specifically for the mandolin yes that is something that I've wanted to do for a really long time I'm putting it off because it's gonna be a lot of work I wanna when I do it I want to do it right so it's not on the immediate timeline it's actually one of them it's like the the the end of my patreon sort of goals of the number of people that are pledging to me there's sort of a new sort of goal for every couple hundred patrons that help me out on patreon and at this point the music theory one is kind of at the end so there's gonna be a lot of time dedicated to that but I do want to do that for now what I would recommend is check out music theory met it's great it's not mandolin specific but it's music theory and it's all free and it's really well laid out and then also the theory section is it like tips on theory section on mandolin cafe that can be super helpful if you have specific questions there's also I think some books out there are covering bases says when you play an instrumental are you thinking of playing notes off chords or no yes I play it a lot out of positions you know so what I'm playing that's where a lot of my double stops come from is getting chord shapes down on the instrument and using strings that aren't the melody to play double stops and drum them because if your fingers are in general chord shapes if you hit another string it's not gonna sound it's gonna sound in tune and a nice additional note to the melody you're playing on top so I do use a lot of a lot of time and it's a good thing to think about you know if you're playing through a tune any tune from whiskey for breakfast to any fiddle tune I'm just going through the tune and going [Music] see I'm kind of having the chord structure running through your head either it's kind of a step-by-step process of learning the melody and then learning the chords and then playing the melody while thinking about the chords then trying to kind of put it all together but I the short answer your question is yes I think about playing out of chord shapes a lot John asked for a little bit of Blarney pilgrim definitely that's a great tune footprints in the snow that's another copyrighted one unfortunately all that bluegrass stuff is copyrighted and I'm just YouTube is just pinning it to me with the copyright these days kevin says he's working on black rogue and then the picking is coming along but we're having trouble with the backing yeah that's a great tune Iona just get through maybe I'll do a little bit of Blarney pilgrim and then black rogue [Music] so a little bit of the backing of black rogue at the end there I think part part of the thing especially with gigs is getting that that down up down pattern in your fingers and it also has a lot of kind of quick chord changes I'd say work through it use my play along track to be heaven already take a look at sort of how the chords fall over the melody if you look at the the sheet music kind of put all that stuff together and don't be afraid to really work through it nice and slowly maybe my biggest suggestion you know catch up with the chat again East Sea Ray 26 says I've been playing for two years and feel like I'm not progressing have learned Theory pretty well but the dexterity and hearing seems to elude me any suggestions it's you know it's hard to say without hearing you and without you know having a little more information but uh they'll say I've been I have practiced a lot of tricks oh I've practiced a lot any tricks to learn faster the short answer is check out there's a great series that I've been reading through I've kind of got halfway through it stalled a little bit but if you're into sort of learning how to learn there's a great series I've been working through on clawhammer banjo dotnet called the laws of brain Joe it's like banjo except brain brain jus brain Jo at the end and it's really interesting they talk a lot the guy is a banjo player kind of adult adult learner banjo player you learn later in life and is also a neuroscientist and has lots of interesting things to say about sort of the process of learning check that out we've been working through that but I think you know on a unless that's I would say if you want to go in the deep end check that out I think for me what has been really helpful it's finding people to play with and sort of maximizing the amount of fun I'm having playing and I think the the practice for me that's been the most successful is when I'm really not even thinking about playing as practice and when I'm not sitting there running scales and when I'm really like either at a bluegrass jam or a folk jam or a fiddle tune or just playing around with my friends whether i'm just gue peanut goofing off or like trying to put something together for a band anytime you're you know you're not you're not feeling like you're sitting there in this time and you're you're just kind of playing music and interacting with the people around you that are also playing music that time flies by and sort of feeling having that feeling of being in over your head is a really overwhelming fear feeling but can be really helpful you know if you can keep a positive attitude about it and not get too down on yourself about not being able to necessarily keep up with what's going on around you and just keep plugging away at it you know find some local jams and just get out there and do it as much as possible so that's what's helped me I'd say between those two things might might have a little bit of useful information there but it still it's it's a big subject for sure all right one more catch up here on the champ and he tips on playing mandolin in GD a detuning yes what I have I have another website that I don't add lessons to it's not unlike an ongoing website but I have a lesson a website called tenor guitar lessons all one word.com check that out it's sort of it's just a beginner series on learning to play in GD ad check it out it's fair it's all free just like mando lessons I don't add new lessons to it because Amanda lessons takes up all my time but it's there banjo Ben has some Mandic mento specific Theory lessons that's good to know cool it's got a lot of good stuff do you have any music from movies do you play any music from movies scores or soundtracks I don't I love that stuff a good friend of mine is a film scorer and I love hearing the stuff he creates and I love listening to the way music is combined with film but I don't I don't play any myself do I use a lot of slides and hammer-ons a little bit not as much as some I really tend my own personal style I think is built mostly on I'll do some slides I don't do a whole lot of hammer on I do a lot of slides I do a lot of double stops but hammer-ons slides all that stuff is great to know about all that sort of ornamentation there's lessons on my website on all of that stuff check it out I think just sort of as I've gone along there's nothing I have absolutely nothing against hammer ons and slides and all the stuff that I don't tend to use as much but it's just sort of the way I've kind of developed my style over the years it some of some of its kind of stuff that I don't tend to use as much kind of like tremolo there's nothing good wrong with adding some of that and I just don't tend to do it [Music] what was the tune you were playing on the bouzouki I think I was just noodling oh you have one of those demon octaves cool that's awesome I I haven't played one yet but I just because they're fairly new I think but that's great I hope to run into one someday so yeah but the to knows I wasn't playing anything I think I was just noodling on the bouzouki but they're definitely good ideas bouzouki a lot for song melody stuff more [Music] that's a pop in my head it's um adieu sweet lovely Nancy from the playing of Jeff Davis beautiful beautiful I love my favorite albums it's got a bunch of great guitar octave mandolin or maybe man - cello input banjo fiddle he's a great American folk musician yeah I tend to do more accompaniment style stuff tenor sorry I'm well tenor guitar and bouzouki alright I'm gonna see if I can just get through these last couple things but I'm running out of time once again unfortunately any thoughts on keeping yourself from cheating and switching strings in upstrokes when doing alternating right hand pattern what I recommend it's just you know play super slow and do some string crossing exercises you know just like some cross picking exercises doesn't matter what your pattern is just make sure your right hand is always going down up down unless you don't want it to donut yeah so go nice and slow hacen there's something else that was oh yeah think about your right hand once you sort of get the basic pattern into your eye head see if you can just feel that movement in your right hand as kind of a feeling rather than thinking down up down up you know if you can really just feel your hand do like that movement or if you're playing jigs just like feeling the physical movement in your hand and then if your hand alters from that pattern you'll start to feel that oh that doesn't feel right in my hand and you'll be able to get back on the train you are my sunshine is another one that's copyrighted it doesn't seem like it should be but it was written by some guy Harry I can't remember his name was written in like the 30s unfortunately the Tryon said it'd be nice if you had the time and named tunes you play on the session somebody did that if anyone wants to go I don't have time to go through all of them unfortunately and do that somebody has done that to one of them and it was great I really appreciate them doing that but if somebody wants to take that on as a project and post the timestamps I'll even add them to the description if you want or I'll I'll pin your comment to the top that would be super helpful but I don't have time to go through unfortunately on all my videos I wish I did okay I got a wrap things up here one more question what does the make of the tenor banjo at the Paramount Lang paramount it's kind of like middle-of-the-road style big heavy thing that weighs like 20 pounds yeah it's a fun fun instrument how much do you pick stick out from your fingers as you're playing about that much and you can you know play around with it you know I think if you'll find if you've got so much sticking out it'll really start to flop around if you have not enough you'll start dinging up your knuckles but that feels about comfortable to me it's kind of hard to see in this background but my top tip don't buy overpriced harmonic dampers buy a big bag of 3 millimeter rubber grommets for a few dollars pounds euros etc yeah so what are you referring to here is I've got a bunch of my instruments you can sort of see him here these little rubber grommets and you can buy them for like 5 bucks for a 4 or 8 pack or whatever it is you can also just buy them in boiling there's nothing wrong if you only need a couple it might make sense to just buy it but if you got a bunch of instruments you want to put them on about a bag of a hundred of them from like a hardware store for five or six bucks so if you're getting into the bulk drum business that's something to keep in mind cool all right so I got a got a head out but thank you so much all right it looks like there's just one more question and apologize if I missed anything do you prefer tenor banjo or clawhammer banjo both i I wouldn't want to live without either of them I love playing clawhammer banjo in old time sessions I love playing tenor banjo in Irish sessions and I talk about thought about teaching tenor guitar lessons again tenor guitar lessons calm I've got some lessons up there but it's not something I'm gonna be updating regularly because I don't have enough time I wish there were 48 hours in the day I'd get a lot more done oh yeah see you all next week thank you so much for joining once again and have a great rest of your weekend keep on picking get out there and place music with somebody's and see you next week same time same place 12 noon Eastern Time on Saturday see you soon bye", "VlVWWKaaPkY": "welcome to episode 9. [Music] today i'm going to show you around and show you the progress since the last video i do want to catch you up on the details and show you how well everything looks so this is quadrant one and you can see we've got the timber cobs and it's doing really well in this area we've got the seedling racks here still we're going to move those out eventually and a few people have asked about them we've been moving most of the plants out of here i'd say almost all the tomatoes are now in the greenhouse we turn the temperature up to 50 degrees and we'll do some videos eventually over there with all of the progress and getting ready for the season we've left the peppers in because they take a little bit longer to get mature and they're still totally happy and they're a great size right now so we're gonna let them stay in here and a few of you have asked how we get them to grow on this rack where there's no lights and it's pretty simple all we do is we rotate them and it's not ideal but we're still using what we have the main key is that we're addressing the weakest link in the greenhouse it was too cold to start the seed and be healthy and here it was warm enough and the limiting factor would be light we overcome that by rotating them you can see here that this half is a lot healthier than this half this half was in the shade and it's not a huge concern but it is a little bit of an issue it's not ideal so we can rotate and then we can put it a little bit more in the light these leds from all this ambient lighting there's a lot of light in here and it could probably be done a lot better with a little tiny shop light or an led of some sort underneath each rack but we're not doing that and i just wanted to address it um here in this section what's going to be the show of quadrant one will be these earth boxes and so this one up front is the 3.0 and this is a halitosis and it did pretty well after transplant these ones seem to be just slightly more sensitive on the nutrients in here this one's recycled we put craft blend and we had cover crop and we turned it in but overall it's getting really bushy and it seems like the halitosis are doing that this is the halitosis number one it was marked female you can see the leftover mulch from the transplant but you can also see some of the mycelium growing that's from the akashi blend that we put under here to start to activate that mulch layer and it's really neat um alan from grow kashi he taught us that putting this down in the top of the mulch layer will start to intelligently break down the nutrients and deliver to them to the plants and so while each person that uses an earth box has their own style we've noticed that a lot of different methods work with these and we really encourage gardeners to work with them because they're so much fun we've watered down the hole one time and it's kind of hard to tell but it's really easy in here when you have the lights you just peek down there and it reflects and you can tell there's water pretty soon when the reservoir goes dry we're going to water again because we're using living soil that has a high percentage of compost we're not going to keep the reservoir full at the earthbox website they they mention wanting to keep the reservoir full and they also don't really recommend using the type of soil that we use in here and so the rule set that we've come up with is you can use our soil but you must let the reservoir go dry that keeps air in there our soil is a little bit heavier a lot more natural than just the average potting soil potting mix it's really more of a soil it has rock dust and copious amounts of compost this one here is a fresh one this is the build a soil 3.0 it's the same recipe we're using in the quadrant three back there but the reason i mentioned that is they both look good this soil has already been grown in once harvested and replanted again this one is fresh and brand new and i'll show you underneath here there's the same thing happening from the kashi blend and it's nice and moist in here and this is protecting it from the light and eventually this this space that's in here because it's only one bag of soil one cubic foot we're going to be able to top dress more amendments and pile on the compost in fact if we really needed to we could pile a compost this high underneath this layer and because we water down below it won't matter that it's a mound up here and the feeder roots will adjust to that compost on top and we can grow a pretty large plant out of these two small earth boxes and let's go to the next quadrant i can talk all day just about the earth boxes so i want to move on i'll be sure to talk more about those as we get into it and the watering schedule so far i top watered once and as soon as the plants started to grow i bottom watered once and we transplanted four days ago and this bed in the three by three i want to talk about several things but first i'll address the watering the day we watered on video i showed you how i added five percent and that was three and a half gallons because there's 70 gallons of soil in here so i added three and a half gallons of water i did that with my chapin sprayer and i did it with a one gallon per minute nozzle and i stood here and i drained the entire pump sprayer into here after doing that after i transplanted i've watered one more time that volume and the reason why i did it twice is it was a little bit on the dryer side when i was done setting up the bed and it was ready to receive probably a 10 watering i didn't want to overdo it the first day of transplant and drowned my new transplants and they did well they told me they needed a little water the humidifier kicked off once and ran out of water and so i went ahead and i gave them a good watering one more chapin sprayer full three and a half gallons and i got no runoff and now i'm happy with it i feel like the moist the moistness is even all the way through and if you look in the mulch layer here there's a mushroom log i'll talk about in a second what i wanted to show you is peek down here you can see the cover crop coming through some of the leaves that i pinched off the plant are already decaying and when i pull up this layer even in the far corner it's nice and moist in there and that's what i'm looking for i don't want it to be dry under the mulch i want the plants to be happy but even though it's moist there i want to keep it that way i don't want to overdo it so i'm not going to water today at all they have plenty of moisture in here i don't want to create a habitat where it is excessively moist that leads to anaerobic conditions there can be fungus gnat problems and other issues and as long as you keep it like this things will do really well and some other things to look for if you just set up a bed like this and your plants are droopy they're droopy either because you've over watered or underwater and if you address our watering practices and how much moisture we've put in you could probably tell if you've done more than that or less than that and answer your own question now if you're thinking you might have underwater because you're trying to be cautious they'll be droopy and might be getting a little bit crispy and and might be getting a little bit of different colors see how this leaf is really even in color it might be getting burnt tips a lot more than that and tips along the edges when you get a dry down that increases the solution of nutrients that's available and the biology is constantly making it available and so there could be some sodium in there or some excessive nutrients that when the moisture goes down the amount of nutrients and that little water is kind of a lot for the plant and so we want to keep it happy by addressing that now the opposite would be yellowing of the lower leaves now there might be a couple leaves when you first transplant that i plucked off that would have yellowed on their own but anything without this turgor see how it's holding itself up it's got a nice it's not droopy and it's not yellowing with like a fade if it starts to change to a lighter green color and it's drooping you may have over watered and at that point you want to make sure that you don't water again and then exacerbate the problem we've got four plants in here and i at least want to address which or which so you can track along the way so i'll tell you which side is which over here if you look we've got the branson's royal revenge and those are the green plant tags that we have here let me pull it out of the mulch layer here so it's labeled burr or branson's royal revenge number nine female and these two are the branson's royal revenge you'll notice that they look similar that they both have large leaves they're both a little bit more uniform and that they have a perpendicular structure they didn't broaden out with these side branches and we've done no training on here on any of these plants so this is totally natural according to their one gallon shape they were previously in some of them branched a little more in that one gallon and some of them didn't and the bransons are a little bit more broad leaf less likely to branch like the other one or the other one all of them seem to have branched out a little bit more including the two in the earth boxes those were both halitosis these are both branson's royal revenge now that doesn't mean anything about the quality these are both going to be phenomenal quality it just speaks to the differences you could certainly start training if you only had one plant in here you'd want to start pinching or you want to start topping and i have a preference and we'll do another episode on plant control i've talked a lot about it over the years if you check out our instagram you can find examples i will be building a screen on here i will be doing minimal training my goal is to flip to flowers soon and show you how simple this can be in a fast process without going for the maximum screenful just getting really beautiful plants and selecting a keeper to run for the next round in the same soil so this is the shiitake mushroom log and this is a half one it was just brought down as a sample we work with a local mushroom farm and they produce a whole bunch of different organic mushroom products some of the products that we use for them include this mulch that's in here and so we like working with local businesses we also like that they have a similar mindset and values to us and they brought this in and we decided that we're going to offer it alright so here's what it looks like and it's already producing something that's pretty much ready to harvest and it'll keep fruiting and these are the shiitake and these are wood eating mushrooms and so that's why they're growing on a wood log so to speak this is you can tell manufactured from sawdust and a few other additives that are all organic they'll be limited batch production so check for availability but when you get it you're going to soak it in water and that's it put it somewhere where it has nice conditions most of us here at build a soil including the staff we add mushrooms to our diet the other benefit that a lot of growers talk about is that mushrooms produce co2 and plants need co2 there's a synergistic relationship there so we're not planning to offer it as a co2 producing mechanism this is for food production but there is going to be some benefit there and i think that's worth looking into so let's take a look at quadrant three and this is where we have seven and a half gallons of soil one cubic foot we took one of our bags and opened it of each one of our four recipes and you can tell they're really liking it they've done great they've transplanted well so these are displaying a lot of the characteristics that i look for after a transplant we transplanted four days ago on monday and you can see the turgor it's the ability of the leaf to lift itself up like this and have these this shape to it and most the time when you start growing plants you come to see that as a sign of plant health you can tell it's kind of reaching for the light and so there's a number of factors that might cause that but overall it's a great sign and they're transplanting well the plants usually transplant really well into the light soil these ones back here are loaded with nutrients including our 3.0 our ollie and our malibu and they're also doing great so it's nice to see every recipe we make performing really well after a fresh transplant especially when we're doing these not live but we're doing it where there's no chance of us switching these out i mean we're pretty much live even though we get to edit the videos we can't we can't edit the process all four of these plants if you can guess by looking at the structure these are the branson's royal revenge and we tried to keep all four the same so we could have a little bit more of a comparison on all four soil recipes but since they're from seed it won't be an exact comparison because some of them are going to naturally have different shapes than others that's just how seed works unless it's totally stable which is like a long-term breeding project okay let's take a look here um you can see that it's starting to get some side branching now that it's been transplanted and the roots will naturally follow the shape of the container so expect this to get a little bit bushier regardless of which genetics they are but we've not done any training to give these lower branches any advantage and there's a lot we could discuss about giving these lower branches an advantage one alternate method is removing the lower branches if we wanted to flip to flower now i'd expect these plants to get about double the height and so it's important that you plan far ahead and when you're running small containers we really remember that because if we end up getting the plants to this size before we flip the flower we're going to double from there and we might run out of soil no matter how good the soil is we're going to be taking from it to produce a plant and so we want to manage the plant to container size relationship and if that's considered you can grow in a very small container challenge is as most people want to grow in a small container and get really big yield and that's more of a hydroponic paradigm in living soil it's very important that we keep that ecosystem and relationship alive and it'll reward us with really high yield if we go from a seven and a half gallon to a 15 gallon we should see a 60 percent increase in yield so keep that in mind if you want to step up in container size that's not directly linear you can increase the yield here and we're going to show you how we're going to top dress later we're going to brew up some teas later but for now you can see all i've needed to add was the initial transplant solution we showed you in the last episode and since then we've only watered twice so for four days we watered every other day since then and we watered about five percent each time so in here that would be half of three quarters of a gallon it's easier to say it that way i think a lot of times people measure by the gallon let's go to the next quadrant there's a few back here i'll mention these are some that we were identifying maybe as females we decided not to plant and i'll address this one in the back corner in the last episode we were guessing it turned out to be female so our intuitions were right and that's that's great for us we did get i think one more female identified we're going to give away today and i'll check on that later i bet you it's showing right now so that's good news over here we're now in quadrant four and i wanted to talk about a few things that have changed you might have noticed that some of the plants off the racks are moving around and this tomato plant right here we put a string on and you can see that it's rolled all the way up and it's tight and this is because it's going to climb this like a vine and we use these specialty clips which we've always carried a lot of our customers use these on bamboo stakes just to take branches and clip them to it but they're really designed to pinch the string the string fits right in the wedge and it allows you to pinch the string and then it just holds the plant in line with where you pinch it so they're super easy to apply they don't hurt the plants and what we did to get it to this point is we removed all of the lower branches up until this last branch below the fruit this last branch here we could probably remove but it is receiving light it is helping it grow and so it's more about what we'd like to keep on in the future if you see right here this is what they call a sucker there's already fruit above it on this main branch this is something that receives the light and helps it grow and in between here is another set that could become a branch that would produce fruit if we wanted to vine all the way up we'd like to keep its energy directed towards the main center line and so we're going to remove that right now and that'll keep this growing vertically you can see these are going to become flowers by the end of this series we're going to see them all the way to the ceiling in here and so it's really fun it's a small volume of soil so we're going to use some of the some of the same tricks that we use over there to get bigger plants in here to keep it healthy we also moved the pepper plant into a area where it wasn't in the way because i've got extra space right now and it's loving the amount of light that it's getting over here um because obviously it's under the brighter light and it seems to have like doubled in size in here it's pretty cool it's starting to put out some of its first flowers which will then turn into peppers and so that's a good sign it's still producing really big leaves it seems to like it in here even though it's humid it's not getting any of that like dimpling that you sometimes see on indoor peppers so i'm really happy with the way things are going and it seems like it's liking the 3.0 right now in this little tiny container so the pepper's there it's going to be producing soon over here we harvested the lettuce pretty recently i think three or four days ago and it's already starting to grow back on some of the areas that we didn't harvest quite as deep and over here you can tell some of these vines are a little bit long it's because we over seeded it and when we overseed it and don't exactly place the seed you get a lot of competition but i'm still optimistic that it's going to all grow back in here very soon and we'll continue to eat from it over here on the rack we took all the good cucumbers out we were doing a little experiment with some old seed and it germinated very poorly while the rest did almost perfect germination so we're going to cherry pick some of the best from here we've got another experiment that we're working on we've got a special transplanter we'll show you later and it uses these paper pots and these unlink and they become kind of like ammunition to a machine gun all of these cells unlink in a straight line and go down a special hand plow attachment that bury those in the soil and then cover the furrow behind it so that you transplant that entire tray in like one minute really exciting over here the kale just continues to grow if you saw in one of the previous videos we removed almost all the leaves and they're back and big again and so that's pretty good to see as we remove the rest of these trays we'll get into doing potentially some micro greens and we're going to do some sprouts that we've talked about but haven't had the time to do since doing the farm starts so look for that coming in some of the future videos that covers it most of that work was done in the last episode now it's been checking it's really just been waves of energy besides all the farm stuff i'm just i just waited to address that once these transplanted it seemed like there was new growth and that they were happy in their home they weren't sad once i saw that they were happy that gave me the confidence to bottom water with an earthbox system if you have a really small plant and it's not drinking right away and you have lots of compost in there it can get a little funky down in the reservoir so i like to weight other than that that's almost the only consideration the rest of these were kind of on autopilot besides the basic watering we're going to do some quick faq about the grow room environment and some of the technology that we're using so i want to address what we're using i've got a few different types they're all made by timber grow lights and we really have come to like them they're a really high quality manufacturer and they use some really high quality components up here is a 50 watt cob setup so each one of those is 50 watts the whole setup is 600 watts and it's dimmable i've got it turned all the way up right now so we can hit all the way to the floor down here over here we have more of a strip side style where you can see lots of small chips instead of the big round ones and those seem to be a little bit more uniform however both perform well these are my newest favorite and so we've got two of those since i love them so much those are from the last grow and they're the timbers cypress eight and a lot of our customers have come back and bought their second round of them already they're really pleased with them they're built really really well and they're going to last a long time and that's important there's a lot of problems out there with grill light manufacturers and these ones are looks like about five feet off the height the top of the plants here and this puts it in about that 500 par range maybe just slightly less which is really good for this stage of growth dli or daily lighting integral and it's based on the photosynthetic active radiation or the type of light that the lights produce and to put it really simple you don't want too much light you don't want too little light and to know that you can actually look up your manufacturer's specs at certain distances or you can buy a meter that tells you once you have that information you can determine how many hours a day you run your light once you know how many hours and how powerful it comes up with a formula and the plants like to be at a certain number in their vegetative growth and they like it relatively higher in flower and so we'll address that a little more later but you can tell that when you get things right the plants really do well and one of the biggest things with living soil is the environment is the only thing you really can control and then they're going to speed up their job and hydro you can kind of force feed them i have to ask them and to do that we have to steward the environment into a situation where they can grow at an explosive rate and that has to do with temperature and humidity and lighting and so we set it at a range where it's just at the high end of what the lights produced so we have it at 78 degrees in here what that does is that triggers when it gets up to 78 the fan the fan kicks on it sucks all of the air out that brings in through passive ventilation it sucks fresh air in the fresh air brings fresh co2 that's what plants need it's like oxygen to us and so it allows more fresh air to come in when that happens that will actually trigger the humidifier we have an active air commercial humidifier that's hooked up to a five gallon reservoir which is enough for about a day at a time if we're running the fan a lot so i would recommend a larger reservoir but it's worked really well for us when we're here every day as soon as the fan kicks on it lowers the humidity and if we don't address that the plants will react negatively and so we pump the humidity in as the air goes out if you get that cycle right if you have a smaller humidifier you can make sure that you don't cycle your fan as often if you have a big humidifier you can humidify your outside room called the lung room either way the goal is to keep it at a very consistent rate in here and we've been able to do that and the plants are growing really fast because of it if you want to research more of this look up vapor pressure deficit or vpd and look up daily lighting integral or dli there are hundreds of videos there's lots of information and it'll make you a better grower to learn about this stuff this oscillating fan a few people have asked about we just used zip ties if you see right here to attach it to the rack normally what i do is i use zip ties to attach it into the top corner of the tent and i'll normally put several right now it's working the way it is as we're going to flower we might put one more in here to keep the air moving not only do you need fresh air coming into the tent but you need that air to be moved around the plant leaves so it can breathe the co2 so it doesn't get suffocated in its own fresh air and this helps with that it also adds a little bit of structural integrity to the plants as they get blown around it's more natural this fan we took the front plate off the reason why we do that is if you've had grow tents for a while you've known that these fans either you get lucky and they last forever or every other one you get breaks and so we've had a number of different manufacturers this is one we used to carry we now have a different brand they seem to perform pretty well but statistically some of them will break if that happens we're here to support you you get a reti uh refund on it or an exchange and one of the things to mitigate that is we actually leave the front panel off when it's oscillating and inside of it there are plastic gears and we have moisture in here and all this stuff the thing that's prone to breaking is the plastic gears so taking a little weight off is why you see no shield on here i leave the back on because it'll actually cut your finger if you're unaware or your ear or something and so that at least helps a little bit kind of a common thing you see with growers a lot of times they'll leave those off and so i just want to address why you might see that it's definitely not the safest thing when you get the really powerful ones they can actually catch you pretty good but it makes a difference in the fan life any brand will work we've tried maybe five or six brands i was going to say a dozen but i'd be exaggerating and most of them come from similar manufacturers we imported one really good one from canada and had issues with getting inventory and even then you pay for a more expensive fan that eventually fails so i think this is a good model and as long as you treat them well and between each grow i take it apart and i clean it and it lasts a lot longer the compressor blow it out little things like that will make your equipment last longer and sometimes it's not about the price the equipment it's about the plastic waste and just trying to keep things as long as we can this is already hypocritical enough to try and be organic with all this electricity and grow lights what i want you to do is if you like this content and you've enjoyed it please give us a thumbs up when you're done watching next up you're going to be surprised but these plants are going to grow relatively quickly and we're going to be going to flower i'm not going to promise win but in the coming future not too many episodes in the distant future we're going to be flipping the flower which means we're going to have lots to talk about things are going to start moving quick thanks for watching we'll see you on the next one", "L1jJqwdztwg": "hey this is Jay the cans explorer here and we're finally finally gonna start vegging as you can see some of these have already well into vegging already as you can see but the problem was I forgot to use rooting hormone the gel on the clones when we first made them so the root structure was very weak so as you can see like three or four of these took off a little quicker than the rest the most recent one we like I said the rooting the roots weren't that well strong so I should have just scrapped those and started over my clones and did it with a good root structure because I just transplant the last one right there not even a week ago and it's already starting to stretch the rest of these have taking a couple weeks to really get going like that back left corner one is the last one to get routed up and start stretching now so we will be training all the rest of these d leafing them and topping them and letting the rest of them catch up and then we'll start flowering so today we're gonna call it day one a veg and at most in four weeks we'll be switching to flower and probably sooner if they really vigorously grow like I think they are and so far I've been feeding them the sorry my lens is on there the blue plant nutrients bluemax line the part a and part b so far and then I also use mammoth pee I'm thinking of using some of this Open Sesame during flowering but we'll see and then of course when they need some cal meg I give them some general hydroponics cal-mag this is stuff I have left over from quite a few years ago so I'm using the rest of that and then what we're gonna do in here for for supporting them we have some steaks that we're gonna kind of make some notches in and then I'm going to make a little custom tomato cage type situation going on and then if you guys haven't watched the first episode we are running a BBB and flow system so there's the memory bucket and the reservoir is right over here and it will flood these right now I have them on 24-hour light and they are getting flooded four times during every 24 hours when we switched to flour we will be doing that's the 11 on and 13 off and we'll probably be flooding three times during flowering perlite cycle so can't wait to get there as you can see a lot of these are well on their way so we got to do some training and the rest will catch up and then we will be into the fun part flowering I think that's about everything guys if I forgot anything I'll definitely tell you next video well of course we are using platinum LEDs that's why I'm using these lenses or it's just pink like that so we're using the Platinum LEDs at half power right now and sticking around eighty degrees in here with 40% humidity so we eventually need to get a window AC to call off this room a little bit but they will be just fine at 80 degrees we will see when we get to flying if we can do full power if not we'll do half power for this flowering and then by the next time we have a cycle going through we'll be able to have a window AC to make it full power but I will be doing weekly updates every Friday Saturday Sunday somewhere around there I will do a grow update and let you guys follow along but I think that's it for now as always has some happy growing out there and much love everyone fight", "00PTzP0erv0": "are y'all ready for some livery kill and natural bridge you know what i am too from this point on the evening and the morning belongs to mr larry
