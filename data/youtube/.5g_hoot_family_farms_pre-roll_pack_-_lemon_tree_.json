{"MESvONMIJiA": "hello youtube this is matthew with lunatic family farms i'm here with my good friend gunner we're just watching the birds out here this be my first youtube video so you gotta have to bear with me here i'm on a cell phone um so me and my family we just purchased uh 40 acres here in uh south central indiana and it used to be an old amish place so they have uh spring fed well and uh you know wood heat they did have uh power they ran plug-ins everywhere and light switches but they didn't have uh didn't have it hooked up to the grid or anything so we're going to kind of go from here i'll show you some of the different things that they did out here some of the plants that they planted and just some of the infrastructure that they already set up here and and i'll take you around and show you all that stuff alright stay tuned bye", "CJu-Tdlnvxw": "so that's that's where it all began right here in sisters you can see our greenhouses down through here which you won't do this year oh no we'll we'll start early next year super excited about that and then behind it you'll see our teepees and that's the sykes another crazy sykes invention right there but you know i'm a i'm a believer in necessity i i may not be able to afford fancy but if it works at least in my mind i'm gonna try it and then if it really works i look like this crazy goofball because it's something that nobody's seen that before but we we have a very special climate in the high desert right so it's dry and we have an afternoon breeze every day that you can almost count your watch to and so mother nature will help you dry and then the rest with the idea you know i drive through farms or different agricultural products and i look at it and i was going through tri-cities and they had these huge poles and pulley systems over these crops and i was looking at a very high-tech hot farm and i was wrapping my head around that as i was going through and that's how this tp idea came up hey there bailey sweet with harvest helper trim store i'm in the beautiful bend oregon i'm at big top farm and i'm taking a tour on some new methods that are really interesting i thought you guys would like to see this this is sykes mitchell's teepee and you can see how windy it is and these are just flowing like sheets but not going crazy there's look at these looks on the ground there's almost nothing so it's just literally protecting itself it's like nature's drying right here the bud has a nice nice texture so sykes already has all of his plants out of the ground but we're gonna go from that point from the point of the plants coming out of the ground through his whole process there's automated drying his separating his uh bucking trimming packaging sorting inventory all the things he has to go through to make this come together and happen and grow year after year all right so we cut the tops okay we cut the tops and then we hang the tops these are the tops and then we move and we label everything so we know what part of the fuel it came from the day it came down we cut this is the fun part this is an oregon cbd field right here we cut this field four times before we harvested it we took four thousand pounds an acre off of this field after we cut it four times wow really really really happy about how this field worked and this is this is why you just why would you try anybody else's genetics right yeah i did but you i mean they're just that good that's i got a lady in utah right now that i've been selling equipment too and she used oregon cbd and she is doing so much better than her peers that did not oh i'm sure i i and i don't know what their growing climate is but it's just such a consistent product yeah and that so that's the other thing too is that you're you're really in an area that i mean i guess we're in areas that are so moist like you're just in the ideal climate for this it really is it's a great climate for us do you think that it'll become uh for hemp that you know i think that's probably the best question you've asked me so far i think i think central oregon is going to be the sonoma of hemp when the word finally gets out that everybody sees what you go through to get the best right product your consistency is going to come from central oregon you're not going to have the seating issues the mold issues and and you know if you have a a gene or a strain that can finish early which is what we're talking about with oregon cbd and the genetics you you can plan it and you can count on it finishing out and getting it out of the field before the weather changes and that's everything just that like you're reducing that gamble so this is the light depths and then we've just converted light depths into storage this one here is uh this is the original one that we had on the other side of the field and the neighbor said you know i hope you guys have all the success in the world but you put the greenhouse right in the view of the only mountain view i've got i said well if we have a good year we'll move it so he took it from that end of the field on wheels and rolled it here you're such a good neighbor rhonda working on some of the drying racks one of our girls so how long does this hang for uh you know we try and cure it for you know between nine and fourteen days in in with the dehumidifiers in in this situation that's about what we get out of it take it down i am just carefully brushing dried wet trim from the rack into the tote so we wet trim these and then rack them and it makes it a really it's a different product than some of the other ones off the stem but it's it's ready really quick so during a harvest season when somebody goes oh come on you got to have something ready yeah we run them through the t4s yeah and then in the t2 that we got from you and then we put them on the rack and we can dry them and the rack is is fun and we give it a pop so we don't have flat spots so we have a rack pop right you know i try and come through here and give them a snack and flip oh yeah just like that and they they bounce in there okay um a lot of these once they're filled up and this is the finished product of course isn't that pretty that is pretty oh look at that this was wet trim yep you didn't even lose the nose no no that's it we we did it at a necessity for markets and and people were like you're going to ruin it it's like no i don't think i'd do it if it was going to ruin it yeah at least not twice in a row yeah but these are and you can find that peach now in there although the wind is a little glowy today um the hairs are all intact yeah let's get a close up smell it blue tinted one so those were had a little bit of look at the crystals on that [Music] that's the goliath too yep yep so same strain just has some that come out yeah various what causes that do you know well it's just a you know different phenotypes in the in the strain yeah and that's and they have a strawberry and a grape smell and then they have the peach smell and they're all in the same bag of seeds yeah it's because they're getting it from the seeds right right right so is this your purple yeah oh there they are yeah look at that one and that perfect purple so this would be another phenotype of the goliath yeah and we had a guy that just he wanted 60 pounds of just the purple so pam went out and just picked hand-picked purple before the frost cave so is that part of why you like doing it right from the seats too is it you get the different varieties oh yeah and you know and the other thing is with the high desert we get we get the diurnal temperature change so you know at night we're going to drop into that freezing range we're going to between 28 and 32 degrees and then it goes it can go back up to 90 degrees and that is what makes them make the oil and it's why we get that purple without mold a lot of places in the country that grow a purple flower people are really leery because they figure it's been in the field so long that it turned purple or maturity and it probably has mold from rain well we're in the desert that purple is caused from that diorama change so it's just and there's a purple look at that one look at that one that is covergirl purple variety i just think they're sexy they look like jewels it's true notice the colors out and about and this is from the seahawk that how bad i hate dust so yeah it was a great combination this is from the uh it's from the seahawks turf they he went and picked it all up so maybe there we are again how much did that cost you to order seahawk turf well we just when they replaced it we got it from a replacement company and basically we just paid the shipping to get it to us and they just shipped it to you just for cost yeah because they they they don't want them in the landfill they're really hard on the landfill yeah so they've tried to fight people that want it and i thought it'd be great to just lay it down where high traffic area is no doubt the pro football games have been played on this process that's the rumor but this is where it all started so in the winter we had a uh the little heater over here and the girls on the trim rack and you know we've been doing flour as long as anybody but i know i mean four years now we've been in the flower business but the biomass you know it's in the tank right now but it's always been our secondary product yeah this is what we're we want to do flowers we want to be you know hey it's gonna be a flower yeah in the biomass do you think it's it was just bad because there was such a flood last year flooded out and now the people that are not in it anymore that are sitting in barns full of bags are willing to let it go for nothing so next year the year after yeah they're thinking by march we should see a change in pricing which would be nice but it's you can't count on anything but knowing half the market went that's in business this year went cbg yeah and half of it's in cbd that's just gonna eventually you know supply and demand we're going to go through that supply and then the demand will go back up but yeah you know it is next year the pla the year to go beggars the next year to hold back those are all the cards we got to you know guess on later yeah you see that uh-huh wow and this there's no flower after this it gets compressed into a 1500 pound bale okay uh jeffrey how did you get mixed up with psychics and what do you do here um title well i'm a vp of operations for a few different companies okay the first of which is imperial seedlings we're a genetic genetics advisement company and a seedling provider to the hemp industry okay so we provide genetic advisement and then the subsequent seedlings crop advisement and then post harvest biology's advisement as a as that company and is that specific to oregon or nationwide that's nationwide yes we're one of the few companies that ship some seedlings nationwide and we're going international with cuts here shortly so excited about the prospects okay all right that's one the next two uh two would be distributorship it's called elevated distributing elevated distributing elevated works with the farms uh in their post-harvest processings with a jv partner from assure technologies as a duo we provide the post-harvest advisement processing desiccation trimming bagging and then through elevated the sale of said product either into processed goods not for cgp or for small cool fun okay all right can you tell us your process here in the harvesting aspect so for the for the harvesting aspect that's really one of the better parts of the new technology that we're bringing to bear in the market and that is a drying process that doesn't exceed 72 degrees and will dry product in 48 hours so we've launched our beta test this year with great success here on big top farms okay and are hoping to launch uh duplicity into the market next year providing hubs for farmers to bring their material to where it can be processed in a timely fashion at scale and still have the idea of valued constituent preservation in mind okay so since you've been operating this system here with the amount of product that was brought in do you was there time in the harvest season to bring on product here for other people or would there be next year this year there wasn't right now we only brought four units um the output of those units on average is about 500 to 700 pounds of dried material per day okay and so next year the idea with duplicity is to bring multiples of those to a hub here in central oregon southwest oregon uh north of bakersfield a few other parts of the country so that we can provide hubs for farmers to bring their product in to be processed much like that of other commoditized crops okay so what we're gonna see is essentially a pilot project with four dryers correct correct are we gonna follow him [Music] let's start here just as an example so we cut to size in the field so that we're if we're having scissor work that scissor work occurs uh in the field we're taking the best of the best smokeable flower and then coming through later with bean pickers or other harvesting technologies to make up for the remainder of the plant okay so as an example this is some product that's come out recently that has been dried uh in about 48 hours and you'll notice it's got a nice crispness to it uh we get the moisture content down to where it's cheap shelf stable and maintains its durability but the temperatures that we're drying out are really focused around the preservation of monoterpenes yeah and cannabinoids yeah so we get a great nose dried down in 48 hours versus the you know seven to ten days or if it's raining even longer right so this is a very consistent process that used uh our new technology yeah i like it it's kind of unbelievable to me honestly machine dried with a nose it's very gentle on the front that's the idea right yeah absolutely yeah we'll show you some of the uh units from the outside of the club yeah absolutely these are the two companies that uh we're in partnership with which is assure technology and aggravation um these four units are the prototype units that will be uh bringing duplicity to the market with next year okay cool yeah so pretty straightforward except for the fact that i can't show you what's inside yeah yeah so like i said there are there are four problems that a lot of people are trying to solve sure we're hoping that we've got the best mousetrap in the business um you know if this if this season uh starting here with sykes there's any indication i think we do yeah we're headed to northern california next to move these units to the next farm they're they're modular this year for that beta testing and then next year we're on the hose the next step well so after it comes out of the dryer right that's what we just looked at it's in the racks here right and normally we're coming out of the field right we would sack it and rack it put it in the machine pull it out 48 hours later at which point it goes into trim okay [Music] yeah which is where companies like yours come into play we need more scale technologies for product that's been dried down and is ready for that process so yeah from basically from these trays into into the trimmers absolutely so pretty straightforward compare to streamline not a lot of moving parts per se um and yeah that's a long shorter yeah pretty good what we're trying to do is avoid you know maybe some of the what's the best way to say this the previous attempts from farms to try and reinvent the wheel yeah uh and and stick to really standardized protocol yeah so we can get a standardized process and a reliable product on the back end so absolutely that's much uh what we're geared towards cool where did you get to work he took me inside and showed me everything everything so you want to run some we want to run some so from the from the racks that come out of the dryer you're going straight into a trimmer you're not bucking it down further right so it's going straight from total we've got some short stacks right now coming off they're all cut to size let's show her that because that would be good right from spain genetic from spain yeah what are you putting in there we're going to put a full 27 gallon toe in and let it run because of after we've ran a few batches through this we like the the dryness is just right so we run it actually sub five minute run and then check it and and it's pretty clean so this has got a pretty fuzzy look to it still got a nice squish in the middle firm but the outside's crumbly bailey is correct me if i'm doing anything out of line so there's a five minute setting and start your engines okay scott we're gonna take a peek at its progress and that's a minute and a half and it's pretty cool when you can reach in this was i remember looking at these big ones going in now that's bigger and you're going to have some difficulty with a bigger one just as it tumbles but to have those be a good portion of what you've done in a minute and a half that makes it all worthwhile to me and then this will all go on a conveyor for the the snip we'll look for any of those crow's feet and the final it'll just drop in the bucket and you know our customers of course they want this broke down but for us to go and be able to break this down and clean it up that fast is really that's why you're here it's what we want to see in a machine that does it really really good just like that pretty good so how long did we trim that 27 gallon tone before uh maybe two minutes two minutes in the back keep it this exact same one this is the fuzzy going in and you just saw the results coming out actually you should walk that over to the tote that's down there um i wish i had my gloves on yeah no it's cool let's do this comment feedback for you yeah nerd boys out there waiting for you so oh yeah before and after two minutes and there's a few of these are good side-by-side comparisons they went in like that in two minutes so fresh out of the batch one this this batch went for about four or five minutes it had a little more moisture in it [Music] but we need to know if we're having shrink if we have a moisture issue if we're too dry or too wet um that's that's one of our ways of knowing our weights where we're at and then of course i wish i would have invested in freaking bots [Laughter] it's crazy but there's just a lot of it so this one's a different batch number upper innis still in the goliath cultivar but also lime green so there's two lime greens lower in this upper in us as we swept through the field taking those out and some of that you know we have markets in that we found this last year everybody was looking for the lime green whether they're doing a delta eight spray or they're just in a part of the country that does not understand purple right and we've got other people that want purple so we just separated them so it's easier for them they can be easier yeah and some people want to put all purple in the jar that's right and it goes and goes and goes just down yeah and this is just being dried yeah we just we brought some of the flowers in and we're just slow curing them in here they're getting closer but they're i think they've got another by the feel of it i'll tell you they got another probably four days to get there and then those are those are marked as well so that we can come up here and when we tote them we know what we've got okay and it's just trying to stay organized yeah so it just it doesn't do any good to have them all in a pile yeah i think you got we got some really good stuff here people the buyers nowadays want to know exactly what they're getting and they want to know how many pounds behind it exactly so you know again and we we did 30 acres of the of the goliath in about 35 acres of the oregon cbd and the goliath because it's compliant and and we have the coas it's going to be pretty popular yeah so we're happy to have the batches and and you know the stores and the buyers that are going they want to know okay you've got 550 pounds of the green goliath from upper moody with a coa we want it yeah yeah so that's that's what we're trying to do as the farm is just be more organized so the buyer wants to come back it's not a it's not a bad experience [Music] right i wanted 50 pounds of purp so we got a perps so is this bag ready for most of your buyers or do you have to tighten it up a bit or is that well no this this guy wanted a machine so this is ready as far as a machine it's perfect but now hand trim you got to clean it up a lot we're pretty we have a pretty tight trim on that but that's not what this is this is this is a machine trim so they're they're okay with that and they they like the color and if they want to trim it down you know we're priced accordingly so yeah you know machine trim is not going to be anything like the hand trimming yeah cool yeah that one's green let's check um it's green same exact stream just a different oh yeah look at the difference yeah that's the only thing i see in the bags of like when i looked on.com i wasn't seeing like shredded like flour yeah so our some of our some of our best clients that buy from us regularly have sites on youtube whatever social media outlet that they have and they take it out of the bag this is from big top farms and they strip it off even the the last of the tip of the stem right yeah and grind it in front of you and they tell you what store they're going to tomorrow and the next day and he goes i can't keep it in the house but he's telling him where he's going and who's going to get the goodies next and we just get it to him that's our job just give it to him and that guy is all about the quality it's not about the price we walked into texas stores and you know the guy behind the counter is like i don't know where it came from midwest yeah well let's see it and opens up a like an oatmeal can pours it on the counter and there's stems and seeds and crap and it's like wow people like that he goes they like the price it's 9.99 i'm like it's horrible yeah it's i don't even see a flower in there but um people will figure it out and it's just it's no different than what we were talking about earlier with the stores um that's where people try it they're like wow we did the cbd and it didn't work well try ours and and we get we get some comebacks to it but you you just know there's a lot of people i'm not trying again at 40 bucks to have failure why would i do that and and i'm sitting in line to buy something i'm looking at these little racks with cbd blah blah blah and there's nothing in it and it's like you're just capturing the sexy part of the cbd sales right now and you're ruining it for these because people aren't getting the results exactly and you know small boutique farmers that are trying to you know march forward with this new medicine are getting you know snuffed by the big guys that all they're doing is chasing the dollar yep one of the things that we've done with our products is we've given a lot of our product away and to family friends people that have problems cancer we've been giving away free since we started to anybody that has cancer we just give it to you right you don't want to try it don't but if you're interested that you're in pain or you're going through this we just get it to you and it's amazing how many people and how many people's family are like you guys are just doing incredible stuff yeah well we've we've really wanted to know that it actually works for people you want realtors all of my products so it's not just coming from a lab we've got recipes that have been developed in-house some of them are old family recipes from some of our team for like the soap and the lotions but but we want to know that it's actually going to work before we've ever put our name on it and put it on the shelf so it's taken us a while to actually get our consumer product line up but that was why because we truly wanted to make sure they were products that were going to be effective exactly", "IfirM2TEC9w": "[Music] all right what's going on you guys so today we're gonna be going over what three hundred dollars would get you at a one plant dispensary here in Florida I actually have two three hundred dollar purchases that I've recently made here that I'm gonna be going over and referring back and forth to here in this video so we'll actually get kind of a bonus and just see what two three hundred dollar purchases will look like but first I have been promising you guys a 420 giveaway coming up which I'm gonna be giving away this star weed right here this is actually a CBD dominant strain of cannabis and I'm gonna be giving this away as long as it is legal in your state this is gonna be a United States giveaway only if you don't want the CBD weed you can actually opt out for a medical marijuana license that's what I'll offer in return if you don't want the actual CBD weed but how we're gonna go about this giveaway this would be pretty fun is we're gonna whoever can guess the amount of grams in this jar or get the closest to it will get it and that's how it will go so over the next couple videos this will be going on until the week before 4/20 so every video will be a new chance for you to actually comment on a video and we'll leave what you think how many grams is in the jar so make sure to leave a comment in the comment section below on what you think is in the door how many grams so let's get right into it and see what we got here you guys I honestly have only purchased from one plant only three times actually a not I really wish I had purchased from them way before now because they're they're weed is just completely different than anything else I've had on the entire Florida cannabis market so far it's completely different let's check this out [Music] there's there's a lot of plastic waste here that's for sure but you know that's from every dispensary I have about an ounce and pre-rolls I have thirty pre-rolls which Allah gram he's so little over an ounce and pre-rolls and then I have actually a quarter of actual whole weed right here which we'll take a look at in just a minute as well but first let's let's just take a look at some of these pre-rolls I got pre-rolls because I mean honestly for the price you can't go wrong so let's take a look at what I got here I've got ten joints of Mac one these were coming in at seventeen point three eight percent THC now these Mac one joints are really good these are probably my second favorite pre-roll that I've had from them so far really good strain all the pre-rolls themselves have really burned good so far only three rolls that I've had that haven't burned good so far were ones that were maybe ground up a little bit too much and it didn't want to smoke that good nejoy me because it was as I think Darth Raven was one of those but it was just because it was ground up a little bit too much and that was the other gnat although joint actually smoked really good Darth Raven is the other strain that I got it's coming in actually a little bit higher this time because the first time I got it was only at a 16 percent I believe 18 percent this time a little bit higher that's nice and I also got dirty limits and we're gonna smoke one of those joints right now these this 30 lemons joint coming in at 25 percent THC I mean that is pretty good for for them I haven't seen anything felt that high come out of there yep did see blueberry muffin coming in at 22 percent but mostly everything really looks like has been between like 16 and 20 percent but it has all been extremely extremely good wheat I will definitely be buying more like I said it's come it's a totally different ball game than all the other wheat in Florida they're doing something way different I'm not sure exactly what they're doing front if it's in the soil grow or if it's in the cure but it's definitely it's definitely there you guys so whatever you're doing over there don't change it we can we can tell so let's fire one of these dirty lemon joints up I mean this has been a really good strain it's actually really indica heavy for me this is uh this is definitely one of those indica heavy strains for me I found out I should only smoke this strain at night time for me at least it makes me really tired there's just no other better name for this strain honestly dirty lemons that's that's the first thing you take I mean it's it literally tastes like a dirty lemon on the exhale especially you get this real lemony citrus taste huh followed by this earthy dirty earthy taste I mean there's just no other better name for this rating besides dirty linen whoever named the string nailed it for sure and this is just an awesome phyno of it I mean the taste is just coming through it's just amazing the chirps on this is outrageous all right so let's take a look and talk about some of the prices and take a look at some of the weed the first delivery I actually got from them was right at $300 and it wasn't my first purchase my first purchase was actually the Kim D which you guys may have seen that video it's a whole video about the Kim D but my first actual delivery was right at $300 I did get a little bit of a discount you get the 25% discount for your first time for your first delivery plus you get the $25 off if you spend over $125 so that's the goal to me especially because you know everything from them right now is delivery they only have one dispensary so everything gets delivered straight to you straight to your house which honestly I thought was gonna be a real pain but it wasn't so it actually turned out to be more convenient for me than anything which I didn't expect to go that way so pretty nice on this first one for $300 I had one tier one string quarter four to eight I had six Darth Raven pre-rolls I had ten Mac one pre-rolls and then I had Mendocino Minaj that was pretty good it was kind of low in THC 14% but again still it was it was really really good it honestly is better than a lot of stuff that I've had some truly even at those percentages so it just has to do with the terpenes and and how the you know who's picking the fie nose and all that stuff and who bred it that'll do a lot for you so sharp d the tier one quarter at when you're buying it in a quarter and not just an eighth price a Nathan's gonna cost you $68 she has kind of expensive but when you buy it in a quarter it's a hundred and twenty bucks and it just keeps getting cheaper from there you can get an ounce of this for the three hundred and sixty eight dollars it is I believe it's under four hundred dollars but when you bite in an ounce like that you earn excuse me an ounce when you buy it in an ounce it's just it's way cheaper that's nice that they're doing ounce discounts that really can make a difference especially when you're buying like that that is hitting that hit really hard real fast Wow and then you can see on here the Darth Raven one gram joints were eight dollars apiece great price I mean you can't beat that eight dollars for a gram joint I mean I was even taking these things breaking them down and rolling to half gram joints out of it and getting a really nice joint out of it and still you know I was able to smoke a good joint of some organic real organic weed for four bucks I mean not bad at all or smoked a you know break it went down smoking in a ball it was I wasn't doing bad with that at all men devasena Manoj again eight dollars a gram for a gram joint and then Mac one was the only Tier one joint that I had got for that first go-round and that was $10 a gram totally worth it I'll pay that every time so that's what I had got for my first go-round and honestly the sharp deep flower this just that was just amazing let's take a look at that actually that was only coming in at 15 percent THC but I have to give it to to them on this one this was the absolute best smoke I've had yet in the entire throughout the entire Florida medical program of them having a flower this would be my number one all-around best smoke yet hands down good job you guys [Music] I was really really happy with that one so the second purchase that I did was just over actually it was well it was about three hundred and fifty dollars here so $25 off for a delivery because I got over $125 so that knocked a little bit off so that was nice so again Mac one pre-rolls I of course I loaded up on them you can't go wrong with those the Mac one dirty lemons coming in at 25 percent THC of course that's a Tier one strain ten dollars a gram totally worth it look how far I am into the joint and I am just absolutely feeling fantastic I can you can't go wrong with that Darth ray eight dollars a gram can beat us I mean every joint you get it truly biz 13 dollars a gram right off the bat there's no tear to it or anything like that and you you you know you're getting really the same quality of weed let I actually broke one of these Mac one joints open and it's just amazing what's inside let's take a look real quick [Music] [Music] it's absolutely packed with just trichome heads and keep you can see it all throughout the joint like I said I was breaking those joints open and just packing bowls or rolling half joints and I was doing great like that and making this build a long way for the price that's it's um it's one of the probably the one of the best purchases I've made so far - really really good and of course I got some Mandarin triangle cush it's an ethos string I can't you know I can't not fight that I you guys know that I'm a big fan of Colin Gordon and I always have to pick up his strain if it's a hit one of his strains if it's available wherever I go I always try to see what is coming out it's just absolutely beautiful there are some big nugs in here - check this out [Music] [Music] very sweet with some very subtle earthy tones but mostly mostly just sweet you can really smell that Mandarin awesome awesome stuff coming in at 20.4% THC not too bad you know I really think that you know the THC percentages might be coming in a little bit lower because they're of their soil growing everything but let me tell you what whatever they're doing over there soil growing or something with I don't know what they're doing over there like I said but I hope they don't change it because it has been the absolute best flower so far I've had on the market that's no lie I really hope you guys don't change anything over there please so the Mandarin triangle cush coming in at $84 for a quarter when you buy a quarter it's a tier 2 strain but to me honestly all the tiers have been good I haven't had a single bad thing from them yet that I didn't like even with the TAC percentages being low like that it's all just been felt like I said this this herb D at 15% has been my favorite smoked yet so there's there's definitely something to the terpenes and phyno picking and the breeding and all that it there's definitely something to all of that for sure the biggest difference is to me and the weed that I've had from one plant is really the first thing that you notice of course is when you touch it and you break it open and you see it you can visually see the trichomes on this it's not like it's missing trichomes and when you break it apart you're actually left with your finger sticky like you know it's it's actually the bud stick it's cured right there doing a different curing process over there than they are at truly for cure leaf whatever they're doing to cure this bud is the correct way to cure it and trim it it's just it's not lacking and and the stickiness at all it's this there it makes your fingers actually sticky this would pass the wall test and the other thing is it doesn't burn my throat now there's something about all that but this is extremely less harsh on my throat I mean in a major way I'm not sure what the difference is when it comes to that if it has to do with it with the nutrients maybe if a plant growth regulars I really have no clue but there is a major difference in this bud when it comes to that and if anybody has any insight or clue as to what that may be that I'm talking about with the harshness of the bud and smoking it please leave a comment in the comment sections I would really like to do a video about that talk about that more in the future so for a grand total of three hundred and thirty nine dollars after my discount this is what I got a quarter of the Mandarin triangle cush and thirty of the pre rolls which of course is what is you know it's ten nine grams over an ounce that's uh thirty seven grams of weed or three hundred and thirty nine dollars in my opinion you can't go wrong with that so good job you guys at one plan I just I have to give it to you I'm extremely happy with what I've been buying especially like I said with the bud that's it for today's video you guys I hope you enjoyed it and remember to Like and subscribe if you did and remember tried to guess the the grams how many grams are in the jar each video will give you a new chance like I said to actually guess on that and I think that would be pretty fun so we'll see you guys next time [Music] [Music]", "ms2KIpHWzp0": "small farms run by families have played a significant role in the history of the united states and remain a cornerstone of the country's culture even today as the country continues to lead the world in exporting agricultural commodities the country still has farms operated by small families the country however has rapidly urbanized farms are consolidated and also improved their yields to meet demands and maintain profitability however young people are increasingly moving away from farm life as well as rural areas in this video we're going to discuss the reasons why family farms are nearing extinction but before we get into this video don't forget to leave a like and subscribe to the channel with notifications on so you don't miss any of the new videos we post what are the statistics of farming in the u.s the united states have more than two million farms that are vary greatly in size and characteristics a farm's annual gross revenue can be as little as 1 000 to 2 million the specific commodities vary from one farm to another but small farms tend to produce poultry as well as eggs and hay mid-size to large farms produce oil seed cotton and cash grains large-scale farms produce most of the country's dairy large-scale and non-family farms dominate the production of beef as well as have high-value crops such as vegetables trees fruits nuts as well as greenhouse and nursery products according to research family farms remain an integral part of agriculture in the country several family farm households combine farm and off farm work to get income and other benefits what is the difference between family farms and industrial or large scale farms family farms produce food without using hormones pesticides and antibiotics antibiotics are only administered as sick animals and farmers also pull the sick from the herd before treating it and the meat is no longer labeled as organic once antibiotics have been administered family farms see and acknowledge the importance of protecting the natural environment and they act as stewards of the land sustainable farmers only raise what the land is capable of and they muse manure as fertilizer for crops doing this eliminates the need for chemicals and commercial fertilizers they protect and conserve their water source and only apply animal manure at the rate that the land can handle no hormones are administered on animals they raise a wide range of animal breeds depending on the geographic areas where they are raised family farms mostly see their products through local farmers markets or agriculture programs supported by the community now let's talk about industrial farms there is a routine use of antibiotics and industrial farms not only prevent disease but also to promote growth the overuse of antibiotics may lead to antibiotic resistance humans who consume these products are at risk because antibiotics are less effective on them industrial facilities lead to numerous environmental issues such as damage to soil water and air industrial livestock production results in a large number of animals concentrated in one area there's too much manure for the land to handle so it's stockpiled or placed into large holding pits instead of being used as a fertilizer manure becomes something that must be disposed of liquid and manure also often ends up as raw untreated sewage that's sprayed onto crops and land the storage of manure emits various gases such as methane hydrosulfate and ammonia it can cause noxious odors as well as variety of health problems factory farms are standardized and specialized the mono crop fields and their industrial processes are inherently sequential and linear raw material flows in and waste materials flow out the animals on factory farms are treated as machines and not living beings deserving of respect dignity and human treatment industrial operations also require a large amount of drinking water for animals liquefying manure and flushing barns livestock manure also pollutes surface water more compared to human waste industrial operations frequently contaminate water sources with excess nutrients we could go on but we're quite sure at this point you already understand why family farms are better than industrial farms however there has been a rise of factory farms and it's threatened to wipe out family farms off the map the family farms in the u.s are no longer like how people imagine them on holiday greeting cards a family farm of today is no longer the prosperous and picturesque property it has been declining for generations and the last quarter of 2019 saw small family farms getting pummeled on every side because of various things in the midwest alone chapter farm 12 bankruptcies were up 12 percent from july 2018 until july 2019 they're also up 50 in the northwest small farmers were left with no choice but to just stop farming no matter how they try to reorganize through bankruptcy it won't save them the united states lost more than a hundred thousand farms between 2011 and 2018 and 12 000 of those were between 2017 and 2018 alone as of november 2019 farm debt has reached 416 billion dollars which is at an all-time high since 2013 more than 50 percent of farmers have lost money every year and they lost more than sixteen hundred and forty four dollars in 2019 farm loans delinquencies are on the rise this may be one of the reasons why suicides and farm communities are occurring with alarming frequency technology is resulting in more and more farmers being displaced although they are not the only american workers losing their jobs they suffer the fate of being ejected from their homes and the land that's been in their family for generations farmers have not shied away from discussing the looming disaster however the current crisis suggests a possibility which once unthinkable to many and that's the idea that independent farming is no longer a viable option small farms are defined as one that brings in less than 350 000 a year before expenses from almost 50 percent of food production in 1991 small farms only accounted for just a quarter of the food production in 2007. in the dairy industry small farms are responsible for only 10 percent of the production rural america has been struggling to maintain an economic base for years but the extinction of small farms is only hasten this decline experts say there's a perfect storm of factors that have led to the recent crisis after some probability in the years beginning in the 21st century the prices for major commodities such as milk soybeans meat and corn have started falling the reasons for this are technology and globalization with technology farms have been more efficient than ever before all but less sustainable than smaller family farms even as the number of small family farms continue to decline from 1948 to 2015 the total output has more than doubled globalization also brought farmers into the international market for crops they flooded the market with milk corn soybeans and cattle this has increased supply and lowered prices significantly it also seems that farming has become an incredibly difficult occupation and is not a very lucrative career path in 2012 the average age of an american farmer was 60 years old as farmers retire and pass away successive generations turned their attention elsewhere to look for jobs farmland also goes fallow and is most often sold off sometimes people earn more money just selling the land than farming it this is especially true for farmlands that are near town or city the collapse of small family farms has also been driven by the rise of concentrated animal feeding operations industrial farms have pigs chickens and cows crammed by the thousands into rows of barns most of these industrial farms are automated beating's not done by hand but rather by computer and the animals are monitored by video workers pay animals periodic visits and they do so by driving through several operations the united states has approximately 250 000 factory farms of different kinds they establish a roots in 1930s with the mechanization of pig slaughterhouses by the time the 50s came around chickens were also routinely packed into large seds often in appalling conditions by the 1970s then u.s agriculture secretary earl bunts promoted the idea of large-scale farming with the slogan get big or get out butts wanted to see farmers embracing what he demanded as more efficient strategy of growing crops such as soybeans and corn the campaign resulted in farmers making investment in land as well as new machinery to increase their production corporate agriculture has taken over the entire production line as factory farms spread they started dictating the workings of slaughterhouses huge operations replaced family farms missouri for example used to have 23 000 independent pig farmers in 1985. however today only 2 000 of these independent pig farmers remain independent cattle farmers had decreased by 40 over the same period the trade war during trump's presidency also didn't help matters after the u.s slapped china with terrorists china retaliated 25 tariffs on agriculture imports from the u.s the chinese then turned to other countries such as brazil to replace the soybeans and corns they previously got from the u.s it was a market that took years to develop that was destroyed in just a few minutes farmers ended up with soybeans sitting in grain elevators waiting to be bought agriculture exports decreased by five percent translating to over five billion dollars to be fair the trump administration made 16 billion dollars available to those who have been affected by the trade war but small farmers complained that the bulk of the money went to huge producers that suffered great crop losses small farmers have found it quite a challenge to adopt to the changes and have mentioned that the government is on the side of big farms it still remains to be seen whether family farms will be able to succeed but things aren't looking too promising right now do you think industrial farms are better than family farms what do you think can be done to help family farms all over the country let us know in the comments section below stay safe and we'll see in the next video", "b3TKEz3sLrI": "hey what's up you guys shadows here again with another episode of shadows weed review today on our show we got our new co-host th see you next tuesday hey what's up you guys and we are gonna be going over bonsai by the ball family farms now this one is weighing in at 21.1 percent thc 0 cbd 24.98 total cannabinoids and it was 55 and it was labeled as a sativa now the reason why we got this one because normally i just looking at this i probably wouldn't have gotten this one but but it was a discount day and they were like oh 30 off everything so i'm like give me all the ones because usually i kind of narrow it down just by my visualization because right now you can't smell anything he narrows it down to l.a questions from claire clayborne oh geez let's be real yeah and maybe well you know i've this is the times when i try other stuff so to save you guys the money you know what i mean so i went and i got all these other ones here even the ones that look kind of questionable just so i could show you guys everything so that's why i got this one it was even more pricey than the la cush so that's putting it up to a really high standard you guys so we have already opened this and smoked this we have already given giving it a good try but we're going to reopen it for you guys and we're going to give you guys a fair our fair shake yeah so right out of the gate what does that smell like to you yeah it definitely smells like it smells old yeah it has a little bit of old smell but it has a very strong piney smell and if you love piney bud this one's right up your alley it's very piney it's got purple hues on it and it's strong enough you smell it right out of the gate now i will say that it is a little does smell a little bit old um but it's a good string it's just a little bit old but look at these nuts they're old because you had them for a long time or is it old because that's how it came i've only had it for like three days open so it's not okay yeah so i mean the nugs look pretty good the leaf to calyx to leaf ratio on it's really good they've been manicured pretty good and i mean check that out the trichomes on it look pretty far i mean it looks pretty doesn't look like what it says it is it looks good it looks better it smells not good though you don't like the smell because it smells a little old it smells like almost like bud mold to me okay let's get inside that nug oh oh that's much better yeah when you break it up it definitely has a citrusy tiny and like floral almost to me very very piney like this smells almost like a christmas tree lot like this smells really good great christmas bud we didn't buy it at christmas yeah but it would be a good christmas time bud because it has that smell and uh this dude's obsessed with the christmas smells and the christmas stuff i love christmas i'm like clark griswold at christmas man i love all that stuff so check this out so we're going to check this best nug underneath the microscope and see just how well it's been handled and cured now look at that you guys one thing i will say about this it it is covered with trichome but there's not very many heads on here i see one yeah i didn't see yeah it looks like a field of grass oh i see one yeah there there's some inside but for the most part it's been handled somebody finger [ __ ] that [ __ ] yeah it's been handled rather rough like somebody's either handled it too much when it was trimming or whatnot or during the curing process somewhere along the line it's been handled a little bit rough and a lot of those trichomes were taken off maybe they were shaken off to be put in a power pack to boost up some of their schnigel fritz that they're trying to get some money for you know what i mean maybe that's what maybe that's the name or something but yeah that's what he lets me smoke hey my snickel fritz is like og remnants okay like it's not that bad okay so this this one's by the ball family farms they have a lot of like miyagi dough and bonsai and a lot of going towards the the japanese heritage no they're going towards the kober kai marketing because they know people are eating that crap up right now let's be honest if you guys haven't seen cobra kai check it out kobokai is a great show also they're not sponsoring us either hey we're over here but that's what the this brand is going for it's that whole cobra cat i'm surprised i don't have to sweep the leg [ __ ] sleep the leg oh gee it'll knock your feet out from undies so good like oh man that would be awesome that would be awesome marketing ideas yeah and why do they have miyagido miyagi does the weak wussy one man nah dude once you've

day and y'all just dragging in here about one o'clock in the evening uh anyway we're trying to fix or i'm trying to do a lot of things i'm trying to spread some lime and i'm trying to fix some big holes in a field in the new field down on bent road the new farm that i got it's gonna it's like 60 70 acre farm um i'm trying to get lime down on it i've got five loads of lime there actually i've done spread one of the loads so one and a half of them so i don't have that many there now but anyway i'm trying to get some dirt to fill in some big holes i don't know how people farm with big holes in their fields i guess they just drive around them but i don't do that i mean we got holes like this like foot deep not fun when you hit them with a tractor so anyway i need some topsoil everything's kind of getting dried out we've had no rain for like two weeks and we it's just now starting to get dry enough that we can start doing things this week uh we've been able to do a lot quite a bit this week anyway both the uh newer cat loaders are busy one screen in topsoil and the other one has the fork grapple on it i think that's what it was doing um log grapple on it that i used on my logs anyway so i'm going to use this old ford a64 dad said it's ready to go he's already been using it so [Music] it already gets the job done it's not exactly it's not exactly an ideal machine to run all day but if you got a few things you need to do like just load one dump truck load of dirt it'll do the job hmm so bye so so you're probably thinking why is he filling his bucket that way why are you why are you pushing it up the pile like that instead of just gouging into the side of the pile well this stuff's so wet [Music] it's been wet so long went down deep so what we're trying to do is skim off the top we've been spreading the top out letting it dry so we're just trying to skim dirt off the top of it get some of the dryer stuff off then we'll spread out some more let it dry oh this thing don't have any breaks really so i have to be really careful on the grammy you have to use the force and reverse lever to stop yourself this was the first row retired loader my dad bought [Music] my dad does never get rid of anything [Music] all right so i got that loaded up uh i didn't get a real big load i didn't want a big load just kind of a three-quarters of a load on this truck uh this is the truck that dad with an accident in they did a good job fixing it back it looks good he hit a hit a car car run out in front of him and he hit it right here mashed all this back broke the match that front axle back about a foot but this is actually the same hood they did a good job fixing this hood it was busted all right in here how in the world they fixed it i don't know it's fiberglass but i mean they did a good job on it we we wanted a new hood and they wanted to put a new hood on it but they could not this was a western star dealer now they couldn't find the hood on this truck a new hood a used hood no hood they couldn't find a hood at all they were going to total they were going to have the insurance company total this truck because they couldn't find a hood for it and uh my dad said the heck that's a that's the best truck i got y'all ain't totaling that truck so uh he said i'll sign a paper saying if the hood cracks if y'all fix it uh i'll sign paper saying if the hood cracks i won't hold y'all responsible for it but fix it back the best you can they've done a good job on it i don't know how long it'll last but it looks good right now all right let's get this dirt out here to the field get back into john deere and get back to spreading some lime look at this operation here dad and uh shawn there's sean running the loader dad this is a top soil screening machine there loading the art truck he sells a lot of top score top store sells a lot of sells a lot of screen to topsoil it is where it's been dry last two weeks that's all he's doing every night is running that screening machine kind of like me in the firewood machine when it's you know when it's in season that's all you do is run it which fortunately i've been uh fortunate to have brian help me out this year i've sold more wood than i ever have since i've been doing this it's crazy but i'm very thankful so anyway long there's a load of topsoil in that little top kick straight axle truck uh there's one of the trucks that peterbilt was hauling line to me and there's a mac there's a mac gonna be bringing michael and his new mac will be bringing the last little live i went and got one load of lime this morning on this truck but uh then i started spreading once i got that line there uh michael got me three loads of lime yesterday so uh he had to take some he had to take some dirt up the galax anyway so he was stopping back by going to austinville getting the line on the way back so i spread those three three loads and he got me yesterday i spread them when i got home from work i got done at midnight last night and then we went back out at seven this morning and i was on my way to get another load so michael will be bringing the fifth load for today so that'll be uh eight loads total and i still don't know that i'm gonna have enough but 16 tons per load 16.5 tons i still don't know that i'm gonna have enough putting two tons of the acres so we'll just have to see all right see how it feels okay so we are here in the one of the part of the field and i'm trying to get to those holes that i was referring to without crashing into one of them um there's just random holes everywhere right in this area i don't know if there were trees here probably were one time because there's just like random stump holes and then there's a couple of great big holes down here which i'm going to go down here and uh dump this dirt into the big holes as my plan so i'm just trying to get to them without it's getting kind of steep right here trying to hold the camera level you can see the the way the truck is sitting right there is a whole rock ledge and then down there is a hole so you're probably not going to see it but trust me there's a hole i want to bite down there and dump this load of dirt in it and then i'm going to go back to spreading lime and once uh get the lime spread we'll start working on these big holes i want to dip up some of the dirt out of the uh piles of this pile that i drop and put in some of the random stump holes also but these big holes down here they need quite a bit of dirt so that's why i want to dump the dirt in them i might jump out here and show you what i'm talking about stop right here i want to make sure i'm at the right spot anyway i don't want to dump it hold up where it don't need it but let's see here no this wasn't a spot where's it at oh here it is i need to go past that spot and i don't know if y'all can tell there's kind of a depression here but there is a rather large hole right here in the ground let's try to get it from the side i don't know if they it's like dropped off about eight inches here goes down and back up it's like somebody took a scoop out right here but i don't know what maybe they i bet they dug a hole with buried trash and now it's falling in it's probably what happened so look at this place they didn't mow this second cut and you got briars like this all that stuff's gonna have to go away before i can get good hay out of here so anyway uh this place goes on as far as you can see out there and then down over the hill and keeps going and goes up that way as far as you can see it's just a big place all right let's dump this stuff which is this one you got to push the clutch in uh this is the tailgate then this raises the bed [Music] i'm not going to stop i'm not going to stop i'm going up the steep hill and i don't want to get stuck hopefully it'll go so far so good it's pretty dry right now if it was wet i'd say no way it was pretty dry i don't think there's any danger getting stuck as long as i keep big old moving ledge right here it ain't too bad it's not something that'll tear up a mower i don't think may look into taking it out later but i don't know this used to be at one time when i was a kid this was a big [Music] air conditioner built squealing like crazy tighten it up apparently uh get out of there there's your pressure just locked up um oh this used to be a big flower farms and moms said that they had uh what they said tulips i think it was all tulips and they they sold tulip bulbs all over the world i mean this place this place is huge it's huge can you imagine having 60 acres of tulips that's just crazy anyway there's old cemetery somebody must mow it and maintain it there's a corn field here the guy that does the corn is going to keep doing corn he's the guy that used to do the hay here but he's not going to do it anymore but he's still gonna do the corn um this is just this place is it's just big and we'll get up here the massey ferguson's sitting right up here and the john deere's over here we'll get up here we can look over into the other side of it yeah the other side of it so anyway i'll check back y'all say okay so we just came from way over there to cemeteries right there and the road that the entrance road goes around the mountain here and there's a there's a house you might could see it right through the woods there but the road goes around and back out to the to the state road but uh when you get up here you can see back out in the other half of the field and it goes i would say from here it's a half a mile back there to that wood line uh and it actually goes back in on the left side goes back into the wood line aways and then you go it goes over to the right side and there's kind of a valley in the middle but anyway right there's my lime tractor i'm loading line with john deere pulling the stoltz foose anyway let me get my coffee out of the dump truck we'll start spreading some lime i've been using the camera system that's working good for me so far i've been using it to actually be able to see and it's up high enough on the cab i can see into the spreader good enough to tell when it's when it's empty i've got the grapple not necessarily using it on this tractor probably put it on the other one i just used it this tractor to haul it out here and i hadn't taken it off yet so and the camera made it a lot easier to put that grapple on so i just realized some of you that didn't see my camera video it's probably like how does that camera on the back of the tractor help you see to put this grapple on well i got a camera on the front of the tractor too just to see the coupler to do stuff like that so that's what i'm talking about if you don't know what i'm talking about that's what i'm talking about got it good so here's the view from the camera you can see that i can see over in there i can actually see uh at the back of the spreader where everything goes to the empties i can see almost always the floor so i can tell when it's empty uh i've thought about putting a power cable on the spreader somewhere maybe run it to the back so i can watch out the back of the spreader or putting one right on the front lip so i can look directly in the spreader those are a couple things i've thought about because these cameras are wireless all you gotta have is two two wires to power it and that's easy enough to do uh once you get power the the uh signal to the monitor is automatic so and it works really good so far i mean it's just and then you know i got you can you can use up four uh cameras on here here's the other channel on the front you can see the view on there the cat the picture is a lot clearer in person than it is trying to look at it through a camera looking at another camera obviously but here's a double view you can see them both at once uh but they kind of squish them up make them look kind of funny so i like either being on one or the other uh if you have four three or four cameras you can put like you can put all four of them on there and they look normal they're just smaller like on your cell phone they a smaller screen this is within the four this is a seven inch display hd 1080p 1080p hd hey i'm in a mood today i just i've been drinking coffee and i just left the house ate some watch a little bit ago and i'm kind of wide open right now and got a lot to do and less time to do it then so anyway hold on for rides you", "XoyxyivrJhI": "well what are y'all doing today we're imitating madison county hitchhikers we need a tire [Applause] [Music] down [Music] you know i don't think there's anything prettier in the fall than a maple tree ah they're gorgeous wish we had more of them i think it's friday november 6. we're back at it again today we've got about another 10 acres left on uh on this farm you can see we're surrounded by subdivisions this used to be like a 30 acre farm when i started working it now it's down to about 15 acres see right there where they took another section out about to build houses on it i really hate to see that because that is productive crop land that will never see a crop grown on it again you know what they're saying is they ain't making any more land at some point we're gonna get to a tipping point to where there might not be enough crop ground to support the world if cropland keeps on getting taken out of production to build houses home and development i'm taking a walk on the wild side today not wearing my boots wearing my teeny shoes instead decided to change it up a little i'm proud to say that i've owned those teeny shoes since i was in college almost 20 years ago yeah i'm a cheapskate although i will say i will say that those are not my going out shoes those have been relegated to my work shoes because only a couple years ago we had crop on all that now houses going up as quick as slides well we hope to pass the two-thirds mark of cotton harvest today we started today having picked about 400 out of the 630 acres of cotton we got we haven't been having a real good run run of luck uh the last three to four days on getting a lot of acres covered today we've been doing anywhere from about 35 to 45 acres a day just due to a bunch of different stuff you know fire on the cod picker fire the module break down on the module builder break down on the bush hole uh having to move farms just you know you know the chain on the bull bug you break in it's been a bunch of little stuff nothing really major just a bunch of little stuff it costs it costs us an hour or two each day so hopefully our luck was changing today and we can get a full day of running in i'd love to see about about 50 acres done or outside possibilities maybe get 55 acres done right now if everything goes according to plan hopefully we'll get done kiki cotton probably late monday early tuesday i think we've got rain forecast to come in possibly wednesday uh last i saw about a 40 50 chance of rain on wednesday i'd give anything to have all this cotton out of the field by the time the next rain comes in ever since hurricane zeta moved out of the way uh last thursday we've had sunny skies and some really nice weather i sure would love to see you hold out about another three weeks and then hopefully we get everything done after we get to after we get the next four to five days of cotton in we'll be done with cotton we got about two and a half days of wheat planting that we gotta do got about another 250 acres a week then we got 500 acres of double crop soybeans to cut which if we have dry weather we can move along through them pretty good we get probably 80 to 100 acres a day a soybean is good if it's dry and sunny but in order to cut soybeans we got to have a kind vine the least period on our riddle combine is up i mean we could rent it for another 15 days and 50 hours i don't know if 50 hours would cover getting our wheat beans down but it cost me another 10 thousand dollars and that's the that's ten thousand dollars that insurance won't pay insurance would pay for the first period but they got a limit of a total of ten thousand dollars on a rental machine so i called yesterday on my on my combine and they're working on it they said it might be kind of tight deadline to get it in at the time frame i'm won so i don't know exactly what we're going to do i guess we'll cross that bridge and get there the biggest reason i like to have my combine back is after what it went through i'd love to see it in the field again this year just to make sure that everything's been fixed right on it making sure that there's nothing hidden on it uh you know why you know any kind of gremlins waiting to pop out last thing i would do is go into wheat harvest next summer thinking my combine's all right and then we get it in the field for a day or so and find out oops we uh we got something else got to be fixed on it all right i got two options for you for our post harvest getaway okay one uh we could uh go up to uh kentucky go to lvl go riding for a couple of days stay at the resort the section the second option is when we've done it before but we've never done it close to christmas time is go see the biltmore in north carolina is your memory dog because we did do that man we it's that we did it after christmas time we didn't do it before christmas time i don't recall seeing a bunch of christmas decorations up yeah i'd have to go back and look at my memories but i know we did it i know we did it in the winter i just don't remember when we went so yeah i don't know yes we did do it in the winter i think it was like january though all the christmas stuff was done with and as i recall they have some pretty good wine there too my options are that i get to go possibly freeze my butt off and ride in a mud infested and fun little area where travel north carolina is the fancy house with franklin that don't act great you don't like going and laying in the mud or and riding riding razors and don't don't forget about the big pork chops they got at matty's okay here's the thing though i never get to drive i'm always a passenger all right you gonna buy a razor you can drive okay i mean you wouldn't bought one you better start selling some more photographs man all i need to do is help you honey and it's fun or how about this i'll sell i'll sell you mine and current market value and i'll go get a new one hey if we go riding i can invite all my buddies to go along too it'd really be a good time um we don't even have a combine yet to get our beans out so who knows when this is going to happen what do you say you two what do you all think what should we do should we go riding side-by-side in the mountains enjoy the great outdoors should we go tour the biltmore mansion which we've already done honestly either way i'll be happy as long as we ain't on the farm i'll be happy well we just got done with this farm and since it's right around noon we're in the middle of jackson we're going to take advantage of what the city has to offer and right around the corner is a good barbecue place got some hot plate lunches we've been eating nothing but cold sandwiches for lunch for a while so we're gonna take a few minutes to go and go get us a hot lunch uh here we are oh pretty big crowd hope we don't get just the leftovers hopefully they let us in since we don't have our pandemic masks well if they don't then i guess i'm getting a hot plate lunch to go all right we're about to head back out to the subdivision out to four lane and on to the next farm uh cause traffic on the four lane is picked up drastically and it's it's hard to get out on the four lane even in car truck we called the jackson police department to come out here and help and help us with traffic so we could safely get out on the road last time coming over here with equipment see how many trash cans i can take out all right we're gonna wait here for a few until the officer gets here and he should be here shortly because we are moving on a very busy road the um police are escorting us out to highland avenue which is a extremely extremely dangerous and busy road so we're getting a police escort so my dad is in front of matt in the service truck uh then you got matt and the picker zach is in the module builder in front of me and roy is behind me in the bush hog we love our man in blue or in his case black i don't know 17. dad it's 17 miles an hour on the picker zach is 22 i'm 31 and uh i think the bush hog goes about 18. so really it's really i'm the one who needs to be in front that's the way to do it thank you jackson please all right so here's the road the police officer is standing in front and he's stopping traffic this is a burst this is pretty awesome first time in our lives we get a police officer uh celebrities coming through watch out thank you we make your cotton underwear people get out of our way now i gotta lie this is pretty freaking thank cool this is awesome we got a police escort this is great oh this is so cool it makes life a little easier considering the traffic is so bad on a friday and it's lunchtime yeah um so zach's older two cancer in the truck with my dad now what's the way to do it i feel special there's lots of traffic that's gonna pass pretty fast on our left so be careful where they gonna put these mailboxes so close to the road i don't want to be charged with a federal offense for taking one out all right we're through the we're to the worst part of jackson it's all easy sailing from here so i'll go ahead and speed this up for y'all get to the next field right about now and i know what you're thinking they look like a cotton field to me and it's not our cotton's back here in the back i don't even know what day of cotton we're on like 7 8 12. she's forever i mean look at those beans beautiful if i don't say so myself see it's like a sense of pride when you you do wow those are those are nice not bad for double crop beans can't wait to harvest those we ever get a combine so now we're going to go back here and there's about 90 acres of cotton i don't know where we're gonna build uh it's up to matt i think um probably build on this road first until we get a spot clear look at the fall colors though it's pretty although they're slowly dwindling away mandela won't you look at that wow got some fighting 360 right here i wasn't expecting it to look this good we'll see what it picks though well everything was going pretty smoothly they probably no wheels here in west tennessee not sure what we're going to do had a blowout well what are y'all doing today we're imitating madison county hitchhikers we need a tire [Laughter] well the calvary arrived put the power on we got new rim from uh farmers in luckily they had one stick it on we'll be back up and going in shortly all right we uh got tyrone got it down the road and over here where we got the other module builder maybe shortly okay so fast forward uh the module builder that zach was bringing over the tire blew out on the side of the road room in the rim so we went over there and matt called everybody to get it fixed so they finally brought it over now the bush hog drive shaft is broke so um while i try and pick some more rows to maneuver these module builders in he's gonna go look at that drive shaft because zach and i couldn't get it off so hi i'm your picker driver today we got this going on the bush all wheel bearings down your drive shaft down so zach and i are working on this getting all this repaired and let kelly run the cotton picker for a while [Applause] well another day that i wasn't planning on making a video but once again circumstances dictate that i do finally got the module builder moved over we got the wheel bearings and the drive shaft disassembled on bush hog and zach has gone to get parts so in the meantime it's just going to be me kelly and kelly's dad out here picking cotton another beautiful day that it feels like we've wasted about half of it working on junk [Music] but what can you do deal with everything as it comes along and try to make the best of it that's about all we can do all right finally after one of the crummiest freaking weeks we've had breakdown after breakdown after tire blow out after the hydraulic line hopefully god and hopefully we have found the light at the end of the tunnel and finally i think it's good and not spending four hours a day [Music] so we're out here 75 degrees t-shirt wind blowing thank you all right so this block that we're in now is one of the two fields i've been really excited about this year i've been doing all the spraying on all our cotton ground this year so i've been putting eyes on it about every 10 days this field that we're in now it's a 91 acre block it did extremely well last year in corn it put us over like 210 average on this farm coming out of this bottom ground we've got phytogen 360 i believe that's what it is here this year it is loaded from top to bottom and since about july i've been ready to get a picker out here just to see how good it's doing i haven't asked matt what it's doing yet but i would imagine just from the looks of it can't really see it out there it's loaded top to bottom and i'm really ready to see i know you won't we won't know anything until it runs to the gin but looking at it from right here it looks like some outstanding time [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] hey well it seems like everything's running pretty smoothly now finally got our groove going about time it got dark so about seven o'clock here so i reckon we gonna i'm gonna sign off for today and go ahead and turn everything over to the night shift hey everybody got the night shift here as you saw in one of our previous videos and night shift i always like to have a little bit more fun than what the day shift does we'll be taking you all the way through tonight or at least until it gets too wet that we can't do no more well zach just got back with the parts or at least the parts that people had in stock got a drive shaft borrowed from one of my buddies because of this cv joint probably going to be special order and i don't have the time right now to tear it down and uh the local parts house didn't have one of the one the seals or one of the bearings for the wheels so luckily they'll be open uh tomorrow morning saturday morning we'll go and get it then and get everything put back together on the bush hog in the morning hopefully anyway carter this cotton picker is 17 years old it does not have multiple usb outlets and cigarette lighters we'll put my phone over there no well look at your phone it's like 100 the entire day you can't even see it no it hasn't because we were broke down on the side of the road all afternoon that don't mean nothing well it means it wasn't on the charts for [Music] you're sitting

"-54TZqGg_oM": "hey everybody siobhan here with the grow sisters a friend and mentor of mine recently suggested that i do a know your farmer for my farm so welcome to bless coast farms located here in humboldt county my family in 2016 was the first to receive a cannabis cultivation permit as second generation cannabis farmers this was a massive change that we embraced with open arms our family supported legalization as we believed it would bring affordable medication to all patients thrilled with the opportunity to cultivate cannabis legally my sister sloane reed and i started filming it was important to us to humanize and decriminalize the farmers behind cannabis cultivation in humboldt county and so was born the grow sisters sloane and i created a series of cannabis cultivation educational videos some educational some just sisters being silly sisters but always from the heart this summer was one of my favorite summers of my entire life [Music] the next season sloane was not able to return to the farm due to changes in proposition 64 which prohibited anyone under 21 to work on a cannabis farm this was the year that i found a deep passion to educate the public about what we as small farmers were facing on ground level of the exploding cannabis industry so i toured the countryside speaking at multiple conferences and cannabis cups i covered a plethora of topics sustainable cultivation craft cannabis cannabis culture social media social media and cannabis regulations and taxes the list is long [Music] returning back home from the conference circuit to produce multiple how to grow your own cannabis videos under the sister grow your own summer project you can find all of these videos on youtube i found value in attending and speaking at these conferences yet i realized that the growth sister community here on social media is just as powerful if not more in hearing about farmers stories during this time california voted yes on proposition 64. this gave craft canvas farmers a five-year head start by capping the acreage to each farm with no notice proposition 64 was changed overnight and california cannabis production began to become monopolized by large industrial operations we witnessed a very concerning economic drop in humboldt county as we watched family farms disappear this year 2019 on bless coast farms we decided to furlough our license strategically waiting out the storm each farm i visit and get to create content with it reminds me of the immense dedication it takes to produce craft cannabis the sacrifices these farmers make the beauty in farming the legitimacy of their love for the plant you can see why i am so passionate now more than ever it is important to know your farmer because your dollar is your vote hello we're hogwash farms sitting here with eric martin jill mcclure and we're at our homestead out in southern humboldt california what's special about my homestead and my farm i enjoy planting seeds it doesn't matter what type of seeds they are i'm notorious for planting lots of seeds and next thing after that you have to find a place for all these seeds to go and i seem to over plant every year and have for years i enjoy having more than just cannabis flowers i love all kinds of flowers we cultivate seed grown cannabis from strains that we specifically make ourselves there are no strains other than these strains from our farm on any other farms every year we make new phenos and new strains to bring new products with new smells and new flavors and potencies to the market what really makes the products that we make at humboldt alchemy group special is that they come from quality conscious farms and specifically hogwash farms and the phenotypes and the profiles that we're cultivating that's what really makes formal documentary special to me is knowing that i'm bringing it from my farm to the factory and then also straight to the consumer and i'm not subbing it out to big business to put a big brand name on it i really believe that the consumer needs to know where their products come from and craft beer has its place and craft cannabis will have its place just as much i think craft cannabis is no different than any craft of any sort i've done textiles i've done gardening for food for medicine i think it's all the same so when people talk about craft it's like really i feel like we need to continue having that because usually you know where it's coming from how is it grown how was it made and you have more of an interaction with the producer which could be the farmer it's i think it's essential when you start you start losing it when you get into all this big corporation and everything's mass production then you lose it you know you find out later that a lot of this product that's out there is not healthy for us and i don't know why we have to keep repeating this cycle with it but that's just how we need to be small and you do anything large you lose it yeah there's a lot of a lot of uh a lot of things go out the window when you scale up um for me i think that you know for cultivating cannabis as i was saying a little while ago just about about the character that comes with individual cannabis plants in over the spectrum of the phenos instead of having them be cloned and operated we grow from seed due to the fact that cannabis plants are a lot like humans they're also that they have personalities and character defects as well as they have positive character effects that bring them the same sort of composure that human beings do that's why cannabis is so well married with the human body itself and why we have cannabis receptors inside of our dna my mom cultivated cannabis and she would grow very little because that's there wasn't a lot of seeds and access to plants so you know a large harvest back then would be three to four pounds of cannabis that maybe would sell for four to five hundred dollars a pound back in 72-73 and we continued to cultivate cannabis from the very early days of the 70s all the way until 2019 to this day and i've been involved in the cannabis cultivation since i was a small toddler and never ever left humboldt county and spent every year cultivating cannabis and now i'm 49. i'm a cultivator third generation humboldt county um born and raised my ancestors came here tumble county in the 1870s i first got into cultivation as a young child because my mother was doing some she left for two weeks and she ended up leaving me a note with the whole schedule of what i was supposed to be watering and tending to and then when i was uh in high school wanted to go to college but didn't have the fun so i my last year of high school ended up doing some growing and ended up not being able to attend college the first semester due to needing to be here for the harvest and the whole process that goes into that and then to actually sell so i could get some money to move and go to college and so that was like the beginning of what i went through those times were hard those times were not um glamorous whatsoever growing up everything was real secretive um you always knew that if there the law could come at any time and you were just gonna have to deal with that with whatever way you had to do and you were always just always looking to see who was around you you didn't talk about stuff on the phone you just didn't talk about any anything um so being here talking about this is not is really challenging and as i got older um i did after college i decided i was that wasn't really for me i was like i need to go back to my roots of being back in humboldt county which i was always back and forth during college and had some interaction with the marijuana industry and decided i wanted to really have my own homestead and have my own property and so i started working towards that and sure enough before you know it i met eric and we ended up uh getting together and within the first year we built the house we bought another piece of property because he had already owned property um he gave me a place to grow and um that was my own garden and we've been doing it ever since and we've been together 25 26 years um i my family moved here in 1970 and bought their property 76 we started selling bulk soil to cannabis farmers at the top of our driveway at eddersburg and in 81 my dad purchased some commercial property on the 101 to do a full-blown nursery garden supply for senior citizens that wanted really nice flowers and cannabis farmers that needed good nutrients and we brought a service industry today to the community for all these farmers that really needed it and so continuing to cultivate for my whole lifetime and with my family until i became a grown man and started my own farms and bought my own property in that jail i'm owned several businesses on top of owning humboldt alchemy group which is a co2 extraction company in the existing old nursery buildings that my family still owns where we started our original nursery business in 1980. the reason we started growing cannabis in humboldt county is because the united states was poisoning all the cannabis in mexico and the cannabis the hippies generation of my family that moved up here started growing their own so that they could have cannabis to smoke and then they would sell a little to their friends so that they could have some clean product to smoke so we just kind of got became part of a of a culture that was providing something that was a lot cleaner than we were allowed to get from mexico which was the main source back in the 60s so the transition it was more like growing clean produce and and and having it you know being the the supply chain was from family and friends and cannabis was used as you know it was a community effort everybody used to share a joint we were here in the 70s so we were the back to the landers we didn't move here for cannabis we moved here for for clean water and and clean culture and cannabis was something that that came here because it was the safest place to cultivate it it was it was the hills the terrain the climate you know the locations where you could be out of you could be three turns around the valley and nobody knew what you did but nowadays they're so up in your grill with their google that you can't you can't hide from nothing you know nobody knew what the neighbor did but everybody knows what the neighbor does now because they're spying on them from above so you know we moved here for privacy my parents didn't want to see their kids get in gangs get shot down in the streets of los angeles and huntington beach or san diego so they moved us to the country and cannabis was something that came pretty quickly because there was a lot of the back to the land culture that was moving to southern humboldt into northern california to get away from what was the rat race that was taking off what i miss about the black market is its functionality that it actually worked and it was national not and international and for some reason the regulators in the state of california can't even get it to san diego yeah big problem we went with a third party consultant the third party consulting wasn't doing nothing but stacking people up taking their money and i was like you know we're going to do this we need and i was already three and a half years into humboldt alchemy group and i'm like we need to do this you need to grab this damn bull by the horns and take it and it was kind of a little season really we kind of expected the third party consultants to be able to handle the projects but they were stacking so many jobs to get the revenue stream not taking care of the first people that walked in the door that we were falling behind in the line and they didn't care because they were just stacking money so jill went in and basically took it away from the third party consultants and powered through our licensing applications all of it she was up until three in the morning all night every night until she could get that paperwork done and yeah it was daunting but we would not be where we are for today if we would have stayed with a third-party consultant it was only because she took the reins in her own hands and figured every little bit of it out from the sipka track and trace the county got rid of from the metrics she's working with from any bit of it from the water board from you name it it's totally doable and jill has pulled it all off you know women in cannabis for me my mom started the cannabis farm and took care of the kids and did it all my dad always planted too much brought in the heat gave us way too many jobs to do and you know we were we were like kind of like indentured servants on the cannabis farm being good at what you do is is the most important part of what we're why we're involved in cannabis is because we're good at what we do we were trained from children small children to cultivate cannabis in ways that nobody will ever be able to do they don't have the knowledge that we have they will never get the knowledge because it comes from like culture it's handed down from your family and your ancestors i grow the same way on our farm today that i grew on my family's farm in the early 80s we use the same amendments we do not use chemical fertilizers we keep it real [Music] my name is marilyn djerkovich and i'm the director of the humble patient resource center we have two dispensaries one is in arcata california and the second is newly opening which is in eureka california i was raised in a generation where women's rights were really important and that women were looked at but we wanted to be looked at as equal and so when i got involved in all of this i saw that the women we're really amazing like we have products that um i can just tell a little story i don't even know if you'll put this in but um so ellen from honeybee buzzed was one of our makers of a product and we took her out of town with 12 other women to show how important they are because i think sometimes we lose sight of the story the story is humbled humbled is the story and so they didn't really recognize that they were the important story so we took them down south and we got boosts for them and we were the most popular booth there because we are the women of cannabis and so ellen's down there and ellen's telling her story and she if you know ellen from honeybee buzz you will recognize that she has her own beehives she has her own organic garden and so when you take a bath in ellen's bath bombs you feel the love of ellen and so ellen didn't end up making it through the process and we miss her we miss those products that were made for her mother her grandmother her father they were made for someone at some point that she saw value and then started putting it into the dispensaries and we miss her and we miss so many other women and men that were making products for a reason not just to make a lot of money not just to say you know i'm important they were there to heal people they were here to make people feel better and some of them are not here anymore and that's sad for us and that's part of our story that i feel that we need to tell that these people are not here anymore with us and we have new people and they're awesome too but their story may not be the same they may not have made the products for healing they have made their products for making money or for making sure that they can stay in business and that was never the case with the women that i worked with ever i think this whole change has been very difficult for women it's been really difficult for families you'll hear that a lot of our men have been out there farming they might be second third generation men they don't have other things they've been doing they've been perfecting this and now they don't have a job anymore and it's causing a lot of stress in our families and we've been depending on cannabis and so we're hoping that with the cannabis industry we recognize our story i think the story for us is important the other thing that we're not doing is that we're not recognizing that it's not all about getting high there is so much more to this plant there is so much more benefits to this plant that we are losing if we don't keep that part of it alive and the farmers are the ones that are growing they are the ones that we should ask please tell us what you can grow that's going to make us healthier because if we do not look at this as a plant as a plant-based product as an herb if you go to the herbal stores we're all about that this is a powerful herb and we should be looking at it we should be learning about it we should be supporting it we should be supporting research on it we should be putting our money into that and not just worrying about the getting high part which could be very important also because it's all part of our life it's a positive movement we actually are going to be able to say we use cannabis we're going to be out there in the public we're going to tell our children we use cannabis we're going to be able to tell our mothers and fathers hey you should use cannabis and then we're going to be able to support people that is the biggest thing if you want to save our industry you need to support our farmers because the bottom line is our farmers nothing would be happening if it wasn't for them nothing would grow if it wasn't for them and they're the ones that are taking all the hits right now so we need to love them show them the love and buy their products and make sure you're buying local always make sure when you come into a dispensary that you ask what is local and know the products and have your dispensaries know the products and have farmers come in and talk about their products and not just the people that are selling their products but have the real farmers come in and you can see the love that they show towards their products and you will be able to buy their products because you feel that love hi i'm matt pennington founder of humboldt seed company welcome to the farm so a little bit about myself i moved to humboldt county in the mid 90s and pretty much immediately started growing and breeding cannabis been doing that the whole time since but also a major thing i was involved with was salmon restoration locally here on the klamath river in humboldt county and one of the things that i specialized in was spring chinook salmon which are a particularly important run of fish especially as we look forward to the klamath dam removal which is the world's largest river restoration project we formed a grassroots effort here locally and took our desire to see salmon continue to come into humboldt county's rivers way up the ladder all the way to the owner of the dam's warren buffett but spring chinook are the fish that would likely repopulate when the dams removed they were the historic run that went there and so one of the things that i was really involved with was a genomics research project where we actually found the genetic distinction between spring and fall run salmon and we're able to get that research paper published in very highly acclaimed publications like science magazine and the proceedings of the national academy of sciences so now we have the endangered species act listing and the monitoring of this fish population is really of the utmost importance because the the last genetics of course the salt does kind of relate to mechanisms breeding too but you know the special special genetics the land race genetics let's say of the salmon run that are here locally just they can't be reproduced and they're lost then they're lost forever or you know 50 000 years sometimes it takes things like this to evolve so that special trait that we have here locally in our salmon runs is something that's just unbelievably important to hold on to and that's why we fought so hard to keep those fish around and to get these protections and that's why the event the spring chinook summer steelhead survey where we bring hundreds and hundreds of people you know year after year this is its 25th year as a collaborative event and really one of the longest running surveys of its kind anywhere for wildlife bring these folks together we all get out and get this survey done in a day so we have the most accurate data that we can get this is actually my 25th year in a row coordinating this event and being a big part of it so this is just you know part of my life and i love it i love fish i love our community here and i love these beautiful mountains of humboldt county and and all the creatures [Music] so our team was very involved with the effort to remove the dams on the klamath river it's kind of been described as the world's largest river restoration project in the world's biggest dam removal effort as well so really what we we care about salmon we care about wildlife we you know humboldt wouldn't be humbled if it didn't have any salmon that was once a huge part of our economy here was the fishery and of course the tribes it's so important you know it's like literally life blood of of those people and we want to support that as much as we can i think sometimes cannabis farmers get these have this association with being bad for fish and you know all of our water is is captured in rain water and all organic ingredients and things like that i don't think that that necessarily is true it doesn't always go hand in hand of course there's been some maybe a few bad actors out there but uh we're definitely you know changing that kind of stereotype and uh you know we've been just out there fighting for the local environment so of course we you know always grew cannabis in humboldt county that's just what i've done for 25 30 years and you know back in the day it was less legal let's just say there's always been that kind of gray area and i really enjoyed the medical law that dennis perrone and others came up with it was a brilliantly crafted initiative a voter initiative that i voted for in 1996 and uh you know really enjoyed that time as we've transitioned into the new prop 64 recreational landscape that we're in now it was incredibly hard it was probably the hardest thing that i've ever done in my life i've written tons of technical documents and grants for many many years doing salmon restoration projects and nothing really compared to getting my cannabis permit here in humboldt county i think the county did a pretty good job because now we're done and legal to grow but it was unbelievably hard and i don't think that many people that didn't have sort of technological writing biology background like i had environmental sciences stuff like that could have had a very easy time it must have been unbelievably hard and and i know that you know firsthand from trying to help some friends of mine who you know honestly a lot of them just gave up and it was really hard to see folks that have been part of the cannabis community for 20 30 years here in humboldt and and also were very active as like you know the local fire and rescue chief or the local school teacher or a volunteer community environmental movement leader essentially not be able to continue something that's also been a passion of theirs because of the way that this new law has really favored large corporations and well-funded outside entities you know it's it's certainly changed uh some for the better some for the worse we can now you know be happy to share what we've done over the years whereas you know when i was uh doing fish biology when i was an environmental activist i wasn't so straightforward about what we were doing with cannabis breeding and all those things so that's a benefit but it's also you know it's been really hard to see the kind of small farm struggle so much and so i really uh have have hopes that we're going to be able to differentiate and come forward with these great craft cannabis offerings and that that folks out there will actually you know start to realize how much better that cannabis is when it's given the care and when it's you know unique and for me it just it's a much more enjoyable experience when i know my farmer and i know what i'm smoking and i know how much love and thought they've put into it i mean it's it's undeniable that it's just a better high you know here we are we're at this kind of snapshot in time in cannabis it's been an amazing interesting journey to watch you know a community come together around a plant and then you know so many other things wrapped into it like social justice and equity so many good things and i just know that this plant basically demands that you carry that forward and so i think you know those folks are going to be the folks that succeed in this whole thing the folks that really care about both the plant and the place where they're growing and the people around them and want to see the world become a better place and i think that's what what cannabis has to be about you know peter tosh said it's the healing of the nation and i've always really agreed with that there's a lot of good that's going to come of this and let's just support our small farmers [Music] hello my name is sarah and welcome to mountain wise farms so beyond being a farmer and owner of mountain wise farms i also own integrated integrity distribution company it allows me to take the flour produced on my farm create products and distribute them to the retail stores it was not a path i chose willingly i felt it was a necessity for me to regain control of my farm the regulation has created fears that are so different from the fears i experienced in the past of being a cannabis farmer i now you know i'm not being helicopters and imprisonment i'm fearing corporate takeover i'm feeling fearing being squashed and stepped on and having everything i have worked so hard for taken from me [Music] what has changed in humboldt county with the black market and legalization is everything everything has changed in humboldt county looking back when i had a cannabis collective and dealt with patients i knew we were working towards change i knew that some sort of legalization was coming i didn't know it was going to look like this my community has suffered the schools have suffered the fire departments have suffered the restaurants the small business owners everybody is feeling the pains of legalization um it's kind of this catch-22 situation where it's like we used to be looked down upon for being a pop farmer but then regulation hit and the community suddenly realized what the pot farmers were doing for the community we're not here poisoning the earth we're here caring we're here donating to the food banks we're here volunteering in the schools volunteering on the fire department and what legalization did for that is it took it from us farmers we don't have money to donate to our community we don't have time to volunteer because we're no longer just a farmer we're compliance managers or bookkeepers and granted these are all things that are part of a regular business the level of regulation is like nuclear warfare legalization has brought mountain wise to a whole new place where we are producing cannabis large scale it is not the same as what we once were but the passion and the love that we give to this plant has never changed legalization has changed a lot in humboldt county that in the last few years the viewpoints of the officials have shifted and i think cannabis might be humble to last great hope we've been through you know mining logging fishing the weed has always been here it's just never had the opportunity to propel this community to what it could be supporting kraft cannabis is important because just like anything else that goes in your body the medicine that goes in your body is important to know also us farmers here in humboldt county we care we got into this for love and passion you know for falling in love with this area and we carried on this dream to provide this medicine to other people whether the medicine be smoking a joint and relaxing and laughing is super important or whether it's your arthritis that prevents you from walking this plant and us farmers who care are doing it to make a difference we produce medicine that heals we take the flowers and produce other medicine that heals in different ways but our passion and our farming practices are what allows us to produce something different [Music] going legal was a hard choice for me i saw it as my only choice i've been in this industry for more than 15 years and i know nothing else i i need the legal cannabis world to work for me it's given me this beautiful ability to go out in the community and stand proud as a cannabis farmer and that i feel super blessed for um legalization is also one of the saddest things that has happened to humboldt county i've lost friends i've had to watch them move away sell their farms people who have been here for generations having to throw in the towel because the paperwork and the regulation is just too much it saddens me to no degree [Music] my experience as a woman in the cannabis industry has been nothing but wonderful i was able to put myself in a beautiful community and empowered friendships here in humboldt county and just because i was a woman it never changed a thing i was always valued for my hard work for my thoughts my ideas for my drive my passion the good men in this industry appreciate the good women in this industry we have always been a part of it if you look back on the history of humboldt county behind every strong male farmer you'll find yourself a badass mama [Music] what is happening right now is history being made everyone deserves access to good cannabis but when you don't know where it comes from how can you vouch for the quality of it [Music] hi my name is elias and i'm a black market farmer i grew indoors for 15 years moved outdoors five years ago i love what i do but it comes with a lot of stress and anxiety that's beyond my control and with the rise of legalization and permitted farms things are changing and it's made me have more anxiety than ever on the other hand i'm going to keep doing this as long as it makes sense and from everything that i see the permitted legal market i want no part of it it's not inviting i stand to lose more than i stand to gain the legal market is currently run by large conglomerates wealthy investors people who have no history in this cannabis culture and community that we've been a part of for decades these are newcomers who don't share the same values whose profit motive is clear who are turning this into any other american commodity where they're selling a brand a lifestyle and not really showing you the truth of who's losing the family farms the small farmer the mom and pops the people who've been doing this for longer than it's even been known or was part of the popular consciousness now with wealthy investors coming into the legal market they're often absorbing all the small farms into sort of conglomerates where they can advertise that they support small farms and they use that as a marketing gimmick but the reality is what they're really offering is vertical integration they're allowing for the small farmer to worry less about marketing branding testing distribution but what does the small farmer lose they make them sign contracts and you are there thereby bound to grow what they tell you how they tell you and maybe that can be a good thing but that can also go sideways really fast now say that parent company gets bought out and all of a sudden the new owners decide to pump and dump the entire operation and sell off all your farms or maybe they tell you hey you need to grow this genetically modified stuff you need to grow this stuff that you find ethically important and now if you try to fight us we have you on contract and we can sue you and take your farm so given that kind of environment and risk what incentives do i have as a black market farmer to want to buy into that i have to put so much trust in these people i have to know that they have my interests in mind and that they care about the legacy of cannabis cultivation and keeping it clean pure righteous whatever adjective you want to use i didn't start growing cannabis so that i could be working for monsanto that's not why i got in this but i've been living in humboldt since 1999 and i love it and for many many years growing on the black market i pumped a lot of money into the local economy and i've employed over the past two decades hundreds of people who have then pumped that money back into the local economy and now it's 2019 and i gotta say legalization has coincided with the worst economic period i've ever seen in humboldt county you saw the collapse of the timber industry and mills closed people lost their jobs whole communities became impoverished you saw the explosion of methamphetamine use heroin use all sorts of negative things that are indicative of a sick society that does not have enough opportunity for its members and this came along and yes it came with the cost but what were the alternatives for northern california at that time this is like nobody people who say oh well they should just cut all these farms down they're horrible this is a bad thing for society what were you offering for humboldt mendo trinity wherever there was no manufacturing industry no other industry to speak of to pay a living wage beyond menial service jobs this pumped so much money in the economy we saw 20 years of a thriving economy and humble much of that industry was based on providing for the new founded medical market you know you had your characters like dennis perron who were seeking to bring to the light the need for medical cannabis for a wide variety of patients from glaucoma cancer aids and under the 215 model things made more sense to me there were farmers who could grow using other people's prescriptions the medicine they needed and provided directly to them and you were growing medicine for people who needed it and by default you would try to grow the best cleanest medicine for those people they would know their farmer and have a personal relationship with their farmer that's becoming a more and more rare thing we much preferred the 215 model of the was more sustainable than the current rush the drive to scale up for a nationwide legalization do you like to smoke pot you're the one who's getting screwed here the most because back in the day under the 215 model we could a prescription farm where we would have customers medical patients give us their prescription and it would allow us to grow x amount extra then we would provide them with what they needed nowadays the average consumer will go into a dispensary and they're going to pay 40 to 70 percent higher sometimes because of all the costs of testing distribution marketing and then the end result the dispensary has attack on and they need to make a profit so why are you going in and paying mid 90s prices for supposedly clean and tested cannabis what's the incentive there when you could still know a farmer and go and get it directly and cut all those hands out you think all those hands somehow make any of this more ecologically friendly or small farmer friendly all those hands end up really screwing the farmer and so as a farmer of course i love to directly sell to people has the market change do i have to sell a lot of my stuff to the other side of the state and just a lot of that maybe then go to all across the country yeah but that being said fundamentally i want to put money in my own local economy as a small farmer that's what i want these big investor groups do not care about humboldt county they really don't even care about the small farmer they are using the small farmers to get what they want which at the end of the day is strictly profit now the way i choose to grow weed is considered illegal because i haven't gone through this bureaucracy but at the same time i've seen so many of my friends going legal struggle and be bankrupted with heavy taxes unfair regulation it's burdensome regulation could you imagine a viticulture like growing wine was under the same amount of taxation and regulation that cannabis was so we're going to jump through all these hoops and where do we end up usually on fire with our lives destroyed now i'll make no apologies for remaining illegal because ultimately i saw paths ahead of me and i chose one that was the path of least resistance i don't know if that makes me a coward or a criminal but i'm a human being that wants to provide for his family be good to his friends and have a big heart are there aspects of this industry that are problematic for other people in their perceptions and as well for myself absolutely but i can't really think of any industry that doesn't have a cost whether it's environmental social there's a cost to whatever we as humans do as a society we've criminalized a group of people who are in some ways the last embodiment of the western dream of the self-made pull yourselves up by the bootstrap off the land lifestyle i love what i've done i won't make apologies for things that i've done that i don't love i've made mistakes but it's been a growth process i'm trying to do things better every year more environmentally conscious more conscious of the health of the end user but this has been a generational thing for so many this is a long-standing community and culture that's dramatically changed and is to an extent under attack by all the people rushing in to the green rush through legalization and if you care about real small farmers and the people who've been doing it and who've been doing it right for a long time you should really look into what you're being sold what you're being told is not always true the legal market has as much shady stuff as the black market if you just dig a little deeper than the surface then the pretty instagram ads and the bong girls selling you stuff at festivals and the dispensary beyond all that and the branding and the promise of sustainability and conscious cultivation there's a lot of bad stuff and we all all of us in this industry have room to grow we can all improve and this isn't a static situation it's going to continue and evolve and many many many of us that were here not necessarily from the beginning for a very long time and those from the beginning in this industry anymore and i personally see that as profoundly sad and also a travesty because i never smoked pot thinking man i would love if this was just go corporate the people who went to the land to grow pot because they love pot they love cannabis they didn't get into it for this i didn't get into this to have to market on social media buy billboards deal with dispensaries taking disproportionate cuts of my profit percentage ultimately i generate the thing that all of these people want and somehow i'm becoming the lowest economic beneficiary in the pyramid doesn't seem fair that doesn't seem right buy directly from your grower know what they put into it know your grower you know don't always believe that what you're buying at the dispensary is clean or somehow more environmentally conscious that is not always the case the profit motive will make legal people just as well as black market people do shady things it's up to you to be an intelligent consumer and to find the right good people to provide you with the cannabis you see you", "sndqOgmhDdw": "all right well today we're on our way up to union city hopefully this is the day we bring the combine home zach and i are going to go stage sitting protest in the shop to try and speed things along trying to convince them to stay late if need be to get the combine finished we got some nice dry days ahead of us and we need to be getting our beans out because the weather here in mid to late november it can change in a hurry also on the way up there we're going to stop and look at corn head it's actually the corn head we demoed back this fall they put the demo head up for sale and it's a quite a bit better price than what a new one cost so we're going to look it over real good we think it's probably the best value for the money after comparing prices on other brands so with any look it'll be in good shape and we might go ahead and speak for it today and after that we'll head on up to uni city and see if we can spur them along on the combine and with any luck we'll be driving at home at the end of the day and be back in the corn field [Music] [Applause] tomorrow [Music] [Music] i always got out here to where the corn head is give it a good look over and make sure everything's up to stuff on it and see what we talked about there it is good i know well we just got done looking at the corn head it looks about like it did whenever they brought it out to our farm to run a little bit more wear on it to the last guy that run it to hung a pipe or something within snout and tore it up pretty good but they're going to replace replace all that and additionally i talked them down 71 000 down to 70 000 and replacing the all the gathering changes i thought together changed would probably be the most most worn item on there but after looking at it real close the gathering chains looked like they still got plenty of life in them but the knife rolls are actually rounded off pretty good they by far got the most wear on them uh some of the drive chains you can tell that they haven't been lubed i mean it's a demo model it probably hadn't seen the service that that it would have been if it just been on one farm uh you know a lot of people they only run it for a day or two two days at a time and you know it doesn't get greased and maintained like you should but being the corn head it's pretty simple and not really i mean there's really not that much to go go wrong on them as long as the gearboxes have that lube in them and i didn't see any evidence of any kind of gearbox leaks and everything so really other than the stalk rolls i mean it looks like it's in good good condition initially we'd uh we'd agreed on 70 000 and replacing the together in chains but i made a made a counteroffer just leave together and change the loan and do 70 000 and replace all the knife rolls on it and do that i think we have many many years of good service on it without having to turn a wrench on it so he's gonna he's gonna go back to the owner and talk to them about it and see if they go forward and let me know plus it still has another two years on its warranty yeah that's another big thing on it you know if i were to get a a case i h and i assume he'd be the same way with the gearing house that even brand new they only come with one year warranty whereas the gts is brand new they come standard with a three year warranty and since this is a demo model got one year's worth of use we'll get it get a two year warranty on it so really not worried about any of the gearboxes or anything but if we did have any problems with the gearboxes the warranty would definitely cover it so now we are on our way to uh to do a formal sit-in protest that at the dealership shop to try to push a pressure on him to get my combine out today so proper motivation i sure would uh i sure would feel a lot better if i'm driving that thing back home down 45 tonight rather than driving my truck back home so we'll go up there and see how much more they got got to do on it see if we can lend a hand and help them turn turn a few wrenches all right now let's see if we can entice some inspired motivation there we can just get a log chain and tie ourselves to i-beam i'll tie myself to that 92-50 there so either get mine out of the shop or this is what i'm taking home or that that'll work too that planter looks awful familiar over there well that's not ours i think it is oh flagship i ain't seen one of them well didn't quite get it all buttoned up today still like a few more hours worth of work but they swear up and down they gonna have it ready about mid morning tomorrow so there but they did get the engine all finished up uh just now and about to fire it up we're gonna stick around watch them watch them fire it up and then head on home and be back up here in the morning they had to pull the engine to replace the oil seal because it was already torqued before before the accident and it's been pretty much the big big project on on the whole thing they got it all buttoned back up this evening we did get one souvenir got the steering old steering wheel off where it's all been up it's going to be hanging on the shop wall we don't mount it on something smart mounted on carter's dirt bike so far all they like is the latch down here needs to be replaced won't take long gotta finish buttoning up the top of the cab roof i worked on some of the stuff in the inside the combine replace the armrest the steering wheel and then uh where i had a switch for the pivoting spout all of that was aftermarket and rigged up by myself so i had to get get that done got the housing on the steering column replaced so i think about all that's left is uh finish up the cab shell the latch and i think the i think the door latch too needs to be replaced so shouldn't take much longer now back on our way up to union city again i've got a different protest partner today since i wasn't able to raise enough noise yesterday i'm only i'm gonna let kelly try today sometimes she tends to get results where i can't i don't know how much results we're gonna get unless i just basically tell them either you're going to give me my combine today or i'm going to take what's on your lot and you're going to give me the keys remember that one time i went up there and took a ground bite and brought it back you kind of had permission yeah but i told them i was coming together whether they liked it or not so it is what it is at this point we are not coming home without the combine today no more excuses got 500 acres of beans to cut it's what is it november 14th no it's like november 17th it's november 17th it is november 17th and thanksgiving is next week that's kind of our unofficial deadline that we get really really upset if we're still in the fields past that date yeah well remember all the governors told us we have to cancel thanksgiving so at least we have a good excuse we're coming home with combine today so it's either going to be ours or when i steal off a lot we're coming home with combine today well here we are again see if they made any kind of progress finally coming out of the shop i'll hook it to a header and make sure all the functions in the cab work and hopefully we'll be taking it home all right they say it's all done ready to go home so we're gonna hit the road [Applause] it's all put back together here inside a little dusty you should have seen all the crap that came out from the roof whenever they replace the cab shell the biggest thing i've got a windshield it's so clean though you can't see it there we go got a long drive home it's like uh 50 miles never made this trip on a combine before normally they've always hauled it so it's going to be a long trip get a good test out all right we're a couple miles down the road so far so good no wheels are falling off and uh the frame had cracked to pass so say we're doing pretty good it's definitely got a little bit different feel to it got a new hydro handle new steering wheel all the button stuff for you so we got a little bit of a new uh a new combine spell in here well we're uh we're heading down to four lane it's about uh it's about an extra five to ten miles driving distance but like i said it's four lane almost all the way home which makes uh makes transport a whole lot easier chris considered we're leaving out we're leaving out the dealership about 3 we only got an hour and a half daylight left but here's here's the kicker we was hoping to have this thing home and time to leave to go to carter's basketball game which is in halls but we're not going to have time to do that so we're taking it we're taking the four lane which is a longer route but also it goes the closest to hall so there's a gas station there and friendship on the four lane about halfway home and uh we're gonna park the combine there hop on over the halls watch carter's basketball game and come get the combine and take it take it the rest of the way home well we're rolling all along pretty good nice big four lane freshly paid finally got to the section of the four lane that's got the wider shoulders [Music] tires finally got the the flat spots rounded out so got a pretty good ride here one problem i have seen is i think maybe some heater hose valves didn't get turned back on because the ac has never worked so well in this cab before it's about to freeze me out finally i had to turn it off uh whenever we stop i'll probably around the engine and see if maybe there's some uh hose valves that that never got turned back on after the engine was reinstalled well wound up not making it to carter's game took me a whole lot longer to get to dyersburg than what i expected which was the closest place i knew of where i could safely leave the combine uh it is now like 5 15 and i got to the place where i was gonna drop off the combine and carter's game started at five so about 4 30 i just told kelly if we both go we're going to be late probably missing playing so i just sent her sent her on on alone better one parent make it than both parents misses so i hate hate to miss the game but it happens from time to time and uh he'll get a chance to play in another game that i'll be able to make anyway we're in dyersburg now uh by by car it's about a 35 45 35 to 40 minute drive to our house not sure how long it's going to take on the combine but we're going to stick with it until until we make it we also got the heater problem fixed uh it turned out that the valve on the engine block was turned off where they pulled the engine out so we opened it back up and we got it nice and toasty in here now well we just crossed over from dyer county into crockett county get a little bit closer home every mile we go i've already passed uh i already passed two or three combines cutting beans not very many beans left in the area that i've seen we're gonna be probably the last ones to get finished up this year really making me antsy get get home pick i'm i'm tempted just to go hook up to my header and try to cut something at night but i know by the time we get home it'll it'll probably be too damp anyway i sure am looking forward to seeing some dust come out back in this combine tomorrow just keep my fingers crossed that we don't find any other problems that's been my major concern from the get-go is you know we saw we saw all the damage that was caused but what damage was caused that we didn't see you know stuff internally inside the final drives you know maybe some stress cracks in the frame that you can't visibly see yet you know anything wrong inside the gear the gear boxes you know we run it all and everything and everything looks good but what's uh we don't know what the combine is going to do until until we put it under a load and really find out so pretty nervous about tomorrow well we've almost made it to the end of the four lane we're going to get off a little before we get to alamo just to avoid having to drive this combine through downtown alabama that could be kind of a chore so we're going to take some back roads all the way back to the farm trip's gone good it's uh been a long time we've been on the road uh two and a half hours right now we got every bit of 30 45 minutes before we get back to the shop it's gone good actually this is the first time i've driven the combine down the road since my accident all the time when we were cutting our full season beans i always let zach drive it down the road to the next farm just because of my injuries i wasn't i didn't feel like i was physically fit enough to be able to react quickly on the on the road so i couldn't fight in the field but on the road i just didn't trust myself so i i really wasn't worried about getting getting back in the cab and driving driving down the road this time i don't have any leftover fears from the accident i know something like that could happen again actually this can always happen but really don't have any fear but tell you what the one thing that does make me nervous is you know combines going down the road they they tend to bounce quite a bit like that just like that bridge that i just just hit and uh when i get to bouncing up and down like that it kind of triggers the bad memories of when i hit the corn head and you know completely lost control got thrown out of my seed and just got bounced around like a pinball and losing control it kind of brings back some flashbacks that i that so hopefully uh over time stuff like that will fade but one thing got different it doesn't matter how bad this combine bounces i'm strapped into the seat real good right now all right we're on the home stretch entering the big metropolis of castington sea got about two more miles to go before before we reach the shop all right we finally made it three hours and 15 minutes later all right well we're going to pull it in the shop check it make sure the engine's not leaking any oil and uh i noticed i know it's got one uh work light that's not working i think we just got a bad connection we'll try and get that fixed and i reckon we'll head on to the house and be ready for hopefully what is a long day tomorrow cutting beans and getting a lot of acres out all right here's a moment of truth make sure everything's still dry around the engine well it's nasty from where it was leaking earlier but it looks like it's all dry thank goodness because the first time we had the reseal replaced after wheat harvest it didn't hold hopefully this time we had a little bit better look in the seal holes well guys she's back home where she belongs and in the shop ready for hopefully a long day tomorrow we're gonna try and put some acres and some bushels through this machine tomorrow so anyway uh appreciate y'all watching uh if you haven't already subscribed to

undercover a much different story a quick ID check and we get buzzed in and we're bringing you along as we pull back the curtain on this illegal marijuana operation in unincorporated LA County hey how are you the product is organized and laid out on shelves various different types and amounts of pot indica edibles and Private Reserve but none of it is allowed to be sold here under California law during legal transactions at licensed dispensaries only up to one ounce of cannabis can be sold or purchased but take a listen to how much this illegal dispensary was willing to sell us ok for pound the offer for a pound of weed is 16 times more than what prop 64 allows and it happened right here at 25 Capp located at 47 28 Whittier Boulevard in East LA it's one of many illegal cannabis dispensaries in unincorporated LA County that's where there are no licenses period and that means this pot is unregulated and untested 25 cap never responded to Fox 11 so we decided to pay them a visit in person and see what they had to say my name is Bilbo Lujan I'm a reporter with Fox 11 do you guys have anybody in charge we could talk to real quick yeah you know everything you're doing is illegal here right the employees ended up hiding in the back room only yelling at us over the wall if you guys want to make a comment come on out and talk to us if you want to say whoa no comment all right he'll comment that's fine you guys had a chance but but once a potential customer came inside that window was back open and 25 cat buzz two men hoping to sell him some illegal pot it's amazing to me that they don't follow any the state laws or regulations they violate everything that they know is out there already with prop 64 Brian Blatz is the CEO of one of the largest legal cannabis distribution companies in SoCal we showed him our undercover video and he was shocked by what he saw they're selling pounds of cannabis they know that's going to be resold into a secondary market with people that aren't going to be concerned about the ages of the people that they're selling it to Blatt says people are attracted to illegal pot dispensaries like this because they are not taxed by the state that means the product is sold much cheaper sometimes up to a 50% discount from what you could buy at a licensed dispensary but it comes with the risk I think the most important thing for the general public to understand is that by shopping at any illegal dispensary you're 100% guaranteed to get products that have been untested and that are filled with pesticides chemicals fungus and mold records show that LA County currently has a civil case against 25 caps owner for violating LA County code and unlawful business practices this was after LA County deputies made an undercover purchase of marijuana from that dispensary in March 2017 the case was filed in June 2017 in almost a year later nothing has happened and 25 cap is still up and running no when you take a look at this videotape you realize that there are no rules we showed our undercover video to Bob Lindsey he's a former LSD commander who is now running to be the next LA County Sheriff he's been sounding the alarm about these illegal dispensaries there are no regulations in there she's just answering questions and she's willing to go ahead and sell up to a pound that's not medical use that's not personal use this is in danger the entire community we have to allow that court system to play out we can't control that captain holy Francisco with LASD says despite frustrations with the system their deputies work hard to crack down on illegal dispensaries we go in we've served just since January a 1 we've served 30 search warrants in the unincorporated area of LA County arrested approximately 60 people recovered over 2000 pounds of marijuana and it's just a system in the meantime LA County leaders clearly remain concerned supervisor Hilda Solis sent Fox 11 the following statement saying in part until the county develops comprehensive regulations and licensing protocols we are still playing whack-a-mole with illegal dispensaries I share in my community's frustration with the status quo and until that status quo changes operations like this one will have no reason to stop no matter who shows up at their door and an LA County spokesman told us they are very concerned about the possible dangers of illegal pot dispensaries and they're committed to shutting them down saying to us in part quote the county has undertaken a series of enforcement actions since it was brought to our attention including an undercover purchase in June 2017 the county filed a civil complaint the defendant has failed to respond or appear on numerous occasions a failure that prompted the judge to finally set a default judgment hearing for August 17th the county is confident that it will prevail and they also went on to say that they are very determined to put these dispensaries completely out of business even if it takes a long time to do so this is the Wild West bill that's what a lot of people are saying and the county shares some responsibility in this because this was legalized the sale for people to be able to buy and sell marijuana this went into effect January 1st 2018 the county still for the unincorporated areas of the county they still have not come up with the regulations and the licensing yet so any of these stores that were out there before this law passed they were technically what's supposed to close down and that's technically what they're supposed to do but as you saw LA County sheriff's went in there there still up and running despite that civil case I bill clearly big business all right thank you much", "GvJeZx1d_sM": "((MILLAINE)) HARVEST SEASON WILL COME TO A

farmer dre back at it it's another beautiful morning here on the farm what we're doing this morning we are getting cider ready for delivery adrian is actually going to go ahead and head out to a hyvee we're going to go ahead and deliver some cider so i got all the gallons in the reefer trailer here and the way we deliver i want to put this down here hold up just a second here just a second maybe that magnetic it's not oh there it is i'm gonna i got a magnetic mount here my gopro there you go so the way we uh deliver our cider at high v so we deliver weekly and just because every single one of our batches of cider is very specific we use a variety of apples in each of our cider so that's what hyvee likes about our cider is that it's unique and they don't want the same product week after week so uh we deliver quite a bit every week here so we usually like to deliver them in the red crates but they're all that high beam we don't have any that many here in our warehouse so apple boxes it is here we gardner's orchard bakery fresh apple cider and uh everything like that now we go ahead and close up the recontroller [Music] then we had adrian on his way to delivery so we just having the isuzu uh box trailer here the reefer truck real real nice thing that goes right started there so uh yeah we do all of our cider deliveries and everything just because cider has to stay cold so that it doesn't spoil on the way there you as you guys know our cider is uv pasteurized so it needs to stay in cold storage until the customer even whenever the customer opens it it still needs to stay cold because once that temperature reaches i i don't remember the right temperature once the temperature exceeds a certain level then it can start spoiling and we don't want that to happen so we want our customers to have a nice fresh glass of apple cider anyway so the plan for today moses and i are gonna go ahead and start pulling runners on the strawberries and uh we uh got some help coming so we will see what we will do today so out here in the farm store we got our beautiful apples here we got some cameos draw nothing fuji you have your fuji granny smith golden delicious red delicious and pink ladies there we also have a few tomatoes from last season or this season some money and some stuff like that and all kinds of different jams and jellies and whatnot so this is our farm market farm store and of course we have our fresh fresh garnish apple cider vinegar so i don't know if you guys know this but we do have a bakery here on the farm and uh oh my one of my older sisters she is a pastry chef so i've been thinking about it and if they want to make a video with me inside the bakery i mean i wouldn't mind because have you looked at me lately yeah i like baked goods alrighty so now we are out here pulling runners on the strawberries and we're doing the rocco's here first and uh just going through checking out the plants and one thing that i realized with these rockers the runners are very close to the plants like right here i mean there's those kind of cluster runners right here that uh so we don't save these at all so we just throw them in between the rows here but uh let me just put them in the bucket and give them some cows [Music] but here we go here's your runner [Music] so this is where the a good bed maker i mean is very important because as you guys can see here the plants whenever we were transplanting i don't know who was driving the tractor in this area but they planted the sides on this edge here and just look at the size difference in these plants so these plants are going to produce us quite a bit and these plants are here same same plan at the same time are not even close to uh what they so that's right it's very important on strawberries to have a nice firm solid raised bed because the plants are just thriving it but if not they don't even do nothing about it so they just sit there and don't do anything so this is why it's very vital to have a nice firm solid raised bed that you don't have any issue with just the plants are just loving on this side on that side they're kind of iffy just in this one section and then as you get back on the road so as you get back to the firmness of the bed on both sides you get back to nice healthy plants like these on both sides of the bed here so just amazing amazing amazing [Music] so we got about two thousand plants or two rows done with pulling the runners but we're gonna actually go ahead and start training the blackberries on the rca trail so we got a couple rows on the blackberries done and we're gonna go ahead and i gotta go show some uh [Music] oh we got a couple rows of the strawberry runners pulled so the chandlers have a lot more runners in the rocco's so the channels will take a little more time but that's the nature of it that's how the the chandlers are they send out a lot more runners but with the rocco's here not not so much but we got to go to the blackberries and train a few rows so now we are out here in the blackberries we are training them up to the as you guys know the rotating cross arm trellis system the rca trellis and what we did over the summer here since we got super busy and uh never got the entire trellis system completed so we did during the summer months we came through and trained all the primocanes vertically horizontally the main power mccains and then what we're doing now is we're just taking all these lateral branches and we're just picking up on the trellis system themselves so you guys can see that right here just like that all of the primocanes now are on there so once they come out of dormancy in the spring they'll be floor cane so these will be producing this the crop next year but it's just a long long tedious job here it's not it's not very hard but it is kind of labor intensive to get all the canes up here and train us once it's done they will be uh producing some really good decent crops so these will be three years old so they'll be producing our first crop in 2021 so next spring will be pretty much our first heavy crop of blackberries so once we get all of these uh trained up nicely and done we got to lay them down horizontally and then throw the row covers on them and since we are growing them on the rotating cross arm trellis system the reason you want to throw row covers on is because if you have any cold damage then the system kind of loses its point because we want a full crop on the entire system itself so that's why you could uh apply row covers to the rca trellis system on the blackberry so that's the benefit of the system so what we're doing here we got adrian we got david we got moses out here they're training away and of course myself and then val will be out here as well so they are just out here not doing too much they don't only say hi to you you're talking [Music] so what we're having moses do here he's coming through and pulling all so we came in through and cut off most of the primocanes but a lot of the uh no all the floor canes that produces a crop this past spring and uh he's just out here cleaning them up making sure that it's easier for us to come through and train these berries so yeah long day we have what 22 rows 22 like 440 300 300 foot long rows here so in total we have 5 000 feet linear feet of blackberries right around a thousand plants so a lot of blackberries and uh time to get it done so explain what you're doing here who wants to talk david or adrian i'll let adrian oh there you go so what are you doing it's pretty simple you just pick it up tie here tie their tire you know and that's it ah man come on man great great explanation great explanation the primocanes to the trellis system man this guy took public speaking he knows all righty so uh we got our entire row here done what i'm doing here i'm gonna come through and clip the tops on from this side and then we're gonna go ahead and chop them all about six inches above the ground there so just to make it easier so they won't overhang as much and then if we leave these on here full of fruit they're just going to hang over the the system here and then they'll just kind of be in the way for the customers so uh yeah now it's just time to do some more and more i mean we got 20 something rows out here so it's continuous process so just got back from lunch the uh everybody ate some delicious food but now adrian's kind of upset because he's tick-tock famous so if you guys don't know adrian here he's actually uh uh famous on tick-tock he has 125 000 followers on tick tock

loader up there looks like we want to do some digging it's not a great way to start the day i don't know how much more a 2020 i can take all right zach just called me i got there and looked at modules said the fire is pretty deep inside the module so if you bring the front end loader up there looks like we want to do some digging i'm having to dig it out now see where it's coming from you hauling to the rescue josh can there be any more crap in this tractor good great what a mess we got going on here today it's funny how long these things can take to play around can we tell we checked it out i mean that's really not coming in that i was gonna carry it to the gym we checked in nine o'clock last night and everything was good when i come in and then that one was fine over there too yeah and here's the other one from this morning well fire is out for the fourth time now hopefully the last time we're gonna get back on this picker and we're gonna try it again well when it rains it pours just had two lines bust on this module builder luckily it happened right before the parts store closed so we should be able to get some replacements this afternoon gonna be several hundred dollars worth of hydraulic holes though kelly said two lines busted is it just one one line busted but another one looks like it's about ready to go where's it she just dumped it and i just i lost control on the uh arm going up and down like i can move back and forth but the tamper up and down all right i'll call scott make sure he'll hang around to get it replaced and just go go ahead and get them get them both changed then [Music] [Music] turn heifer freaking guards in the way [Music] [Music] should be in that front tool box front one look up top need that ratchet wrench another one yep right down there in the hydraulic fluid [Music] [Music] [Music] yep we farm in the city let me tell you how much fun it is wow y'all look at that cotton man that's pretty the beautiful sunset i wish i had my drone up in there yeah i'd say it's good you know how i mentioned in a previous video how good cotton smelled when it's being picked you know the smells of cotton harvest you know the way the cotton smells the cotton picker spindle grease smells you know all that stuff smells good i'll tell you what does smell good is burnt cotton especially when you wallow around in it this afternoon trying to dig a fire out of a module and put it out it doesn't smell so good i'm ready to get home and take a shower and get this smell washed off of me i'm afraid i might be smelling it in my dreams tonight though well it would appear that our bad luck did not stay at the previous farm get over here and uh roy makes a couple rounds with the bush hog and we have a drive shaft carrier whatever reason we're having a problem with a bolt that holds the drive shaft together keeps breaking i don't know if we got too big of a bolt in there and it's too tight of a fit and too much put too much stress on the mold or what anyway the part of the shaft that the boat goes through got slung off in the woods somewhere before the field i don't know we can't find it so gotta add that to my list of stuff to do in the morning ain't farming fun it's days like yesterday and today that really make me seriously think about why i became a farmer because days like today and yesterday it's really hard to find the joint farming when you're just uh overcome with frustrations from every single angle but i do it because it's what god made me do he gave me the talent to do it he gave me the ability to do it and he's provided the means for me to do it so that that's why i do it it's a day it's just days like today it's really hard to remember that but the sun will rise again tomorrow tomorrow is going to be a new day and you never know what tomorrow brings it could be great joy tomorrow but i will say that 2020 it's a year that keeps on giving but i don't think there's too many people that's enjoying the gifts that it's given this year oh well that's enough of being a cry baby for today we still got an hour or two left in this day and we're gonna try and finish it out strong so uh we'll say this zach lost the other radio yesterday had no idea where he put it where it went right guess what i found it in the field today that's right just sitting there i found it now be sure be sure to give yourself a big old pat on the back anyway it's about 8 45 at night we just ran out of water we got like two more passes on this field before we move on to the bank we got 13 and a half acres done over here on this farm total for the day is like i think we got around 35 acres done hadn't been a great day i can dump this basket tomorrow or tonight i don't care i just want to get the haze cleaned out and go home that's what she said anyway where was i yeah in total we got like 35 acres done today been a pretty rough day hopefully our fortunes will improve tomorrow y'all made it this far i appreciate you

"fkf7i0fx3Bw": "[Music] my name is Dustin Fox I work for an innovative organics we're here with Yeti farms in Pueblo Colorado this is a recreational and a medical grow and a MIPS processor that you know make chatter and concentrates and what we're doing today is actually putting plants in the ground into our amended soil we brought in a several hundred yards of concentrated compost with biochar and crab shell kelp meal and you know some some of the good organic and probiotic amendments and what we do is we treat the land the way it should be treated we stop all use of synthetics no man-made artificial fertilizers no chelated nutrient salts they're all organics and probiotics and everything that you know that we use comes from someone else's trash it's all waste product from other companies and you know for example the biochar is beetle kill pine from the mountains here in Colorado and the Bocage ET and the you know it's the basis of the Bokashi soils that we produce and what they're you know it's made of fermented trash really and it heals the biology and the native soils and it restores life and regenerates this land like I mean it's it's an amazing process to get to witness you know starting out on these farms and seeing the cracked barren soil it's just sun-baked and then by the end of the season it's it's just amazing what you can witness in one season when we're not putting these synthetic chemicals on on the field crops like like we have been for years and you know this way is it's it's a really you know this is the beginning this is a the revolution is beginning for all of Agriculture this isn't just about cannabis either this is all the way back to every crop and this is the way it should have been for years [Music] hi everybody i'm john from yeti farms i'm the grower here and these are our babies they're going out in the field now at the end of june we just did a large expansion and so we're delayed on getting our license or modification of premises so we're getting them out a little later than usual so they're a lot bigger than we really want them to be when we put them out we're this is our mix these are pretty much all the recreational x' that are going to be going out we're planning the medical field today and tomorrow and that should be done this goes into the new field and there's 1,800 recreational and the thousand medical and you can see they range out the range in size from Dixie Cups with young clones and I'm all the way up to five six foot plants and they've been planted in some very fertile soil it has probiotics in it it's all organic we don't use any chemical fertilizers we use like wonho's and things like that which really helps because we don't end up with having a salt buildup and a problem for plants that are of this size we haven't had to flush them they use up the nutrients and they let you know when they're hungry for more we have done a lot of transplanting as much as we could we were limited on space to have 2800 plants all in veg at once we the greenhouses is pretty loaded we've already taken probably 400 or so plants out of here and we still have the balance of our medical field to go and we'll have a medical and recreational field is the new addition and we can go out and take a look at at the medical field as it is right now these are our the medicals that we've just planned here over the last couple of days these this was just planted today and what again they're a lot larger than we would normally be planting outside because of of our delays and be able to plant so we're trying to get them all in in the next couple of days both medical and recreational this is our Jackie white we have 15 strains on the medical side and seven strains on the rec side plus we just obtained some new genetics so if we added about another 5 strains to our medical side so don't put us about 20 on the medical side four strains as you can see they vary in size the netting will keep them give them a chance to adapt to the wind in the climate because they're out of the greenhouse now and it'll let them grow up reinforce them help the branches develop we'll be able to pull the branches through the netting be able to clean them up so they can go into full veg and flower all here we do only do outside planting we don't do indoor grows at all we do maintain our genetics from one year to the next and then we just transferred the clones to the greenhouse to harden them off to get them used to sunlight so we can bring them out to the field and each roll is grouped by its strain and so we have 21 Jackie White's which is what this is and then we start with our next drain down there and they proceed all the way through until we get all the plants in of that strain then we start onto the next one and these ones as they're being transplanted they're being being given a nice organic tea along with some Bokashi which will help with the micro production in the soil and help them grow into big healthy little girls since this is a we've gone into soil this year we're actually laying down a brand new irrigation system in previous years we actually planted in smart pot planters that work one to two hundred gallon and now we've gone into the native soil and amended it and so we're actually putting an irrigation system that's underneath the mulching plastic and that way I'll keep the moisture in and it'll help spread evenly under the for the roots so the roots can expand evenly throughout the whole growing area and we'll be able to send the nutrients right through the irrigation system so we'll be able to water and feed them at the same time it makes a lot less labor-intensive [Music]", "aJVjbyCVFRY": "hemp is is known around the world for over 6,000 years in the United States the independence the declaration of independence has been drafted on hemp paper and hemp has been banned in the United States in the 1930s to save the cotton industry United States banned ham and now they're looking to lift the ban on hemp the United States themself so why isn't the other countries just legalizing hemp by a few words in their Parliament - to have him grown in their country and produce him I have with friends of the affiliate over 2,000 acres in burpies right now we're ready to plant we're preparing the land plowing the land building the the dams and the roads to get in there 2,000 acres is a lot of him yeah and then we have other hemp farmers or Association in Guyana here who has land they're willing to grow hemp as well we probably have right now over hundreds of thousands of acres total with all the hip Association and the farmers in Guyana this is potentially hundreds thousands of acres of hemp just waiting there and that adds up to millions of dollars you asked the question early what did America brought in which is five hundred fifty million but remember they had a processing facilities taking out the oils taking out the milk taken out of protein and gaion has the growing facilities right now which means they can only grow it Drive and they can sell it for a small amount of money when you come down to the processing having a plant set up that's where you yield the more money a guy needs to pass this bill now so they can create jobs for the local people who are farming rice and cane and those industries are dying out a little bit by a little bit so this is a new you start for them and it will create jobs from every farm of the track tractor plowing land truck drivers accounting people who have to count for all these things fuel everywhere you look for industry you have job creations shipping abroad will be more shipping more containers going abroad with him even we can have a hem planted in in Guyana here where you can process right now if you grow up you can only sell it dry and I keep you exported eventually we will have to have a plan to process him in Guyana for him oil and milk and powder protein powders all that is good for the people to use even if we start now is very lucrative market as you said but if we don't start now we face a problem that Guyana will be not the top ten but below 100 because the United States is positioning to grow hemp legally in all the states currently maybe over 30 states is growing hemp we gonna miss the boat and where we gonna supply our him China is the biggest supplier of happen I think China will be growing hem from now till end of time go to your government officials and protest and say you want this hemp passed as early as possible the earliest it can be passed the better you will be financially and knowing the god economics in Guyana where the people are suffering from the lack of cane lack of rice this is the opportunity for them now to

to be able to take our products to market and the consumer at the end of the day will be able to buy our products at a lesser cost because we're able to control all aspects from A to Z from the time we grow the product to the time we delivered to your door my name is Chris mash nerdy I'm the president CEO Double Diamond farms Double Diamond Farms has started just over 40 years ago by my father Nick mash nerdy we've been doing this our whole lives since I was a young child so that's about the only thing we've ever learned it's in our blood and this is what we do at the time when it was started it was an extremely small farm it was only roughly about one acre through the years it has grown to now it's over several hundred acres we have a new facility now in the progress of construction when that facility's done it'll be in excess of one hundred and twenty four acres the culture has evolved from when I was a kid you know it was probably around 15 people that worked in our family farm today it's now approaching 800 team members and it's more of like a one big family inside of one small family our core items are tomatoes on the vine we got beefsteak tomatoes bell peppers seedless cucumbers mini cucumbers eggplant we also have a full line of organics and then of many specialties about 30 different varieties of specialty items Double Diamond farms has a five-acre research and development facility we're over on about a hundred and thirty-five 240 different varieties in any given season none of our seed are genetically modified they're all naturally bred we have a team of around 20 people in that facility all they do is monitor all these you know between production Brix levels every characteristic of a tomato or a pepper or cucumber the things that allow us to bring those varieties to marketplace to make them a winner maybe only 10 percent of those items will actually meet our spec our greenhouses are the most state-of-the-art facilities that you could possibly build today everything that we do from the ground up is state-of-the-art from our energy curtains to the glass that we put on the roofs to the automation in the facilities when it comes to building our new facilities we don't spare any expense we do it right we do it the first time that's the only way we do things at the Bluebonnet community involvement is definitely important to Double Diamond we try to get involved as many things as we can because at the end of the day our business is growing and evolving and we want to have as many great young people involved

the answer to that as far as where we're going to go and that's you know maybe shoot it up and back it up american spirit style yeah as long as you're shredding that flower out right i see the midwest guys are grinding up biomasses that's the only thing i see in the bags of like when i looked on dot com i wasn't seeing like shredded like flowers yeah so our some of our some of our best clients that buy from us regularly have sites on youtube whatever social media outlet that they have and they take it out of the bag this is from big top farms and they strip it off even the last of the tip of the stem right yes and grind it in front of you and they tell you what store they're going to tomorrow and then and he goes i can't keep it in the house but he's telling him where he's going and who's going to get the goodies next and we just get it to him that's our job just give it to you and that guy is all about the quality it's not about the price we walked into texas stores and you know the guy behind the count is like i don't know where it came from midwest well let's see it and opens up a like an oatmeal can pours it on the counter and there's stems and seeds and crap and it's like wow people like that he goes they like the price it's 9.99 i'm like it's horrible yeah it's i don't even see a flower in there but um people will figure it out um and then of course i wish i would have invested in freaking bots it's crazy but there's just a lot of it so this one's a different batch number upper innis still in the goliath cultivar but also lying green so there's two lime greens um lower in this upper in us as we swept through the field taking those out and some of that you know we have markets in that we found this last year everybody was looking for the lime green whether they're doing a delta eight spray or they're just in a part of the country that does not understand purple right and we've got other people that want purple so we just separated them so it's easier for them they can be easier for the buyer yeah yeah and some people want to put all purple in the jar that's right them in here they're getting closer but they're i think they've got another by the feel of it i'll tell you they got another probably four days to get there and then those are those are marked as well so that we can come up here and when we towed them we know what we've got okay and it's just trying to stay organized yeah so it just it doesn't do any good to have them all in a pile yeah i think we got we got some really good stuff here people the buyers nowadays want to know exactly what they're getting and they want to know how many pounds behind it exactly so you know again and we we did 30 acres of the of the goliath in about 35 acres of the oregon cbd and the goliath because it's compliant and and we have the coas it's going to be pretty popular yeah so we're we're happy to have the batches and and you know the stores and the buyers that are going they want to know okay you've got 550 pounds of the green goliath from upper ruby with a coa we want it yeah yeah so that's that's what we're trying to do as the farm is just be more organized so the buyer wants

Kolstad a fifth generation farmer started with Montana's pilot program in 2016 to start growing industrial hemp but he hopes the industry continues to grow in Montana what I'd like to see is something happen with the fiber I'd like to see Montana bring in some processing plants and start utilizing that because that's where the most most of the uses from hemp actually come from the stock and no one's really using it Morgan Elliott IND hemp VP of Operations shared with me some of what they will be doing at IND located in Fort Benton and you know we produce wholesale products to do wholesale oil and wholesale protein and so you know our finished product is going into salad dressings or topical treatments as well as protein bars or protein shakes and so hemp products have typically been associated with marijuana and that just isn't the case anymore Eliot says it's important to make sure people are aware of just how much can be done with hemp so advocacy is a big part of our job

happening around us and today again I'm with the lovely Jenny ala hey everybody so we're going to be covering this series for six months and we're gonna be watching this cannabis garden grow in a really beautiful setting we're at an undisclosed location for up for obvious reasons so it's gonna be a great series gonna be a long shot long film so we're ready to go right yeah we are and what you can see behind us right now is the where the future garden is going to be and as you can see there's a lot of fava beans growing a lot of wild flowers that's gonna help with the soil I think it's gonna be a great series so has a lot of economic impact in the county as well a lot of benefit so we're I think we're gonna just go ahead and do it yeah let's see how it grows see our girl wildflowers surrounded the field which brought in beneficial bugs bees and the rest as you can see here the garden is planted with fava beans of which will be plowed under later for nutrients these long Gardens with the walkways in between is where the marijuana blue-blue planted these are the clones taken from last year and they have those breather pots which help the clones grow as you can see they're only three or four five six inches high and those will be the plants later this is a view of the field from far away as you can see many of the fava beans so here we are one month later one month later back again and what we see is that the fava beans have died down and are becoming part of the soil so it's feeding the soil for the next crop also the plants have been planted so let's go take a look at the garden see what it's looking like this month and then we'll be back next month in July July is the big month so stay tuned stay tuned now that the fava beans have been plowed under and the straw is also plowed under the small plants are planted and the water supply the water supply uses less to grow marijuana the you would have in a large field of grass or a golf course it's very water efficient here is a pairs of view of the fields now as you can see the fava beans are gone and the straw remains and here are the little clone plants planted in the fields to begin their growing season this is a view of the same field you can see the clones in the ground and the walkways clearly visible here's a side view of a small little clone and as you can see once again they're not very big so we'll be back in a month and take a look and see how much they've grown on the third month we brought our film partner crystal Highline to see the plants and as you can see she's seeing all the beneficial bugs in the soil the size of the plants we welcome crystal to the shoot and you can see lovely crystal with the plants as big as she is in the background so the last month has yielded some tremendous growth it was very hot the day we were there and you can see that some of the plants are even bigger and the native plants and flowers are still there to help with the beneficial bugs and our final shot here is crystal all the way back in the back of the garden you can see that we've experienced quite a bit of growth so we are here on the end of the third month shoot in July with the cannabis farmer and crystal there's pretty incredible plants here they're amazing and I had a great time learning about they have some native carrots Thanks all right yeah for the beneficial bugs yeah and he keeps the weeds down to keep the pests away and it's all done organically sustainably and so it was a pleasure to be here yes okay so that does it for this month shoot of the cannabis farming near the rich and we'll be back with three more shoots to conclude the shoot in October so my name is Mark Kuna birdie I am crystal highlight thank you so much for watching and we'll see you next time sounds good sounds good so here we are in mid-august at our grouse shoot again yeah welcome back crystal thank you Mike happy to be here happy to be herself as you can see behind us what once was small plants where we started the film quite a while ago and then there and then last month of course you and I were here and they got even bigger and now I look behind us they're 6 7 feet tall yeah twice as big so three times as big that's right so cannabis is a unique crop mm-hm and tell them about the input and the output of this crop it's amazing well cannabis is a low input you get all your energy from the Sun and it's a high economic value output crop that's right in other words in other words a little bit of labour and a little bit of water and these plants just take off now we had an interesting conversation with the grower about where he supplies this cannabis pharmaceutical grade medical producers are where he provides this crop to and he was telling us about his testing report right this test for any sort of pesticides chemicals they spends a pretty good amount of money on this report yes and it's pretty sophisticated so we were really impressed with it so there we go we're here in mid-august and we're gonna come back when next month next month so we'll take some photographs yeah and they're gonna pick in October mate okay so crystal and I here at the grow again at an undisclosed location we don't even know where it is and we'll be back but meanwhile we'll give you some photos and continue our long series of medical cannabis farming in our fourth month you can see the plants have grown quite large they're 6 7 feet high the Sun again was quite hot today we were there and you can see crystal dwarfed by the plants now there's the same shot we've used in previous videos and the plants are indeed robust in green and there she is overlooking the field made of plants still they're bringing in the beneficial bugs and the water consumption was a lot less than what you might see so the grower tells us and there we are dwarfed by all the plants and now all the clones of this season will be used next season and there's crystal overlooking the field again was quite an interesting last two months the growth so here we are back in the fifth month of our small-scale commercial grow of ganja here in Nevada County and I'm with again a lovely Jenna yellow that's right so we're here and as most of you can see we've got these big plants behind us and we've got about another month to go before it's harvest time so we'll be back another time before then so the grower wanted us to emphasize that the outdoor environment is superior in producing higher quality of medicinal plants than indoors and she's very beautiful out here the medicinal qualities include a treat pain and inflammation address and treat opiate addiction and withdrawal anxiety disorders sleep disorders epileptic seizures and cancer that's right so you know it seems to be the opinion of most people that this area of the you know geological location is too marijuana as maybe Napa might be too wine so you know plants love it here the gardens really thrive here and these outdoor grows you know the emphasis is that you know with a healthy environment you have healthy plants it's pretty incredible and in you know it is pretty incredible here we were last month we didn't see almost no flowers and now it's just yeah looks pretty incredible so we're gonna take some photographs should want to add anything before we move on to the next month you know I did see this interview and I hope I don't say this name wrong but dr. Sanjay Gupta he was saying that it's proven that marijuana will treat pain in fact it will also help in opioid rehabilitation so it helps with opioid Reap withdraws and then it also helps the brain to recover from you know being addicted so these are all facts that you know we said I saw that on CNN the other day sure sure okay so where to take some photographs and then we'll be back here in a month to witness the harvesting yes I'm excited for that early morning morning really morning shoot and then now hopefully we'll also wissinger witness the processing of the of the medicinal products that we put out all right well let's take some pictures of these beautiful plants and then be back here next month okay we'll see you in a month and in the fifth month we welcome is Johnny alla back to the field she's stunned at the amount of growth we've seen the plants are six seven eight feet high as you can see she's dwarfed by the plants and the amount of flowers on the plants are quite incredible she's pointing out some of the thickness of the flowers and again the outdoor grows so says the grower are superior to the indoor grows producing a much higher quality crop and you can see the flowers the native flowers are left to remain and there's the field against the tree backdrop you can see how big they are and in our next shot you will see the concentration of the flowers that have really taken hold in this fifth month and the lovely miss Ayala is dwarfed by the plants in this fifth month shoot and another shot of the flowers in the field and it was a little bit cooler than a that we took this shot and now she's holding the fava beans which will be used for next year's crop so good morning so here we are in our six-month shoot of the small commercial ganja grow in Nevada Canyon with jenny ology yep so we're here early in the morning because this is the time when the plants are going to be the freshest so this garden right here is getting ready to be harvested and the reason why they do it so early in the morning is because as soon as the Sun hits then these plants kind of open up and they want to get it early in the morning so we got this early start as you can see there's a couple of different varieties here that I have in my hand and they're beautiful and impressive they are beautiful impressive I mean take a look at that you could see behind us there's an amazing amount of ganja here this outdoor facility so says the grower is far superior to growing indoors so we wanted to show you the final stage of this grow and we'll have some more information at the end of the video so I hope you've enjoyed the series Jenna and I got up early to be here today what else we want to add well I mean I just want to add that you know this this whole garden and growing marijuana its kind of viewed as a second class sort of agricultural thing and as you can see there's there's nothing violent there's nothing criminal there's nothing dangerous going on here but it is very criminalized and you know we just kind of wanted to bring a different viewpoint out to this and show you how you know this is actually used for medicine and this is it's excellent for people who need help with pain you know we've we've covered the different medicinal uses before and and not only does it have a medicinal use but this also has a really strong economic value in our local common economy and a lot of those topics are kind of overlooked and not really talked about so we want to just bring up that there are other points to these gardens and you know like it's a really beneficial thing for the community this grows really excellent around here and outdoor grows are the best grow the best kind of marijuana and have the best medicine all properties and so you know this isn't a scary thing this is a natural thing and it's really beneficial for the community and for the people couldn't have said it better myself okay so that does that we hope you've enjoyed this six-month extended shoot from Jen and I it's been fun it has been fun that does it for this edition that's long edition investigate community where we bring the amazing events organizations and sometimes interesting things happening in Nevada County you can contact us at money matters at cave amara.org my name is Mark Cunha birdie I'm John Ayala thanks for watching and in the final six month you can see the flowers are quite pronounced the harvesting has begun here's the filled with half of it harvest and you can see the slag of the plants is left on the ground and finally into the drying room where the plants are hung upside down and that allows the resident to get down into the plants themselves you can see we walk through the drying room and it was quite a bit flying as well been an interesting shoot over the last six months and we hope you have enjoyed the coverage [Music]", "ebvfMbEnnyA": "hi this is mark cuna Verde in another edition of investing in community where we cover

okay so crystal and I here at the grow again at an undisclosed location we don't even know where it is and we'll be back but meanwhile we'll give you some photos and continue our long series of medical cannabis farming in our fourth month you can see the plants have grown quite large they're 6 7 feet high the Sun again was quite hot the day we were there and you can see crystal dwarfed by the plants now there's the same shot we've used in previous videos and the plants are indeed robust in green and there she is overlooking the field made of plants still they're bringing in the beneficial bugs and the water consumption was a lot less than what you might see so the grower tells us and there we are dwarfed by all the plants and now the clones of this season will be used next season and there's crystal overlooking the field again was quite an interesting last two months the growth so here we are back in the fifth month of our small-scale commercial grow of ganja here in Nevada County and I'm with again a lovely Jenna yellow that's right so we're here and as most of you can see we've got these big plants behind us and we've got about another month to go before it's harvest time so we'll be back another time before then so the grower wanted us to emphasize that the outdoor environment is superior in producing higher quality of medicinal plants than indoors and she's very beautiful out here the medicinal qualities include a treat pain and inflammation address and treat opiate addiction and withdrawal anxiety disorders sleep disorders epileptic seizures and cancer that's right so you know it seems to be the opinion of most people that this area of the you know geological location is too marijuana as maybe Napa might be too wine so you know plants love it here the gardens really thrive here and these outdoor grows you know the emphasis is that you know with a healthy environment you have healthy plants it's pretty incredible and in you know it is pretty incredible here we were here last month we didn't see almost no flowers and now it's just yeah looks pretty incredible so we're gonna take some photographs she want to add anything before we move on to the next month you know I did see this interview and I hope I don't say this name wrong but dr. Sanjay Gupta he was saying that it's proven that marijuana will treat pain in fact it will also help in opioid rehabilitation so it helps with opioid Reap withdraws and then it also helps the brain to recover from you know being addicted so these are all facts that you know we saw I saw that on CNN the other day sure sure okay so we're to take some photographs and then we'll be back here in a month to witness the harvesting yes I'm excited for that early morning morning she's really mourning shoot and then now hopefully we'll also wissinger witness the processing of the of the medicinal products that we put out all right well let's take some pictures of these beautiful plants and then be back here next month okay we'll see you in a month and in the fifth month we welcome miss Johnnie ala back to the field she's stunned at the amount of growth we've seen the plants are six seven eight feet high as you can see she's dwarfed by the plants and the amount of flowers on the plants are quite incredible she's pointing out some of the thickness of the flowers and again the outdoor grows so says the grower are superior to the indoor grows producing a much higher quality crop and you can see the flowers the native flowers are left to remain and there's the field against the tree backdrop you can see how big they are and in our next shot you will see the concentration of the flowers that have really taken hold in this fifth month and the lovely miss Ayala is dwarfed by the plants in this fifth month shoot and another shot of the flowers in the field and it was a little bit cooler than a that we took this shot and now she's holding the fava beans which will be used for next year's crop so good morning so here we are in our six-month shoot of the small commercial ganja grow in Nevada Canyon with jenny ology yep so we're here early in the morning because this is the time when the plants are going to be the freshest so this garden right here is getting ready to be harvested and the reason why they do it so early in the morning is because as soon as the Sun hits then these plants kind of open up and they want to get it early in the morning so we got this early start as you can see there's a couple of different varieties here that I have in my hand and they're beautiful and impressive they are beautiful impressive I mean take a look at that you could see behind us there's an amazing amount of ganja here this outdoor facility so says the grower is far superior to growing indoors so we wanted to show you the final stage this grow and we'll have some more information at the end of the video so I hope you've enjoyed the series Jenna and I got up early to be here today what else we want to add well I mean I just want to add that you know this this whole garden and growing marijuana its kind of viewed as a second class sort of agricultural thing and as you can see there's there's nothing violent there's nothing criminal there's nothing dangerous going on here but it is very criminalized and you know we just kind of wanted to bring a different viewpoint at this and show you how you know this is actually used for medicine and this is it's excellent for people who need help with pain you know we've we've covered the different medicinal uses before and and not only does it have a medicinal use but this also has a really strong economic value in our local common economy and a lot of those topics are kind of overlooked and not really talked about so we want to just bring up that there are other points to these gardens and you know like it's a really beneficial thing for the community this grows really excellent around here and outdoor growths are the best grow the best kind of marijuana and have the best medicine all properties and so you know this isn't a scary thing this is a natural thing and it's really beneficial for the community and for the people couldn't have said it better myself ok so that does that we hope you've enjoyed this six-month extended shoot from Jen and I it has been fun that does it for this edition that's long edition investigate community where we bring the amazing events organizations and sometimes interesting things happening in Nevada County you can contact us at money matters at cave amara.org my name is Mark Cunha birdie I'm John Ayala thanks for watching and in the final six month you can see the flowers are quite pronounced the harvesting has begun here's the filled with half of it harvest and you can see the slag of the plants is left on the ground and finally into the drying room where the plants are hung upside down and that allows the resident to get down into the plants themselves you can see we walked through the drying room and it was quite a bit drying as well been an interesting shoot over the last six months and we hope you have enjoyed the coverage [Music]", "IZepKv9cIZU": "hey y'all farmer dre back at it it's another beautiful day here on the farm but i want to thank everybody for stopping by if you guys haven't already go and hit that subscribe button going to smash that like button if you guys enjoyed today's video don't forget i'm coming to you guys every single day until i hit 10k so if you guys want to help me out i would appreciate it but today i gotta go help out adrian he is chopping up firewood for the winter months yup someone already used a skister once today because it's unplugged out of the plugger there it's starting to get cold so we plug in all the diesel engines at night so that the uh antifreeze and the entire engine will be warm so then we'll get to get back to work oh man i gotta put fuel in here fuel empty oh and then i gotta put the pallet forks back on i mean it's not too terrible see it's already beeping at me it's already beeping at me so i gotta put fuel in the man i haven't driven the skis here and filmed in a long time so it's gonna be a little a little weird here from into it i tell get used to it a little bit you know but anyways we gotta go chop up some firewood for the house so uh let's go [Music] all righty going ahead and putting fuel here and uh believe it letting the sketcher warm up here i know you're supposed to turn off your engine whenever you uh fuel up but not for today you know it's probably a bad habit but you know you can't just start running on a cold engine because then you can get its bigger issues with uh trying to put my camera down here with the engine later on in life so uh go ahead and fill this up here and then we'll get to work there you go i know you guys farmers out there you guys have your fueling station well we just have a few hundred gallon tanks here fill them up and i mean we don't go to too much fuel here on the farm but we do i mean compared to other we go through a lot of fuel but then we don't go through a lot of fuel like all the other bigger farmers out there but yeah fuel power everything's run off fuel nowadays everything and another reason why i want to keep the skister on because i could tell how full the gauge is just by standing here and i don't want to jump in the sketch or check the gauge get back out i know nowadays electronic skid steers you know you can't leave it on when you're feeling but then again you uh can't see how full it is you just gotta wait there until it spills over or something alrighty so we are back at the orchard now and that's the property line right there that's our neighbor's yard and if you guys remember i don't know if i mentioned this but whenever we had to pull the power to my container which is that blue thing right there if you can see it we had to come through and chop off a bunch of uh uh trees and whatnot just so that could have the the the power company have 30 foot of clearance on each side so all these logs and stuff with the thicker stuff that we had to cut down so we saved it so for now so that we could go ahead and um chop it up and use it up so that's what we're doing right now we got the wood splitter the logs the bins apple crates and then of course we got the logs we got to split up then we got real farmer himself [Music] [Music] so foreign so [Music] [Music] so got two bins done now and i gotta take them in and put them in the basement because our wood stove is in the basement house so uh yeah a lot of wood's unloaded but it is what it's got to get done [Music] all right so i just got done parking this kisses here at the shop now i'm gonna go ahead and close up the high tunnels just for the fact that we're trying to trap as much as much heat as possible in the tunnels and probably turn off his irrigation on the uh cover crop here but yep day's coming to an end now in the strawberry high tunnel coming up in here and uh dr clemens from lincoln university was out here today this afternoon actually uh we were doing some research on some trap cropping not trap cropping uh we did trap cropping this summer on some aphid and spider mites monitor eight monitoring in here so uh yep pretty cool stuff i'll show you guys a trap later on but we'll go ahead and close these high tunnels here all right so i'm gonna go ahead and show you guys the uh sticky traps i got still got to put a lot more in here he gave me a bunch of them to that so we can monitor throughout the entire tunnel so we keep the population down but these are them right here it's just a sticky trap looking for a whole snap you have already seen some let's see here no that's just a pain oh there there's something just in a couple of hours i guess so uh seeing if the aphids will get stuck to this and i put i think you said eight of them here [Music] so that whenever the aphids fly up in the air go ahead and get stuck to that so we go monitor the population so that there's another issue and if the population is great enough we gotta spray for it [Music] alrighty so we got done cutting all these tiny uh twigs here i forgot to film camera was just right there i just got busy just getting dark so uh we just used these to start the fire and these burn real nice are just old uh pine dried pine sticks so uh i'm gonna go ahead and take these in the basement ready so this is all the firewood this is just in our basement here in our trough it's a little messy over there on that side so i'm not going to show you guys around that side because it's our basement then we have this trough here where the uh our legit our dryer machine's right up there and that's the outside of the house there we just put everything through this trough down here and then we uh take this wood here start the fire thieves burn those logs and then uh i'll show you the wood stove good old handy-dandy wood heater in the house here in the basement heat it up but this is where the boys live so uh yep we get nice and toasty and warm and then we will uh heat up the whole entire house so there's the firewood right there then it's right here and that's it y'all this is pretty much it for today if you guys haven't already go and hit that subscribe button go and smash that like button guys enjoy today's video don't forget i'm coming to you guys every single day until i hit 10k i want to thank everybody

growers of greenhouse produce in North America and the only publicly traded greenhouse produce company in Canada but the big story is that it's adding a new cash crop to its existing product line of fruits and vegetables cannabis we caught up with a village farms president and CEO and one of his greenhouses in Delta BC to talk about his company's move into cannabis about three decades ago we saw a clear opportunity using very high-end agricultural technology for high-value crops that can be grown or need to be grown to meet a market demand on a year-round basis and over those 30 years we've become one of the largest producers of produce specifically tomatoes peppers cubes in North America we have almost 6 million square feet of high-tech production in Texas here 4 million square feet Ontario another 3 million so on and so forth when the Canadian government decided to legalize medicinal marijuana that's when we really started doing our homework and eventually made a decision to move into the space this bold move by village farms was made possible through a recent joint venture with emerald health therapeutics a licensed medical cannabis producer also based in BC together they each own 50% of Pearson Farms corporation a vertically integrated company that aims to be one of the most reliable growers and suppliers of quality cannabis products across Canada and internationally with their combined infrastructure and expertise it's a company well positioned to enter the much-anticipated recreational marijuana market currently we're converting 10% of the assets that village LUMS international owns that 1.1 million square feet conversion of a standalone greenhouse here adjacent to this property represents 10% of the assets we own in Texas and here in British Columbia and that conversion once it's fully operational will generate close to a hundred million dollars more than all of village farm generates after 29 years in business you know I look at our business as we are greenhouse growers in in controlled environments regardless of if it's peppers tomatoes or cannabis and that will underlying business of doing that as the same we're just changing a certain crop and we've done that many times in a nine months since we launched this joint venture we're on a verge within a year of possibly being the largest cannabis producer in Canada if not the world time will tell but I think that pure Sun farms will certainly be in the top five in terms of capacity in terms of what's produced in the next two years and as Michael de Giglio explains that confidence comes from experience in the science and business of agriculture you know this is a fixed cost business you don't give a plant more fertilizer and have more yield but if you use technology making a better environment more output of the yields you grow that all helps to lower your cost and we do that every day ultimately the fact that pure Sun farms is able to operate as a low-cost producer bodes well for them in a market that is yet to be tested with revenues of 200 million as the underlying business you know we feel we're in a very dearest situation compared to our competitors so I think you know we're we're prepared to be a strong competitor to those other companies going forward I think our timing is perfect as we're starting to plant our crops over the next few months this is farming and we're farmers and it's been a long battle of 30 years to get it right village farms recently closed a ten million dollar financing to be used mainly to bring their cannabis

welcome to weed in the garage week 13 I wasn't gonna do a video today by that whale let's just keep on there so I'm consistent mainly I'm doing this for my own good anyway so you know today I was just kind of out messing in my field a little bit I took my skid stirrer and kind of went around this area on the outside of my plantings you can see the like the grass and the weeds were starting to kind of come back so I thought well before I plant in those areas I wanted to maybe try to get rid of some of those weeds try to control that the other thing I got going on is I'm I'm taking my plants here and I'm putting some mulch around them also taking the tags and moving up higher you know when you first put those tags on there way on the bottom so that's really the only spot you can put them but you know eventually they get kind of lost in the bottom of the plant so I just moved them up so they're higher but you can see the mulch you know I'll walk back to my mulch pile I finally found this sweet spot in the mulch pile which my mulch should I'm using here is just some decomposing hay with oh it's probably got a little horse manure and whatnot in it that was just from cleaning up the barns but it's you know mainly mainly hay yet but you can see it's it's quite actually warm and you know you look at it that's wet it's warm and it's makes a darn good mulch you know the purpose of the mulch is to a couple things that it'll kind of suppress the weeds around the plant it'll hold in moisture and also leach you know some nutrient down to the plant so you know as you you know they grow it to just good to have a mulch around I would say the biggest benefit is probably to hold the moisture in you know as the summer drags on and you know you're not getting rain you know most likely I'm gonna have to set up an irrigation system but so far I've been watering these all individually by hand so that that's gonna get old quick especially once I get everybody out here in the next few weeks so we'll come up with something for irrigation like I said before forest I always like to see how forest is doing and he's down here on the end he's got a few yellow leaves on the bottom and I'm sure what he's telling me if it's just time to give those leaves up or if he needs a little nutrient but you can see he's he's a nice plant he's doing quite well I might have taken a couple clones off of him but not a lot you know most of these other plants I did some you know pretty massive cloning off of him you can see some of those interior you know nodes are gone and on the bottom I've taken a lot of them off to get the the clones that I have but Bill though uh you know they'll continue to grow and fill out and I don't really think it's gonna even be noticeable to any degree by the end of the year that you took that step off but you know some of these plants have some pretty decent height to them already I don't you know that this one here is probably a solid two feet tall it looks to be one of the taller plants this first one we were looking at was a really nice plant this one I had cloned a lot I think I took 16 and clones out for this thing you know a few weeks ago but you know that's a nice plant right there I've got a couple of them that I just don't know what's going on with him certainly I didn't clone off of it like I really don't know what is going on with this plant it's been just a nightmare since the get-go I mean it seems to be growing and getting bigger but you know the leaves are all kind of curling in so I might have to do a little homework to see what that thing's problem is I thought it would kind of self correct as it grows but doesn't seem to really do that but other than that you know these are the first clones that I did that I have in the ground and you know you can see they're doing pretty well this one I kind of run over a little bit so he had a little beaten to recover from but you know all in all they're doing pretty well he's last - I just put in yesterday they were a little slow getting going but once they started to grow they've they've taken off and are going quite nicely you really can't tell the difference between that one and this one as you can see the rest of them down the line here anyway hopefully when I get this all done in the next few weeks we'll have plants you know pretty much this whole area filled up you know probably give or take 275 plants are better let's see exactly you know but yeah he might be wondering where my dogs are I was running my skit stirrer earlier like I said then when I I'm running that I just do not let him outside I would not want to run one over so I don't trust them to be out of the way they're generally pretty good but you know like I said a I don't always trust them to be where they shouldn't be so they're not out here with me now but I guess that just kind of reminded me it's time to go let them out and see what they're doing they haven't missed a show yet they certainly wouldn't miss this one except they're locked in the house anyway that's it for this week take care of", "0ib5sbx08wc": "Illegal marijuana plantations appears to

your crops will face several challenges before harvest time arrives how your crops are able to handle these challenges will determine the kind of yield you get at the end of the season among the challenges your granite cow pee and soybean crops can face are pests drought diseases weeds etc in this message we are going to focus on weeds and the practices that can help manage them to reduce the negative impacts they have on your crops other messages will talk about the other challenges and how to address them accordingly after sowing seeds on your field it does not take long before you see that it's not only your crops that are growing on the phone about weeds to weeds come in different sizes and types but they all cause harm to your crops it is therefore very important to learn how to effectively control them to ensure that they do not harm your crops and reduce your harvest four ways to establish on your field they need a few factors to thrive like all other crops the unique space moisture and new chance to grow but unlike most cultivated crops they are much more resilient and tolerant to lest unfavorable conditions this means that if they are allowed to coexist with the soybean cowpea and grounded crops your crops will be overcome this is the reason why we control measures have to always be timely in cultivating grounds coffee or soybean you have an advantage of other other kind of crops if you use the recommended planting distances you will be able to considerably reduce the amount of space available between crops for weeds to be established weeding activities are very critical in the early stages when your crops have not yet formed a canopy to suppress the of the weeds we didn't shall therefore be done regularly from the second week after planting until the canopies are formed we then shall be done with hoes and not cut classes to reduce the damage to the crops another method of controlling weeds on your farm is through the use of chemicals you can apply pre-emergence with the sides before planting or immediately after planting before any weeds appear on your field with pre imagines with the site you will not need to read your farm regularly because by the time the chemical wears out on your field to allow seeds to germinate your crops would have established a canopy which will make it very difficult for weeds to grow if you decide to use post imagines we decide to control weeds on your farm as you see or inputs dealer for brands of selective breeding sites these kinds of we desires will only kill the weeds and will not cause any damage to your ground Nets cow pee or soil plants weeds crowd our world space crops and prevents them from getting enough water and nutrients from the soil some types of weeds send their roots into the roots of our crop plants and rob them of the up food resulting in very poor growth and development weeds may also carry diseases and pests that cause harm to your plants in total you can with your farm about twice before the plants form a canopy and suppress the growth of weeds on their own the first reading can be done in two or three weeks after sowing with a second one in another two or three weeks after the first reading remember that all weeding activities might must be timely to minimise competition and avoid irreversible damage to your crops chemical weed control saves time and involves less labor costs however if you cannot afford to buy weed decides to fight the weeds on your field make sure you carry out your manual weeding safely without causing any means to the crops in the process by properly controlling the weeds on your field you would have removed one of the challenges faced by your crops in achieving a good yield there will be other messages on pest management and water management which will also address the other challenges thank you [Music]", "mVQ0FOQ_yDM": "you are listening to part 2 of the Willie Nelson interview that Willie Nelson was nice enough to sit down for on the time for him television series in may of nineteen ninety one time for him they made his debut January fifth in 1991 and was the very first television series in the history of broadcast to focus on how wonderful marijuana is over the next several months after its debut the series began airing and a variety of cities across the country and within a few short weeks was airing in 103 cities Willie Nelson was on tour that year and noticed that the series was playing in many of the town's that he and the band were singing at and when will he got him to Kentucky and decided to roll up his sleeves and help the gate with Galbraith get elected to the governor's seat which unfortunately that did not happen gateway Galbraith was nice enough to introduce me and Willie Nelson by phone and when he did Willie made a commitment to be a guest on the series and when he came into Los Angeles will he gave me a call and kept his word and you are listening to the second part of two parts of that and because of the remarkable information that comes from this interview I would ask that you share it with your friends and then also let your friends know about time number for hemp com that's time for hemp com there you can find over 400 hours of great interviews and music free to download oh yeah and we've also got a radio show that airs on American freedom radio com every monday through friday from 11 p.m. to midnight central standard time well pack a bowl and tell your friends all about this interview and we're going to take some more time for him really not that kind of like points to some of the things that we were talking about on the income that can be generated for the farms and saving the farm is on and we were talking about the difficulty of trying to reintroduce it to the economy what do you see hemp actually taking the farmers that they were start being allowed to grow it do you think happen itself could be the the crop that would say the farms for America in a state of Kentucky when the leading agricultural crop there in 1937 was him when they took that away from the farmers it was like it would be like taking we away from Kansas cotton away from Texas okay cattle you know away from it's just devastating what has happened to the farmers in that area since they're leading agricultural crop which as we've all seen is a very beneficial not only beneficial necessary plant that the earth needs if it wasn't supposed to be there the big guy wouldn't put it there mm-hmm you know he didn't make no mistakes so he put him here for a reason one of the reasons I believe is that the route is like 10 to 12 inches long which literally holds the planet together now what happens when you eradicate a plant from the planet if you check history every civilization that has gone under since the beginning of time has gone under because of soil erosion and the inability of the people to be able to feed themselves now is that a serious problem today look at bangladesh look at the places on the planet where hip has been made illegal to grow in the state of iowa that state in the last hundred years has lost over fifty percent of his top soil wow so we're talking we're talking about farming areas that are going down the drain because of some stupid not stupid some very well planned conspiracy to take the hemp plant off the planet to keep it from being competition to the other products that it would be competition to your petrochemicals your paper all the textiles now business is business as they say and anything is fair in war but when you start taking something that valuable away from the planet you're affecting other things other than just business associates you're affecting the our children who eat and where you're affecting yourself and me we're taking food away from healthy food away from our families and we're taking the healthy soil away from our planet what do you think it would take to get the farmers to rally around this plant and to unite across the United States and say give us the right to grow this plant so we can set utilizing it for industrial purposes well the biggest problem is knowledge education I think this is the first thing that has to be done the-the-the American farmer has to be made aware that 50 years ago this was a legal crop and why was it taken away I think he has to start asking himself why is this hidden from me let his but his curiosity start growing why did my grandfather plant him and why can I not plant here now I've heard all about the big scare the marijuana thing but most people who have lived any length of time at all and have been around anything at all in this on this planet knows that if we have any serious problems in the world which we do marijuana is not one of them oh no not really not one over when you start listening our serious problems its way down on the list somewhere and it might be even one of our greatest assets that has been discouraged to make appear to be a bad guy so I think what the followers should do and not only the farmer every taxpayer out there everybody who's affected everybody who eats food should start wondering why are we so kept in the dark over this one plant the hemp plant yeah do you get any slack or difficulty being a performer who advocates the really cool is it really was a shin of him do you I get into a lot of things that I get to lack for yeah I know hard to say where my plaques coming from okay if you had the opportunity to express yourself at any one point in time to the American people and and deliver the message of the farmer what would you say well first of all the fact that you're able to do this show and I'm here talking on it and it means that this idea has come it's time for people to consider it and make a decision one way or another and it's a question you have to ask yourself is it important is the planet worth saving can help really save the planet if it can why is it kept such a secret from us ask yourself these questions call around to some research and make your own conclusions I'd say we are facing a world that needs medicines we are facing a rule that needs food and we are facing a world that's rather stubborn when it comes to dealing with the topic of drugs they seem to overlook the fact that marijuana is a plant that can be ground for as we've said paper fiber and fuel we have people overseas who are growing it for just that is there anything that we can learn from RS our brothers and sisters ever sees do you think that would help we're gonna do this into our economy well you must remember that our brothers and sisters overseas are controlled by the same people who control us here they're planning habits hemp is illegal in many parts of the planet and it's been made illegal by the same people who made it illegal here the oil companies a petrochemical people who are the paper industries the people who own trees on this planet would rather see us chop down the trees and make paper rather than use hemp which could save all the trees there's great there's a lot of opposition here so with this is a war that we're just only beginning stages of and there will be opposition from a lot of people there will be a lot of people throwing a lot of accusations at you at me so you better be ready for well it has been a joy to have you on our program today you know to have heavy honor of you coming in here and speaking on behalf of the farmers I mean you have a voice of authority you know as you've seen it and you've been there and we want to wish you all the luck on what you're doing is there any place that anybody can write or get in contact if they want to get participate in farm aid or if they want to find some way of helping the farmers in their states is there any organizations that you can think of that might benefit from there are many organizations formated funds many different organizations agricultural movements in all the states all the areas and it's very simple to find out who in your area represents the farmers of the farmers alliance or whatever there's there's many many organizations and you can look in your phone book or ask your neighbor and find out who or you can also call one eight hundred farm eight excellent thank you very much don't", "4uebsnYL8Ro": "hey all farmer dre back at it i'm not on our farm today i'm out here with uh at cox hospital south springfield my brother val got this job to build two high tunnels here there are two movable high tunnels and today we're putting on plastic so i'm the wiggle wire guy they call me out here every single time they got to put wiggle wire on so tunnels are framed up here nicely but i'll get more in the detail i'm going to kind of interview him even though he's my brother here to to uh talk more about this job anyway so i gotta start putting moving the rocks here start putting on plastic we've got the crew out here got to wear a vest because the city of springfield requires us so anyways get to work here so it's going to take you guys along here with the uh job and the plastic and everything so you guys already see me do this on our tunnels but they're unloading the uh plastic there i'm gonna go ahead and put the gopro as high as you can on that teleport phone put a time lapse go for you guys here because trying to film and work at the same time ain't doing too well so i guess this time lapse will do uh pretty good trying to put on that one but uh this one seems to do pretty good for now so we'll see brownie goes about 25 foot in the air so hope this pulls magnetic magnet ah stop stop oh wow oh wow we got the views from up here the views okay see if i go any higher uh after it's maxed out we're about 20 something feet in the air here we will see how much i can get from up here so we'll see there's a hospital right there it's a huge hospital i mean it goes like two miles that way anyways [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] do [Music] [Music] [Applause] so i'm going to continue working up here are double wiggle wiring this um the plastic here i'm going to give these two guys uh the camera there that's valastro i do you guys both know these guys my brothers favorite brothers ever and uh val's going to talk about what he does so casual dude all right all right guys so as andre was saying i'm val um i own true home property services we build high tunnels we do excavating grading stuff like that we're here on a project in uh well we're straight in springfield right in the city doing a project for springfield community garden we got two 30 by 96 tunnels that we installed v-trax system we just got them completed we've got topsoil put down [Music] [Music] all right so let me show you guys a little bit what a v-track high tunnel is so it's a 30 by 96 standard but we have casters on every single pillar that holds the trusses up and as we could do show you guys here six foot high thin wall caster on the bottom v track on the bottom that gets staked down into the concrete then we have anchors on the v-track with and that holds the tunnel down and it's very solid very sturdy and it's just as great as a fixtured one but you could do rotational growing in this one for example you want to have a you only have a tractor with the cab you plant the back section unhook the tunnel roll it to the back and you'll grow there then you do rotational um growing throughout the season all right how did you do so another cool feature with these end walls is in order to move it and have everything planted we went ahead and we have doors that come installed here let me latch it on real quick they're pretty light they're not too heavy for the average customer the door does come off of the hinges so it can be easy so this allows for the movement yeah and this is ready to move in the back yeah once you unhooked all the um anchors anchors on it correct [Music] all righty so two high tunnels here are done and uh they're looking nice spiffy they call me wiggle wire dre because that's the thing i do is i come out here and help them put the wig wire and finish off the plastic so uh looking good and uh yeah they know a wiggle wire is come on right dude so we got the crew and uh i'm not used to wearing these vests around but hey city of springfield requires it so any other words for val words of advice man andre thank you for coming out helping us out yeah no problem if you guys need a quote or pricing on any tunnel or installation just hook up andre he'll send me my uh your my email [Applause] truehomellc gmail.com shoot me an email get your price listing installation listing everything you need so yeah awesome yeah so i'm gonna go ahead and leave his email down in the description box below and uh like i said any high tunnel greenhouse construction anything like that agricultural based he's a man to do it he's an expert this is already our uh was it your 10th tunnel installed so ever since he started doing this and we got two more going on on our farm this next this fall and then we've got this property the three yeah the plan has put three more there so hey the diversity of agriculture is uh is uh growing so hey urban farms out here we're exactly in springfield missouri that's the hospital like i mentioned earlier so it doesn't get any better than this best way to do is support your local farmers so these high tunnels are pretty pretty fancy compare compared to the ones we have on our farm these are really really nice i mean at the end of the day as long as you have a structure plastic and they're covered that's going to do the trick for you these ones are movable i mean it's nice but at the end of the day whatever fits your budget whatever's gonna work on your farm so like i said these things are awesome i kind of wish we had uh some of these on our farm but it is what it is maybe one day they're gonna go ahead and lock everything up here and uh be done so now we are back home adrian and i got back home around uh 11 30ish then i helped adrian pack for the farmer's market so he's out there right now isaac and i are out clearing up some fence i got some exciting news for you guys probably the next video you guys will uh find out what's going on here on our farm we've been super busy working you know 12 or 16 hour days and you know sometimes it's just i just can't find the motivation to pull out the camera and actually film it's you know a lot of times it's not just about the filming process it's about going to the house and editing the video and sometimes you know just like you're so exhausted after a long day that you just don't really you know kind of feel like editing a full video and doing that for a really long time kind of kind of guess too so you know it is what it is i try to bring you guys as much as you can as much as i i possibly can but stay tuned for the next video or the next videos to come i got some super exciting news i am we are getting ready for strawberries and uh kind of stressing about that a little bit i mean we ordered 33 000 that is a lot of strawberries we're going to be planting some in the high tunnel about a month ago we got pre-approved for our third high tunnel so we're going to be putting that up here pretty soon and it's just getting ready for uh apple season we're gonna start you pick apples this saturday so be the first saturday of you pick apple so we gotta clean the orchard make sure everything is nice mowed ready get it get it ready for the customers and it's just one that time of year where everything's going at a million miles an hour and uh it's just this is part of part of being a farmer so this is gonna be pretty much it for today if you guys

welcome back to our youtube channel hello hello hello guys today [Music] let's get high [Music] [Music] for example this one [Music] picture pictures [Music] foreign [Music] yes", "--jBVAs1Rrg": "if you're in a foreign language if you're a linguist you know study all the different languages that you that they'd have you know the different words for cannabis and him can't cannabis sativa sativa is a Latin word for useful so cannabis sativa a useful plant now they call it the devil's lettuce you know so it's it's really twisted the way they change that but we know it's useful cannabis the word canvas is actually derived from the word cannabis so the Conestoga wagons that explored our western frontier were covered with canvas made out of cannabis so it's really cool and this is the Chinese symbol for him it's a very straightforward symbol of a shed with a couple hip plants or cannabis plants hanging upside down to dry so I don't approve of tattoos however you're looking to get one that might be a good one you did so we have linguistics but there are areas if you're into biology or chemistry we need to understand the makeup of the hemp stock the cannabis stock is very complex it's got these long fibers that long bast fibers that run the entire length of the stock and then the inside of the stock is just woody herd material which is very high in cellulose and this is an electron microscope picture of a hip herds so you can see how you know it's just the pattern of it there's a lot of things we can do by studying this or study the composition of a hemp seed you know why does it have such good you know percentage of proteins in the central fatty acids and how can we make hemp seeds with better nutritional value so there's a lot of different areas in this this realm for you to look at if you're in engineering we need a lot of work in the engineering area thanks to reefer madness thanks to the fact that we haven't been able to grow hemp for 70 years in America the entire hemp industry has basically been decimated in America and there's been zero research and development into all of the machinery used to harvest and process him so we need engineers out there we need students to the new machines that process hemp fiber this is an old machine and the hip fiber would go in just like this and the wheels would crush up you know it's separate the herds from the fiber but we need we need people to look at that we need to look at the hemp fiber it grows hemp grows 10 to 12 feet tall in the fiber runs the entire length of the stalk so it's one continuous piece which means the tensile strength is very high which means it's very good for composite materials composite plastics so if you're into composites and you want to develop a green material look at hemp fiber and develop that you know document it so we can show that it's a great thing for composite materials and that our farmers should be able to grow it", "7DKgHq3tKg4": "hey y'all farmer great back at it another beautiful monday afternoon here on the farm i've been out here all day going out all day just for a couple hours you're working on the soil this morning i had to make a drive up to morgan county seat all the nerd at 5 30 gonna go pick up the classic drip tape and all the other stuff we needed for the strawberries and i plot up the soil last week now i'm just working on making sure it is ready to go for the uh the raised bed maker the plastic mulch earlier and hopefully by uh end of this week we'll be planting some strawberries our plants are coming in tomorrow actually so 33 000 strawberry plants coming in and um you know big changes here on my property we actually just got done drilling a well i actually took some footage of that uh last week so the wheel the pa the well the casing is not done now they got to come back next week and um put the well i mean put the actual motor and pump in the ground there and make sure to connect everything make sure everything's ready to go and uh like i said a real busy time here on the farm you know last week only posted one video so hopefully this week i'll get more videos out there for you guys trying to try to balance everything out make sure everything is ready to go but anyways today i'm out here disc in the field getting you ready to uh to plant ready getting ready for the raised bed so you guys stay tuned for today's video all righty so it has been a quick minute since i dropped the gopro and started filming we are extremely busy we uh got the soil ready i went ahead and plowed this a second time i got the soil ready last night i thought today i'm gonna go ahead and start forming the beds but you know i got to thinking and i was like instead of having to fix plastic like i did last fall i'd rather just go ahead and plow it up again and get that ready you know get the soil you know six to ten inches below you know make sure it's nice and soft and ready to go so that whenever we do start laying plastic so that we could have you know ample amount of dirt to go ahead and throw on the sides there and just have enough soil to work with so that's what i did took me cardio it took me like three hours to go through through and re-plow everything make sure it's nice and ready to go we got to come through tomorrow and finish off picking off the big rocks here isaac is on the disc there he's going to continue finishing that off and i am spreading fertilizer right now it's a small tractor there and uh you know hopefully like i said tomorrow we're gonna go ahead and start making the bed and we'll see you have three farm tours tomorrow at 9 10 11 and 11 so we'll see how how much we get done you know so that's the biggest problem this time here you're super busy with your orchard and we've got to get all the strawberry plants in the ground and we're still picking tomatoes after they put one the crew went out there and paid 180 pounds of tomatoes this morning i had to send an agent to the farmers market there's just so much going on but slowly and surely we will get done so you know our deadline to plant strawberries is the 22nd of uh what month is this september i'm just so uh exhausted and tired after full days of work and i've been working 20 hour days for last week just trying to get everything ready lined up you know waking up early getting the store and everything ready you know and then we do the farm tours and coming out here later on in the afternoons and uh just trying to get it done so super busy now i'm gonna go ahead and jump into the uh small tractor here and spread this fertilizer here i um this is just a uh this is just a maintenance fertilizing so on strawberries you want to add you know anywhere from a 70 to 100 pounds of actual nitrogen per acre of dry fertilizer before you plant then we also got some p and k in there from our soil testing what we need in there so um you know the soil ph is fairly good for strawberries i believe it's like six point two or three it's it's really good i mean some lime would have been been a good but you know i didn't want to get the lime truck out here and now when i got home from the fertilizer place i realized that they had pelletized lime so i could have put some in here but you know adding this in here and then we will obviously feed through the drip system as well so after we transplant three weeks into the fall we gotta put about seven pounds of actual end per acre until you know just the first few weeks after transplant and of course we got to put the uh starter plant solution it's just a high phosphorus fertilizer whenever we do go through and transplant i think we put like a pound of dry fertilizer water with soluble fertilizer in our tank and the transplanting tank just have the roots that that foster has really helped out the root system to go ahead and get established here and another exciting thing is those guys that were out here uh yesterday i believe they finished they they drilled the well so we went ahead and we went ahead and put a well back here and hello so this well right here is 485 foot in the ground and they found a good aquifer water and they have ample amount of water you can see all the limestone back here that's draining so hopefully in the next couple of days we will have you know i ordered a shipment container to come we're gonna go ahead and make our well house in a shipment container and get some bigger tanks and the fertilizer injectors and everything going on in there i have power coming next week so that's just part part of farming new land and one one thing i already messed up on you guys could see that the bigger clumps of uh of grass and all the roots i should have tillered you know use the rototiller first and to kill off all the grass and they went ahead and plowed it but i was like you know well let me just go ahead and plow that that grass saw there and it didn't work out too well i had to go down through there with the disc quite a bit of times but you know everything is falling into place uh you know hopefully by next week the well be connected ready to go they got that drilled all you got to do come out here put the pump in there we'll have power out here the strawberry plants are laying plastic tomorrow morning so slowly surely one day at a time we are getting it done and uh you know as you guys saw my last video there the u-pick they wiped out this these uh back two acres here so they're there's not a single apples on those trees anymore and like i said the field trip so it's just real busy time real hectic time but you know there's just you got to get it done and get the shower plants in the ground so hopefully surely slowly and surely we will get it done so i'm gonna go ahead and jump into the small tractor here and i had isaac uh smoothing that out a little bit there and i'm gonna strike start spreading this fertilizer here and hopefully get it done before it gets too dark here so so so just like that the fertilizer is spread here and uh isaac is running over the disc you can see all those white pellets there on the ground i don't know if you can see that or not but good old mixture fertilizer it's time to get go we'll plant so um make sure everything's right good to go so conditions are a little a little good but i'm gonna figure it by tomorrow morning by the more afternoon they should be okay so it's flowing pretty nicely out of the disc here so as you see here it's phone pretty good so so just like for everything else the prep work actually takes a little longer than the actual uh part of doing it so i mean so prep work is i mean it's a big deal because if you don't get these soil conditions right for the plastic mulch layer i mean i experienced that myself and it was just a pain i mean it costed us yield and then it was just hard to manage everything whenever you got plastic flapping over everywhere so you know i told myself i'd rather spend another day working on the soil conditions making sure they are ready to go then uh you know trying to trying to push it and try to get these strawberries planted and then you know you get a 29 20 mile an hour windstorm and then it kind of wipes out most of your your plastic there and then it's a pain you got all this money invested inside the plants and i mean your first of all your time you know you know a few days you take you know spending getting a soil ready plus your um cost of uh your input costs with strawberry plants and everything else you know it's just you know another day here of getting the soil ready it's not going to hurt us long term so hopefully the plants will be here tomorrow or day after that by the end of the week if uh plants not in you know it kind of crunches our time and you know to plant but we still got what 10 days until the uh plants you know until that deadline comes so we're still on a good track here but whenever you think about it 33 000 plants i'm kind of getting worried about it kind of stressing out just a little bit but soil prep for these strawberries is pretty much complete like i said tomorrow hopefully we'll get the um transplant right here or you can tell i'm tired i'm talking nonsense here we'll get the uh we're gonna get the plastic mulch layer get that going hopefully by tomorrow afternoon we'll have them all the plasma mold clay and once the soil conditions are great you it lays really easy but once once it takes a while you know you got to get adjust everything so anyways yeah tired it's getting dark what does that mean time to go to bed so this is going to be pretty much it for today i know it's a little it's a choppy video but whenever we're out here working and sitting three to four hours on the tractor you know you film you get excited about filming there at the beginning and then by time you get done you're just tired and exhausted but this is gonna be pretty much it for today soil prep for the strawberries is complete we got the well done so that's all good news everything's running smooth so if you guys haven't already go ahead and hit that subscribe button go ahead and smash the

up and what better place to go then cannabis the Green Rush all the excitement there's only one problem I don't know anything about it so come along with me as we learn about cannabis together [Music] [Music] [Music] we're at the kind buds farm in a fellow Washington where we're gonna learn from Frank everything we need to know about cannabis [Music] hey Frank what are you doing over here well we're filling up these pots with soil so that we can transplant our girls into their final resting place for the season when we came in we saw this great big mound of dirt what's all that about yeah we just got that delivered in from Canada and it's what we're filling all these pots with it's a very porous soilless mixture so that it's really good for the root zone so we're getting all these 50 gallon grow bags filled so that we can transplant our other plants into their final resting place for the season so there's a special quality about this dirt or bug free or yes it's very very clean very sterile clean very professional business and they bring some excellent excellent soil it's peat peat moss and perlite and there's really no dirt in there so it's just a good neutral real porous so they get a lots of oxygen and so using this special soil you can control the nutrients better yes exactly because we're not putting it in the soil and hoping that we've done the right mix and make a bio available at the roots we're putting a very neutral soil and then we're adding it when we water them we're just adding our nutrients to it so we have complete control over what it gets throughout its whole life is this a common way to grow marijuana outdoors yes I'm gonna thought people put it in the ground well it depends on your soil and the soil out here is real agricultural so it's good for a lot of agricultural crops but it's real sandy not very porous it also has a lot of parasites in it that we just don't want to deal they're clients so it is pretty common outdoor growers even on the California they didn't put him in the ground they put him in the ground they were just digging a hole putting their soil in there and probably would have been happy to do that except for the parasites that are in the soil here that we don't want to have to use any massive pesticides or anything to control anything so or controlling the soil is that right there's plastic on the ground that and help keep dust down and help keep these weeds that you see or her fair ubiquitous around here out from away from our plants yes excellent thanks Frank since I'm investing in the farm would you like me to get my hands dirty absolutely we can always use help out here I better not break a nail no I'm fine until I start complaining about it right and you'd be like I told you oh you want me to help you [Music] and I kind of swing it into there I just you want to try to pull it I think I can I think I can that's how hard okay haven't gotten to the hill yet [Music] we'll move it after we move the car pull that car forward for me that'll go down don't worry about it run right over [Music] what's next well now we got to get the water lines in the water emitters in so that we put the plants in we can give them some water I said a more efficient way of watering them than just oh yeah hand water in just this many plants that would just take forever I'd have a watering system so that's what Mike and I are going to get going on now so first you want to make sure the pot is situated and sometimes they get a little jumbled kind of flat and yeah dig out a hole big nice and flat then you come over here first just quickly go from the bottom here and just kind of pull off in either the brown leaves don't get too concerned about it will do that plenty more you can even get the ones out of there and then you just take that bag rip it open all the way down to the bottom it's heavy man you kind of ruffle the bottom a little bit [Music] one two so it's like a full terms like two efforts see I'm sir just put your fingers on either side one pull around yeah and then put it pretty close off the center there but you don't want to just shove it right there then you might get here if you feel big pressure from roots stop mm-hmm and then just put that in there about an inch up okay move on all right let you do that one whole little dead pieces what are we planting here Frank what strain is this this is OG k v7 and I do not know what that stats a hold it just buy that stock like that it's not hey Frank what's with all the security cameras well marijuana is a pretty valuable crop so we got to protect it plus the state mandates it not just not just cameras so that we can catch anybody breaking in and stealing but also so that they can keep an eye on what we're doing and they can always come and request footage if they have to suspect that maybe we've done some kind of violation of the laws so it's mandated but it's also a good practice because we want to protect our my crop have you ever had anything stolen not from here no this one's wet okay little girl oh girl yeah and why is it important that they're all girls because if we have males in here they would pollinate the females and then they females are developed seeds and we don't nobody wants seeds in there bleed I don't want seeds in my weed so this is the dosatron that's actually what it's called I don't know if you can hear it as well as I can but it's got a nice beat and you can dance to it hey Frank what's behind me this is our storage connects and processing facility climate control is where we keep our product in the pristine condition until we actually package it and send it off to the retail stores so in plain English that's where the good stuff is let's go check it out so here we have air conditioning and humidifier or dehumidifier so that we can maintain it below 75 degrees and keep the humidity around 50 percent is that important for the storage yeah that keeps the product in pristine condition doesn't get too dried out it does it's not too moist where it will start the mold so you keep it right at that perfect spot so it doesn't get too dry and it'll be perfect when you smoke it what's this thing this is the green rose trimmer it's a trimming machine you put the bud in there spins around and comes out mostly trying to sell not a good hand trim but yeah there's no perfect machine solution yet for trim when it does come is going to be into the industry because labor and that hand tremors it's a real bottleneck in the industry because that Americans really like that hand trimmed flower like in Israel you know they have the government medical program and the government does all the growing and they only way you can purchase cannabis is either an oil and a hash farm or in a joint if you want flour you guys smoke a joint cuz they're not going to process it and trim it all the way down they just grind up and make the joint out of it so but but the American consumers so used to hand trimmed perfect little flower they've not settling for anything less so what you have to do it what are these boxes for a frame well this is where we're storing all our products for example this is some product harvested from last year that we haven't quite a process yet so we leave it on the stem in the climate-controlled environment until we can get to the final stages of processing and trimming it as you can see it still got it holds its shape so it's not too dried out and it's a good way to store it leaving it on the stem if y'all can get to it to get it all trimmed up it's just easier for it to dry out so some of these bins have the trim in them some of them have our lotta deflower already we have just the old just this is what we call rough trim that ones so that's just stuff that's gonna go to an extractor and be just turned into oil and this is the stuff that comes off in the machine no this isn't even from the machine this is just stuff like when we're harvesting just all this stuff but and it's it's no great glass material but still got value so you said this is various products what is of the approximate value of what you have in here I think I've estimated it quarter million and before marijuana was legal in the state of Washington what would this have been worth street value approximately [Music] double that bus without any taxes the difficulty that farmers like Frank face trying to raise funds in order to grow the size of their business really emphasizes the importance of the cannabis investment group like Michael Gordon over at cush that bring the producers and the retailer's together on couche marketplace really is needed in this industry to enable that growth so people like Frank can fill this whole farm full of plants this is a platform that facilitates large school sale transactions between producers processors and retailers it makes what they do every single day faster easier to ensure fair market price so explain maybe the struggle that a producer or processor would have to get their product in a retail this is such an old-fashioned industry when you're a producer you've got your where say you've got your cannabis and you literally knock on door after door after door and you say hello my name is Michael I've got the best cannabis product but you're one of 200 and to differentiate yourself from that market it's tough to even get a meeting and into the door of a retail store as near impossible for these small and medium-sized farmers so with our relationships with retailers we can help break down those walls and ensure that that they're able to make sales is there anything else you'd like to say oh that's that's what an opportunity to talk about the cannabis industry social change is coming with probably 60 or 70% of the United States being in support of legalization I think it's important to talk with like it's a regular thing learn a little bit about the difference between indica and sativa visit illegal stay walk into a store and see what it's all about we're literally making history here together and to be able to participate in that as a special thing that you probably only get one chance in your entire life to experience such a change like legalize cannabis that's one thing that I have found as I enter the cannabis industry is it's really a community it's a partnership between everybody involved yes I was actually pleasantly surprised by how the industry shaped out because of course you know I was a grower for 15 years in the medical market and you know we all kept to ourselves for the most part it really wasn't everybody kind of had their own ways of doing things real secretive by nature and once the industry started is really really pleased to see how a lot of the growers were helping each other out giving secrets talking about how to get through the inspections with the LCB etc it's really turned into a group a community that you know everybody seems to really care about the other guy there's so much room nobody really has to worry about you know seriously you know the competition real hard there's room to brand and to expand and to grow in so many areas that you know it's still really open I hope it stays that way because it's a definitely a fun crowd I agree the community aspect is one of the things I like most about it it makes it fun it really does we've had some fun at some of these events at way yeah speaking of the Warren G concert right that's that was a fun night I was not expecting to attend a Warren G concert in Bellingham of all places I know it was uh yeah some partners of mine put that together and it was a really fun time it was mostly an industry event we brought a lot of retail store owners in a lot of growers together so it was just a good event to really mingle with the industry plus you know just a bunch of people got to see some brand names up there on the on the sponsorship so you know get some awareness out there to have our companies yeah I think brand awareness is something that a lot of the cannabis industry is struggling with right now absolutely absolutely there's not everybody that's in this even once the branded there's guys out here they just want to grow it and sell somebody else and they just want to grow it they don't really care about that but I'm I'm definitely about building a brand because I'm very proud of my product and I've put a lot of time and effort into really making a high quality product and I'm really proud of it and so I I only wanted to get in this if I could build a brand if I could grow it and put my name on it and say this is my product that's what I didn't wanted to do so the industry has a long way to go to to get all that dialed in that's for sure the wild weird wonderful business of growing pot stickers lots and lots of stickers actually this is important this has a barcode on it and this barcode is required by the state of Washington they track from seed to sale and so there's actually a lot of information on this t-rex one gram that tells you the string t-rex the weight one gram says grown by beacon buds with his license number where is it going the gallery with their license number it also contains the harvest date and Frank referred earlier that you have to do testing on it and so it tells you how much THC isn't it and how much THC a and how much CBD and then the barcode which the retailer uses to scan when they make the sale and one of these barcodes has to go on every single package and it has to be straight right Frank [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] hi I'm Matt Lewis I'm the producer of legally Simone that was our first episode be sure to hit the subscribe button to get all of our videos coming out soon and also like us on Facebook it's legally stone a documentary series thank you [Music]", "DjP9FfyWDIc": "welcome to my experiment so it's midsummer and got quite a bit of flowering out here the females have decided to make a full appearance and as I suspected some of the plants are full male like this one right here and some of the plants seem to be full female and some of the plants are hermaphroditic so we've got a combination of the 2 i'd say most of them armed aphrodite so looks like i'm going to get some seed out of this crop this year so that's uh that's making me happy and once again law enforcement is leaving me alone because I am a registered hemp farmer in this state and at the same time I'm harvesting the Rye a mano with a side old school that's the way I like things so crop is looking pretty good it's not bad for a pound of seeds got about a quarter of an acre I think I had the intention of starting out with an acre and a half but that was a little ambitious this looks more like a quarter acre so that's what I ended up with some of the insects that I've noticed so far Japanese beetles out here it's a number of other weevil like looking creatures but for the most part they just do a little bit of damage to the leaves and the plants stay pretty healthy and can withstand that level of consumption so not worried about the bugs and the deer certainly certainly been out here there's a doe with two fawns and they don't touch these things so my theory on that is a they don't know what the hell they are don't recognize them in their natural fauna and food stockpiles so they don't touch him additionally i think the the cannabis plant because of its cousin that it's psychoactive properties don't lend itself to healthy deer because a stone deer in my view is a dead deer I mean if you're a dear and you're high you're probably not going to be as worried about predators and running into cars and such not to say anything about folks who do get high he certainly used to be one of those back in high school so again just going through the field looking for anomalies plants that don't look quite right these all look like cannabis sativa hemp so far I haven't seen any plants that someone has tried to install in my fields as a frame job and some people might say well you're letting the cat out of the bag know people have been framing each other with contraband since the beginning of history so it's nothing new and I say it's going to happen and you just got to be diligent that's all because you don't want law enforcement to show up and say AHA you're growing marijuana out here disguised as industrial hemp so we can't have that so industrial have farmers beware and just be diligent get out there and be vigilant don't allow your crop to be contaminated as for the marijuana growers out there you certainly don't want any hemp farms nearby because the pollen spreads far and wide I think about two miles and sometimes bees can transport it even farther than that so if you look at nail plan i'll see if i can get this one too it's been windy so you don't have that much pollen but boy do they produce pollen anyway that's the report and get some seeds in the ground people so you can have a nice harvest later", "SneSBj9-mZk": "thank you for tuning in to the fridays from the farm from the fox and crow farm in new hampshire our podcast series for the month of march women in farming i'm so excited to bring this amazing topic to the forefront of our march podcast series i have the privilege of knowing so many

want to go and how will they get there we will share stories of success and failure and talk about the emotional impact farming has had on their bodies mind and soul join us for this motivating and inspiring journey with some of the toughest women in new hampshire from our fridays from the farm march series women in farming from new hampshire i want to thank everybody for joining us on our fridays from the farm this is the podcast series from the fox and crow farm in barnstead new hampshire the month of march we're actually talking about women in farming and today we're going to be joined by nancy meings up in samberton new hampshire she's going to share with us her story and her business wild berry farm in samberton so thank you so much nancy for joining us today thanks erin thanks for having me oh of course so i always like to start the series kind of you know give everybody a little bit of an introduction or not even a little bit tell us a little tell us about your life before the farm and you can go back as far as you feel comfortable um so we we are relatively new to farming uh we moved to new hampshire about six years ago prior to that um i had gardens and i loved the gardening i never grew up gardening though this was new i didn't start gardening until i had children and i needed a hobby to do at home and then um we had horses when we were in we came from connecticut and we had horses because my daughter was into uh horseback riding and i always wanted a horse um always wanted a horse but never never lived in a situation where that could happen so so i was really happy uh to get her into horseback riding and then to have a horse that she could ride i didn't necessarily want to ride it um and so so i just loved taking care of animals i loved being um being in the dirt uh digging growing things eating my own food and i will say prior to that part of my love of farming is that my uncle is a farmer in new hampton he's 93 years old today not today is his birthday but he is 93 years old and he had a dairy farm when i was growing up and we used to help him we used to muck the stalls with him we thought that was great fun um and uh we used to um you know feed the cows and then he went from dairy to uh beef and he also has always done maple syrup and so it was we just always the whole family that's where we went for vacation we never went to the tourist things we just went up to the farm and we ran around and that's where my memories from real farming come and i think that's where my love of horses because they always had a horse they always had all different kinds of animals but their focus was on dairy first and then beef and the maple syrup um and and i and i loved the lifestyle i really loved the um the fact that they they just woke up and they did what they needed to do they were busy all the time i like to be busy um and um and there was just a sense of serenity around that lifestyle that i that i wanted um so fast forward to where we are today um when my husband and i were thinking about retiring we wanted to do something that would keep us busy my husband is in it for the tractors i will say that and all the pto equipment that goes with it exactly exactly so that was the that was the carrot in front of the um you know on the stick for him um and uh and he is so happy to be uh here up here with a tractor but um we decided we wanted to farm uh we looked for two years before we found the farm that we really wanted and i will say that it's much bigger than anything that we had expected we were thinking around 30 acres you know some chickens maybe some horses we thought about doing a horse rescue but we found this farm we loved it and we ended up working with it [Music] it took a lot of work because it was pretty overgrown we have wild blueberries i mean they're the high bush and they they are not they're somewhat cultivated in that they're not the low bush but they are they grow wild and they don't they aren't in any order they don't they're wild they just kind of grow where they sprouted and so so it took a lot of work when we first moved here there was a lot of buckthorn and invasives um uh what's that other one the um bittersweet was all over the place and we did it all um by hand and of course again my husband pete was there with the tractor like oh we need a log splitter oh we need a chipper we need a this [Laughter] so that's that's kind of how we got here um we did get the sheep because i wanted an organic way to deal with the weeds to maintain the weeds because basically i'm kind of lazy i like to keep busy but i also like to find the easiest way to do this do something so we got these little baby doll sheep to eat under the bushes but we soon found out that they they can climb not climb like a squirrel but they can stand up on their hind legs so they ended up eating the bushes so that didn't last very long but they were so cute and when people come to pick berries we just kept them so that's how we ended up with sheep [Laughter] so let's go back um so where were you guys in connecticut so we were in the new haven area um i worked actually worked at yale university uh doing web design and development uh for the various departments within the university yeah yeah so i was sitting at a desk all day right i mean were you were you already kind of living in a rural rural or agricultural setting or were you guys kind of in an urban setting we were in a relatively um rural area uh we actually had my daughter's horse actually lived on our property so we had five acres which is a lot in in where we were we went from living on a quarter of an acre to getting five acres um and it was kind of the same scenario we didn't intend to get a horse although i did but i didn't tell pete about it until we got the tractor um [Laughter] and then and there was this piece of land that was kind of overgrown and we cleared it out and you know it was we he the horse couldn't graze of course we had to have two horses he couldn't graze but um but we it was enough that we knew what it would take to take care of animals we knew that it was a full-time commitment we knew that we couldn't just take off and go away for a weekend uh without um you know somebody there who knew about horses so we um it was it was rural enough and we grew quite a bit of food that i canned a lot of it in a small you know urban kind of garden it wasn't it wasn't a field we lived in the woods basically so we had to create the space for the garden but um it was a little mini farm i think yeah so so you're you've worked your whole career you and your husband worked your whole career you kind of have this cute little hobby farm going on and you think oh for retirement we want something like quadruple size with way more responsibility work and obligation am i understanding that correctly well kind of we didn't [Laughter] we didn't plan on 115 acres we we were looking for a smaller 30 acres um enough to pasture a horse you know or something um and um we just we found this place and we kind of grew into it i mean i think that's part of what our adventure is really been about is that um we i mean i had never even picked a blueberry before um i never you know went apple picking we lived near a place that did it so i will say that and we used to watch what they did every year we lived across the street basically from at least a 10-acre raspberry farm and so we used to see how they what they did every year and we were intrigued by it and just kind of the way um the way that things happened um but but we had never really had our hands in it um but we love the property and we really didn't want to destroy what was already here um the blueberries that were here we had some people come and look and and they said just mow it all down and start fresh but we we really like look we're good at looking at something and building something from what already exists so that's kind of how we ended up here yeah well we'll find too so in a couple of other podcast series that we've done and this is this really is an important message i think for a lot of our aspiring farmers that that are listening or watching so you guys you took you took this existing landscape you went there with a complete open mind and you allowed that landscape to kind of shape what you were doing and how you were doing it and and then i've noticed too in the time that i've known you even the product that you've produced from the farm has evolved and changed to kind of meet the needs of what you've done and we'll talk about that more but i think the important takeaway for anybody that's thinking about getting into this it's not like you woke up one day and said i want you know dozens of sheep and i wanna manicure you know 15 acres of blueberries and do endless amounts of weeding [Music] you you literally allowed that landscape to provide that lifestyle and that culture am i right yes yes that's that's exactly it uh we knew we wanted to farm we didn't know exactly how that would manifest itself but we were open to um what we wha what we found uh yeah i mean we had to for the sheep we had to redo all the fencing because it the person before us had cows cattle and horses so we had to redo all the fencing we are also now in the process of uh we planted raspberries last year so we're expanding it to to what it had um and yeah because we because we just love the property and we and we just it was you know we we knew we could could make it work but but i think that is an important message for people um that it doesn't necess like i'm really big on setting goals uh but but i can't i can't set a goal that says i because again originally we thought we were going to have a horse rescue and and we had a couple of horses when we came here and we realized that it was just going to be too much at our age it was going to be too much work um so um yeah so so we just kind of let it evolve yeah so what what brought you to new hampshire um what brought me to new hampshire is basically family uh we like i said before um we spent our as kids i spent my summers um uh with my my family my uncle we would go up to the farm my uncle and my cousins i'm very close with them they're kind of like brothers my cousins um and my uncle is like a second uh father and um and we came up here when we had our kids we did the same thing we would come up and we would live come up for vacations and for weekends so it's like my sec it's always been like my second home and when our kids graduated from high school we felt really felt more connected in new hampshire than we did in connecticut um so that that's why we chose to come here yeah yeah so let's talk about um the current farm that you have let's talk about wild berry farm and you know from the day you bought it and you started doing all the land clearing what sort of evolutionary things have happened since then well um so we've um we've improved the land quite a bit uh i think um uh number one we we have fencing which took us a long time to figure out because sheep really do require secure fencing they have they have to have at least five strands and we tried to do it with the temporary fencing which is great temporary fencing is great until the winter you know and it doesn't work anymore so the first thing that we had to do and we were very very lucky i have to say we're very lucky that we got in contact with a lot of people who helped one is jared um but um uh we we had a guy come to help us with the fencing and he said you know forget about the fencing of the pastures the first thing you need to do is secure them for the winter and he set up an area where the sheep would not would which is predator-free so the sheep don't have to worry about predators getting in in the winter um and then we we tried various ways to do the fencing for the pastures and finally um did some high tinsel uh fencing to with a five strand um which my we my husband pete and actually did with jared um to to secure the animal so now we have three pastures three good sized pastures where we can rotate the sheep and so that not only keeps the pastures down and keeps it free of invasives but it but it also um keeps the sheep really healthy because they're not on those same pastures uh we have cleared the original blueberry field and also the back blueberry field which actually had pine trees and birch trees growing out of it so we've we've cleared that we've um we've the back pasture which we pasture other people's animals on in the spring summer and fall um we've gotten rid of all the invasives on that um and as i said we have started to plant raspberries and we're going to plant uh blackberries this spring yeah so yeah so your just a quick question before we take a quick break and we'll come back to this topic there's just not enough time um okay so you you know that the property has wild blueberries you invest the time to manicure the land and salvage the berries and then you decide to get into the sheep to manicure the berries and the land that you guys have just cleared but the sheep didn't work out and now you become sheep farmers um so what's what's it sounds like the sheep do have an important role right they're doing all of they're keeping that invasive weed species down and all the other stuff what else what else are you doing or you're planting with the sheep well so i um originally i was going to sell the baby dolls as pets and that that worked sort of um but it was it was hard because they needed to be registered and then in order to be registered it was it was just it was more complicated than what i wanted to deal with so we sold them as pets but not as registered and then i tried to sell them as meat but i really had a hard time with it i i just um i mean i'm not a vegetarian so i understand eating meat but it was just maybe it's because they were they baby dolls are really cute um and so now what i'm doing is i'm transitioning into fiber and i'm working to get a more fiber friendly flock the baby dolls aren't known for their fiber but i i've been able to use the wool for things like dryer balls and felted soap so they they can pay for their food that way [Laughter] but i am kind of phasing them out as i find homes for them um i'm i'm phasing them out and bringing in more sheep with better fiber so that i can either sell it for wool um yarn anything just raw a lot of people just want raw fleece yeah so yeah all right we're gonna break for a quick uh a quick moment and then we'll be right back okay okay all right thanks all right sure all right thank you guys for coming back to the fridays from the farm our march podcast series women in farming today we're actually meeting with nancy mings out of wild berry farm in samberton new hampshire we're we were just talking before we took a break about the baby doll sheep and and the use of the fibers and and now the fact that you guys are expanding into um the fiber business and i love i love this dialogue because it really does show every farmer has evolved or changed or you're just open and receptive to what the community's needs are and meeting those and so this fiber thing i'm just going to click on the shop now and guys uh links to their social media and their website will be available um online through the podcast or youtube um but the website now you were a former website designer so and you're still doing web design right yes i am yes i do that as as part of my income yes yeah so we have this amazing showcase of not only what you're doing in retirement in quotations if you guys see the quote retirement right but the products here talking about the the fiber products um i think a lot of people let's speak to some of the sheep people out there because there are quite a few this is a very popular trend um raising sheep caring for the sheep and doing the animal husbandry right now it's lambing season for you um so speak to speak to that sheep interest and tell us about sheep what do we need to know well wow you know i i'm in no way don't feel like i'm an expert but um [Music] compared to horses they're actually pretty easy to keep um they don't bump into things or if they do they don't hurt themselves quite as easily as horses do um uh we we we gravitated towards sheep as opposed to cattle or um cattle specifically because of their size they're relatively small we do have um small sheep um and they're pretty docile so you know we thought about goats but all pete had to do is hear that they might jump on his truck and that was the end of the goat possibility um plus i understand they're escape artists um she don't really want to escape they don't want to be alone so they're pretty docile they're very sweet um they love me i know when anyone who's a mom who listens to this will appreciate this when we moved up here and got the sheep i had teenagers um and teenagers at that at that point um they they liked me enough but i wasn't the one that they necessarily wanted to hang out with so when i would when i would go out in the field and the sheep would come running towards me like they loved me you know you have 12 or 18 sheep coming at me it was just the best feeling yeah so um but it did take a while to get used to uh care and feeding i didn't really know what to do i you know i've read books i talked to people one of the most important things i think that i found is networking and finding people and i have i'm someone that that's been helping me a lot lately to refine my um my my shepherding skills um in taking care of them because because you know i would walk into the barn with a bale of hay and although sheep would come right at me and basically i would just drop it on the ground and leave they'd have hay all over them there would be hay in their fleece it was just a mess and so um so i i kind of had to learn how to make it work we had um someone come and cut holes in the wall so i could feed the hay in without having to walk in um it was a carpet it was jared it was carpenter so it was all done very very well to the barn you know to the structure of the barn um and we set up hay feeders but but it was a little bit it was almost like one thing each year every year i would learn a little bit more about how to take care of them the first time we land i had no idea i was stupid enough i will use that word lightly but i it's probably true that i had two rams and i really thought that's kind of embarrassing i really thought that the big lamb would gravitate towards the big sheep and the little ram would gravitate towards the little sheep yeah i know it's really funny isn't it and so on [Laughter] well it's because you had some sort of expectation so naturally we already know that's not going to work out these are animals by by all means right right exactly and and then and then every sheep every you was pregnant you know i remember saying to the vet he said how many did you breed and i said what do you mean and he's like you didn't separate him and i just looked at him like you're supposed to separate them so anyway needless to say we had i think 10 babies that year it was fine um and and each like i said each year i learn a little bit more um we are very lucky that we have never had any problems lambing that i go out in the morning and there's baby lambs there and they're all fine so yeah that's good yeah so and then we're we've got this other end of the business which is the blueberries where's the how do you find the balance between the two i mean you're spending an awful lot of time with the sheep and the feeding and water and all that stuff but then the minute the snow thaws i mean doesn't this require a ton of your time how do you find the balance um well so it does require a lot of time but it the balance is that by the time it's like i'm just getting ready to go out and prune um the blueberries and lambing will be done by that time so all i really have to do is give the sheep hay until the fields are ready and make sure they have water and they're pretty self-sufficient the the lambs are growing they're running around and they're playing and i can be out with the blueberries uh pruning them we're also at a point now where it's maintenance although i am expanding our neighbors have um kind of the same situation that we had and they've offered me i'm clearing out theirs and cleaning up and freeing the blueberries um and um so i'm going over there and doing that but but i've got plenty plenty of time you know to do that um because we're we're kind of on a schedule now where the sheep are done and now we're into blueberries um where it gets a little bit crazy is when it's blueberry picking time that because because there's farmers markets there's uh you pick there's me out there picking um and uh but that only lasts about three or four weeks so somehow everything okay just chaos for three weeks and then yeah yeah of course now we have raspberries so you just extended your season right so right between between the heat because it does in fact get quite hot up here in new hampshire and the bugs because bug season is going to be right around the corner right the chores the weeds the picking the farmer's markets which i'm the biggest person to say farmer's markets are not for the faint of heart that is hard work yes people at farmers markets guys they deserve every penny that they earn at those markets because they are working very hard to be there and the fact that you're you're older and you're retired i mean how are you keeping all this together i mean have you ever just wanted to just say i quit i just i just want to literally retire well i have said that i wanted to quit i don't know that i have said that i want to retire because i always come back to well what would i do and i don't clearly don't sit around and do nothing easily um so but i will tell you around this time every year right before lambing i'm ready to send all the sheep to the butcher right winter is very long winter is long it's hard dragging that hay out um it gets icy uh i worry about them even though they've got those nice woolly coats when it's you know when it's below zero i worry about them um so i do get to that point but then you know on a day like today where it's just starting to get warmer and spring is in the air and then i start thinking i can't wait to get out and prune i just i really love the work and i i think the diversity of the farm really helps because it's not like it's just sheep all year long it's not like it's just blueberries i have just enough time with one particular product um to not get bored and to keep me and and to keep keep things interesting yeah yeah um something that i do want to spend way more time and and i promise my viewers that we'll we'll probably end up doing a separate um sec segment with you nancy is also behind the scenes you know you you're doing the farming aspect but you brought up an important point before we went live there's also the the building the commerce right so so you you're you're busy doing the chores you're busy doing the pick your own you're busy doing the farmers markets and that's all well and good but you also have this creative website in this creative engineering going on behind the scenes because you want this to be a profitable business so you know kind of share share some quick insight with people we only have a few more minutes left but just quickly share some insight on that with people well you know i realized early on no one was running to our our farm to pick blueberries first of all there's four other blueberry farms just in san bernardino um and so i realized that i had to do something to make if i was going to make money and i wanted to make money i mean i i didn't want to make a ton but i wanted to at least pay for the the work that we were doing um and so that one of the first years we had 300 pounds of blueberries that i picked and i couldn't sell because i wasn't connected with the farmers markets and that's when um i got in touch with this company called genuine local who will actually package small batches for farmers and we came up with this first product which is the uh wild blueberry maple topping i also because my uncle and my cousin still make maple syrup and they had an abundance of maple syrup we combined the two ingredients um and made it's not a jam it's not a jelly um it's just a topping that can be used on ice cream and yogurt and it's just maple syrup and blueberries those are the only two ingredients and i that was the first product we did and it was a big hit it was a big hit now it was hard because i had to get out there and sell and i hate to sell it's just my least favorite thing to do but in a way it kind of sold itself and so once i kind of got the feel for how that was working um we started doing more and uh this christmas we did gift boxes which erin is showing now with syrup we've incorporated some teas from another local farmer and and other maple products and we we did really really well pancake mixes and crepe mixes and fruit crumble all kinds of things that um that we've added to our store um to to kind of and and our slogan is get a little farm in your life um and it's it's a way to kind of help bring people to the farm one of the things that i knew about living in an urban environment compared to where we are now is that people really long to be outside and in this lifestyle that we're living and so my goal with these products was to bring that to people um and yeah and so and so that that's what we did yeah it looks great i know um the new hampshire farm to door website has been selling the product too and it's it's done very well and i i love it i i make mixed drinks out of it and you know if you need any drink recipes to add to your out to your website you let me know um so i do want to end end the the session with you where do you think the future of your business is going to go do you have some secret itinerary or plans what do you see well i you know i'd like to continue to um expand on our berries you know as far as the the physical products that we offer but to also expand on our online presence and incorporate i think what we found is that the gift boxes and baskets are are kind of our little niche and then and then i can combine our products with other people's products and so to bring more people in that have that same uh flavor that same kind of uh product uh product that they carry yeah and um just just see where it goes um to continue to grow yeah and do more farmers markets i farmers markets like you said are hard but i do love them because i love connecting with people yeah yeah yeah we i i mean last year was the first year i've done one and it was just one farmer's market and now i'm doing three and tons of these little pop-up things i mean tis the season for the farmer would you agree right i yes yes i think it was a it was a really good year and it was actually a good year for you pick last year too because people wanted to get out of the cities and just be outside and we did it by appointment so we only had one family at a time so people basically had the farm all to themselves and they loved it yeah that's amazing yeah well you know to to the viewers that are listening or watching through our youtube channel you know talk about bringing a whole new culture and experience into this farming and agricultural setting it's not always about feeding and mucking it really is about community it's about networking it's about building a culture and nancy i think you've done a fantastic job with this and the the wealth of knowledge and experience that you have on the commerce end again i promise my viewers that we will touch on this topic more because it is and it's so essential today more than it has ever been before with social media and um online networking so um we hope that uh nancy you'll you'll find some time to sit down with us and answer some questions about that and have some great dialogue in that sure that would be great i would love that so any um any last minute things that you want to share with our viewers um no you know i farming really is hard work but it's it's it's great it's so rewarding on more and more than just the financial just to be outside to be with nature for me um you know is is just a real it's a real gift and to be able to uh to to live this lifestyle you know um and i'm grateful to be able to share it with everyone you know who comes to pick or buys our product or just gets a little

as you can see they they like it a lot most of the marijuana plants psychoactive ingredient THC has been removed staff from the dispensary claim the pigs don't get high but rather more relaxed by eating the cannabis the cannabinoids and cannabinoids bond to the pig in different ways to where the stress hormone that all animals release when they get stressed gets blocked and thereby makes it a more succulent tender meat the big farmers here say this enterprise has produced all the jokes that pot-bellied pigs are living high on the hog and becoming baked bacon but no matter what the jokes this is good business butcher William bunch Dino has experimented with feeding pigs everything from beauty bodka and now this part I know calls them his pot pigs marijuana became legal in Washington so sometime I met the growers I don't know how that happened but I met the growers you're actually witnessing history right near here hot pig pork shoulder chops and sausages has a little bit savory

the CEOs on there and the price list okay guys so we're gonna start we got sour tea and it's the first new one I gotta slowly does so with the sour tea it has 14 point one to six percent CBD it has a moisture level of twenty nine point six percent and shout-out to miss Linda to always hit me up with all the good info I liked her a lot all right it's under the zero point three percent THC threshold that makes it legal okay then over here we got the t1 guys all right so this t1 is packed in fifteen point five to six percent CBD and it has eleven point four percent moisture level and again under the zero point three percent THC threshold that makes it legal then we got their stormy Daniels and that's packing 18 for eighteen point four six four percent CBP 10.8% moistured and again it's under the zero point three percent THC threshold it's legal guys so these are the analysis for those three flowers now I can't really give you guys the full prices on YouTube they are a mile behind they told me that that you're selling products and what I'm not doing is selling products I'm simply reviewing these flowers for you guys so you can see the quality of the flower well you but it's up to you okay guys YouTube why don't mess with me man anyway now let's get a look at these box okay so we got the sound with tea let's open that up call these black labels but this far over here guys this is what you're gonna get when you buy in bulk whatever you want you don't have to be big bowl not same pounds but let me tell you them cheaper to buy a bunch pounds so we're gonna take a couple of these out so I could give you our guys and look at it I have to save some room cuz I got my little tray out today guys a little [ __ ] I don't know why so that's a good enough time you gotta see this is the sour teeth removal nothing sour tea guys sour tea okay and ya already know y'all about to get the close-ups is the t1 we're gonna mix those up so we've got the t1 here okay so I have to tell you guys these these prices all right these prices are definitely right okay let me show you this knob this is the t1 okay that's the t1 now let's take a good look at this storm again now I'm a stormy damn uses look at one look at this so stormy Daniels thanks big Oh nuts all right so that's the biggest of them all so right now what do time guys some close-ups oh yeah I know exactly would it look like would you be receiving when you go check them out I'm gonna put the information on the bottom of the video so yeah guys take these out okay you two so Natalie back we got a look at the three flowers the sound with t2 t1 the stormy Daniels so I gotta let you guys know the smell these these guys have a earthy smell to them they have all earthy smelling flowers so the only difference I'm gonna be able to tell is in the smoke itself now the flowers they all three have different looks but they all smell earthy so we're gonna whip out the grinder now I'm gonna grind up sour tea has some nice red hairs on this our T by the way guys so some of the flowers like the sour tea is it's lighter than the tea one has the same amount of darkness as the starving Daniels and what the tea one seems to be more dense it's more tighter and store McDaniel's like leafy guys it's leave me that's what I see okay why look at that crushes up nice and fluffy that's the sour tea now we're gonna crush up the t1 because I want to get it all crushed up that way I can sample them all at one time all right how's the t1 now we're going to take a piece of this stormy Daniels we're gonna crush that up to like I said again guys all three DS have an earthy smell okay flowers kind of nice things on my brain okay I mean they all brined it up pretty nice too so now it's time to get some in the love and see what this be like remember guys this is what you get when you order your product and I know the last time I was telling you guys I think it was like 150 to 200 pounds so I can't give you the exact on these pants but I'm telling us around that so this one right here soured tea first guys let's try the sour tea is this our team of them try first choose it's time to be completely honest the flower tastes a lot better than it smells because to me I like the smells earthy earthy earthy earthy but it actually has a fresh taste [Music] a light smooth smoke [Music] and for the price I gotta say is pretty decent it's pretty decent for the price okay now this is where you're gonna get some weight on the budget and thin farms so it like I said tell you for the price this is good I'm always trying to help my fellow people out here you know what I mean we gotta stick together in this community [Music] so that was the sour tea we're gonna move on let me get this out of the pipe here next one we got is the t1 so we're gonna get the t1 in here and guys I gotta say had no seeds whatsoever unless you're collecting it's a plus if you're trying to use them and grow a little something in the closet or something so here's the t1 Cheers okay so that t1 is definitely different than the sour team now the t1 is a little stronger and it packs a little punch so you have a heavier smoke but it's not bad or anything is just a heavier smoke have an earthy and floral flavor with it but with me I like the sour team right to silent T so far I'm going to sour t2 t1 not bad but I like to sour tea so far let's see if that stormy Daniels take me by Starr all right so two strands in I'm filling this our teeth t1 is alright to meet you but I'm choosing I want to pick the sour tea I like that sour team as the stormy Daniels we're loading up and you see that sticky it sticks to my finger while I'm trying to match it inside of the UH pipe here guys cheers let me let you guys know was this bow [Music] okay that's different that's different [Music] different you see sitting here it's different it's like a floral fragrance [Music] sweet [Music] [Music] the smoke is a tad bit harsh dysentery so it's sweet floral smoke is tad harsh II may be to some people as you can see it doesn't have me coughing that much so you know it's not that bad but I'm giving you guys a description of the smoke the flavor and as far as the way I feel after the sour tea I was already feeling the effects they all three have a decent amount of CBD and so armed they are doing the job guys so the effects are all there all right right now I got this um I got this nice calming and it's mostly in the head so you will get effect from this and this is the nice moon once stormy Daniels this also smooth so I have to go one two three shower teeth with one stormy for 2 and T 1 for 3 alright so smoke doctor signing out I'll be back with another review soon guys alright these thanks for watching", "PEZ_YvPwncw": "this farm-to-fork segment is sponsored by net effect well today I wanted to talk walnuts and there's no better person better friend or better farmer than Jerome warmer damn Jerome how you doing thank you rich hey it's good to see coming into your fields are always beautiful but there's so much going on than just growing a tree how many different varieties are out there even the people are planting today compared to what they did years ago oh there's a lot of different varieties the most common varieties in this area are the sir - Larry's Chandler the newest variety to hit this area would be the Ivanhoe you've got some fields that you planted in what 1960 and 1962 there's some some old dusty Moriah tea some Hartley's and some of the older varieties that you don't hardly see you around here anymore what's changing in the science of this is not just planting a tree for color for size for weight but kind of all of those it depends on what people think the markets gonna gonna bear yeah the markets kind of shifted for they like to have the light colored meat and the newer varieties tend to produce the the light colored meats that they're looking for one beautiful thing about walnuts new studies have come out people are shifting from grains more into nuts and walnuts are kind of leading that charge because they're so nutritious I think you as a farmer are probably pretty excited that that nutrition numbers come out now and people realize how good walnuts are for you yes definitely when it came out that the wallets were rich in omega-3 we noticed a upward trend of sales and in walnuts you mentioned two color differences so a lot of people like that blonde nut but some of the varieties with darker skins actually around the nut may have higher oil content yes they do the older varieties did tend to turn colors sooner but it was only because of the oil content that was in the meats that also has maybe more though omega-3 oils in it this is just the beginning of the process after this you got to get it dehydrated in process there's so much more to get it on the plate yes for sure and we're gonna bring more of that to you next week for farm to fork I'm rich Scripps", "RimqOiFs2K4": "so world Callaham farmers out here at amigo cent farm they've grown two acres of a VW one form a VW developments I think it's indica dominant yeah these only went in the ground not too long ago so they're just getting started won't talk to you about hemp farming on a small scale two to ten acres this right here is two acres we're only planted one acre right now second acre will be in rotation but we're in California so we got quite a growing season got great genetics and pretty substantial yields from small farms you know we talk about a farm like this let's just talk about one acre so an example like this we put between 1,500 and 2,000 plants per acre and if you averaged about a pound per plant then you're talking about 1,500 to 2,000 pounds per acre which is pretty pretty substantial for return on investment on a one acre little farm little boutique farm so the way that kind of breaks down to is out of two thousand pounds from one acre about 500 pounds will be smokeable flour like the actual flower that you'll be able to sell like this this is a is actual boutique flour so you know all different kinds but these girls are done these are actually just a test those were a test spot we just did a bunch in the middle to make sure that this is gonna work out here at this property and everything obviously did so but two thousand out of two thousand pounds five hundred pounds would be smokeable flour that you can put in a bag in sell at CBD flour the other fifteen hundred pounds would be biomass and biomass is washed into co2 oil or ethanol oil basically hemp oil the stuff see all over the Internet and so you could take a farm like this and produce 1500 pounds and process 1500 pounds in oil and if you were to just sell it as biomass to someone who's going to process it in the oil you're talking about about $30 a pound so 1500 pounds times 30 the smokeable flour is $300 a pound so 500 pounds at 300 bucks and then the other 1,500 pounds at 30 bucks but if you wash it yourself we have a lab we have relationship with hemp honey hole and they only process hemp they only process CBD they don't touch THC products so we can hook you up with them but basically they'll take that 1,500 pounds turn it into oil and give you half and your return will go up about 30% goes up about 50% but you got to give some to the lab so the lab takes their cut and you get about a 30% increase over if you just sold it as biomass so we're looking for some small-scale hemp farming partners Cali hemp farmers we have licensing you can look at the amigos hemp farm licensing to see kind of what that looks like but got to 10 acres and looking to do some hemp farming Callaham farmers can help you out we got good genetics good know-how and good relationships so reach out say hello peace", "3Iv3TxnJV48": "hey guys what up its apex today we're doing another review okay no my friend was just texting me um you know since that one slow where I guess we'll just start on the review of that I'll put the name in the thing but this is on FX Corp or something that FX rx or whatever you want to call that company today I got some of their napalm well while ago I guess continuity doesn't exist here but um got some other napalm tangerine napalm sugar on half G I'm not gonna lie this one was very interesting in the color being really nice and on the smell definitely a nice one it almost reminds me of um sour tangi mixed with something else you know the consistency is mmm not a typical sugar it's not very granulated it's very microscopic granulated so there's a little more give but on definitely like not bad clumping on it or anything definitely easy to work with get this device turned down quick and let that cool off on its own because that was in the heating cycle got my diet dynamap right here on the d-dave mods water pipe adapter for it though that nice little glob right there on oh and if you're wondering who made that tool its use brand I guess they're very popular in the UM circle of user devices and stuff just general all-around I just cleaned this so I'm trying to make sure the outside ain't too sticky and saliva is a good breaker down a THC and all that so it's not like anyone else that's using this crap right that's set in there and this is the CEP j-hook for the diet a neom which we're going to be using and a bed once it cools down just eat this sucker up I'll say this it's very tangerine on the smell if I had to give it on like a sprite chin it tastes almost like this sour tangi on sugar like you know something like around there and it's very clean ah to say the least definitely ani it is an indica so definitely hits like an indica I mean in my testing there's really not much I can say about this like I said I paid 55 you know if you want to consider it 35 I guess because that disc kind of got on whatever item you want to put that on whenever I bought this you know that's really all I can truly say about it honestly it's not bad it's not good either it's clean so if you're looking for like one of those it's almost hits me like a hybrid but more of a sativa leaning and how it goes about hitting my body but anyway enough about this stupid thing locked the clip so that we can use the titanium just sitting right here but on the titanium going get a little more on here and I'm not gonna be lying to you guys and say I always kind of mix my stuff so like this I have like greep what was it like no nice unsaid sherbert uh-uh yeah it was like sour grape X Slimer and then I've been using up that pineapple express Graham I still have I just been mixing them all um honestly the moxie wine is hitting me a lot better which I'm gonna do a review tomorrow you know so anyways guys low

Solomon's lotion the extra strength one yeah that's about all I have to do right now late but I've pretty much given my some ups on those the lotions gonna probably be the last one I do because that stuff lasts a while but anyway guys let's get this dab going been rambling on too much on also I do do to Co vid 19 or whatever I had to make this disclaimer I may or may not be on had the cannabis

I'm good I know you're right in the middle of all this it's super busy but walk me through the process once we've shaken the pistachios out of the tree and they come here what's the process they have to go through to them the finished product so once the growers shake it shake the pistachios off the trees they come in in trucks then they go through our hauler which as you see the machines out here so that pills off the soft hole off the outside of the pistachio then from there it goes through a float sink tank and they're separated between the lighter ones and the heavier ones and then bales all go to different dryers they're dried down to between five and seven percent moisture and then they go to silo and they're stored until we need them in Tulare now what are you looking for when a truck rolls in I mean how do these things get sorted separated and graded so what they're looking for is a stain stain issues insect issues in them so once they're dried down then they go into the QC lab and in the QC lab then they sort them out and they they grade them based on all the different defects which is the different stains the insect and those things as big as this operation is here at Horizon how many growers do you have to deal with in person so we deal with about 50 growers here what kind of volume is that now running through the plant so here at Horizon we can do about sixty million pounds today and we've got an expansion mode in process once they've gone through this plant now and then they go to the other operation can you take stuff not only from here but other aspects of the industry then and kind of getting cahoots with other people to handle the processing center so we take our product from here and we go to Tulare with it and then that's where we do the hand sorting roasting salting and packaging depending on growers you get to see everything are there growers that really make that big of a difference center in the industry as to what the quality looks like absolutely how do you know then as far as which grow or what field that kind of so every load is identified with an identity number and at that point then we can track every pound from every field all the way through to the end user all the part of the quality control to make sure you know that every pound that came through how good that quality is for the end user like yes absolutely we're gonna bring you some more from Horizon that that actually once it goes from this raw side and goes into the processing side you can see what it takes to get to the plate for farm-to-fork I'm

not the the the biggest market in the world so we don't grow anything that we know we can't sell to so as soon as we we planned we get that acre we get that seed we know who it's going to gets harvested it comes into the cooler within days we get an order for it and we're packing on the packing line and it's literally takes just 30 minutes to cool and then we load it that day or that the next day and goes out to whether it's a distributor to go to retailers or if it goes to the processing plants everyone runs on a first you know first in first out just-in-time system that's how produce is a you know ship we don't set up by the product flat that long so so yeah we shipped to Japan by air Korea by air goes on the airplanes trucks you know takes three to four days to get to New York or it only takes an overnight to get into the San Francisco Bay Area or llla area I think it's distributed from there so as big as this production is and looking at everything that's going on here I don't think people realize that you're not running all the time because it also depends on how these orders are being filled because it goes up so quickly so as that ramps up it's coming

download and over 400 hours of interviews and music of all the founders in the marijuana movement so that's time number four hemp com please tell your friends to check it out and with that said I want to make a wonderful presentation of the interview i did with Willie Nelson back and i think it was may of nineteen ninety one so pack a bowl and enjoy today we are very honored to have a special guest on our program this gentleman has changed country music forever with his voice with the style with his singing he's also helped an awful lot of farmers across America with their plights and their heart aches and he's also brought to the public and message of hemp really realization that is backing people in Kentucky such as Gatewood Galbraith and their campaigns to just conversations on a daily basis and how we should save our planet our special guest today is Willie Nelson really thank you very much for being a guest on our show glad to be here well if you've had a chance to see firsthand the heartaches and the plights that our farmers are going through and a lot of people in their offices and driving to and from their jobs in LA in New York in Chicago don't see that the heartache that you've had a chance to witness could you could you share some of that well whenever I first started hearing about the farmers problems so i was born in a farm community in farm town a lot of my friends or farmers and so I started checking it out I heard these horror stories about farmers getting foreclosed dollar and losing their farms and bankers who were once friendly now unfriendly I heard all these things and I said well something's going on that not aware of so I started checking it out millions of farmers all over the world this country had been losing their farms at the rate of a million a year occasion phone informer's you know at one time there was eight million working farmers in this country American family farmers down now we're down to probably less than 2 million the big corporations it's the old story of the big ones eating the little ones and they're running the small farmer off the land and when that happens the farm town closes down the first thing the hospitals and the schools go and then what happens is all these people are now unemployed they move on to the next big city which causes the same kind of problems in that city I think that all the homelessness alcoholism insanity all these things that we experience unemployment in our country can be traced back to the first time the first American farmer was forced off his land when he was unable to make a living off of a hundred or to a hundred acres of land and the reason for it is because they have asked him demanded or made it necessary that he raise a crop below what he costs him to raise it he loses money on for instance if he just example figures for instance if he word it it costs him two dollars two or three dollars to plant and raise and harvest a GABA she love corn and if he only gets two dollars and fifty cents for that at the market then he's losing and this is an accepted practice in American agriculture today for the farmer to get less than what it costs him to grow and they keep trying to justify it with subsidies and whatever but the American farmer would rather go out here and work hard and make his money the hard way the way he knows how to do it give him an acre let him do what that a juror can do let him do it without all the pesticides without only chemicals don't don't put his yield so low his money so low that he has to use every piece or every gallon of pesticide that he can find to port on that acre of land in order to get enough money out to almost break even they have forced him into this position there are even banks who will not loan you any money at all unless you agree to use X amount of pesticides and chemicals on your lingo really absolutely because they know that their only way you can make your payment is if you get so much off of that acre and the only way you can get that much off of that acre is to keep pouring the chemicals to that one acre what now when did you first become aware of hemp as a cash crop a couple years ago I read a book I think that a lot of us have read by a nationally the Emperor wears no clothes and it was in that book there was a reprint of an article the the one thing in in that book that I saw that could not be argued with was an article it came out in 1938 edition of Popular Mechanics magazine februari addition if anybody wants to go check it out that said a billion a new billion-dollar crop for the farmers do you think that farmers today would be receptive to growing hemp as a cash car because of all the propaganda we've heard over the years there are so many people now who believe that it's that it's the evil weed but we we kind of figured because of all the products that it can create that it could be a solution well definitely I think most most people that I talked to had no idea just like me that hemp and marijuana was the same thing we were ignorant of that fact also we were ignorant of the fact that hemp could be used as food it can be used as clothing

things about farming is that it's usually multi-generational today I'm out here with Mason McKinney Mason how are you I'm doing pretty good how are you I'm great so fourth-generation farmer you've been working with dad now who took it from two generations above him I have been currently a student Arizona State University I'm studying global agribusiness and some I planned some days to come home and hopefully take over the business so as good as a farmer as your father has been your job now is to take some of that new technology bringing in to make the operation more efficient definitely I'm learning as much as I can in college to come back and hopefully apply it to our farms anything that can be more efficient for water usage and that kind of stuff now you talked about water uses it's not just how much water you're getting in the ground you're actually using that now to apply nutrition yeah we can directly put fertilizer into the sprinkler systems that way we're not wasting time on tractors we can just put it right into the sprinkler system and it'll spray right onto the trees now you mentioned tractors it's not just coming out you get on a track and you drive you've also been doing a lot of work on equipment this summer yeah I spent most of my summer in the shop working on sweepers pickup machines all that kind of equipment just making sure everything's ready to go during harvest season and it's not just you and Dad there's a whole operation of course definitely a team effort it requires a lot of people during the harvest season we can have twenty or thirty people out here so it's definitely a huge industry requires a lot of people make things happen so when you give an dad the boot and take it over we'll talk about that someday the next time you're enjoying a

tell me a little bit about what has been created here I know you have a ton of information on it but a unmanned spray ring yeah so Gus stands for Global unmanned spray system basically it's a completely robotic autonomous orchard sprayer no driver on the machine whatsoever just goes up and down the roads using GPS lasers some software to help guide it safely and accurately through the field so we've had some some challenges and egg lately with not having enough labor this is a great solution yes innovation is born out of necessity and we've had a farm service business here in California for about 35 years and it's just been very challenging to get people to our door to want to do this kind of work so we decided to do something about it and we we needed a solution so we created this machine we can run up to ten of these with one guy monitoring it from the safety of a pickup or a control van the great thing about this is there's no issues than with someone being sick getting tired taking breaks this thing can be running all day all night if need be exactly yes it's much more efficient than the traditional method with tractor pulled and you know driver to equipment and we just have a lot less downtime with this thing it just keeps going very accurate safe just keeps going and you mentioned safety that's an important part for you you've built a lot of mechanisms into this to make sure there are no issues in the field that's correct it has obstacle avoidance if it sees a person or a tree or something it'll stop we set up a virtual perimeter around the field so if anything bad were to happen and once it hits that virtual perimeter it would just shut the whole machine off we've got a whole lot more to bring you on the Gus and we're gonna cover that in another

through the plant and get processed and sorted so when they come into this dehydrator give me kind of the process of the rundown of what a nut goes through before it actually gets dried and taken off yeah it goes through and gets the trash is separated from the material that comes in from the field it's sorted where the green and black are separated the green gets ran through again because it still has the halt the black is naturally the bad walnuts and then after that they go to the banns and they're dried for anywhere from anywhere from 16 to 24 hours these things are done at 8 percent and there's all kinds of safety you know features in place to make sure they come out perfect yeah everything's automated here we have moisture plates that are in the bands that read that moisture and try to produce as close as we can to that 8% mark are all dehydrators the same because I happen to have the inside information I've seen you out here multiple times welding on this you built this yourself does the operator have his only way now the majority of this plant we've built ourselves to myspace was limited so we had to justify the amount of tons that we were trying to run through per hour so we designed and built our own equipment over the years you've gone from what five tons to 34 tons an hour you're running through this thing yeah come Chandler season we're upwards in a 34 ton range part of its the automation - for efficiency for your growers so everything you do here is not just to make your life easier but all this technology you're putting in place just makes a better product for the public yeah we do all these updates and and streamline this to accommodate the faster harvesting equipment that's in the fields now and to turn out a better product for our growers but

hauler sheller of their choosing we're fortunate enough that 60% of our growers utilize a co-op right next door they do the majority actually of all our pounds will come from next door so our products coming in from there and from there we're gonna put it on the scale we're actually going to USDA sampling at that point so we pay our grower based on edible meat weight of what they deliver to us so that's that's going to be sorted out right here as soon as it comes into the facility so out of those growers it actually represents 92 million pounds currently after this last year and so we're very fortunate here at mentor we're continue to hopefully try to keep growing and doing the best job we can with the 300 plus growers we currently have you talked about 60% well that entails there's 300 plus growers that are all incorrect yes so we have that growers actually from Bakersfield all the way up to Chico and so you're talking about dozens of different haulers shellers so we're receiving from all these places but even with that said I would say a good 70% of our throughput or from growers that are within a 40 mile radius of our facility right here comes out of the coop does it come over on the trucks or now is it in the bins ready for you to take yeah it's gonna come in bins or if it's an inch shell which we actually pack a lot of in shell here and ship it to India and China it's gonna come on a set of doubles if it's going to come as in shell but mostly everything is going to come in these twenty two hundred pound bins now this comes in raw product are they specified then by variety but not size and you're gonna have the variety and this is gonna be a pretty rough but these haulers and shelters are becoming more sophisticated so it's actually a lot cleaner and cleaner product making a little easier on us and then we'll go into taking it all the way to the band then we'll go all the way to the bag and the consumer where you guys get to enjoy it you'll be

there's not that many acres so it's a little bit deceiving though well you do a wonderful job but tell us a little bit about figs there's so many different varieties out there in in the kinds and texture and flavor sure the traditional type is the black mission which everybody is used to seeing you can see that in fresh and dry at the grocery store we also have Callum earners and Sierra's we also have cadeau 'das we have kanay draya's which wind up going into fig newtons and we also have the new fig called a tiger fig which has got a yellow and green stripe on the outside and bright red raspberry flesh it's really cool getting really popular figs are a little different in a crop because they're a lot more intense it's a longer growing season and more importantly a longer pick yeah fresh figs have a first crop which typically happens in June goes for the month of June and then starting about the end of July we have and the main crop which depending on the variety and how it's farmed that that late July harvest can extend all the way till about Thanksgiving time so right now we have lots of folks picking fresh figs and we're also getting geared up for our dried fig harvest also figs they're they're kind of a little hidden very dense nutrient crops so people are starting to learn the value now of eating figs you bet they're very high in calcium fiber and potassium per unit of measure they have more calcium than milk more fiber than a prune more potassium than a banana per unit of measure so they're really really healthy for you so the next time you're thinking

that on the raw side before you can even get it to the finishing side okay so on the raw side of the plant what we do the first thing we do is we run through a scalp or where we're removing foreign material and undersized pistachios and getting it out of the product stream next step from there we're going into our pinners where we're looking at separating closed-shell from naturally treat open pistachios not all tree all not all nuts open on the stache show tree from there we go through electronic color sorting where we're looking at pulling blemishes out that are on the shell dark stain adhering all and other things like that then from there we go to hand sort and that's our last process through on in shell the port goes anywhere else and at that point we're looking for insect damage swarm material and anything that the sorters may have missed now on the quality control side though there are multiple steps it's not just we ran it through the Machine and here's what comes out you've got labs that are testing I mean making sure that we are getting the best quality product we can get yeah every every package every Super sack is it's a 2,000 pound sack that's going as an

two to three minutes and then we stopped the watch move up half of them down the line the other half stay where they're at so they get hooked up with everybody on down the line I think I was probably a year ago I was in a National Public Radio and I heard a very small story about a farm and mean that started doing something called weed dating and there the idea behind it was that and their experience meeting they realized that you really get to know people when you're you know weeding a row together and so they decided to start something that you know was like the concept of speed dating and I thought what a brilliant idea so I have I'm friends with Lori Bevan and Casey O'Leary and they have Earthly Delights farm so I forwarded them the story from NPR and they both embrace the

week see average per cow did not enough to to extract cram all dairies are different but we're averaging about 8 gallons per cow per day and again I've mentioned thousands of cows but every one of

sometimes it's a challenge one two three [Music] [Applause] [Music] we're down here in the hills of pasa Robles down in a very dynamic kind of environment down here where you know that's one of the things we really like doing is through the years this is going back to the guerrilla days of growing and this is growing through the mountain to California I've had the pleasure growing all through the state from south to north and in the process of that been able to kind of learn different environments and climates and how certain strains kind of work in certain spots and we've been really looking forward to getting some really good sativa strains into the market which up in Mendocino and up there in the High Sierras that's not the ideal environment where our gardens are at right now just because it's a little a little too much weather late in the season sort of but down here you're south of a lot of that weather it's a lot drier you get a lot longer season stays kind of warm and sunny all the way up until November and so therefore this is a perfect spot to grow sativas outdoors naturally right in the ground just like we're gonna do here so we're doing a pretty big Fino hunt with those we got some tropical sleigh-ride crossed up with long valley royal cush we've got a couple different candy canes crossed with a Dutch dragon Jack the Ripper P Nia male that's been working really good and then some candy cane crossed with a sour bubble pina male and it's gonna be a lot of flavors we've done some test runs on these strains right now and the flavors that have been coming off and have been absolutely phenomenal it's funny you know when it comes to this vino hunting and doing this stuff and this is where experience really does come in and plays a big part you know I've spent 20 years of my life now like I told you the other day I love rubbing stems ok loving stems for a long time and these were just cannabis stems to clarify that I guess but you know you do that year in and year out and just you get all these flavors and different things in your mind and it's like a computer that goes to work when you're doing their stem rubs and especially late in the season when you have the flowers coming on you know there's a lot of things that you're looking for oh they're not that's one of the interesting things about this you know sativas and their climates that they've grown up living in it's you know a lot of its in jungle conditions so you're in a warm humid environment stuff that's really you know conductive to molds and mildews and stuff so and the process of that looks like sativas generally have a small kind of bud that's more stretched out that can handle that moisture it just lets it right out of the bud it's not thick heavy stuff it's just kind of lighter it's one of the problems with sativas too they can be a little airy sometimes but you know through breeding and stuff you can kind of increase that end up getting some tightness ideally I like small types of team of buds oh it's perfect yeah this is the limestone this is one of the neat things kind of about this spot too you know we got these ridges of limestone that are cutting up through here and limestone is a great you know product it we nice stuff you know calcium magnesium calcium right there you got a you know kind of the way it - it breaks down you kind of see how it's all it almost looks like pearlite just kind of all mixed through our soil it's amazing how fast this whole process now happens with you know we're in the beginning of June June July August it's incredible what happens in the next 90 days yeah the guard on this big really makes you look tiny all the time I know we'll make it look like it is back to the patient's not a lot of stuff going on if you call a gas a sativa there's a lot of gases he was out there but not these kind yeah the other day when we're at the High Times show there is one lady in particular she was a writer and she was just talking about you know writers need to be creative and stuff and sativa helps to inspire creativeness and artists and those types of people she was a writer just really helps her come up with good material and you know think outside the box sometimes so I don't think there's enough sativas these days in the marketplace it seems like the team has really have their place all right we're over here sprinkling just kind of getting a little bit of I think it's vermiculite that holds all the predator bugs and I don't think you're gonna be able to see it on the camera but a minute ago we took zoom maybe once we get over here you see him on there there's a couple of them right up here in the shadow spot they're not moving much but those little red things right there's a couple moving yeah those are predator mites predator mites are being released had been experimenting with this for the last six weeks and they're working absolute wonders for us it's a three blend predators I think there's the California kiss the swear ski thing and for simulus and they're doing amazing like literally the next day you can see the plant opening back up and just coming back to life it's amazing to see how much voracious these Predators really are to resset broad light so we're really happy we found this technique because it's really helping us out we're just kind of putting a little bit right in the crop spot so it can kind of they can kind of get going there's a little bit of a breeze some of them are kind of blowing off but all in all we need is a few predators on each of these at this little staging we're good you can't see any type of visible russet or broad might damage at this moment right now but we do know they're here so this is smart to be vigilant because once you wait to see the damage and everything you're kind of behind the 8-ball on it and you got catching up to do so it's better to stay ahead of it that's for sure back over here GoPro karma Gryphon day 2 [Music]

about you never give up you just plug ahead but sometimes you have to deal with some issues so it's keeping us honest keep it to be truthful I think on the last episode I was super super funny when Mark said uh you know to be real something's going on with these grease monkeys and out to be real there's a couple things going on grease monkeys is the first thing though but before we get to the problem let's look at something nice this is one of the reasons why we grow a lot of different strains and always try different things out is this is a perfect we haven't had any issues with this plant yet it's beautiful strong strong outdoor growing plant there's a few things like show them the purple tan geez right here which started having some russet mite problems that looked like early on we've been put predator mites on them and it's really helped cleaning them up and it's looking like we're gonna be okay with that one the grease monkey plants seems like we've got some kind of a virus inside that plant is what it's seeming like you know maybe this is something we should send to the lab and see if we get any info back on what it is did you guys do that last no but that would be smart see what maybe now it's just theories and ideas but something's happening you know that tissue culture didn't work out of it back into it like they did last year like as they're small they're they're cool but when they get bigger they to turn into [ __ ] some pretty interesting stuff Bindo dope plant right here this is another plant no issues beautiful looking growing plant this is what we like to see we put in generally these are funny you put in big mother plants troll woody and normally they don't do that good you wish you didn't even put them in kind of at this one it's strange because it did have a lot of these problems where leaves were starting to go a little wrong we got some cucumber beetles eat that but also some damage from it looks like rust it might stuff and that the Predators looked like they really did some work on this we're really happy we discovered working with these predator mites right now that was when og Steve also wanted we're gonna enter this in their World Cup and then you also want to see the biggest purple tangi which was our dream - we want it be able to walk by cos when this thing's firing oh my god the smell look there was smell-o-vision hard and fresh purple tangs you have some very unique Terps that is just so pungent it's so noticeable when it's purple changing the winds from this plant coming at you oh it's going to be so cool oh Lord delicious flowers I've ever tasted the top 3 yeah oh gee Steve thank you very much colas all right we're back we like all kinds of plants purple tangi going from clone that's looking real nice we're into the Nellie's Nellie's are looking really nice what's the time period of this thing usually finishing October yeah looks kind of like it wants to go quick it's almost got a slight preflop yeah it's interesting they you could pick it a little early but when you like to go that extra that one last week yeah you're probably picking beginning of October for Kings yeah right now we gave them a nice fertilizer put down one cup of our fertilizer which ended up being what do we got here we got chicken manure we got Peruvian seabird guano pellets we got high nitrogen bat guano that's primarily the mix a little bit about falfa too just to make it look cool then we're about to get some alfalfa seeds to sprout for some tea blend it up to you I'll show you guys that again for those who haven't seen it and then we're also gets a couple bags of all tomorrow we're thinking I did last year the feeding movie simple good they're eerily similar look kind of the plant yeah the greasemonkey look that's the occupiers greasemonkey cross two three paints no this is one of our problem plants right here this funky weird will we got starting on here you seen it last year now we're seeing it again we're gonna have we're gonna rip these ones out because was a failure do anything how strange these keel axes are inside here that are just completely browned it dies in a weird way all yellow and brown super soft leaves even after getting a big watering yesterday yeah some people would look at this and almost think it was over watering but that's certainly not what our problem is very disappointing to see the second year of trying to and she's she's not built for this result so it's really it's just well I don't have to put a couple post up on the Instagram and get to these marriage because something weird about it so I think it's time we're just gonna pluck them you're gonna fill it with something that's gonna grow better this is a super good example while sure at home and wanted to make sure you get some medicine grow multiple strains if you had all this right now we'd be in some big trouble out here luckily we only got three of them yeah we'll be okay yeah and we got three plants that have been dying to get planted so it's not hurting us too bad we got gas [Music] you all right so sometimes when you get these early tops going then they split you know the doubled up this low once these get so big and you're pulling them out they tend to want to split pretty easy so sometimes you can just add a little extra support in the end of a little bit if we are gonna do an extreme mainline technique we would have to do it when it was really young and stay on it on a daily almost on this style because this one got topped young I forget why probably it was because there was a little a that thing happened or some [ __ ] because we had obtained even deeper problems with some of the seed starts this year we had a top a couple of them cuz their top was kind of messed up you know let's insist grew so fast nice just a little something extra because the wind sometimes could knock it all the way apart and and like you said the training it's all about trying to keep these plants as happy as possible we don't want to split especially right there could be a devastating split you can either end up losing half of the plant sometimes you want to do do a nice tie down on this one too so now that we tie that bottom now we can actually pull these a little more than you'd usually be able to because they're holding together so a little green tape on here and just little by little it doesn't have to be a huge huge difference of like pulling it way out to here or something every little bit counts every little bit of light that you help get in there helps all these other branches grow more and just helps you get that perfect nice big Bush it's this amount of pressure being put on the plant who really helps it push against the pressure and pull off of it and it's a big part of what the cages do is applying a lot of pressure pressure they like to be put under pressure far enough to start reaching parts of the cage they're still again to grow out the side I mean you know what we want to do here you can just put a little green tape and help it stay right there like it it's a nice little area that's what's cool about plant training is you can really form the plant to however you want it to be you know a lot of times sometimes I mean plants don't want to get pulled around too much that are really thick have a little bit more spacing to them a little more stretchy you can really change how it's growing and direct it where you want and they always always seem to fill out the middle no matter how far out we go branches find the way to the middle yep some of these smaller branches down here once you start to time and they get light they end up being with the actual top of the plant I'm just doing a little tying around the side of the caves nice and easy don't have to be nothing too fancy it holds widen her up a little bit too there she is a lot more space down now it's not easy doing this style farming it's for sure a lot of hard work leaning in the Sun not having anything air pulling you down but look at the plants look how much happier they learn and when you smoke it you feel the vibe so much this is all hand farmed over here real natural I hope you guys enjoy these flowers when you get to smoke them this year I burn them down to the ashes this is how I do my thing they think they don't yeah they think they don't but we eat the same you think you know yeah you think you don't think you don't you think you think you know yeah you think you don't eat you don't yeah you please I'm burning rounded the ashes this is

"IWk-FOEwSL4": "welcome to Dunedin cannabis club show number 13 we're happy to be here with you again on a erratic basis and we're going to smoke up and chat about some cannabis subjects live for you this evening yeah thanks for joining us for another show Dunedin campus club and we're going to be covering all the news politics in views from the world of cannabis and we've got a special guest Angela here has a very good thanks for joining us so tonight we're going to be talking about a couple of different things we've got some footage from the hemp fields to show you it is hemp farming season and anybody who's interested in this wonderful resource can get their legal license from the government and get those seeds in the ground will be showing a little video of some of the hemp seed planting process a little bit later and we'll talk about the licensing process we're also going to be talking about the recent program looking at synthetics and the issues surrounding animal testing and human testing of synthetic cannabinoids and natural cannabis medical products we're also going to be talking about the shock decision to deny subsidized funding for Sativex all that and more coming up on Bonita in cannabis club but what is the main purpose of why we're here and why we broadcast Julian and one of the viewers going to see us doing in just a minute here well we're here to promote the legalization of cannabis of course it's a policy that's long overdue in this country and 10 all around the world and we're going to engage in some civil disobedience and we're going to consume some cannabis as an act of protest and you can do the same home if you want to join the protest and engage in civil disobedience feel free to smoke up while you're watching this and we're going to have an Ag review where we bring you a review of a different nugget show and this week's no different so we're going to partake in the hood it sounds the most easy approach testing of your dad I think mmm very easy protease yeah in fact it's a it's one of the few protest movements still very active a lot of other protest groups are you stupid or negative this one keeps his mask 82 Garrett well and it's not very well known I'm speaking of cannabis let's partake shall we it's not very well known but a lot of people lament the state of protest movements on university campuses around Anita University of Otago around New Zealand University of Otago in Dunedin is no different and there used to be a heyday you know sort of in every decade protests about a different thing the right of males and females to share a flat together against the actions of the vietnam war against the Springbok tour against introducing fees on university but you know since the 90s there hasn't really been a lot of high-profile protest activity except for one thing there's only been really one big protest of any size on the Otago campus in the 2000s and that was in fact a cannabis protest reacting against the infiltration of undercover police at the behest of the university to try to shut down the 4 20's and of course the 4 20's as a protest movement well not always huge in numbers persistence over a decade 12 years now as certainly yeah an achievement you can always find out more about the whole protest movement down the cannabis museum of ulterior [ __ ] mana and that is at 66 David street in caversham so plenty of information down there if you're in Dunedin she kept the cannabis museum now at the cannabis museum recently we have undertaken some creative funding attempts mostly in the form of a guest room on the popular air B&B platform and I think we can thank you for a lot of success there Angela tell our viewers you know what they can expect him speak well lately Oh was looking at Shea me when I first got here exercise but it looks really great now it's like a home away from home I'd like to say and you've got access to the risk of the building is a kitchen area and lounge obviously and big dreams got a lovely at to wrong man big beard it's got example bit and outside we have a large garden that you can have it wake it as well and what else is this quite a minute isn't really kosher this as a sparkle which can be used yes right home it's very large three gigabit broadband Wi-Fi Wi-Fi throughout the whole house dairies really close you've got the public you've got 15 chefs you've got a lot of great antique shop actually our most recent guess that's meant I haven't been a year yeah well it's new and apparently there's some great deals and caversham you know isn't underappreciated an historic neighborhood and denied a and we have had a lot of feedback from tourists now with the Airbnb with with the museum in the first place we were always New Zealand's only legitimate cannabis-based tourism operation and now we're at New Zealand's only legitimate canada-based accommodation operation and it's very popular and we've had a lot of feedback from not only the guests but the local businesses as well that we're bringing economic activity to de need an end to caversham specifically people have told us that they weren't even planning to come to Dunedin on their itineraries but because they saw the cannabis museum was there they had to make a stop and now that there's the opportunity to stay why not stay a few days and in fact our latest air B&B guests was going from Christchurch to walk the milford track and he wasn't even going to stop and de need anybody thought that the drive to Tiana from Christchurch was too long then he saw the cannabis museum and he stopped for a night but headed to way straight the next day but he had so much fun while he was here that he's decided to come back to Dunedin and change his itinerary book a couple of extra days spend time spend money in the caversham neighborhood and further afield and so on it's really a big addition to the Dunedin tourism portfolio there's not a lot of rainy day activities in donita you know for the adult enthusiasts but even this is a good place to just come and relax and chill out and just maybe take a little bit bright really well I've also haven't described to me by guests as a sanctuary a refuge a home away from home my new batch in Dunedin um it is that is a cozy place there's a crazy fights I like that and here's a good atmosphere chickadee on airbnb com and to search for [ __ ] amana the cannabis museum nice $55 a night which is a great deal you know not only for your own room and all these facilities projector Wi-Fi heaven by itself yes exactly yeah plenty of heat and and you get the place all to yourself and you know uncertain evenings you know you might have people like us knocking around in another room doing a crazy live talk show where we smoke up in protest or vaporized in this case hey you know hey baby with us yes that's right there's plenty of space for everyone but if you do enjoy witnessing those type of antics there's ample opportunity for that as well so let's move on to synthetics you know we hear a lot about them they're back their new they're worse than ever the gangs control them now they're even harder than they were in the past and this is all because well in the first place the government went through this convoluted process of trying to stop you know do anything they could to avoid legalizing cannabis even going so far as to legalizing synthetics you know to prevent having the discussion about legalization of natural cannabis now the idea was they were going to be tested for safety now instead the government just banned them very abruptly before the election and then they decided that they weren't going to allow animal testing now you know a lot of people are against animal testing for reasons of animal welfare but the problem is that the government basically created a catch-22 scenario they said you have to test these products to the level of a pharmaceutical but you can't use animal testing but if you are testing the fire Seussical you must use animal testing so we're in the strange situation now where synthetics cannot be tested on animals but the medical cannabis that they're talking about maybe allowing trials of must be tested on animals so you know if they you know if people patients want access to medical cannabis then they have to have it tested on animals but if you no synthetics manufacturers want to present other low-risk psychoactives they can't test it on animals and over in America medical cannabis products that are intended for animals are being tested on humans how is that happening yeah well it's so the pharmaceutical were raging Peter Dunn wants to follow here in New Zealanders is so strict and of course as part of us pharmaceutical regime they have animal testing and it's going to be interesting to see whether the animal rights groups kick up as much fuss as they did for the synthetics animal testing there could be a whole new round of protest to that save the puppies and you know Peter Diane's trying to kill puppies and TC drugs on puppies well but in this case you know this is something that could benefit them I think the problem people have the synthetics is it was no benefit and it was obviously harming humans with medical cannabis people want to give it to their animals you would like to give it the black community cares my case she's got very bad arthritis well that's right men where they have a much better system in the US where they are giving it to animals now and yeah I've heard a lot of read a lot of articles about people being having preparations to go to the animals I fan is great um she likes getting starring anyway that's a cover-up I she embraces them quite regularly but without having a stripper pharmaceutical regime it's a much better system yeah because humans can access medical cannabis straight away without needing to be tested on animals and animal yeah animals that use cannabis i first tested on humans it's just he's just throwing something else only we know it's safe because studies have been done but because I've been done overseas he's saying that they're not it's not enough information whereas other pharmaceuticals coming to the country and it's enough that without been tested overseas and he's just sitting up this ridiculous double standard there it's why should you animus be forced to enter the pharmaceutical so yeah brought out a circle system is a whole another system panetta medicines and cannabis could be treated as a natural medicine I think that's the interesting because it is recreational and pharmaceutical so some pharmaceutical preparations will be needed for people who don't want to just smoke or vapor or something well maybe they can make it more specialized with different thanks for the trouble is that the pharmaceutical companies have a vested interest in keeping cannabis illegal because it can help treat a lot of diseases that the other drugs are currently being used for so once they and I think that's still going to look at things and develop things not me so you can patient it you know but um I think I have a problem with that if they're going to put the hard weekend like there's some stuff we can't just boil up well I think the the interesting thing about the you know the debate that you're having gonna meet bars if you're left a guard plants and you think yeah and Keith exactly joint is not gonna be good enough fine but a few hey you don't want to go plants in your background you can and you need maybe need something a bit more specialized but they're not mutually exclusive and that's the important thing the debate we're having here in New Zealand is pharmaceuticals only yeah the expensive home growing and natural for those who have benefit more there's no problem with it and that way some people make money and some people don't have just been many before yeah I think you can have both what Peter Dunne's doing with the pharmaceutical regime is another form of prohibition he's using it to prevent anything get approved you know like he doesn't want people to use home growing up or try now over when the state's is a whole new industry of scientists developing each strength and cannabinoid preparations and there's a whole lot of scientific testing well I must not forget that most of the greatest scientific discoveries here in New Zealand have been in someone's backyard in their back shed including jet packs so you know let's not underestimate the key I why D the Kiwi DIY ethic number 8 wire especially when it comes to cannabis we know they've done well overseas in the Dutch seed banks and speaking of seeds hemp farming season is upon us and a hemp license is something that anyone can do you the viewer can do and tell us about the hemp licensing process how do people get ahem places and you know what are the basics and they can get in touch with us at the Museum if they're interested so you can apply for a license through the Ministry of Health and it takes about two months to get the license so you want to apply well before the planting season so hemp is generally planted and around the october november time so you want to be getting your license and around well before August or so and if you've got a good bit of farmland that you want to be grown in on then you simply fill out the form we want to grow it and ideally you want it to be hidden from public view in some sort of rural area and then it's about five hundred dollars to get the license and as I said it took about two months and the case of the one we're going to be watching a video of they recently got the license in the implant of the seeds straight away which were purchased locally so it's definitely quite possible when more and more people are taking up the opportunity of him because of its economic potential and we were lucky enough to get a glimpse of some seed planting and get to ride along if you will with a license holder and this local farmer and it was a really great experience it's a great craft just the the look in the field and the act of farming is very transformative and liberating but the crop itself has so many uses doesn't it oh absolutely yeah I mean the food the seeds are used as a food source it's very high in protein and meeting at my house shop and that I cancel so anymore that's right there's any one bag keep the seed or protein a departing the protein powder yeah yeah shops I think that's been selling that just don't like cancel so anymore and it's quite papacito yeah well the seed of course is legal for consumption of animals yeah but not for humans only in Australia and New Zealand blood it's illegal to grow hemp in America yeah in most states but it's legal to eat the seed for food and it's legal to grow hemp in New Zealand but it's illegal to eat the seed for food you know if if you press the seed into oil that's legal for human can sumption in New Zealand but not Australia but all of its legal for animals and these farmers that we're going to see they're actually growing the seed for pressing into oil and they're going to feed some of the seed to animals and some of the by-product to animals and of course you can also get the fiber from the stock as well as the herd material which is good for building products I liheap great and it's also useful for the likes of biofuel and even bio plastics and things like that so many advanced products can be developed from from the natural hemp plant so now we're going to take a look at a short clip of some hemp farming in action sowing the seed and hopefully we'll be able to provide you hereunder needing cannabis club in future episodes with some footage as the crop is growing and maturing and you'll get to see for yourself but it all starts out with planting the seed yeah great yeah yeah yeah then you got me show you the seat and we can ever about what we're going to be sewing rates when they will set stuff up girl every choice um I mean he's got the stuff you never write let's David yeah yeah yeah okay yes let's trip d t dress what do you mean well what's been done the to be run through a plot and all the rubbish is at all chaff at all the seed boys yep are you getting a knot on to exit well this is gone sorts of stay exactly where yeah so so small seeds we've all those little yeah it's got large sea and it's got other it's in between butters easy he really hasn't been dressed okay dresses nice Tony speaks that's fine suppose what you guys keep out help achieve ever it's basically the point but it's all I want Ron yeah mr. Grover commit yeah so and some through the stroke yeah yeah what on things like yeah calibration baby another good Thomas sorry give would be yeah maybe like it's not a notice oh we just do one rock yeah and then I don't think well we apologize for the audio problems that we had in the video but the audio wasn't the main part of it anyway you got to see the pictures of the heap being so in the air and you know it was really good experience being up there on the farm and just seeing the seeds go in the ground it's very very productive you know and hopefully there's going to be some good economic development coming from there yeah and um as you say you know it was just it was just a really fun experience like getting on the farm having stuff before not really i mean i've been on farms like as a kid but actually i'm operating the machinery and like doing it all from start to finish pretty fun yeah I'm have you been on you from love it I swing down a trap right I've seen a large one in march away Carrie and I've seen a large one and the Waikato region and I've been involved with growing hit myself as well and the small scale and to it this is the second time I've been directly involved you know I mean not yeah not as the licence holder but someone who's given advice and so on oh cool and just like tell us about your farming background angel oh my family background uh my parents had deer found at one stage that was pretty cool what's it to you nice watch this is not that was a lot did you do any like cropping though like no I'm sewing there's really running your hands through the seed yeah miss Adams I'm feeling yeah scatting really that piece you getting such as well but now I am pig cropping well that brings us to a favorite part of the show the Naga reviews and it's a bit difficult to do consistent nug reviews in Dunedin and we're going through a bit of a dry patch at the moment but um we did manage to sort of squirrel away some tiny tiny morsels at McKinnon Jay where were you and this comes from the central north island region yes really and hey let's just give it a go hmm we would you say fancy if you like fancy areas well it's all about who you know you know every every region has not like someone was fancy marijuana yeah and if you can meet them or a very lucky person oh yeah it shouldn't have to be that luck question it really you should just be able to go look but I must say to all of those you know all of the viewers out there who may be that that person in their region who has the good stuff um as New Zealand's only cannabis museum at sort of our responsibility to sample and get along all these different varieties so we can only encourage you to you know submit your samples we excited well academically preserve them in the historical place they deserve taipei maybe the beasts paper toy review tables wait you mean using well I'm not going to say we're the best but I will say we will do justice to historical archive of the you know importance to cannabis culture that um you know New Zealand home cultivators have provided over the years thank you can provide in it that trust yeah give them that trust in your good confidence oh we're talking to each other yeah we will responsibly review responsibly just as you see here and so what are your thoughts what are your thoughts on that durban poison i believe from the central north island during i see it's very smooth tasting and obviously being durban poison it's a strong sativa dominant and very uplifting you know i'm a big fan of durban poison so it's really good yeah I always appreciate it because it's not not every day you get to smoke Durban what would you give that out of a 1000 no I have another Pam just to make sure maybe an 8 out of teen direct dep have you guys been taping and okay well you know we're always open to suggestions and we do want to develop this professional nug review service I'm gonna end up with some kind of winner at the end of the year mmm that's right and we can join in Detroit pitcher well I don't race you know I don't think today yeah they might be able to claim it at the Museum or we might just display it at the Museum you know with an engraving yeah they might not want it to be one group of students write the name of the tip of the necklet one yeah that's really pay too late yeah well it's been a while since New Zealand has had a proper cannabis cup of course I'm the now defunct normal New Zealand organization used to host a cannabis cup and the Hauraki Gulf you attended one of those never know you never attended us but they used to have a boat they went out on it sounded very nice I mean the cannabis cup on a boat so maybe we'll have to look into that idea and get the cannabis cup revived because you know there's plenty of potential to you know get it hit me much time true that well let me just pack up this other little portion here and we'll see if we can come to a consensus so what else has been happening in the world of cannabis and cannabis lari from what can viewers look forward to Canada has sort of our guarded the wheels in motion hmm that's right yeah the Prime Minister and Justin Trudeau has issued a directive to the Minister of Justice and instructing them to start a process of legalizing cannabis so formulating the framework of regulations and how it's all going to work in it's great to see the ball is rolling straight away as promised by the Liberal Party to legalize cannabis nationwide on Canada so are sticking to that promise in legalization is beginning in Canada and also in Mexico beautiful look right they already have cancer in the active engine but south of the US and Mexico there's signs of legalization as well yeah stirrings I think if you will the am supreme court and this guy has come out and see it cannabis is a human right and it's a human right to grow it but they need this baby skills they need five more people to bring similar cases and I think that won't take long yeah that's a pretty groundbreaking decision by the Supreme Court and Mexico that canvas is a human right not only to disease and use cannabis but you also have the right to grow up because if you're going to if you're going to be given permission to use it you have to have a legitimate way of obtaining it so it's great that people are going to be able to grow it on the near future over a mitigator did we talk about the cervix pendant yeah we don't and I'm really back and disappointed about it so sativex is a pharmaceutical preparation of cannabis but a whole extract of you know purebred cannabis strains that have a known ratio of THC and CBD formulated into a mouth spray delivered kind of by asthma inhaler under the tongue I'm just like like I'm mouth spray like mens rea Lee yeah yeah um and it costs a thousand dollars a month yeah to use it hmm and our thousand dollars a week approximately fourteen hundred dollars a month it depends how much you're using how much pain you yeah and pharmac was looking at subsidizing it so that you know people who really needed it could be getting it hang the five dollars yeah great that's been taken seriously people made does medicine and there's a lot of people who do need it and could benefit from it but they don't bother applying because they know the columns dan has come out and bein lat well no one's applying for it so obviously don't need that back people don't apply for it because it it's like it's yeah a lot of hurdles of Peggy work and no one wants to [ __ ] take it i was going to apply for something they can for them something that you can fall in the first place so but if i were to be subsidized then a lot of new people would apply for it oh my god Ben large be ripping one of the only very bad new paint in my face and nerve painter is one of the things that we know our cannabis is amazing for and so I have very bad side effects from the opium medicine I feel visit ah nope it's obvious that i have to take to control my pain so i could take a cameras product instead and not feel awful and but still have my pain management lee hmm why how do i do that yeah well it's a real catch-22 situation because if it was legal you could just produce your own set of X alternative yeah there's mcdonalds Fallon that's the reason well that adds efforts money the reason why as mine education free and what was the decision that was handed down it was looking like they may actually subsidizes and Peter done it himself trotted out this argument in the media just a few years ago saying canvas with preparations and if its safety yay and don't you know and don't make the argument that sativex is too expensive because we're looking at subsidizing it right now yeah what decision today please come back when oh well I don't think me that the people not viewing it came back with that um people who want to smoke it recreationally might get their hands on it and how's it and therefore go get a thousand sighs it's okay and this is the sixth expert advisory committee to farm active strongly come out against subsidizing it because it has the potential for recreational yourself extremely concerned just pray that to tell me that I can do something is gonna change my life quite dramatically well them good to tell me I can't use this just like [ __ ] you I just can't play someone else yeah because some junkie might abuse it instead you have to stay on which has never ever been which has never ever been recreationally diverted yeah they want the junkies to stay on the opiates they don't want you know this increased access to medical cannabis and the thing that people don't understand you know when Peter Dunne talks about specific products when it comes to medical cannabis any product any medical preparation can be made out of any cannabis transdermal patches Oilers space it's the strain it's the strain of canvas trying to see is the product so any of those products can be made they can may be made in the pharmaceutical lab they can be made in the home in the shed maybe your shed is a lab and maybe you would make it into a lab if you were growing cannabis what set of Excel strain of waiting is onion going to be one strain it needs to be mostly dry mission we go back why should it baby any option well in the US models in the mini states that allow medical cannabis the doctor prescribes it and they prescribe specific strains and then the patient can take whatever product whatever form of ingestion suits their condition suits you know where they have the symptoms the delivery method that's best very and the one that agrees with them and it's the strain that is the product and you need to know the specific strains in the best way to have the best access to strains is to allow that you know boutique niche organic home growing individuals entrepreneurs at every level and that's what they've got over there that's what I think we should have over here and you know it sounds like the people who are putting pushing this pharmaceutical agenda you know may have finally come to the end of that mission so let's hope that that's true and let's hope that we can move forward you know with a holistic meaningful change for medical cannabis and you know that might just have to come about via a referendum or something like that but uh it's been great being with you we've smoked a lot of cannabis we've talked about a lot of [ __ ] and we're going to smoke a little bit more cannabis and now you know to sign off the show we're just going to have some parting words and a parting cone and we'll show you our favorite our favorite tourist advertisement for a [ __ ] amount of cannabis museum you know and if you you like what you see if you like what you hear visit us at [ __ ] went on a cannabis museum down there in Dunedin 66 David street caversham have you guys got any parting words for the viewers hmm garlic at the facebook page [ __ ] argument w wh AKA ma na yep and keep up to date with the news from cannabis called da teensie bit wwan organs ed have you talked about that what happened with kelly going what happened le van gallon yeah no one knows no I reserve but they want well right exactly we know that the judgment was reserved how long ago this is this was over a month ago and we were supposed to hear about this and nobody heard about this so what options does that leave right i mean presumably there's been suppression quite obviously there's been suppression because you know if it was a normal reserve judgment we would have heard within days and since we haven't heard in a month it must be suppressed and if she was still in jail I don't think they would suppress her and if she was out of jail and it was just they had decided to free her I don't think it would be suppressed either because she would be free so what do you think well I think that'll the only option left is that they're somehow its ongoing that they plan to relitigate it and they don't want anybody talking about it that's the only option that I can see but we don't know and we'll never know I mean we've got to find out where is the media on this chinen with your conspiracy theory free Kelly and check out Pokemon a cannabis museum and check out this ad for our latest edition and thanks for joining us on dunedin cannabis club club stop by Dineen ins one and only [ __ ] on a cannabis museum to check out its new collection of historic rolling papers dating back to the mid 70s and beyond donated by a former member of the organization for marijuana when of dunedin first Kendra's law reform movements in the mid-70s this collection of vintage rolling papers is a must see so stop by the canvas museum in Tunisia and", "kWMLG4aDVic": "well what we have going on today is what our people have been doing for hundreds of years we started the process yesterday of harvesting our our walk sheet corn our indian corn as a young child this was something that we did all the time this time of year we harvest harvested the corn right now we're we're doing our fourth indian corn harvest um it's a project we started four years ago that the purpose of the of the program was to to revive a diminishing cultural practice that a lot of our community members didn't know how to do [Music] one of our our male relatives in the community he puts out tobacco at the beginning of the year and he says a prayer and offers that to mother earth asking that that we can have a successful harvest then the second process is obviously going out and planting we farm it organically we do it just the way that it used to be done we don't use any chemical fertilizers or or insecticides or herbicides then after that once once the corn is has reached the milky doughy stage then we then we'll go out and we'll offer another prayer we'll offer tobacco and say another prayer and and thank the creator for the for the successful crop and then we'll move forward with harvesting [Music] so we go out and we hand pick everything and then we we bring it in and we we husk it by hand and then we'll boil water we'll we'll blanch them in the water for for about five minutes um then we'll take it out and then we'll let it cool and then then that's when we start to we start to wash goo and that's when we're we have a spoon and a bowl with with each ear of corn we're going through and we're taking each kernel off by hand so that's the that's the way that we do it um for the for the project just because that's the way it's always been done after that we'll put it out on screens and then we'll put them out in the in the sun it usually takes about three days then it's dried down to where you when you rub it it almost sounds like rocks because it's dried down so far and then then after that then we'll store it we'll put it in the bags that's kind of the entire process there [Music] our vision is to is to develop a healthier community through food and now we're really starting to move forward people are starting to produce their own food people are starting to eat better we have we have a better physical wellness in our community and that's only going to make a stronger community for us i've been involved for almost a year now and this is my first time picking and husking corn i like being there with my family and doing it for people that can't be there i'm going to be 65 in december and you know i i'm i'm dealing with cancer right now and i'm feeling good that you know if i'm not here next year at least people know what to do you know if i'm not here five years from now at least their children know how to do this corn and it's not gonna be gone you know where that was my fear that was my biggest fear that and so it's you know to have these kids be proud you know proud of their heritage proud of one of their customs you know that's a part of a part of what we're doing today you know and i i hope it continues on for for seven generations [Music] you", "1TTG2V_Z79k": "David Monson grows wheat barley and canola on 700 acres in osnabr\u00fcck a little town in the northeast corner of North Dakota but wheat has sometimes been a problem cropped for farmers in recent years we were hit with a disease in our wheat called fusarium headblade when we got to harvest time there was nothing in the heads and we had never seen anything that bad before so Monson who's also a Republican state legislature wanted to help farmers find a way to switch to another cash crop he happened to read about him it was talking about industrial hemp legislation being introduced in other states including Minnesota and in many other states and it talked about how Canada was raising it now and how much profit they could make on it and all that one reason for the interest is that HAMP is so versatile there are more than 25,000 uses ranging from food to fiber it was part of our everyday lives for centuries American farmers including George Washington and Thomas Jefferson grew hemp and in fact in North Dakota remnants of that activity are still evident today in what is called ditch weed today which is nothing more than wildly growing industrial hemp it was encouraged as part of the war effort because it was a strategic material over the decades hemp was looked at in a different way the leaves are similar to the marijuana plants so they're often confused both plants are from the species Cannabis but hemp contains virtually no THC the active ingredient in pot still it became illegal in the 1930s only to have the band relaxed briefly for military use during World War two in the 1970s it became classified as a restricted drug but that didn't deter Dave Monson I said if they can do it in Canada and England and Germany all of the world we should be able to do it too just 25 miles over the border Canada passed a law in 1997 become one of more than two dozen countries allowing the licensed growing of industrial hemp Manitoba produces nearly half of the 12,000 acres planted in Canada but you see your paddle not the seed out into a hand Andrea Herman is with the Canadian hemp trade alliance an umbrella organization for the industry she says her country's interest in the crop began in 1992 when a group in Ontario looked at successful cultivation efforts in Europe and some producers there and some governmental officials decided that this was an opportunity for Canada to recognize an industrial crop that could be grown on agricultural basis adding to crop rotation and crop diversity and also product diversity how tall will they get when they're ready to harvest 06 8 feet tall Kent Oatway is one of those Canadian farmers to venture into hemp production now why did you want to start growing it oh I guess we like to try new things a bit and who is interesting and the price was fairly decent for the product farmers like can't operate under strict government regulations that include a criminal background check before receiving a license currently Canada grows 12,000 acres of him you can see many plants right along the highways it's an easy crop to grow especially on land that's also good for weed and corn the crop is harvested at different times for different products seed products are picked by combine most of the hemp grown in Canada is grown for hemp seed which is then processed into oil and meal the two largest plants are located right here in Manitoba hemp oil Canada's facility may be small but it is north america's largest producer and processor of hemp both fiber and oil for things like food clothing soaps and paints we contract with farmers to produce hemp seed for us across the Canadian Prairies we then bring it in and process it here and seeing a gap in to hemp seed oil hold him seat or shelled hemp seed some of the products like the ones Purdue by hemp oil Canada can be found in a variety of stores and specialty shops like hemp in the heartland in Sacramento California Kyle it's amazing all of the things that use hemp definitely we carry clothing food paper products you know hempfield something like four times more paper per acre than wood pulp so it's an incredible alternative the u.s. is one of the biggest markets for hemp items Dave Monson hopes one day to supply the crop in 1999 North Dakota became the first state to legalize hemp cultivation and Monson was the first to receive a state license he still can't grow it however because the law also requires federal approval so far that hasn't happened which means North Dakota farmers will keep up efforts to someday get the crop into their fields camp has played a role in world commerce for thousands of years the plant was originally cultivated in China to make rope as well as fishnets hemp was widely grown for use in papermaking early in America's history in fact the Declaration of Independence is written on parchment containing hemp fibers it could be a multi-trillion dollar industry had it kept going from the early days if it hadn't been outlawed because of its relationship to marijuana his dream is now one step closer to reality a bill that would allow the growing of industrial hemp just passed the state assembly a committee it will permit the growing of hemp as an eight year pilot program in kern kings and san joaquin counties a number of law enforcement agencies are against the plan they say growers can easily hide marijuana and hemp fields bringing more crime to the area Meyer says this is the case you can't go marijuana in a hempfield it would get pollinated by the male plants and the ceased to produce the THC or well it wouldn't produce it at all sheriff's offices and Kings kern and san joaquin counties didn't want to comment on the issue at this time there's no doubt in Wayne Howie's mind hemp should be a crop that is part of North Dakota's future we've been going peas and lentils chickpeas various other types of crops over the years I think hemp will certainly be a nice rotational crop it would fit in well he feels so strongly about it mainly because of the potential he sees in it everything in front of him samples he requested is made from hemp much to my surprise about three weeks ago I received three boxes in the mail three really big boxes of various products from manufacturers across the entire United States there were others we could have shown you but unfortunately I can't provide you a lot of samples because these products taste too good and have you eaten an awful lot of these oils lotions food milk like products and more all made from hemp the silk and hemp is extremely soft very pretty looking I can see some girl in about three years making a prom dress out of this stuff but for that to happen in North Dakota the federal government stance on the crop must change a lawsuit brought against the feds was recently tossed out and North Dakota's congressional delegation has decided not to pursue it in Congress but huggie still continues his push looking to generate support hopefully at some point there will be a sufficient demand not only in North Dakota but in other states across the entire United States to a point where we can join the rest of the industrialized world and start growing some of these products and he hopes North Dakota is a key player in doing just that that's my goal I guess just to get area person's thinking about it", "sjGWTHDi9XI": "next on meet the farmer TV we talked with two plaintiffs in a lawsuit against Monsanto the companies that have these plans on our food have had a you know over 20 years to make billions of dollars they can throw at anything we do to try to change the situation and the only way it's going to be is going to be something like in the civil rights movement this program is a production of meet the farmer TV LLC in association with planet Earth diversified Nelly productions and Leslie Jacobs photography and graphic design so here we are we're going to talk to a couple plaintiffs in the Monsanto lawsuit so Arab I know you from the seat exchange but how did you get started in this this court case well gosh while southern exposure seed exchange we were approached about joining in this lawsuit against monsanto and we've been you know raising the issue of transgenics and how it affects us because we're a seed company where we're at risk of having contamination and this lawsuit came along and it seemed like the right thing to do to become a part of trying to stand up against monsanto you know and it also gives us an opportunity to educate as many people as we can in the public about the dangers to our health to the purity of our food system to our seeds by joining in with all of these other seed companies and consumers and farmers and saying no to GMO so your customers actually want you to tell them that the seeds they get from you are guaranteed not to be transgenic the absolutely care and we do things like testing having guidelines about how far you have to be from other farms that are producing the type of seed to try as much as we can to offer a guarantee to our customers that they're going to get pure seed from us this is southern exposure seat exchange that's us so they expose your seat exchange their website southernxposure com there we have lots of information about the lawsuit about growing food and all the things that are going on to support that kind of activity in our region you know our growers we have protocols for not being contaminated and then in order to follow up on that we have to do testing to make sure we didn't get accidental contamination and we had a case it actually wasn't a crop that we were getting for ourselves but we were helping another seed company with one of our growers to grow something from them and they're a mile from anybody who's growing GM corn and they had one lot that tested positive for GMOs and this just makes you think oh my goodness we have to even take more precautions you know against this and if those neighbors cows had come in and eat in your crop you could you know get some kind of judgment in court and they would have to pay or repair their fences or do something but well you know another thing that's going on is not so much directly about this lawsuit but i also am on the board of the organic seed alliance and we that organization has been involved in the Willamette Valley in Oregon where most of the organic beat and charged seed is produced with fighting montano wanting to grow that crop their their GMO sugar beets when they know that that pollen truck travels 45 miles you know just these big clouds of pollen at the time and drop beats four very tiny but they're talking about GMOs sugar boosters cross with chard and this is like one of the only places that a large amount of Oregon a seat is produced in the in in the country and they've been growing this GMO stuff somewhere else before but they decided they need to grow it there and it's like a big fight people you know like in the counties or trying to knock them out they're taking people to court you know they have a lot of money and this is how they beat farmers down you know they take you to court about some any any nonsense and they just use up all your money until you just fall over and roll over well that was the concern I expressed the senator Cain it's like if we don't have some protection you're telling me well don't worry about whether it's labeled genetically modified or not you can label yours is organic or label it however you want and then you have a special label and if people are looking for it they can get that but my concern is how do I protect myself from a monsanto or someone that has a gene patents saying that my crop contains that they've got the money to run the DNA test I don't and they could easily just run their tests and know that the pollen is there uh-huh and i would get 11 hundred dollar per instance state fine every time I cleaned it wasn't and it got contaminated they want to instead of have having zero tolerance along with that have some percentage of GMO contamination that is acceptable like a bills man yeah a certain percentage of filthy can yes okay Oh GMO just buttons are filth compared yeah and if you have a small amount of contamination and you keep growing that seed you can inadvertently increase the amount of contamination I just really why the especially the Big Island they're really big organic growers there they've got a very nice environment and they're isolated I and they're trying so desperately to grow their own food because I eighty-five percent oh and it's very expensive yeah and but buying thousands of acres isolation and they want the climate I'm telling you the lamb Valley Hawaii the climate is great I mean you can grow seed here in Virginia but one reason we have some growers who are like in Oregon it's certain crops we can grow and we can get seed and if you're saving a little bit for yourself that's fine but for the same amount of effort they can get eight times as much seed with less problems you know with any you know funguses and stuff attacking it because that is everything by all the salad comes from yeah and this valley and so Monsanto wants to take over and have control of most of these prime seed growing regions and actually mostly they're not growing GMOs at this point because they own so many non-gmo varieties that of course people should pay attention to which varieties come from Monsanto so that they're not spending their hard-earned dollars supporting it because they bought lots of conventional seed companies is seen how do I well one can't run it is rated well one thing that you can do is a petco seeds has put up a list of varieties that are commonly available that Monsanto owns the oh and she has non-modified yeah and these are non their list is primarily not it you know not conventional seeds that Monsanto owns we you know we've thought of it we just haven't quite got the resources to get all of that and keep it up to date because people buy and sell companies hot but and the other thing is most of these older varieties that they can that they have actually have just regular PvP patents which will expire shortly and like one of the things we do with those conventional varieties is hold on to some seed and then when patent expires offer some organic seed of it how do the patents expire on GMO while they do some day 50 years what a difference because they're they're made for here's what their dreams and I mean higher ethical purposes they're not expiring because they change the traits slightly and reap get a new patent and so and they take the old one off the market five or six years before the patent expires too so that people who are inter transgenics cannot save back seed in any substantial quality quantity long enough to use the old trade not that we will want to ourselves but even someone who will want to would have trouble cuz these are fuel crops look at that thing the back of that the packet of those just for fun go into you know a regular farmer seed place and pick up a packet of this is by opening this packet you agree you know how you know when it's really modify my cuz there's a yes a you own that there's also you can also tell about seeds that are not GMO that they control their starting to put that on farmer quantities of the conventional seeds that they are selling as well because I think they have plans in the future well there you have it the reason why we need to really be watching transgenic material and stay tuned next week for more about this court case and this attempt of 83 plaintiffs to try to stop the ownership of plant genes well now in the 80s the late 80s or Virginia did the 1998 Virginia food at which campaign vehement Lee for thinking it was going to protect us from all of this right Monsanto came to us in the organic certification quoting Rachel Carson that we can make the plants have their own insecticide so you organic growers won't have to use them and we were like no and I mean they offered money they were going to like pay for the whole organic certification program and and and greatly support it as long as when we wrote the regulations that modified materials were no different than Gregor Mendel aha cross and peas and that plants that were developed to be resistant against diseases and insects were automatically organic because there was no applied herbicides pesticides fungicides and I think about a Trojan horse huh yeah it was well it alarmed a lot of us but we didn't really understand what was going on but it was it was their genuine belief and and I recently heard something on NPR where Rachel Carson retracted some of that stuff that she had said like I it seems like a really good idea that we breed plants that made their own pesticides and therefore we wouldn't have to apply them and certainly that's better than DDT but it's not it's no toward her at the end of her life she was like whoa wait a minute this is not going the right direction right now Korn is really high and corn is being groped all across the United States yep and in Jewish or animal feed and right by your fuel yeah and and those farmers are making money on that yeah and there is no way that you can get them to grow non-gmo corn they're gonna they're energetic but here that why some good news maybe is any number of people including right here in Virginia Chris Slade at virginia state is showing farmers who can take two acres intensively planted with food crops that are not commodity crops and get the same profit that they would growing 50 and sometimes a hundred eighties 58 yeah this is something that i know for a number of our growers our seed growers who were not organic or some of them were true you know actually went through this three years to be come organic and and they are still making a good amount of money from their two or three horsemen it's very different financial plan than the guy that's making money on the ethanol coordinate yeah they can just pay somebody one time to drill it or plant it in with the chemicals right in the ground and then come back and harvest it that the people that are really doing the seed saving and the organic growing they're investing all the time and the whole season there they're monitoring stuff and they're doing a lot of handwork they're composting and adding materials mm-hmm and I'm not and and that doesn't show up when you walk into Whole Foods and you see the the carrots grown in the desert and Israel and the carrots grown here in Virginia that the amount of effort that's different between the two doesn't show up but what happens is one one guy survives because he makes enough money the other guy fades away and that's what I'm worried about what you're saying with exactly modified as they create a financial system that whether we win fighting or not we all fade away because none of us survived long enough for our kids to keep doing savin see the whole point of making a new food system is to get farmers who are farming for other reasons and get consumers who know that food is not cheap that they're going to have to if we want to have a sustainable system we're going to have to choose to spend our money on okay the real cost of food and consider that good I mean we spent a lot of money on food and restaurants if we get real food and you know and cook that food if we in our restaurants look to have fresh local produce as a value that we appreciate in the meals that we get that's how we can have it I mean I go you know I I've spent time in Europe food is not cheap in Europe it just isn't and that's why having organic food is not such a deal there because food period is not cheap because it's important to grow food locally to have a system where you can feed yourself we didn't happen we didn't happen to live through the Second World War where there was no food that was brought in you didn't know how to grow it yeah you were out in the case without a metal this is sort of the kingpin for their financial success and their ability to dominate yeah is to be able to own this and apply these triple damages to anyone who possesses it that they didn't get a license and that and they don't have they mostly don't know they're even if they said this in court they don't sue that many people but they take so many people they threatened to sue them and settle out of court that that person is going to stop talking about it you know 10 times the number of people that they take to court they do that and so they just quiet them down so you don't hear a word about what they said they promised they'd we're now going to talk to anybody about this so what I want to try to do is get the same thing for pricing go absolutely so I said this for humans now we need to say it for our food yes and we right now unfortunately the companies that have these patents on our food have had you know over 20 years to make billions of dollars that they can throw at anything we do to try to change the situation and the only way it's going to be is going to be something like in the civil rights movement where you have millions of people standing up and you know speaking their voices speaking with their money because these companies have more money than any small group of us ever hope to have so how do we get the general public when we still experience this in the markets and in the fresh farm markets general public comes they still are looking for the cheapest price what's your price on tomatoes what's your price on sweet corn they might ask you where you organic or do you use GMOs that they might ask it cursory but they are really looking at the price and if the guy down here has got five years for a dollar in mine three years for a dollar even if his it Roundup Ready they're going to go for that well denim item I gotta get grown they they're not I cook it give it to him with some butter he'll pay me two walks for it uh-huh and so and we'll see this at the harvest vessel it'll all be prepared food nobody will take home fresh food yeah and most of our markets now eighty percent of the vendors are cooking things and selling somebody something for five to ten dollars but they don't want to give me and Oliver are handful of coppers and I hey get home cook this else oh yeah that's funny question is a deal you know what has any time well what our lives are so pressure they have to work with schools I mean what we do at a southern exposure is we spend a lot of our resources on education we work with school groups who were with for age groups we work with food pantries and all of these kinds of places that you know are giving people the idea that you can make a difference in your life in the life of your family by taking the time lame you know the gift that you can give them is fresh home good high quality food that seems to me to be the real key if even if you pull the kingpin out of Monsanto by they they don't have this right to sue they don't have this ability to to own a patent and profit by it we still have a general public that doesn't know how to feed themselves and doesn't know how they can balance their time budget and cook food right raw food and still is you know we've got that ball Martin mentality absolutely our prices buy a cheaper live better about the Chinese yeah and you know I we need to educate and we also need to do research about how things you know work if somebody like myself you know I deal with being overweight there are many studies about overweight women if you're eating well in other ways you don't end up with high blood pressure or diabetes or things which other people and my family died from that I don't have you know i mean and i may never you know stay then you know but so we start going here it is medicine it absolutely is and and there are their programs now where they give double benefits for food stamps if you spend it at a farmers market and the ones that are robust have shown you know decreases in diabetes and high blood pressure particular which are quite expensive to the state for four people of ten percent or more in like two years so there's really a public benefit to instead of subsidizing the corporations that are suing the farmers trying to grow things to subsidize those farmers to keep growing things that might be a little more difficult and less profitable to grow and better help you and what Don what you're saying is this is a multi generational thing yeah it's not just that we might get sick from that particular feed we get when we might pass this on to multiple generation where we become intolerant and and our health breaks down sort of like in a global a global residual I'm not change in the gene pool that will affect all humans that's right for generations to come yeah okay I'm up against yeah and you know we can make a difference right now as I tell every time I give a talk I say if you want to have good food vote with your dollars by good food cook good food teach your children to love good food from time to time like we do some work with mothers newsmagazine one of the things they do is they'll take some variety that we are some other heirloom company offers and do you know analysis it like the Floriani flip corn that has more protein you know available they're just eating the same thing that you would otherwise and you know some of the tomatoes they can't produce as many tomatoes per plant that you have more nutrients and each one is we got to eat closer to the farm yeah because people don't even like to buy them when they're perfect at you know in a market they think well I'm gonna bring him home and had it returned at last yeah well last two weeks yeah it's like it's fresh lettuce it'll last ten minutes if you leave it in your 90-degree car yeah you know if you don't eat it before you leave it in the car you've lost it yeah but that's what people want it to be like a TV dinner they can pull it out six months later and push up I honest yeah I tell them if they wanted to keep get some roots well now we're worried about the potatoes because they you know maybe those skins are set by an herbicide kill yeah well that's why you ought to get a winter CSA going in your local area yeah our children are going to have trouble we don't even recognize because we've contaminated the food supply with these transgenic materials they're going to cross whether you get sued or not for it pretty soon you're not going to have any heirloom varieties that are uncontaminated it's definitely one of the things with you know joining these various lawsuits week they say we we feel like you need to go after it three ways so um whenever you can why not maybe we'll win one especially and then the other is is lobby as much as you can because as I say you might not think it makes that much difference but I can remember being a towel and being drugged by my grandmother down the streets to some March you know and she said nothing may happen in your lifetime but you are not going to have a better future if something doesn't so I'm going to take you here you're going to walk with me and then when enough people were you know made aware of the bad things are happening and for us it's important to let them know about these risks to their health to their children's health to the health of our animals so that people will join in our fight and we have nothing to lose except the life that we want for ourselves so we better fight for it and then we're spending money spend your money in the right way yeah all of these things together might prevail somehow we've got to make it so that the the farmers doing the right thing make enough money that they become financially competitive with the corporations that are well this is you know what started out when people started with csas it was one way of saying I care enough about this food that I'm going to pay my farmer a reasonable amount for that food and the more the more that you tell people that being a good person that is trying to build this life means allocating more of your resources to food is important and I feel like sometimes that we under emphasize that well you know there are there are young people out there doing incredible things I love you guys know about farm hack I love it when people who have technical backgrounds say I want to farm and I want to do it a little bit easier on my back and so they're reinventing how you can farm on a few acres and and making it more like we can have more farmers into the future all we need to do is support them so that they don't go broke it's very challenging so what we can do as individuals is join us esa know our farmer by local and and and start spending our money in that way absolutely i mean it is you know the the thing that they've said all along act locally first you have the most control there and of course continue to take these larger actions but the thing that you can do and nobody else can stop you from doing is where you buy your food how you prepare your food what you teach your children we need the public to be aware get rid of the apathy start voting with your dollars and recognize that you're poisoning yourself if you don't spend more and get the true cost of good food i wanted to mention another to other websites that have addressed these issues quite often one is escada the organic seed birds and trade association which are lead plaintiffs in our lawsuit and they you just can keep up to date with what's going on and then pub hat but it's more of a total legal thing there but they do tell you about the literal things on the lawsuit and then the organic seed alliance it just gives you more about all of these issues around seeds and how to try to maintain a peer seed source and where to go and find the position of the week because you might as well it doesn't take very much time to add that to your list of what you should do well there you have it the real reason why you need to buy from your local farmer at the farmers market not finding the cheapest stuff you can at the super stores and support healthy food for you and future generations the way that you can support local farms join a CSA buy from your local farmer go to the local farmers market to avoid modified materials and patented genes in your food this program is a

in this emerging industry ensuring that product all along the supply chain from seed to sale as proper safeguards in place the go legal campaign underscores the importance of marijuana consumers and the industry choosing to participate in the regulated market while working together to eliminate the illegal market and its criminal activity go legal is about creating an ethic among Oregonians and the industry by embracing a strong regulatory structure that supports public safety the industry and consumers were establishing a standard for all Oregonians to follow one of the benefits of the open and regulated industry is that it's drawing a lot of people from with different backgrounds highly experienced people from different backgrounds into the industry so my husband and I are who both founded the company and we actually come from fifth-generation farming families and we continue about family tradition of farming but we switched crops my partner and I we actually met on the other side of the country in Annapolis we had both been Midshipmen at the United States Naval Academy and so we partnered up and since then we've been working on this dream of opening Oregon Coast cannabis and now you see today this amazing dispensary that I can't even believe some days that we're here my wife and I have been growing cannabis in the om MP medical system for our 18 years I've started in this industry in the black market so I've traveled through this the entire time I'm the lab director for Oden distillation being part of the regulated industry gives me a comfort to do this before I got into growing cannabis medically and recreationally I was a fishery biologist for the Forest Service I worked out in the Central Oregon and I found you know I have a passion for the environment my graduate work was an environmental science had an opportunity to just settle down and become a farmer we just want to be regulated and thought of as any other business and have all the responsibilities and obligations that go along with that but also be able to feel protected as business owners and as citizens I'm an architect I practice architecture for 20 years through contacts and connections I was able to get access to some different extracts and I just started playing with chocolate and next thing I know I have left my job and and bought the farm so to speak and and never look back I received a doctorate in molecular biology and I worked for a number of years in the vegetable seed industry before coming to found a new breed seed and I think the one advantage that we have of this industry is it pulls so many other industries together that were able to use a lot of background a lot of knowledge a lot of personal experiences from other industries to help start the foundation for this one our economy not only contributes to the cannabis industry but it also contributes down to CPAs to lawyers to design companies to safe companies we contribute so much to organs economy cannabis industry being regulated is going to very positively affect every aspect of Oregon so now that we're getting tax revenue or creating good-paying jobs that tax revenue is being able to be utilized for schools and police departments the cannabis industry is affecting so many other assets of Oregon and it goes far beyond just dispensaries and Oregon edible makers I mean we're talking about hazelnut farmers and as far as coffee producers down in South America I mean that's that's really what this industry is helping to support when I look at the cannabis industry here in Oregon there's a few things that really jump out at me first and foremost job creation we've we've hired three people in the last year and we're looking at hiring another 14 people when we transition into our larger facility so job creation is is to me number one currently we employ a hundred people we project to employ over 300 people by 2018 so we currently employ over 25 people not including our trimming staff with the trimmers we currently have about 30 and within four to eight weeks we'll have another hundred to a hundred and twenty full-time trimming staff with the intent to six months to eight months from now have roughly 200 full-time employees I'm incredibly proud to have this small business right now we've got 20 people that we've employed many of them have come from other industries some of them were unemployed previously all of them make a good living wage all with full benefits we think that Oregon has a really great culture of valuing craft and we are excited to see the craft cannabis movement really develop here and see producers who are working to produce things in a sustainable and ethical way really rise to the top well what we're trying to do is innovate we want to be innovators in the industry it's important for us that as we grow we stay focused on innovating the the industry you know one of one of the great things about and being in the industry especially right now is seeing all the new products coming out this industry is is old here in Oregon it's only been regulated as a recreational business for a short period of time so there's a lot of room for innovation and we're seeing it every day the Oregon food culture has always drawn really unique and sustainable growing practices and as one of the things that I think has made the Oregon foodie culture so dynamic so diverse and so incredibly successful we have farmers that we work with who they are craftsmen they they take extreme care in the product that they produce cannabis industry has always had an impact on Oregon and now for the first time we have a transparency that allows environmental regulations to come into play to protect not just Oregon's environment but the consumer so in Oregon with LCC regulating our market and metric tracking all of our products you're able to see from the time a plant starts as a seed or as a clone how it's grown who grows it and where it goes to the way that I view a laboratory is a vehicle to legalization or to making this possible because if you don't have checks if you don't have balances it assists in the transition from a medical or even a black-market scenario into making a legal recreational scenario possible having this regulated system allows the product to be far superior or the regulation on specialty pesticide use we stand out and the rest of the license states Oregon has supported a lot of smaller companies and family farms to participate in the program and has a limit on canopy size which sort of eliminates those huge corporate players from entering the state and taking over we can get cleaner products we can get higher quality product the medicine that will come out of this now that there's more capital behind it is gonna be a fantastic advancement that the money the expertise the innovation and equipment and the scientific advancements it's gonna be amazing for lots of different reasons with this regulation we're able to see safe access before there was a you know cannabis was in the shadows we had you know a very black market that people didn't really know a lot about but with legalization and state-run programs we're able to provide a safe place for people to purchase cannabis who are over 21 I think the cannabis industry is really changing Oregon for the better there's some real benefits to bringing this product in a more mainstream market or there's more availability to education and to regulation and really that impacts all of us I think Oregon is doing it right by really engaging the industry and working to shape regulations around sound science and really putting public safety at the forefront of everything that they're doing OLC you see as from the beginning offered everybody in the industry a voice to come in and help contribute we're building this industry we're designing it it's being born right now and we get to participate and how those rules play out we get to participate in how businesses can be run and influence the entire world not just the cannabis industry but all industries and all types of businesses on new ethics and standards the OCC has been a great resource you know through the whole licensing process it was a learning curve for everybody involved so having them available to you know to speak with about how the application is going and so on and so forth and what they need and what we need to do to be better prepared it's been absolutely wonderful you like everything that we're doing especially people like myself that are really pushing for the regulating market to create jobs in industry there's not gonna be room for the black market you know honestly I feel like Oregon has you know one of the most open if not the most open cannabis industries in the world we have the ability to do a lot more we have potential as part of this industry to really shape the future of cannabis in the state and the nation a regulated industry is something that a community can build around it's an industry that families and communities can be proud of and build around for the future [Music] you", "4XgRuwRgTVo": "the environmentally sustainable alternative part one hemp history 101 long ago when these ancient Grecian temples were new hemp was already old in the service of mankind for thousands of years even then this plant had been grown for cordage and coarse cloth in China and elsewhere in the East for centuries prior to about 1850 all the ships that sail the Western seas were rigged with hempen rope and sales for the Sailor no less than the hangman hemp was indispensable the Conestoga wagons and Ferris schooners of pioneer days were covered with help and canvas indeed the very word canvas comes from the Arabic word for him in 1813 the Americans took a trip across the lake ontario to steal a lot of help first they captured all four york the royal ship burned down then they went to harbor front to see what could be fouled they fill 14 ships with amp sales and hemp rope burning all the rest before they torched the town down the Brits got so mad sea and Parliament a burnin river they cried and burn the White House down and the old day is breaking was done by hand one of the hardest jobs known to man now the power breaker makes quick work of it the hemp industry can now recover 95% to the fibers rather than the twenty-five to fifty percent as before in 1935 Henry Ford's desired to unite industry and agriculture would lead to the formation of the farm commercial council the commercial model would use the country's farmers to supply the industrial needs of the 20th century the expanded markets would bolster the dismal state of affairs and American farms and he's the emerging problems of Petro chemical pollution Ford and the council would find support in the like-minded genius of Thomas Edison and plant geneticists George Washington Carver and Luther Burbank in 1938 advances in hemp decortication equipment prompted Popular Mechanics magazine to call him the billion-dollar crop with 25,000 uses the development sprouted a new kind of hemp industry in Minnesota one poised to exploit the cellulose rich herds for use in the plastics industry in 1916 the Department of Agriculture published bulletin 404 written by leister Dewey and plant and paper chemist Jason Merrill printed on hemp paper the bulletin warned that forests cannot withstand the demands and praised the paper potential of him Henry Ford had a vision of growing automobiles from the soil at the company's river rouge plant researchers used annual crops to develop biodegradable car parts at in 1941 unveiled a car whose plastic body was made entirely from hemp wheat straw incisal the wild plastic withstood blows 10 times as great as steel without denting and its reduced weight promised better fuel efficiency 1937 was my first summer to spend with my grandfather and at that time they grew hemp to make rope and him in the next farmer had a machine and you made your threads okay after you had it on the spools then you would go and make rope but then in in in the latter years of the depression they banned it it was banned by the governments of North America it came at just when the Depression was right at its worst about 19 in this area about 1937 the law was passed that it was illegal to have emceed was illegal to have it and it was illegal to grow it it was actually illegal to have em seed in your possession it will stop being used by mackenzie king and you would I would listen to the old-timers my Uncle Bill and my grandpa and Fred Wagner and those people talking like they really felt that they had been hardly the hard done by in 1942 in a full reversal the US Department of Agriculture presented the movie hemp for victory encouraging farmers to grow him the hemp industry was in decline when the United States entered World War two with a nation supply of Manila ham and Jude curtailed by the Japanese invasion of the Philippines the government turned to the farmers for help the war hemp industries built 42 mills throughout the Midwest hemp production rose dramatically as the nation's farmers produced 60 million pounds of fiber for the country supply of cordage but then they banned it it was banned by the government of North America in the waning years of the 20th century the earth's most useful crop we emerged on farms the world over for more than half a century hemp was a crop and exiled to bring into the world 200 million new people to a year that equal to the panera equal to the population united state and to not want to bring in a source of shelter and clothing and food is virtually every swamp the heritage of the past is the seed that brings forth the harvest of the future many years ago and grown everywhere and we don't know it's been so hard it's low kind not the door kind it's clean it's organic its a don't panic you can

homestead this video we're going to talk about the steps that we're taking to getting our greenhouse in order for this year and getting some plants started in there stay tuned to see everything that we got accomplished so these garden beds and tubs were already existing on the property that we purchased so we're using what we have and i am turning over all of the tubs and the beds um working in some vermiculite and some other um things we're gonna talk about later and getting them ready to to plant some seeds in [Music] we did add the greenhouse the hoops and the plastic over these existing beds and also if you look the beds on the far right hand corner are already worked as soon as we moved in i went ahead and planted garlic in those beds we had decided to make more room to plant more plants in the greenhouse so we are moving all of those tubs to one side to be able to either put more beds or more containers on that left-hand side [Music] give us your ideas in the comments on how we should proceed with adding plants on the left-hand side whether we stick with containers or we add some beds or do something else over there let us know down in the comments thing we're gonna do is we're gonna do next two beds so while i'm working on mixing the beds my mom's going to be working on these barrels and clearing them out just mixing these barrels together a few weeks ago we dumped ash from our fireplace um pine wood shavings and chicken manure in here and just let it sit and now i'm working it in the soil to get all those nutrients [Music] by the way if you're new to this channel my name is lily this is my mom heather [Music] a little bit of a back story we just recently moved here from kansas city and we bought this farm and are working to become self-sustainable or as much as we possibly can not completely but with all the craziness in the world right now just not knowing what's going to happen next we thought we would do this as a family my husband and i both do have full-time jobs but we work we work remote so as long as we have internet you can work anywhere so we do that during the weekdays and then mornings and evenings and weekends we're working to get this self-sustainable homestead of our own had a lot of help from friends and family and it's we're very grateful for that because it does take a lot of work [Music] so with these pots we are making do with what we got since we just recently purchased this property these pot to this garden area which is already here we just built the greenhouse over top of it to be able to utilize this to start planting and also get some things that are growing a little bit earlier maybe probably keep some tomatoes and some herbs and stuff in here that we can get earlier in the spring and keep growing later in the fall but to keep diseases and stuff out of our soils we will probably let it freeze over in the winter at least a little bit [Music] looks like they're about ready to put some plants in [Music] and lettuce so i've got a couple basil already started kale kale some kale's already started too tomatoes like some onions around we've already started [Music] yes that's hard to start i think anyways here's some more flowers we're not going to miss more flowers we're going to make one of the flower bed yes like some of each one can i do the flowers in [Music] we'll do a little bit of each one of them just to kind of have some flowers okay there's more then we can put some more outside cuz but the marigolds and zinnias and cosmos those are good for bees but it's also good especially marigolds that help keep animals away from your garden yeah yeah so that's why we got to keep some marigolds to plant outside around the garden so there's flowers over here tomato snow okay so there's a lot of stuff [Music] so now we have everything figured out we're going to see which to put what to put what seeds and which thing [Music] all these weeds think they could get all this garden space to themselves little did they know that lily was gonna come up and break them all apart yeah right now i'm planting a green leaf black seeded simpson lettuce [Music] we are gonna do some zenya xenia california giant cosmos sensation mix and marigold marigold sparky last but not least my favorite type of flowers sweet williams williams double flower mixed colors you know tell them why it's your favorite type of flower it's my favorite type of flower because my mom's dad used to be named william and if you take out the w-i-m it spells my brother's name lamb and my father passed away before two years ago so that's why i really wanted to get some williams to plant this year and plus he was really sweet [Music] is where we're going to put the marigolds and stuff at we're going to put around the garden so that they could scare away the animals that might come we have tons of bunnies and coyotes and all types of things so you know how it scares them away they don't the animals don't like the scents of the flowers so it's a good return it's a good natural deterrent for animals right now the garden is not fenced but i think we're going to probably be putting a fence around it there are as lily said a ton of rabbits and this that we're planting bok choy kind of in the same idea i'm going to plant it around then eventually plant something a little bit higher up in the center a tomato plant or some kind of a pepper plant i'll space these out a little bit more they need a little more room to grow than the lettuce does [Music] on this bed i'm putting some herbs i've got some basil some peppermints and some cilantro cilantro probably made a couple in here and a couple of the other ones we love our cilantro i really love it [Music] i love grapes cilantro and basil realize how tiny we didn't realize how small mint seeds are no i didn't realize [Music] the next thing i'm going to be doing is i'm going to be mixing all the stuff so then it's not in just one area in the middle of the bed because we went spread out so then i get ourselves a lot of fertilizer for waste and i am putting tape on these tubs so i can remember what i planted which is very helpful yeah right now i've got two end beds that i'm just not one yeah i'm thinking about maybe making those kind of many compost piles or maybe eventually i'll get it out and take it and create a compost pile outside but it's just a good place right now to put all of the extra green stuff and ground stuff and everything else that we've got that we're pulling out of tubs right now guys i think you guys just gave me some good luck by hitting that subscribe button and hit that like button cause i just found the four leaf clover in this tub i'm going to put a couple of kale seeds in get some kale started [Music] in this tub i'm planting some spinach [Music] we like cooking with bok choy so i'm doing some more bok choy's [Music] so in this last tub i'm going to plant carrots i've never planted carrots in a container before but the dirt is really deep um it says the roots will get eight inches long so it's more than enough dirt for that but we'll just see how it goes we'll be planting some more outside but we can't plant them here in our area until april [Music] i just got done mixing all of the soil wood chips and everything together and now we are going to add vermiculites it helps with retention of the soil with nutrients and moisture [Music] i am now leveling out the soil and everything else so then it has a nice level area to grow [Music] so what i'm doing right now is i'm looking on the back of [Music] these flower packages to see how far i need the part i need to plant these first i'm going to look in on the sweet williams plant spacing is 12 to 18 inches in marigolds i have to plant it eight to twelve inch spacing on the cosmos spacing is nine to twelve inches zinnias is 9 to 12 inches [Music] so do you know the difference between germination and maturity okay that's fine so germination is how long it takes to seed to start growing so what's the germination of the zinnias the germination of the zinnias is three to five days so that's how long it's gonna take before the seed even starts growing so we won't see plants coming up until a week fish a little bit less than a week so tomorrow we come out here there's not going to be plants growing that's how long it takes so that's what germination means germination means how long it takes for the seed to start growing just start growing into a plant so what's the other one i mean maturity maturity so that's when the plant becomes mature that's when the plants so like in this case we're having flowers so it's putting on flowers or if it's a vegetable it's [Music] i hope you enjoyed our video of us starting to get our greenhouse a little bit organized and planted also don't forget if you have ideas on how we need to structure the the rest of our greenhouse leave it in the comments below and we'll be reading through those and trying to figure out what all else we need to do we'll keep you updated on the progress of everything growing in our greenhouse also soon we will be working on getting our garden set up and going for the year see y'all next time", "a3M-zPCfi84": "this farm-to-fork segment is sponsored by net effect I'm in a beautiful pistachio orchard on the east side of Madera today with a pioneer the industry mr. Chris Wiley how are you sir great rich how you doing I'm good it's always a pleasure to be standing here with someone that's as good a farmer as you are but tell us about pistachios they don't grow like most nuts no they bloom in the springtime usually around April and then it's the interesting because the apricot grows first that's a shell shell and hull and then the meat starts at the end of June the mid July we finish the meat so it's a little bit different than like almonds so it'll be hollow in the middle and the inside the meat will grow like an embryo absolutely and then slowly the nut feels towards the end of July we want nut Phil right now and so now being in nut Phil is all the waters is actually being used more by the tree you become so efficient now by using drip irrigation or micro jet sprinklers absolutely these global volume low pressure systems are amazing well much more efficient using our water now now when people see the trucks rolling out it's not just what's in the truck that a farmer is being compensated for that's just the entire volume you get paid on the meat absolutely that's green weight about fifty thousand pounds and we get paid about thirty third of that 33 percent now not all that the the green weight doesn't go to waste either you actually now have found ways to use the shells absolutely we'd start testing that last summer and into winter and we love it we put it on the roads aren't traveled that much and the shell has been working on foot death control work out really good well what we love is what you put on a table in pistachio so thank you so much for that for farm to fork I'm rich crepes", "kxN6h2eEA3o": "so where are we going again Christina she's doing those I'm just along for the ride lots of farms in Springfield Colorado people are flying in from all over the country for this event you excited will be my first time actually in a hempfield so this is the first hempfield that's been harvested in the US since the 50s that's me 33 countries around the world or profiting and enjoying the positive benefits of growing this amazing plant but we're not in the US we know that our customers want him because they buy it in ever increasing quantities really excited about the potential to partner with American farmers who want to grow it as we really see this as the next step in American agriculture this is a kind of historic moment we're going to come out and see this this hempfield and this will be the first of hopefully thousands of hemp fields across America in the coming decades the DEA published in the Federal Register in September 2001 that hemp foods was in the same category as heroin class one scheduled drug which is ridiculous you know you know hemp seeds hemp oil this is not a drug crop this is most nutritious seed in the world right man welcome regulation be right here we go here we go so what's your plan so you're gonna harvest them and then stick them into bins and let them dry along with dr. bronner's and nature's path and the tivo the hempen is association we sued the federal government and it took us two and a half years until two thousand four to win a Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal and now him foods are legal and if you can eat him you can wear him these jeans are from him that shirt i'm wearing is made from him why can't we grow it a number of states have passed laws that allow for hemp farming under state law and the only impediment so far that's helped farmers back has been the federal law it's not a drug industrial hemp spin clumped together with marijuana and we've been trying to separate it you know it's the most ridiculous part of the drug war that a non-drug agricultural crop is treated as a schedule 1 substance the fact is you can't get high from industrial hemp there's so little of the psychoactive component in hanford less than three-tenths of 1% by law we're really happy with the hemp we get from Canada and that's growing all the time but I think because it's illegal to grow in the United States the prices are artificially high it's the perfect food in terms of having all the amino acids you need it's a complete protein it's got a great spectrum of fatty acids high in fiber tastes great we're talking about a billion dollar opportunity for American farmers with all the different uses for him not only for food but for textiles and construction in the UK we've got them they're building these incredibly energy-efficient homes using have heard this the woody part of the stock here blending it with lime it has excellent insulation energy-saving qualities they don't have any insect problems and it's also fire resistant industrial hemp is just poised for a comeback and is coming back because it is a sustainable alternative renewable resource where there's biocomposites or textiles it grows like a weed you don't need herbicides pesticides a whole lot of fertilizer the inputs are pretty minimal lends itself well to organic farming systems and you compare that to say that cotton where you know massive amounts of water huge amounts are beside construction materials textiles body care clothing food the whole thing is is all being in imported from Canada Europe China and overseas so the farmers in those countries are allowed to take advantage of hemp but American farmers are being denied this opportunity America was founded on him in 1700s the most important agriculture crop in the whole world was industrial hemp George Washington grew hemp on his plantation in Mount Vernon Thomas Jefferson grew hemp New Hampshire is actually named after hemp amp is the Northern European name for him one of the nice things over the last 13 years as we've been working on this is that in every state where we've worked on legislation it's always been on a bipartisan basis farmers wouldn't grow it if they weren't able to make money and that's what's really important is we want to you know get farmers in the United States growing this crop we have Ryan Laughlin super brave super courageous ready to do it he's like okay I'm just ready to do this to grow industrial hemp in this cultural moment I think it is brilliant it's a half a circle right what we got here so it's 60 acres you got to start somewhere so this is you know the first little steps of creating those you know getting this industry back into powerful producing initially in America you know which it will be guarantee it it's great for you know literally the whole planet man I've been waiting for 20 some years for this you know I've helped harvest in Canada but in America this is a whole different ball game this is a whole other species of animal coming across there you know new generations coming forward like Ryan's daughter out in the hempfield this isn't something to her that elicits this is a crop they grow on their farm and I think that that's what's really touching lots of the times when I go to family farms and it's a family farm and though their kids are out there working the fields or combine all around to go before we started vote hemp in two thousand thinking oh yeah three to five years we'd be able together again here we are thirteen years later and we finally putting our first drop this is so I momentous and historian we're not quite done yet though you know we still need to get Congress to pass several bills that we have and we've got a bill in the house that has 47 bipartisan co-sponsors if you go to vote hemp com put in your zip code find out who represents you in Congress if you don't already now they'll give you their contact information and then you can either call or write them and let them notes you think this is something important that the two bills that are pending ought to be passed in Congress the 5th annual hemp History Week is geo second through 8 2014 get involved and help us spread the message that it's time to grow", "qQN-3xZnojk": "nice here corn I'm here to tell you and this is a monster field just about think about that just about a hundred and fifty thousand dollars where the corn growing out here in this field 150,000 that's a pretty good paycheck if everything goes right irrigated it be but you do understand or I'd like you to understand if Nebraska would make marijuana legal legal the drug marijuana legal a medical marijuana this field instead of producing 150,000 would produce 15 million dollars worth of medical marijuana think about that at the same time say you want to grow marijuana but just hemp the hemp version the non-drug version which Canada does at the tune of a billion dollars a year Canada grows hemp if this field was hemp we would be able to make three hundred thousand dollars compared to 150,000 with corn and do it with a lot less herbicides and pesticides and fertilizers now who's Shafton who and who's blowing smoke in whose face and who's stopping the farmer from making a living and who's always stepping on people's rights who hidden in plain sight right off the side of this bridge there's a ten foot plus tall marijuana plant along with dozens and dozens of other marijuana plants why the government doesn't utilize these and get us out of debt I'll never know not for the people to use but for the government to harvest itself and profit by itself with this to the states that simply already have it legal sell it to the states that have it legal and let our own government harvest it you bet why not a lot better idea than raising our taxes in my opinion you know me you know I'm mr. bill you know that I've spent 32 years of my life year-round mind you for nothing on the streets preaching common sense and when the Holy Spirit so who moves me I preach a little religion but be that as it may I preach against any kind of drug use be it cigarettes booze or marijuana and any illegal drug out there I preach against it at the same time I as a taxpayer do not want to have to pay massive amounts of money some thirty thousand dollars a year to keep someone in a cage just because they used marijuana I think that's a terrible atrocity and a waste of tax dollars when our roads our bridges or dams our inter structure in general needs so much help you bet so I would finished with this though until it becomes legal don't do it don't break the laws of this government that only promotes them that only allows them promotions that allows them to eat lobster and brag how they destroyed your life help change come but don't break the law until it does rate this film here in Southwest Nebraska we have a lot of low maintenance roads and hear some of them caved off you barely have enough room for one vehicle to get through there and I wouldn't try doing it if you was drunk I'm here to tell you with two and three foot drop offs on each side welcome to Southwest Nebraska", "K0DJ5SP78CM": "Hey it's Dustin from Freen Method Farms\nand co-creator of HempFarmingAcademy.com and in this video I am going to\nshow you how to farm industrial hemp using the farming methods that we used\nthis year so stick with me. First of all I just want to mention that we've had a\nton of fun this year farming him it's a beautiful plant and it's almost\ninstantly gratifying to watch these things grow we planted them early May\nand they're about 5 or 6 inches tall just these little things you didn't even\nknow if they're gonna survive and before you know it they are growing and every\nweek there's progress until they get to the size where they're almost as tall as\nme there's tall as me in some areas and then they're just producing beautiful\nflowers and have a really nice smell so even though the plants mature over the\ncourse of four months here in Central Oregon we have been planning this\nprocess over the course of more like nine months since the beginning of the\nyear taking samples of our soil and getting those tested understand the pH\nlevels and also understand the nutrients within the soil and then it took some\ntime to till the soil and get it right so that we could lay our plastic in our\ntrip line and eventually plant in early June. One of the things that you're going to\nwant to consider when you decide that you're gonna farm him is what genetics\nare you going to use not all seeds are created equal for us it was really\nimportant that the seed company had a good track record of producing really\nlarge high CBD percentage plants and also they a high percentage feminization\nrate out of the 12,000 plants that we have here in this field we've only found\nfive male plants that we had to remove which makes farming a little bit easier\nand we know that we're gonna be able to keep most of our crop once we decided on\nthe genetics that we were going to use for this field in propagating the seeds\nin a greenhouse in early May and during that time that gave us the ability to be\nable to lay our rows and lay our plastic mulch and our drip tape and establish a\nnice healthy moist soil to be able to plant our seedlings in in early June when it comes time to plant your\nseedlings into the ground you want to get as much help as possible we got\nabout seven or eight people on planting days to be able to help us and we\nutilized a waterwheel transplant er which is an implement that goes on the\nback of a tractor and has two seeds where two people can sit and they will\ndrop their seedlings into holes that are created by the transplant er about four\nacres into the ground each day once the seedlings are in the ground the next\ncouple months really is all about just making sure the plant is getting all of\nthe proper water and nutrients that it needs to be able to fulfill its genetic\npotential those farming duties would include just checking and removing weeds\nin your rows you can notice in our field we're pretty much weed free we have a\nreally clean field and this has really helped us allow all of the nutrients and\nwater to go straight to the plant instead of it being robbed by weeds and\nother types of things the other thing with weeds is you really don't want that\nin your biomass at the end of the season so it's really important to be able to\nkeep it clean field the other thing you want to stay on top of is watering and\ngiving the plants the fertilizer and the nutrients that they need throughout the\nseason obviously this is gonna be a little bit different in the beginning of\nthe season from the middle and towards the end of the season so in the\nbeginning the plants are small they're really not drinking a lot of water and\nthey don't need a lot of water but when it gets really hot in the middle of the\nsummer mid-july plants are large and they are drinking a lot of water seen to\nmake sure they're getting enough water at that point that they're getting the\nnutrients that they need sometime mid to late July the plan is going to transfer\nfrom the vegetative stage to the flowering stage and it's going to really\nstart focusing on producing flowers for the rest of the season and so you're\ngonna want to switch up your fertilizer to be able to help that out because the\nSun and the light schedule is telling the plant hey it's time to be able to\nbud and see you want your fertilizer and your nutrients to be able to follow that\nschedule that they are naturally getting from the sunlight when it comes to\nfertilization we fertilized straight through the drip tape right to the roots\nas well as a full-year feeding so at the beginning of the season when\nwe were full your feeling we just used a backpack sprayer and it was relatively\neasy to be able to walk the rose and spray the plants but as the plants got\nbigger you can imagine spraying a large plant like this is gonna take a lot of\ntime and to be able to do that it looks over 10 acres 12,000 plants it's gonna\ntake we figured it would probably take about 50 man-hours. So my partner\ndeveloped a new little mechanism and he was able to put sprayer on the back of a\nthree wheeler and be able to go up and down the rows and spray that way so that\nbrings up another point because we spaced our rows eight feet wide so that\nwe could drive a three or four wheeler down without any problems some people\ndon't like to do that they like to you know maximize their land we have a lot\nof land here and so we figured why not space the rows out really large so we\ncan drive an ATV up and down the rows so in a week or two we will be cutting and\ndrying the plants and we'll take a combine to be able to keep the really\nlight stuff and get rid of the stalks and stems so that we can have a real\nnice homogeneous biomass that we can send to the extraction facility to have\nthe oil extracted from these plants something that you'll definitely want to\nconsider before you decide to start farming hemp is the risk that's involved\nanytime you get into farming there's certain things that are out of your\ncontrol for instance this lasted about a month\nago we had a major major hail storm that swept through the region hail the size\nof gumballs and absolutely ravaged this field in many other fields around us you\ncan actually see some of the damage still on these leaves broke the stems\nbroke leaves and luckily it was about a month ago so the plant had just started\nflowering and after the hailstorm I think the plant gave all of its energy\nto producing the flowers we were fortunate because we still have\nsomething to show for it and it looks like this crop has not only survived but\nit's thrived but there are other farms in the region that lost everything they\nhad nothing but sticks and stems left in their fields so you definitely want to\nconsider the risk that's involved because there is a lot of risk in\nfarming and that's why I've created a couple resources for you the first one\nis a free pdf that is a hemp farming timeline and budget planner so on this\nPDF it'll go January through December and I'll tell you the things that you\nneed to be doing each month during that month and it'll also show you a per acre\nbudget so that you can plan your financing for your hemp farming all you\nhave to do to download that PDF for free is just click the link in the\ndescription and that will take you to a page where you can download the hemp\nfarming timeline and budget planner the other resource I want to offer you is\ncalled hen farming Academy hemp farming Academy is an online video course that\ntakes you step-by-step from field preparation all the way through harvest\nwhen it comes to a farming hemp I've partnered with farmer Tom Lauer Minh on\nthis project and farmer Tom's been growing cannabis and hemp for most of\nhis life and he brings a wealth of knowledge to this course so if you are\nplanning on farming hemp and you want some instructions and some help along\nthe way Hemp Farming Academy would be a great\nresource for you you can find it at HempFarmingAcademy.com or you can also\nclick the link that is in the description for that well thanks for\nwatching this video hopefully it's been helpful for you if you have any\nquestions or comments go ahead put those in the comments section below\nand I wish you a successful hen farming season.", "ttkaJWmlMqY": "hey yo farmer dre back at another beautiful day here on the farm but i want to thank everybody for stopping by if you haven't already go and hit that subscribe and go ahead and smash that like button if you guys enjoyed the video don't forget to turn on that notification icon so you guys can be notified whenever i upload a video so we are out here in the high tunnel or high tunnel number three as you guys saw yesterday we went ahead and finished beating all the post with val and adrian and we set trusses last night and today we are working with david and we're due there we're going to go ahead and put the hip boards on baseboards and start working on the purling pipes that's the goal for today if we get more done we're going to go ahead and continue working here we still got to finish you know putting the last bow up and all we still have a lot of work a couple days here of work solid of just uh us grinding away but anyways we're gonna go ahead and get started here with the hip board so we got the main man dave here he's helping us out today and then of course you got rad do he's the uh guy screwing everybody today and now yeah oh he's putting in the what he's called carriage ball carriage bolts there you go three inch what size bolts are these it doesn't matter anyways we'll bring up the straps here and then we will be good to go and then in between here we are putting these plates here they're just a two by two by four or whatever to buy i mean if you're using any kind of wood and we just go ahead and put this down the center put this metal part with some more screws and then we continue doing that and then whenever we are putting these we just get a clamp there put it on there and just continue on with the rest of them so we are using 24 foot two by fours or 20 you know these are 20 footers 20 foot two by fours so we only need five per side it makes our life a whole lot easier since they're so long you know less clamping on the other drops we've done they're 10 foot two by fours and it's a lot more work but these 20 footers are make our life a whole lot easier [Music] alrighty so the east baseboard is on and we're hit for hitboard these are all level now so i'm going to go ahead and start putting on the pruning pipe they're going to go ahead and start working on that headboard there but we went ahead and installed the uh end bow here so we go ahead and measure out put that last section there and we're going to do the same thing on that side there's a few other supports that come here on the end walls that we got to get figured out so i'm going to start working on that until these right dude david start working on this hip board and then we should be on a good track then i'm going to start working on the purling pipe so it's just a continuous process just trying to get it done all righty so just had lunch now we're gonna go ahead and continue the boys are gonna finish off that hip board there i'm gonna jump on the brownie here and work on that and hopefully get that center purling pipe finished and then we will continue on [Music] okay so a few hours has passed you were still you're working we got adrian he's working on the protein pipes i started but i don't really know what i'm doing up there with the pearling so uh he came out here he's the pearling we call him purling pipe adrian so uh on every single job he puts out the perlin pipes and radu is finishing up the uh the baseboard here they got that entire site done david is putting the uh textures through these brackets here so the uh bow won't come out anymore so once that takes you through there it locks the the pipe to the bow and everything all in one there and i'm coming through here now and putting up these um these knee braces so they connect the top of that w truss through that bracket to this side wall right here so it really helps out with the lotus let's say you get 12 inches of snow in missouri i don't think we'll ever get that i mean i'm never gonna say never but if that that really helps out with the down pressure and the knee braces actually help out quite a bit with the sturdiness of the tunnel itself so that's what i'm out here doing i went ahead and put them all up they're all dangling from that bolt there now i'm just coming along here putting a pipe strap and just strapping that that up there nicely so the entire frame other than the curtain pipe is up so we the pile is just right there we got the c channel left over there and that's that's all the framing so hopefully by tonight we'll get all the metal framing done or all the structure is going to be finished and then tomorrow hopefully we'll get the end walls up and i said by the end of week we should be ready to pull plastic so a full day out here with the boys we are getting it done so i'm gonna go ahead and continue on putting these knee braces on and then we'll go ahead and finish her up [Music] wow so looking back at what we did all day we did quite a bit today i'm not gonna lie it was uh you know we got the hustle in baseboards hip boards purlins are finished the hip boards or the hip uh braces knee braces so uh yeah tomorrow we're gonna go ahead and start working on the end walls and then we will see how long it takes us for that it's not too bad we got a poor concrete and whatnot but i'll take you guys along for the ride there so this is where i'm going to go ahead and end off the video for today if you guys haven't already go and hit that subscribe button go ahead and smash that like button because today's video don't forget i'm coming to you guys every single day until i hit 10k i want to say thanks for watching up to this point you guys have a good day we'll see you next time", "MM1JxCCUkqk": "hey guys welcome back to follow me with charlie today i'm back on the farm as you can see um just about to start scraping up and i've got drain blocks so there's a puddle there there's a dog that's dying stunning all this time cows um so yeah drain blocks here so where my foot goes so you can see that my foot is going in slightly by the way these are these fabulous bikini boots i did an early review uh and but sorry me these are them fantastic boots i did a review on they've lasted me about two to three months um maybe more but yeah i'll set you up you've watched me do the bats so yesterday um i did a video of the scraper trap and i haven't uploaded yet because these is going to be for when i go home um so i did so i did a few other videos of like the jcb back in the v-treader and voltra and zita's starting now i should probably put them all in one video i don't know whether to do it all in series or or what but uh i don't know so this video should be going live tonight the monday tuesday wednesday i should be it or no monday wednesday thursday and friday i should be uploading that's if i've got enough videos so yeah you want to do this for so if you didn't see flat like that and just scrape like that what i'm doing is basically just scraping all of this off all of them that's because our yard is sloped in some areas so over there it's like this it's like that and then all the way down like that so and that's why we don't have a box scraper that's why we have a curved one um yes we could um have a um we could we could have also has ropers if we had a big barn and a feed mixer look at that one three five doesn't she look good with a front weight blocker so because 135 is old um and the radiator as you said the lights aren't there because the cows right right so back where i was my phone right storage so i delete some stuff uh where was i oh yeah the ones revive we have put the from the front weight frame on it so these guys if i go too close to them can't kick they'll kick the they will kick the back of the oh whoops they will kick the back of the they will kick the front of the tractor and hit the lights off and hit the radiator so that is why we put the front weight frame on yes i am just using my foot because i'm lazy and i can't be asked to put my phone down oh bugger so yeah i i need i just forgot to do that so thanks for watching and i shall see you on the next video bye", "-gioVD_G06M": "aarti here for pot zero as you can see in September we were harvesting at the pot cereal plantation and everything was looking fantastic we had a beautiful crop and then something changed and then it hit on October 1st we got 10 inches of snow which complicated our harvest a lot your immediate impression was that it was like an iceberg dead ahead but as things unfolded we started to realize maybe it wasn't so bad and we started to dig colas out of the snow and they were beautiful and the terpenes seemed more intense as it unfolded we started to realize that not only were the terpenes enhanced but when our test results came back we were shocked to see that not only was our THC profiles extremely high in the mid to high 20s but our plants have exceptionally high levels of CBG CBG is the rarest and most valuable cannabinoid as it it's never present in large quantities and we're thrilled to have a bunch of it because it has amazing medical potential and at the same time it actually really enhances the recreational high of marijuana so fantastically what appeared to be an absolute disaster turns out to be the silver lining is that our crop was enhanced by extreme weather events that stress the plants into doing things that they normally don't do unbelievable it ain't warm enough", "-QIrp091UOo": "you hi everybody this video here it's going to be about indigo farms we went to the local farmers market and one of the ladies actually invited us out to her farm where you can come and you can buy fresh local produce and they've got a petting zoo and a

"welcome back we are in for a bumpy ride here everything's grown pretty great right now you know but of course just when you think everything's going great let's just check the radar real quick says we're only supposed to get a half inch but oh it broke up did it break up thank the Lord it's pouring right here bringing it about six inches right here right in that one spot that's great that's great we got about an inch it's been lightening like crazy you got a few spots of water out in the driveway guess there's like half and hail reported or something like you can kind of see where it's like white right there and it gets worse raining a lot harder up in that direction but yeah there's like half inch hail or something and like 40 mile an hour winds that went through just south of us point eight point eight so these are our sugar beads plan it yeah these ones we're playing with like April fourth [Music] before we got some rain and whatever whatnot look at this we have some drainage issues over here well this is actually like disco that's very low well yeah we're gonna fill this in eventually we're just waiting to get some stone I guess I don't know you only got point eight inches of rain we're happy we didn't get any more because we can start planning dry beans maybe later this week if it doesn't rain it's the sweet I just sprayed for these weeds and they didn't die no these are probably new ones honestly if I just sprayed for fun fun I just sprayed a fungicide on these beets for like rot and whatever other diseases getting the beet but yeah these are looking pretty good we luckily escaped some hail yesterday that was in the storm because hail really liked [Music] well this is two together oh this is very small all right so instead of growing the beat they have to like replace the leaves so when the leaves get hurt but obviously it like stops the growth of the beat yeah when the beats are are the leaves are injured they're more likely to get diseases and yeah that's just bad because we don't want disease this we want tonnage in beats the more tonnes you have the more you get paid so obviously we want some good tonnes here and we're getting off to a good start here look at these suckers look at that rut look at that right Wow all right I'm just gonna I feel like this beat will grow more with only one so I'm just gonna keep this out let's go check out the corn the corn is also off to a good start here on our farm zero sugar beets corn wheat soybeans and dry beans dry beans are the only thing that we don't have planted yet they're usually planted like mid to mid June they're usually like get planted a little bit earlier you can go a little bit later no big deal last year there was a flood and you know we didn't get a plane until very late June and they ended up being alright so yeah hopefully it doesn't rain later this week and we'll get some driving started for you there's water laying out in the field I think it's just where it's compacted compacted areas don't drain as good they just don't sir core and this is the first field of corn we planted I feel like it's not very big it's just growing pretty slow I'm not sure what day this these are playing it Oh actually I might okay okay we think you have been playing it like May seventh or ninth or somewhere in between there our planner did a pretty good job here Oh as I say that there's a skip there but all these like pretty good spacings a little bit off but it looks good here lies our wheat Oh see see it coming out here I think that's a good thing I'll have to get in and spray it for head scab think a lot of people don't know this apparently they think that's like bad like that it's bent like this but apparently that's like how they come out of the stalk here see there's a bunch like that so your wheat looks like this it's fine it's fine that looks like it hurts heavily and was planted a little bit later so like all these are coming out sooner soon enough we'll be harvesting some wheat it's probably gonna be like mid early to mid July we always go up north for the fourth of July and we're always like rushing home on the fourth or fifth like day after July for fourth of July see if we can harvest some wheat has to be like dry enough to harvest it hopefully have a good year sometimes like if it keeps raining on the wheat and we don't get get it harvested it'll sprout like this seeds itself will sprout and like lower the quality of the grain so we don't want that there's a lot of diseases armyworms or whatever smell this Wow this down so we don't want none of that yeah hopefully our wheat harvested is a success well we got a we got a while yet we got to plant some beans first then we can worry about that get the combine oh gosh feel like it's happening it's so quick like it's RT June what second it's crazy it's dark over there there's a little shower going through here's our soybeans over here we playing it on it that we sprayed and killed all the sand in the field stop it from blowing big blows and all and here's a very wet spot in this field acres we'll just go out here and check them somewhere what are these what are those these winds still aren't rolled we roll them when they're like a little bit bigger like this big so we did roll one field I'm not sure why we decided to roll one field and not these code if like look how spaced out there they're all playing into the same trench so what the heck just come out wherever you want no we don't really grow that much soybeans are that many soybeans we usually just don't grow them because they grow better if you have like feels like a history of growing soybeans in that field because it has to like build up we're gonna go with inoculate so like we don't have really have a history of growing soybeans on our land we actually like acquired some land that like the grower grew soybeans so it kind of has like what soybeans need I think it just like gets them off to a better start whatever they need to get growing good so and we just don't have that so this ground like we just started to rent and has history of soybeans so that's why we decided to put soybeans here because we have grown soybeans on like some over other land but it doesn't get that good of yields [Music] all right so let's it basically for today's video I just wanted to get out and do something cuz the past few days are the past few it's more like a week we it's just been like what we couldn't really do anything I've been spraying beets with a little like sprayer pull behind sprayer we have for our Ranger and you have to really be paying attention so if we paying attention a lot when you're sprayed because we have like a 90 foot boom is in ninety and the tips will like swing we put drop nozzles on so it would be like right over the sugar beet the row of sugar beets get on the leaves because that's where we want it so we don't have like you know of gauge wheels on them so like the wings can just come down and hit the ground and obviously you don't want that Oh brakes like the tips off or whatever I've hit I hit the ground multiple times yesterday and I'm like sitting on the controls for the wings because our sensors for like the auto boom don't work of course so I was just like I really shouldn't be holding down there so anyway I'm like controlling it with my just like by hand up and down like but if I see it about to dive into the ground I just like heat it up raise the wing a little bit and that's fine but so like I couldn't really make a video I could have but could I up I mean I could have but it would went hard cuz I was spraying and I don't want to like mess up so yeah kind of important I don't know waste our money it's not worth it's not worth recording so that's what we've been doing waiting for you can roll our soybeans roll our dry beans we need a planner driving super slow yeah that brain went that direction not at not at us so that's good that's a good thing so yes oh I forgot I did shout out of the days for like last year so we're gonna do that again because I don't know it's kind of fun and today's shout out of the day is just in case like just in case it's it's a good it's a cool name man it's a very cool name so but thanks for watching if you're not subscribed already hit subscribe I'll be farming out here for many years to come so if you want to join the farm fam go ahead and we'll be back at it hopefully this week with some dry bean plantain all right that's it see you next time make sure you like this video - oh we got a lot of likes on my last video - this like swimmer that all right the reverse out of here [Music] my world's best backwards driver", "AZTUd5OwZgA": "oh good morning everyone um i woke up really early actually woke up at six o'clock i just i went down to the store picked up a shipment of seed i talked to the bank a little bit just to get a little bit alone because we were really struggling on money uh we had to pay and we bought a new trailer too [Music] as you'll all see but um tap on the quad here so i hope you guys enjoyed the last video um i sure did i sure enjoyed making the last video um i just love this phone honestly and i hope you guys do too so we're driving up to the farm here kind of since i have a forward i can kind of skip but you can see we got to see right here and we gotta plant it's the fourth day already and it's 48 degrees that's quite nice where should i park i'll park over here so i'm kind of out of the way you know you know you on that know door okay justin would say about that things skinny but we're see any so it doesn't matter so hop in the case you hopefully okay so apparently we had to beat that one i don't think i'm gonna put fertilizer in this one here and there we go let's drive over here so this thing doesn't hold anymore so the reason okay so i'm gonna drive right here we gotta put some uh air in the tires of the case um or just this one front tire right [Applause] here there we go so the back players i checked they should be alright maybe soon we might want to put it in but for right now i think we're doing all right take this slowly around here so yeah it's the fourth day [Music] i gotta i want to get the cord in the ground right now to be quite honest um hopefully this case can pull it or else i can put the john deere on it but i prefer just to have a case pull it um but yeah so we got an absolutely megatron kill though we're pleased that we can even fit this gate barely so like i said this is hopefully this case can pull it max speed oh yeah it works perfectly you know it gets so we have a big field to plant a small plant a really big field in fact a very small planter which is all right um not ideal this field is actually massive like massive and if you really look at it i mean yeah and this field's pretty big too i mean we have pretty big fields but that's why i really wanted to get started early so we didn't have problems in the future because i don't really want to be planting in the middle of winter um that's not an idea and like i said it's snow two days ago so you don't know what's gonna happen here in indiana which is amazing um really amazing okay let's just turn this corner in here careful make sure not missing too much the outside rows don't matter as much um headlands just so we can turn around and i'll probably have my brother my brother is out here um he'll probably hop in here and help us do the middle half of his field but i want to get a good outlining for him because he of course he's not the best he's actually never really worked on the farm i've kind of taught him how to drive character so um and all that so yeah um okay okay i was just let's get in the mail um from walking back so we got my brother going on that field down there as you can see um yep so i was just walking back to the farm check the mail you know pay the gotta get the bills so another thing that on the objective is that international we got to get that thing fixed um first of all uh its tires are flat like really flat um the thing barrel i mean the thing starts okay first of all let's attach this thing but there you go okay sure so i don't i don't i don't really want to like turn off this because i don't know if i'm going to get it started that one pretty good that one okay there we go [Applause] now let's hop back in it slowly go in here so we got to fix the oil filters and all that stuff for sure because that stuff is probably around we probably got to change deal on it but i mean this thing it probably has been random 15 years the way it looks i mean it's very clean but yeah okay so we got the oil filters over here let's just change these things get that [Music] um should be it but i gotta still order some more parts for it so yeah shut up so another thing i want to kind of bag this trailer up out of the way oh my god i did not hit that no like this truck looks honestly rare dude which kind of surprises me but yeah so another thing i kind of want to check out is this truck engine like this thing is old can we try to everything's like turning and stuff just good but there's no way this oil itself is good like there's no way people actually drive this a lot just take it for a spin hopefully i won't go on like any public highways yet but i'll take it on this road right here that road there's daryl did he miss daryl missile bro oh i'll just have to go okay dang daryl messing everything up oh that's probably my fault i should have known another one my brother's actually moving hopefully right here he might go down the street you know we're trying to figure stuff out remove the advice from the move right here you know store stuff right here shifter in the gear shifter here one more time oh i always just kill the bird that's right finally here come on get up this road come on come on here we go that works pretty well i'm happy with it hopefully we all the way oh yeah okay that works perfect actually i i really like that uh [Music] probably should run down to that one field and then i'll probably end off this video uh i kind of want to show you one of our properties that i that was already tilled out i kind of bought it for a really low price oh it's kind of holy crap we got to be way carefully this thing is wicked okay oh shoot i bought this for a really cheap price honest last night it's like 25 acres baby uh it's pretty small i mean that's like 50 over there i mean we'll be oh like 140 acres stuff like that i don't even know but this adds on to that which is nice i mean we don't have oh shoot i suck at driving this quad still i'm still getting used to this trail um we don't take jackets on this we take tractors on the big road but four wheelers and gators and i've even driven a truck down here to go check it out didn't really know was this skinny but i have a nice trail out here almost there straight up here it's right here you look at this i mean it's a decent property good hunting lander on it and stuff like that but yeah that's pretty much it for the video i'm pretty tired i'm sure you are for watching me because i'm pretty tired and there's really stuff that you know yeah okay foreign", "C3Uw4dYty0I": "as Golden Triangle is known for its world-class green production for the last two years there's more green next to the fields of golden wheat this fall as some farmers are planting industrial hemp the Montana AG networks Lane Northland has more it's true from 500 acres last year to 14,000 acres just in state of Montana and we can do a lot of different things with it industrial hemp is an emerging crop in Montana and is growing in popularity through a pilot program sponsored by the Montana Department of Agriculture the crop is legal to grow under certain conditions unlike marijuana which is still illegal under federal laws industrial hemp has been given a narrow legal approval under the 2014 farm bill so CBD is what makes the difference between marijuana and hemp hemp grows the CBD where marijuana grows the THC well with that there's no psychedelic effect by using hemp where marijuana you get the THC high and that's that's pretty much the main misconception with it until the early part of the 20th century farmers across the nation grew hemp before 1930 1940 every farmer had to grow hemp it was ordered by the government that every farmer had to grow a certain amount of acres until some lobbying groups from the paper company and newspapers they saw it as a competitor so they started doing the reefer madness and all that and put him with marijuana for farmers like Colby Johnson diversifying the crops he plants helps reduce risk now the farmer I love to grow different things you know it's got to keep farming exciting and with low commodity prices it's a perfect opportunity for him to come into play here obviously it grows really well here and obviously we have a lot of acres to grow it so if we can build a market create a market place we can help out farmers and help out Montana just like other oil seed crops growing in Montana hemp is harvested with a combine while the crop is still green with a moisture of 11 to 17 percent so yeah there's a few different ways to harvest it for different different kinds of oils so when you harvest it for the grain it's just like any other oil seed canola or flax or whatever and so you can just it just gets crushed and that's where you get the hemp seed oil and that goes into foods and topical creams and stuff like that other products made from hemp include fiber paper fabric biodegradable plastics and more Montana's low humidity paired with experienced farmers may lead to more acres planted in the state with manufacturing facilities to follow reporting near Conrad Montana I'm Leigh nordland MTN news currently farmers much must purchase their hemp seed from Canada with the oversight of the Montana Department of Agriculture the 2018 farm bill if passed by Congress will include legislation to remove all remaining barriers to grow and research industrial hemp across the United States", "0JjHvCxQCQ4": "what's going on everybody endo grows here help everybody's having a wonderful wonderful day today's video was submitted a video idea for reviewer like you so thank you so much to everybody and thank you you know who you are so it's gonna be all some tips and tricks on how to grow like a pro some things I do and some things I use if you're new to the channel this is what we do we grow we do rosin press reviews we do rather than squishing you can see all this on my page go check it out I have all these grows everything you see here go check it out give me a subscribe you know hit the little subscription button down below thank you so much if you want to support the channel watch the video all the way through give me a like and thumbs up I can't fit all the tips and tricks in the one video so that's how I'm gonna engage on whether or not I want to keep doing this one or not so if you really want to see some more of this give me some likes give me some comments down below thank you I'll get right into we're gonna go start out in veg and work our way through flour so a first tip I'm going to use is get some make host microbes definitely check them out I have a few videos highlighting them really really beneficial stuff for your root system and bigger roots bigger fruits right that's what I always like to say a lot of people you know so definitely do that badge and flour super crazy important have really good airflow and I mean just in general about temps you want to mimic outside like their plants that came from outside so mimic outside you want to have my go-to temps for my veg tank it is like 70 to 85 degrees 70 is my low 85 is my high you don't have to worry about it as much and badge because they like to be warm don't overwater how I gauge how I need the water is I'll pretty much like put my plants my soil water and I'll let him dry out to the point that they start to droop and that's when I start to get my idea of how light my buckets are and I hold my buckets up and if I remember that day you know and like oh my [ __ ] it's pretty light like that day then that's when I water so that's how I decide on how I'm gonna water training there's all sorts of different ways to do it low stress trainings my go-to method but you can do a bunch of different ways by five by five as you can see I don't need to know trellis Nets I still have a great canopy everything's pretty even everything's only been talked to one time and they're so uh just do training and I train my plants in a funny way I like had him every single day I go in there and I just pet him trying to be rough with them been immune to the ways that I want them direction I want them to start growing and it's really beneficial for a lot of reasons you can get more tops that way as you can see I have crazy tops all over my tent but I've only topped those plants one time and it's just because of training you can also decide how a higher canopy is with that and the reason I don't really use nets and stuff because I can get really nice canopy without it and I can still move my fence around when I go to defoliate and everything I don't have that big a problem so you know definitely important to train the plants the way you want them it helps you also see things that might be going on I started really small plant pots and I worked my way up and every time I change my pots like when I go to transplant I give a good flush every single time get all that old nutrients out start with a nice new base I run sixty forty sixty percent Coco forty percent like Fox Farm soil and that's just for you know my personal preference and then so every time you also transplant throw something that make us him they're super good stuff can't stress it enough do your research on it I keep my lights in bed anywhere between 12 and 14 inches away side run cobs and LEDs so if you're running HPS you know you want to be definitely a lot further away so that's my go-to for my light setup you want to see like what stuff I have in my real room go check out my channel and I highlight everything I'm running in my 5 by 5 on one of those videos so we'll go into flour times now super-important again good airflow definitely you need good airflow I can't stress it enough through your whole canopy top and bottom and then I also start dropping my temps back when I'm in flower I like to drop them back you know just like outside so like just not quite as cool as outside but I usually like to go back my preferred range is 65 to 75 that's another huge thing is a tip make sure that try as closer you as hard as you can to keep your temperature within 10 degrees like so you don't want your temperature to much more than 10 degrees off from your high and your low so I usually like to do 65 to 75 ID foliate week 1 week 3 so right when I throw them in there I'll give them week D fully at once and that's just take all your big families and all that stuff off it's good for different like reasons like light penetration and get more light down to those smaller bud sides it also helps with the air flow back again so I'll do that week 1 week 3 there pretty much most strains are done stretching by that time almost done stretching by the time so I'll go through and the more you do fully there's a big reason why you do it it's innocent instead of the plant using all the energy for that to keep those leaves alive and keep growing new leaves those ones it takes all that energy that you take all those leaves off and it just puts all of the butts all that extra energy that would have been used to grow those leaves is now all gonna go to blood production which is what we're all looking for anyways right so that's my tips on that I didn't defoliate this time as good as I really wanted to as you can see but it's still getting the job done my lights in this setup I like to you run 14 to 16 inches away from the top of my canopy in those terms nutrients you don't want to over water your or over water or over feed the plants either because if you're starting to get like you know follow your feed schedule if you want to know what I use go ahead and reach out let me know I will tell you everybody runs different stuff so so follow your feed schedule but if you're noticing when you burn tips and stuff late kind of take it back and not flush your plants like so that's a good tip there and you don't know everything is different so do that flush your plants lay back on your nutrients a little bit if you're noticing burn tips and stuff because you don't want to get it build up in there and stop production pretty much no go I don't like my relative humidity going and you we're past 55 when I'm in flower just you start buying more risks of bud rot and all that stuff so really nice another important thing is that is your air flow I run my fan at nighttime to a little heater and humidifier in my room so do that and then flushing super important at the end especially if you're in soil and another tip about like in terms of like seeing burn tips and stuff like that is when you're in the soil and stuff like that here's a really good pro tip that a lot of people don't know starting out is when you're in soil like what you're noticing now happened days ago like a week ago it's not like hydro where it's like super noticeable right away and you can fix it right away so it's also gonna take that week to fix it and see corrections so don't go crazy and cause another problem trying to fix one problem but that's a good tip there flushing I usually start like three weeks before I know I'm gonna take them down I'm checking my trichomes and it's gonna help you through flavors and everything like that and your spoke quality I wanted to get my video done to show my cure tips and stuff but that'll come next weekend so if you're looking for that that's when that's going to be coming out I had to do this whole video on my phone because my Wi-Fi is out at home right now so I can't upload that video so that's why I'm doing this one today instead but yeah I hope this really helps somebody and when I'm flushing you know I'm starting three weeks before I'm flushing down to like 200 ppm is 100 ppm is because also if you ever test or notice like after you flush you'll be getting that reading but if you wait a couple days and try test your run off again you'll notice that your ppm rose again because your soils coming coming back to life so I like take a real low three weeks before 100 ppm is as close as I possibly can to my tap water and then I just give nothing but water after that Mike and I went doing that flush I use pH water after that I don't use anything so I hope that really really helps everybody have a wonderful wonderful day any more questions you know go ahead and reach out to me if you knew please subscribe I hope you enjoyed the video go check out my page I have all sorts of things you can find me on Instagram as well I'm pretty active there so I hope you all have a wonderful day I hope this helps somebody if it did give me a thumbs up make sure to share I hope you just all have wonderful day thank you", "a4T4i05u_qg": "smoke is also having an impact on a local crop which relies on adequate sunlight NBC 5's Emily Beale explains at Butte Creek Farms an Eagle Point marijuana spans the land they have 20,000 marijuana plants growing usually the peak time for those marijuana plants to blossom is in the summer sunshine here in the Rogue Valley but with the Sun almost completely covered by smoke from fires across Southern Oregon it's affecting how their crop is being grown and they estimate the financial damage could be huge total financial hit could be well over a million dollars for a farm of this size Butte Creek Farms opened just over a year ago and is already one of the biggest marijuana farms in the entire state their decision to be an outdoor farm as opposed to a greenhouse farm was intentional that's why we're an outdoor farm as we get the free sunshine and they rely on that free sunshine to keep their business afloat they need that spectrum to get all those nutrients to continue to grow and flourish like we want them to but the lack of Sun from the thick smoke is affecting the plants growth is what helps the buds grow bigger getting all this spectrum from the Sun we're missing out on so much of that right now that is really causing a damper in the plants growth cycle so the main visible effect is that they're not as large as they should be so for example this should be bigger right now yes but is Butte creeks biggest moneymaker a pound of it can cost up to twelve hundred dollars multiply that by the bud they get from each of their twenty thousand plants and the potential financial loss could be massive in Eagle Point Emily Beale nbc5 news Slauson says despite being smaller their first harvest potency and quality was normal however now the ash lack of Sun and humidity are causing mold to form on some plants he's hoping it won't impact their next round of tests", "5mDPvqw5_FA": "hi guys this is yeah i'm in a farm here in one of my mentor in

the likes so what they just did is they applied the manual into the soil and then what they spray is an insecticide can use any of the caterpillar attack only on the israeli fertilizer you can see the crops are looking ld they are looking odd ld in little i think the the stand here shouldn't be more than 500 or 300 stand of switch con the way i'm seeing it though i didn't count anyway so you can see you can apply and venture into switch on what provided you before you venture into swiss consultant is one of the creative business in agri business but before is if you venture please and please

and help each other and I think that regenerative cannabis has a lot of potential to do that and we really feel like that that's one of our main goals of why we do what we do we want to eat clean food smoke clean weed and the diverse and sort of small farmer farming practices that are happening to is sort of what we need to see throughout agriculture as well these small family farms and people being able to sustain themselves on the land is really important the land wants us to interact with it and to listen to it and imitate what it's doing but then bring it beyond in our ability to try to create a system that's self-sustaining I can't really see not having animals be a part of the farm with merino sheep for wool and meat we have meat birds that go to farmers market we know that every time we have to take some fertility from off farm that there's a missing link in what we're doing that we can improve on that we making bone broth after we're done with the bones now we're crushing the bones and now we have bone meal so we just constantly trying to figure out how to close the loop the animals I think are sort of how we're able to make everything possible the way we want to because they're able to turn this stuff into gold and I just love watching them eat the hay and I just always in such awe that they're able to transform that material into something that nurtures the land so much they're just made to be with each other the plant and animal components we're making kimchi we're getting cabbage from a local farm and then we got a bunch of carrots from our farm peppers from our farm as well and just mixing them all together with some salt and a little water and let the magic happen and hopefully those will be sold at farmer's market and our local co-op I feel like I wish we live in a society we didn't have to make money to survive but that is where we live and so anytime I get a chance to do things without having to make money is what really feeds our soul and I think what really feels good I would give away all the food that we grow but I just can't do that and so when there's opportunities and things to help out the community to help with the library or help cook food for a fundraiser that's what feels so good yeah we want to live in community so we find ways to make community happen", "8WmwL5nrt1M": "so you don't put it don't put it in this one okay all right all right we're both really interested in taking cannabis to a place it's never been we're not aware of any credentialed researchers that have worked on these pests in this area and so we're quite interested in in doing something that has been done before we have 32 organic acres here's dill we're beats romaine lettuce mustard green here's something kind of interesting edible flowers we grow specialty crops on our farm and we also have a agricultural research company and our objective is to work on control control mechanisms or control strategies for for cannabis cannabis is closely related to hops and hops suffers from a number of diseases and insects and most of those attack cannabis as well this is a researchers dream to have an indoor research trial and imagine of all the variables that you can control here are some produce Wow they've grown a lot we currently do research on most of the pests that are pests of cannabis so it'll be relatively familiar one for us still have to turn you still have to do this because this is what's going to pay the bills for a while and even if we're well established in the cannabis deal and then even after that we still have to do research on this other stuff can't neglect the rest of the farm if we did then we just have a building the size of the lab over there nothing else just sell the rest of the phone because that's all you need for cannabis", "14wocXSB9dI": "[Music] good morning quick update uh in the greenhouse today uh let's see three days after i planted as you can see um we're sweating inside

bachelor buttons and kind of hard to hold this and show you but uh yeah we've got some growth already only a few days in that's pretty cool huh and then if you come over here to my barrels as you can see we've got uh plastic over them checking the soil temperature today it's uh nine o'clock in the morning so we have a pretty solid 60 degree temp we've got radishes in this first bed and i don't believe oh yeah i do we have growth in here as you can see right by this little guy right there and then over here we've got quite a bit this is all lettuce in this one as you can see we've got good growth it's coming on coming on the first stuff of 2021. cool all right hey this is just a quick update it's very cloudy very nasty outside rained yesterday pretty dang heavy we had a lot of lakes a

running by growing and selling organic vegetables free kind of the beginning of the bones of organic you know produce and food so the farm was was good I'd grown up you know growing vegetables you know family gardens and canning so it just kind of fits his dad stole part of their land years ago once corn prices to the nosedive but Wallace a father of three is determined to make the acres he has left profitable I feel like it's my responsibility to try to make sure that the next generation has a possibility of of keeping the farm bill and of keeping the family on the farm and and you know just enjoying living in the country like now that lawmakers have cleared the way he's ready to take a leap of faith on a new plant him it's a sister crop of marijuana that has none of the high like effects if the governor signs on he plans to grow it why anything that can be made out of wood can be made out of this product almost anything out of plastic can be made out of this product from cosmetics to paper to food products the hip plant can almost do it all and not only is it good for the environment but experts say it's a potential 2 billion dollar industry it can be huge I mean it could be really big but because of his close ties to pot it gets a bad rep outlawed since the 40s and it's considered a controlled substance by the US some in law enforcement say that's how it should

don't know how much she'll be on it but we'll get started we're gonna start mixing our dirt and getting our plants ready and get them planted so we'll have fresh coffee and broccoli put in the garden this year we do have new containers that we'll use for our vegetables we'll probably use these flowers i think it's raining and i hate to say it but we're liable to have stuff come up that's the seeds from last year that didn't come up we'll just have to wait and see i said it's gonna this dirt's gonna be used for flowers a zinnia with a broccoli yeah might get some broccoli with it cauliflower and sunflower i might get a weird mix of plant okay okay [Music] chasers and we're gonna start our coffee it's kind of our first time trying stuff from seed we normally always fire plants so we may not be doing this quite right but this this is the way we're going to try it this year and see if it works big chase oops now we're going to put our groin mix in make one of those bowls i guess i should have followed you instead of turning the other way yeah it's learning experience smaller yeah first tray ready we're going to start with our cauliflower which is a hybrid snow crown and probably plant two per tray and thin them out if they all come up i'm trying to trade all right now that we've got them all planted and covered up in this tray i'm going to spray it with some water and some just miracle bro to dampen the soil and we have noticed that this greenhouse here holds a lot of moisture and condensation right now so we're hoping we won't have to water as often but then again we'll come out and check them because they are in trays and trays have a tendency to dry out a lot quicker than being in the ground all right right now we're going to plant some broccoli uh and see how it does so basically we did the same thing we had some extra potting mixes left that's what i'm using just to kind of half fill it and then we have some starting uh mix that we put on the top so that's what we're starting so again with the broccoli we'll probably put one to two seeds in each one and then thin them out and we transplant and if they come up okay we oh sorry we got our first plants planted and we'll wait we got our cauliflower our broccoli and my wife wanted to try robbie we'll see how they do we'll be planting more throughout the year and probably in the summer for some fall plants and like i said this is our first greenhouse that we've actually tried to start our plants in normally we just buy the plants but they're getting harder and harder to find seeds are kind of hard to find right now but we do have grow lights in case we need them but we don't think we're going to need them right now for these plants and we also got heat but it's starting to warm up now still cold but we'll uh turn that on as we need and keep an eye on the temperature and uh hope everything turns out well and we'll keep you updated thanks for watching bye", "0GA0ZYotkW0": "20 years at the helm Anna he burped oligarchs the he'll saw the collapse of the ruble fought conflicts on multiple fronts and obviously out lasting nearly all other major world leaders but three themes that are really worth highlighting potentially be brought up in questions today I want to discuss energy one that brings you 2005 he signs that Nord Stream deal with Germany and of course now we're just weeks away from completing the second gas pipeline polemic Rauf that RPC calls him the world's energy czar no wonder why he spent tens of billions of dollars new pipelines bringing Russia's main export gas key markets in Europe and recently we saw as well in China then of course 2014 crucial for Russia the annexation of Crimea that really shot sent shockwaves post-world war two order for the onslaught of sanctions from the West and that helped send the ruble crashing and then finally in very recent times Russia being accused of meddling in the u.s. election which by now few American leaders other than President Donald Trump on occasion dispute so you can expect a lot of questions around these sanctions energy election meddling but I'm interested as well is what he has to say for his promise that he made last year at this exact event Putin said that Russia will grow 1.8% but Bloomberg survey says in reality this isn't even likely to exceed 1.3 percent and then IMF says his target the government's target 4 + 3 percent of the next few years is just out of reach the question then becomes is how much will the economics of the Russian state way on his popularity especially as the marks these 20 years in power", "oGduQADCTnc": "hi I'm Amanda Bora I'm a policy analyst with the recreational marijuana program here at LCCC and I just want to give you an overview today of the current rules that are in place that were effective in the beginning of January of this year and then the rules that are going to be coming into play the summer through a rulemaking process due to 2018 legislation so I want to start with the micro tear processing so the rules that went into a place allow for a micro to your producer to do limited concentrate production and so that means they can use water or they can use a mechanical mechanism for the concentrate production to be able to do this you would just apply it on our website we have a form for the micro to your processing and you would go ahead and fill that out send it into the address of the form specifies and then wait until you hear back from our agency to be able to actually go ahead and start doing that limited processing so this has been available since January at this point in time we don't have any micro to your producers that have taken advantage of it but it is something that's available so everybody should know that that forms up if you're something that you're interested in as a micro tier in mature canopy so for new applications that are being licensed after April 1st or for people that are coming up for their renewal app after April 1st you'll have to designate an immature canopy area so prior to this you were able to have unlimited in mature canopy now you'll have to have an actual area specified with your mature canopy one thing to keep in mind is when you let's use the example of 10,000 square feet of mature canopy if you wanted to have two stacks of that you could have five thousand square feet of mature flowering plants and on top of it you could have another 5,000 square feet of mature flowering plants and that would equal your ten thousand for the immature canopy it's going to be different than that if you had five thousand square feet of mature in mature plants and then you wanted another stack on top of that of immature plants it would still be about 5,000 so it's the footprint for the image where plants so you're still able to have quite a few immature plants and stay within those limits and if by chance that you need more than is allowable you can apply for the propagation endorsement those forms are also available on the website and that would allow you to be more of like a nursery type set up where you would be able to sell immature plants to other producers wholesalers and retailers one of the things that did change finally got put into rule about every legislative session and there's been something on the law that said that LCC licensed producer can produce for medical patients and it keeps changing so every time we get the rule into place it's basically not effective anymore well finally we have a rule in place that is effective we do I heard last week we had one inspection so somebody is actually taking advantage of this rule at this point what this allows you to do is grow an additional 10% on top of your canopy for medical medically designated canopy you have to give 75 percent of the annual yield to patients and 25 percent of the annual yield can be transferred into a processor or a wholesale or a retailer and so really the point of this is to be producing marijuana for patients there are some limits to the amount that can be given at one point in time so one point in time you could give a patient 24 ounces of usable marijuana and then you give them that same patient three pounds over a year and metric we'll talk later about the external transfers and how this is trapped in metric but it is all trapped in metric and when it goes out to a patient it would be transferred out to a patient associated with a patient number and so this will allow you if you were a medical grower or transferred to recreational and you still want to provide for patients maybe that you used to grow for they don't designate you as a grower you're just able to do that for them oh and one more thing I would like to say about that is that a lot of people ask like how do we know what our annual yields going to be and so I just like to say if you're planning on doing this to really err on the side of safety keep in mind your additional canopy is for patients and so you'd want to be giving a majority of each of your harvest to the patients to make sure that actually 75% of it annual yield is going to them start up inventory so we're going to be doing rulemaking in this summer talking about the start up inventory currently when you're licensed you have 90 days as a producer to be able to receive your start up inventory from anywhere within the state so that would be you know your clones your seeds your immature plants things like that that rule is set to expire the Commission realizes that genetics is a concern within the industry and being able to get new genetics in and be able to actually make sure that you'll be able to grow the kind of plants you want and so we'll be holding a rules advisory committee this summer to address this issue and to see if it is something that the industry believes needs to be extended how it needs to be extended and then in what areas you know if it's something maybe possibly just seeds should be allowed to be let in after the 90 days or something like that and so while I'm talking a lot of my slides are going to be about rulemaking and the process and so right here I'll just go ahead and say since this one will come up first what we do is we have rules Advisory Committee and they'll go over rule language available to discuss changes to the rules and what will work and what won't work then we have a public comment period and so we have it where you can comment have a comment in person at the olcc or you can write in with your public comment and so when these rules come out is really important that you have take a chance to read them because they're going to affect your basically your businesses and if you see something that you don't agree with rather than just writing in I don't like that or that doesn't work for me it's very very helpful if when you write in you say you know this wouldn't work for my business because of this and I think a better option would be this or this may work better for the industry to actually give some sort of idea on how the problem can be fixed rather than just saying that is something you don't agree with is much more helpful to us as an agency and staff because if we get one in that says we don't like it we're like okay next you know unless a lot of people say they don't like it but it's really helpful to know like what people believe actually would be a good answer all right so another big change is processing for patients so 2017 legislation and then our rules that were in effect in January allows an olcc processor to take in product from patients process it and then give it back to the patients so that would come in obviously from the patient as an external transfer through metric so it's the in metric walls in your processing facility you'll be able to process it have it tested and then you could actually give that back to the patient and it would be an external transfer again when it goes back to the patient so it's still tracked while it's inside the license system there are limits to this however and so for example and extract you could only take in 24 ounces of usable at one time from a patient and you could only give them back one ounce of extract at a time and then there's also annual limits they're all spelled out in the rules what those limits are exactly and the thing to keep in mind if you're thinking about doing this is rule allows you to take in products from multiple patients at once make possibly do a run and then be able to give that you know let's say extract back to the patients based on the amount that they've given you so you don't have to do like really small runs for one patient at a time you could but it allows for a larger run if that's something you're interested in and like the other like the micro tear and the other forms you'll be able to apply for this online it's just an additional endorsement for your process or license so it's nothing that it would take a brand-new application processing industrial hem so this is kind of a big change there happens people that will apply for this endorsement what this allows is a no LCC processor to take in hemp flour and concentrate or extract from an Oda hemp grower handler that has a no LCC hemp certificate and be able to process that product so it only comes in at the processor level and then the processor actually has to process it before moving it forward into the supply chain and then the next slide is going to talk a little bit more about the rules the one thing to really keep in mind with the hemp though is once it comes in it doesn't go back out again so it's not like processing for a patient when you can give it back to the patient when the hemp grow or handler decides that they want a product to go in the olcc market once it comes in it stays in until it goes to the retail and it soul to a consumer so that's being processed at the processor level it needs to be tested to verify that it has no more than 5% THC so if you're receiving flower material in and you're processing it into an extract or concentrate that extract or concentrate has to be tested for potency before it's transferred again if you're a processor and you're receiving concentrator extract from an Oda handler and that comes into your facility you need to have the potency testing done before anything else has done to it just to verify that it actually is industrial hemp and it's not marijuana and so some people do think that the testing may be a little bit redundant but reasonably speaking with a law change to allow this to happen we wanted to make sure that there was extra potency testing done at this level just to make sure that we weren't having unlicensed growers transfer marijuana in as hemp and so this shows that at least at the concentrate extract level it's below 0.5% THC so also with this after you have the potency testing done you can then if you would like let's say for example you have a hemp extract and a marijuana extract the processor then could mix the two together once they're mixed it's considered marijuana so if by chance you were to add any marijuana to the hemp after the has been tested it automatically turns it into a marijuana item its entered as a marijuana item in metric when it makes it to retail its taxed and it's listed as a marijuana item if you keep it solely industrial hemp derived and you don't add any marijuana to it it's item type in metric is hemp it's transferred to be lets say a retail store and it's items type is still hemp and it's not taxed as marijuana would be so it's something you want to keep in mind and if there's questions at the end I can definitely take those so a little bit more about the hemp it's probably more of the changes that have happened this year at an olcc retail store they were allowed in the past last year they were allowed to take in hemp items you know directly from basically anybody who was making them in Oregon they didn't need to come through the supply chain it had to be packaged and tested and labeled accordingly and so now that the hemp has a way in to the license system it can't come from just out from anybody anymore it has to come from a process of an olcc processor to a wholesaler processor to a retailer the stories that had those products had until April first to sell them down so this is just kind of like a reminder you know this is its past April first so those products should no longer be in the retail stores any item that's in an o LT LCC retail store should be in metric should be listed as a hemp item and it should have been received from within the license system also another one of the big reach retail changes was licensed retail to retail for a product this only applies to businesses that have 100% the same financial interest the same ownership so if you have two retail stores that have identical ownership including people with financial interest then you would be able to transfer from one retail store to another retail store otherwise this would not apply and then if you have questions about you know if you're really close and you have a question about how much is identical then you would want to send those into licensing and we can look at your specific example to see if you fit in or not so this is probably gonna be one of the biggest changes that we see this year with the marijuana system is medical growers for the most part a certain subset of them are going to be tracking in the cannabis tracking system one of the allowances given by law is that they're able to transfer 20 pounds of usable marijuana into an olcc processor or a wholesaler if they're in the metric system so before they're going to be allowed to do that though they're gonna have to verify to the olcc that they have legal access to water when somebody is just growing strictly medical marijuana they're not receiving any money for doing that it's not a commercial purpose those rules may not have applied to them but once they decide that they're transferring 20 pounds into a commercial market then they have to be treated as all other commercial agriculture with me and that would require them to provide legal access to water so I really like to point this out even though this isn't the Medical Group just because I have a feeling as soon as people get in the metric they're gonna say hey I have 20 pounds I want to transfer to you and it's not going to really work like that they won't be able to transfer to retail first of all so no retailer should be receiving any product from medical growers retailers are still receiving product through the olcc license chain processors and wholesalers however would be able to receive that product once the growers are approved and so the way you're going to know basic they'll be able to transfer that to you through metric it'll come through metric with a transport manifest it'll show up in your inventory and metric and it'll be like any other transfer that you receive from within the license system so if somebody tells you you know I just can't do it in metric it's not working for me or something like that you know it's gonna be very questionable as to whether they're actually allowed to do that 20-pound transfer so I just want everybody to know that it's going to look like any other transfer you get and just kind of be ready for that coming on after July first so these are some changes that are going to be happening upcoming in the summer as well based on 2018 legislation so the what with what was happening is OTA handlers and growers could apply for a no LCC hemp certificate and this would allow the hemp handler or grower to transfer product into the processor that I talked about earlier 2018 legislation kind of changed the way that looks so basically what the agency did was we stopped issuing the hemp certificates to the handlers and growers as soon as the bill took effect so everybody that currently has a certificate can still transfer into an LLC C processor that has a hemp endorsement so that process can still take place during rulemaking we're just not giving any new certificates right now however if a processor wants to apply for the hemp endorsement and they haven't had a chance to do so yet you're free to do that at any time so what's going to be changing is the way that the hemp is going to enter into the olcc system so the ODA handlers and growers will still need to apply for a certificate with olcc the difference is going to be once they get that certificate they're actually going to be entered into the metric system and so they'll have all the testing conducted prior to that transfer to an olcc licensee and then that transfer will also come through them trick system so it'll look it'll streamline more with the other with actual what you receive marijuana products in the system and so right now we can talk about it's kind of just a broad way it's gonna look because what we have right now is the actual law that tells us the broad categories that that we're going to make happen the rulemaking for it is actually going to be what gets into the details so for right now we just kind of wanted to highlight what's going to be happening and then as the summer progresses I encourage you guys to sign up for our listserv and come to our meetings if is something that's of interest to you to be able to stay up-to-date on the changes and the big change is going to be that Oda registered hemp growers and handlers with the certificate will not only be able to transfer in hemp and hemp and concentrates they'll be able to transfer in hemp products as well and they'll be able to transfer transfer those to processors wholesalers or retailers so you'll be able to see in the future an Oda handler would be able to make a hemp product let's say a hemp soda and it could go directly to retail without going through the other olcc license types so those are the type of changes that we will be discussing to see how that'll look in the future so I wanted to touch on our current compliance so I'm sure most of you read about the minor decoy operations so first they were really bad we put out notices change the way that we were treating those operations a little bit and then last time we ran them was a hundred percent and nobody was selling the minors so I certainly hope that you guys keep up the good work on that so does the agency it makes Oregon look really really good not to be selling to people under the age of 21 so what we're doing right now with retailers is on-site compliance inspections so we're going in we're going to be looking at your metric inventory looking at your real inventory seeing if those match up seeing if you've made any unapproved alterations to the premise you know this is really important for all license types you can't just build out just because you decided to you basically have to send those plans in have them approved and then you can do the build-out and you'll get an inspection and basically the reason for that is we do an on-site inspection of every premise prior to licensure and so we want to make sure that when you do make changes that they're also still in line with your rules and your security that you're originally licensed under also look for unapproved business structure changes it's also a big one you can't just sell off half of your company and never let us know it's really important that those changes are ran through the olcc in the appropriate backgrounds and fingerprints happen when they need to and then also probably one of the big will to other big ones the security cameras I'll mention just because it's really important not just to have them but to actually make sure that they're in working order make sure they are working make sure you have your backup make sure your off-site backups working make sure your cameras are actually doing what they're supposed to be doing it doesn't hurt to check in every once in a while just to make sure that you're actually in compliance something could happen maybe it went offline you were unaware of it and that's really going to be bad for a compliance action if we can't see anything you've done for you know a week or something like that and then the auditing of the tracking system data so the nice thing about having the tracking system is that we're able to see the industry as a whole at one time so if we want to look at something to see for example if there were any retailers that sold over the daily sales limits in a day you know we could look at those numbers on a statewide to see who is doing it so what we're doing and what we have been doing is using that data to actually audit licensees so if we notice for example this is gonna be a probably better example we noticed that everybody's doing something wrong and it's not that big of a deal what we're gonna do is we're gonna send out a compliance bulletin and basically say you know this is what's going on this is how you should be entering this in metric and you know if you have any questions you know contact us we'll send that out and then we'll check the data again in like a week and we'll notice 50% of the licensees that we're doing it wrong are now doing it right you know in another week we get like 75% of people doing it right so we're like oh good people are actually paying attention everybody's trying to be compliant and so those types of issues are easily fixed through those compliance bulletins so if you don't read those I would encourage you to because there's very helpful information in them the other thing is that people are just blatantly breaking the law breaking the rules and putting it into the tracking system we're able to see it we're able to see that things are way wrong in a facility or in a number of facilities and we can take compliance action based on those audits a lot of times so it's just a really good idea if you use a point-of-sale system to make sure that your information is getting it over to metric correctly and timely and then if you're entering your information and metric maybe you licensee aren't entering it maybe you have an employee entering it doing a little audit every once in a while on yourself just to make sure that your data is what it should be and that you're compliant because ultimately is the licensees responsibility so this is always my favorite slide even though you guys have seen it a million times it's our website and there is a lot of stuff on it and I'm sure by now you guys all know but the left hand side is a side where you find all the tabs which is the easiest way to get through the website so like I was saying about the compliance bulletins you know if by chance you haven't seen them or haven't had a chance to read them you can click on the bulletins tab and it takes you to a list of all the bulletins that we've ever put out and we have a brand new section that's hemp related bulletins as well so they aren't mixed in with regular marijuana bulletins also the frequently asked questions I continually get calls with questions and I just copy and paste them from frequently asked questions and an email and send them out because actually we do update those on a pretty regular basis and we actually update them with frequently asked questions and so it's helpful just to kind of take a quick look if you haven't just to see if it answers your question hemp has its own tab now licensing and forms and publications is where you guys are going to find all of those forms I was talking about so they're in two places so you really can't miss them and that way if you do want to apply for any of the additional endorsements or any of the additional you know medical propagation anything like that you'll be able to easily find those forms and then if you can't you can always send us an email at marijuana at Oregon gov just like always with a question about where to find something or maybe you heard something was gonna be changing can find it on the website we're always happy to take those emails and take those calls and so the one thing I would like to point out here is the cannabis tracking system tab because that tab actually is gonna change when you click on it you get to this page where you can either be an olcc licensee you have a different tab to click or you can be an om MP lace or registrant and so the medical tracking they're gonna have their own section and so we just didn't want everybody to be surprised that this looks different and you have to take an extra step but as a know LCC licensee you will want to make sure your documents and all of your information is separate from the medical so you keep them try to make it as less confusing as possible all right and then the last slide is our mission statement I just like to put it up there so everybody is aware of what it is alright guys thanks for coming", "kue4pj6Bfgk": "SHELLEY-- HEMP AND REGULATIONS.

"hello and welcome to another episode of cultivate i'm your host jennifer murray and today we have ramen azar from planetary remote sensing um this is amazing technology and i honestly have never thought of this but after getting to know him and understanding what he does with this technology it's fascinating so i'll have him tell you a little bit about himself and the technology but he's a remote sensing scientist who uses his knowledge and decade of experience to find cutting-edge solutions for the good people for the good of people and natural environment welcome thank you so much for joining us hi jennifer thank you very much for having me and uh it's it's an honor to be on your show and i hope i can explain and open some doors about this technology and get more people to know what is happening actually in the world with the cutting-edge stuff that's coming in absolutely well let's talk about a little bit about your background and how you got to here i got into remote sensing because i was amazed with stars we used to do stargazing as a kid i think human being has always been amazed looking at the stars and even our gods they live in the skies and that's what we have always been looking to see what is beyond at certain point in my life uh i thought how would it feel to see from that perspective to see the earth from the skies and it grew in me and the interest was the thirst was a lot and i started studying uh how i can get into this field and i found remote sensing which is actually the science of studying targets surfaces to objects from a remote place or from a remote manner way so remote sensing is actually studying earth from a distance that could be with drones if your kid is playing with a drone is watching you is doing remote sensing in a very basic way or aerial airplanes as we call them or satellites it's all remote sensing and yeah that's how i got into it that is very interesting a very cool story so much happens when we are younger that affects you know what we do later on in life and it's very nice that you could turn your dream into a career right yes yes how does one study to become a remote sensing scientist uh well it is a field it is actually a separate field that you can start studying it but it's a little bit confusing because in different countries this field is under different uh departments let's say okay for some countries it's under geodesy or geomatics some countries geoscience some countries is surveying some countries civil engineering depending where you live and what that country is uh using remote sensing mainly for or conventionally for the field has uh formed under that department and uh for me i've been moving around around the world a lot i've been changing countries for the last 15 years studying here and there and so i've always been moving from one department to another one department to another i've been under civil i've been under geomatics i've been under environment so there's not a fixed answer for it you gotta see where you are and you gotta find out how you can study and how different are those from country to country oh completely different completely different yeah the focus is different uh for example uh back in malaysia i was studying for my masters and the the main focus over there is on uh rice um okay yes rice and palm trees because there's a lot of palm oil production over there and they use remote sensing over there for this uh mainly two reasons and that's maybe 15 years ago i'm sure it has developed but yeah or back in italy uh when i was studying my phd the focus was uh on crop monitoring i was working with um national research center of italy while studying and after it as a researcher and we were focused on natural hazards um wildfires floodings okay and also crop monitoring for the whole european continent as the part of national research center so real time right so you're looking from the satellite and you're seeing exactly where the fire is so they can mitigate the fire easily than having to try to find you know exactly where it is or how does that work uh yes yes it is uh kind of real time it depends on your application if you are in defense or intelligence it is definitely real time okay but when you get into commercial as uh let's say uh what we do in agriculture or civil or surveying you get as close as 24 hours that's how close you could get yeah okay and so how do you get this technology i mean you don't own the satellite do you so how do you get the how are you able to use that technology uh there are lots of ways well actually remote sensing there are some satellite data that they're free oh yes yes and they're provided by governments or in case of north america usgs and nasa they provide the data for free whatever is free you can get it from there in case of uh europe there is the european space agency isa they provide the satellite data free but there are also commercial satellite data the higher the resolution you go the data is more most likely commercial and there are different data providers there are different data providers through the world you know you can't count them they're there a lot you got a lot and you can they're different sensors different types and then you can search and find what kind of data you need but one of one of my job today is that i help people find and choose the best data for your application that's one of my uh duties now right now so when you say they provide it for free but that doesn't give you like a report of anything you'd want would it no so what like what would you get for free uh you get the raw data and you have to know how to use it okay yeah yeah i can make an example it's like uh you go to a grocery and you get some flour some oil and you gotta bake a cake you have to know how to bake the cake right got it it's the same thing okay that's a great analogy thank you so then what what is this um sensing how do you talk about it in canada and in u.s obviously i'm in the u.s you're in canada so let's talk about some applications that it's used in those two countries yeah remote sensing has been used uh well uh united states was the first country that started it remote sensing started back in 60s yeah this is a this is a photo of the first uh televised photo of earth in 1960 through one of the nassau satellites and well nowadays there are very very high resolutions satellite photos available such as this one for example which is 30 centimeters and it's over brazil over a soccer stadium and you can see the details how detailed they are and we're we will be getting 15 centimeters so imagine you have this wide range in united states this has been uh used historically like for decades now right so it's quite widely used in agriculture it's for environment definitely for climate change um for uh defense of course they were developed for defense and then they came to yeah other uh kinds of applications for civil for surveying for infrastructure in any in everything you use it in everything and you can get down to a person how close can you get down for now with satellites we have up to 30 centimeters so that means that of maybe this is 30 centimeters yeah so if that is a square i can see wow 30 centimeters so that yeah this is 30 centimeters yeah that should be square right should be a tile okay that's really scared i mean that's really scary that they can't now and they don't um they meaning people that use these satellites so you don't have to get people's permission oh you're not seeing the faces so you're not invading any privacy right okay you are seeing whatever uh airplane is uh let's say flying over anything you you're seeing whatever you're seeing and give a very good example okay google earth or google maps when you turn on the satellite mode that is between 50 and 30 centimeters over popular let's say locations that's right and when you zoom in and then you get that 3d kind of view that is aerial photos got it i didn't even think of google earth clearly i don't use it very often so wow that's exciting so of course agriculture so which um examples of that could be hemp or cannabis so what kind of um what would a let's say a hemp farmer why would they engage you on your services okay um that's a very good question but let me just go a little bit back to tell you how it works so that could convey the meaning right remote sensing is about electromagnetic spectrum i'm going to show you a photo an image of electromagnetic spectrum and this is what our world is about the reason why we see what we see is that we can just see in that visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum it starts from gamma ray and ends in radio waves and that's why we see the leaves green that's why we see the sky blue because we can only see in that specific range imagine a snake snake has a different range snake has thermal sensors and this is how a snake sees a mice well the mice cannot hide in the dark might think so but actually not the good thing about human being is that we have developed the technology and the sensors to be able to see beyond what our eyes can see and that is what remote sensing is about let's put it like this we study universe in gamma rays okay if you look at this image i'm just helping you and navigating you through the electromagnetic spectrum we study the universe in gamma rays we check our broken bones with x-ray we study the ozone layer in uv range infrared helps us to see at night radars function in microwave range and radio waves are used in telecommunication back in school he used to have this professor that he used to tell me everything in universe is about electromagnetic spectrum we can solve all human kind problems when we can utilize the electromagnetic spectrum in full example of his word that was a code example of his words is mri and cat scan yeah it's remote sensing it's electromagnetic spectrum it can see inside you and that's the same basic thing we work on for agriculture that all the crops wine grapes hemp cannabis everything it's the same thing right it's crop it's agriculture how it works is that the sunlight shines on crops on leaves on plants and some parts of this electromagnetic spectrum is absorbed by the leaves or the fruits or the branches or the soil and the rest of it is reflected the satellites they record this reflected uh radiation okay and we grab this uh recordings and we process it and then we can define what is happening and that's how remote sensing works so instead of having to walk around your entire farm which a lot of these farms are gigantic you can actually look down and assess what's going on in your crop what are some of the things that it looks at what kind of data sure a good example of what she said is just like a hemp farm you know sometimes they grow so big they have to put the net or mesh to hold them right you can't walk in them and if you have a big farm how can you see it so there are different ways to see it you can use drones you can use satellite data or aerial data but what we look at what we look at this image that you're seeing is how different crops would look like okay remember i talked about visible range the visible range of human being stops at 700 nanometer but after 700 700 is a magical number after it the magic happens that's where we cannot see and that's where the sensors step in in this image you can see different types of crops we got beans we got alpha alpha we got wheat grass potatoes everything right and you can obviously see here how different they would look to us when we're looking at the process and the curves of the reflections and that's how we can different differentiate between different types of crops but that's not all of it what about if our hemp our cannabis our grapes our potatoes are healthy or not right right following image yeah this is how a sugar beet as i picked up as an example with that funny picture recited this is how a healthy sugar beet and a stressed sugar beet would look to us so can you see it see this with your naked eye nope can't see but we can see and that's where we step in and then and then we can know what uh stress level or health condition is happening in that specific let's say hemp plant or cannabis plant so if it needs water or if it needs nutrients or stuff like that that could assess it wow wow okay i don't have the numbers on top of my mind now but if you're growing potatoes or watermelons oh you need to water them a lot yeah and your soil has to be constantly moisturized right one of the things we do is uh checking soil moisture with this car i'm gonna give you another example this is an example of grapes grapes okay yes i like melon i also cook with melon what we can do is that we can differentiate the grape types with satellite data this image shows you we can see what plants are cabernet what plants are mellowed what plants are zero and we can say for example in hemp for example what kind of hemp your neighbor or what kind of cannabis your neighbor is growing that could help you to find out what's coming in the market or in the region same thing for wine same thing for crops it's basic agriculture right got it so is there any way for a a farm to make it so you couldn't see no because you can see through whatever it is right yeah if it goes indoors our hands are tight oh okay yes indoors but any crops outside any crops outside we could see but i mean our hands in terms of satellite data but if for indoors we have uh stationary sensors so we actually have to go there and put the sensor and because it is covered right right right exactly yeah um so how close let's say you're looking at a hemp farm so with the information are you able to identify the exact plant that you need to go out and assess let's say it's not getting enough water technically it depends what kind of accuracy we're targeting what do we want to see okay some farmers they are interested in the in a general view over the whole field okay some farmers are interested in individual plants some farmers are interested in more detail even in terms of cluster of leaves or branches right okay and depending on what a farmer or a grower needs we have to go to different platforms right okay yes if if someone is growing uh hemp or wine and uh they want to check a cluster of uh grapes or cluster of cannabis uh flowers we wouldn't be able to use satellite data that's where the drones they step in we will have we will have flyovers uh but um same thing also for uh for soil moisture is important it's not only about the plants because uh for farmers it is important pre-plantation to know the situation of the uh of the soil right right you can track the soil moisture i have a video if you can show it i'll show you we did a we did a soil moisture mapping uh and we did a crop water content mapping with this is with satellite data over over field that's a canola crop uh it shows us the change and the stress within the plants so besides checking the soil moisture and providing a plantation grid for hemp for cannabis for grapes these these are the plants that are really important how you plant them because of the you want the enough space between between these plants right right uh you need enough to get enough sunlight and we can design those with satellite data we can check the topography we can do the slope of the land we can check everything with cellulite data and one of the most important things is the water content which uh reflects into stress for the health of the plants we can check that right so if your hemp is uh drying out it will show so what specific things can you do for him good question a great question well we work in agriculture hemp is a plant we deliver services to every kind of plants and everything but hemp is a plant the end so what we can do for hemp business in your industry is that we can check the missing plants check canopy volume canopy volume check um crop health we can check crop stress we can check crop water content we can build models for a yield estimation this is early yes especially for hemp build models for yield yes we can build models for yield it is amazing how the overall production of volume for hemp per square feet is higher than any other kind of plastic you can imagine like literally everything is used when you're growing hemp you make papers out of it you make ropes out of it clothes out of it it's used in uh plastic in different uh uh artificial let's say substances it's used in international space station it's used in so you actually miss something because i guess if i was planning a hemp farm i would want to know how the soil is where i'm going to plant my hip and farm so we would probably start with that right yes well from far away we can tell you you can help you with the moisture but when we step in and we get some samples we can check the conditions of the soil and check the nutritions okay so a good example would be that we could see what parts of your field needs fertilizer what parts doesn't so you don't have to use fertilizer all over the field that's a cost effective decision right right absolutely or nutrition or disinfectant we can check the patches that they're stressed for irrigation some farmers they use pipelines and sometimes we do have this problem with vineyards here coyotes come and chew up the pipelines and the pipeline breaks and downstream that the trees they don't get enough water and then the soil goes dry right so drainage we could check what parts of the hemp farm is uh dried or is under stress so they can check the irrigation same thing for soil for example sometimes it happens parts of your field has a sandy kind of soil that doesn't absorb water instead it just passes over down so you need to work a little bit on that part of the soil we can we can flag this out with the continuous study and yes as yields estimation we can build models for yield estimation actually we did this for rice back when i was working in italy for european union we did a rice estimation with 86 percentage of accuracy in mid july you have to know that the rice is cultivated in september and the yields come out as numbers in october so that's a couple of months ahead that helped the authorities to regulate the prices for import and export of rice and keep the prices balanced in the whole european continent and governments take advantage of this it could apply the same thing for a hemp farmer they could build a model we could build a model for them and they could know how much they're going to cultivate how how how much how many tons of uh product they're gonna have right by the end of the cultivating season yes so what about security there is a lot going to happen in remote sensing for now we are getting up to one time per day satellite revisit so if you have a farm i can get a once a day if the weather helps once a day satellite image over your data but this is going to change this is going to change in the next couple of years okay and we will have up to 15 times of revisit per day but you didn't say they couldn't see your face you can't see your face but if you're having someone if you're not in in your field if you're managing a lot many numbers of fields or your field is still too big and you can't have security all over the place if someone enters and is stealing your pile of harvest imagine with 15 times of 15 times per day revisit machinery will be visible or you stop contracting someone right to come and you're sitting in vancouver your wine yard is in napa california and you have subcontracted someone for your hand farmer for one yard to come and do the cultivation and due to kovid you're not there you can't be there right and you can visit every couple of hours revisit that means 15 times during the daylight and you we can track if the people are working on that security right if your contractors are working if they're not yeah that's that comes in handy right now so you think that's gonna be out in the next couple of years it will be out yes okay wow this is fascinating um i can't even imagine uh you know what other what other things um that can be that this technology can be used for um well is there anything else that we've missed oh yes yes i want to show you uh i want to show you two images uh one image is from a company named precision hawk that they do a great job actually i had the honor to meet uh uh one of the uh directors in uh last year two years ago in uh there was the remote sensing association meeting i was presenting over there and the gentleman was over there precision hawk is based in texas and they do great job in agriculture with drones i'm going to show you an image they did for a hemp farm this is with drone this is not the satellite okay yes and in this image you can see individual hemp trees you can see the missing trees and this helps the farmers to know the geometry of their plants what is located where and what's happening in different patches wow the next image i want to show you is with satellite data this is over uh the credit goes to harrison joe spatial they're a leading software uh use also their software for processing as well this is a satellite image over a hemp farm it's a little bit let's say not medium high resolution can't be as much as drones but this is a 10 meters resolution and this farm wow you can see the red patches right the plants are under extensive stress and the green parts they're healthy hemp plants this is this gives the farmer uh what is going on on their farm and we can produce this for any kind of agriculture product right so which include cannabis as well so you know cannabis grows are getting larger and larger and larger so god this would definitely come in handy can you talk to me about what's the price range i mean i'm sure it's very large but what is what does something start at for a general we have to know what the farmer needs because like the last image i showed you it's with satellite data definitely the cost would be less but if there's a need of drone like the first image then we'll have to have our drones flying and there is a lots of other expenses involved right right but we for small to medium projects we usually work with a square per kilometer and square per square foot in this case yeah yes and uh for uh larger projects we usually work with uh project based prices so i can't give a price that we we will sit we will uh see what you need we will do our estimates we will find the best prices and we will help you to choose the cheapest method and then we can give a we can give an estimation of how much it can cost sure well and of course right this is replacing costs this isn't really an i mean it may be an added cost at first but you're saving your crop it's definitely a very important thing um i mean if i had a large operation i would definitely want to be doing this so and i really appreciate you taking the time this is very exciting and i can't wait to see the progression of this and if you are interested in remote sensing you can reach out to us at cultivate cannabistech.com and we will get all of those funneled to him but thank you so much again for for coming and i wish you all the luck at the end of the day you should not look up to the god to help you but you can look down and help yourself with help of satellite love that i love that thank you so much and um yeah have a fabulous day okay thank you", "ZjGxzw3BfxE": "[Music] sheriff's deputies in Siskiyou County seized hundreds of illegal marijuana plants tonight a look at the problem law enforcement says is getting out of control good evening and thank you for choosing NBC 5 News at 6:00 I'm Kristen haasvelt and I'm Natalie Weber in for Craig smullin that is tonight's top story at six for months the Siskiyou County Sheriff's Office has been serving search warrants on illegal marijuana grows today they were assisted by the California Highway Patrol and the National Guard on 19 raids officials say in the past couple of weeks they've served 50 warrants on groves which they say is much more than normal this area has just exploded with Gardens it seems to be getting more and more of a year we hit these ones and then sometimes they get replanted to week or two later deputies say each grow usually holds at least 100 plants they say the majority of the marijuana is getting shipped to the East Coast where plants rake in five to six thousand dollars each for one garden that can yield around five hundred and fifty thousand dollars", "JjTiqvrpnFA": "what you think that this the oil the would have a positive effect on these chil I and I definitely believe it would yes because it's any seizure you know anything like this so I mean I'm never treated in anyone with this condition but I would definitely if this was my child I definitely put this child on the oil try it I mean the main thing here is you're not giving the child something that can harm it no no's arm factor yeah no danger so but I think we have good results with this I really do I think there's hope here that's an awful thing I mean you have to live like that my god that's not a life at all no this gives a child a chance and this is the same way to see with these autistic children you know yeah yeah it just does amazing maturity I trust each other their autistic - yeah most of them yeah well I think that doing your would probably well I believe if it can't cure it is probably gonna be best control you're gonna find and like I said it's harmless so I would definitely try it that's what we're we have been aiming for we've been trying to get this oil here in Iceland legally right for a year now hmm the doctors are working against us Corsair yeah but so now we're coming to a point where we have to say okay are we going to continue on this path and and do this for the next ten years or are we gonna get the oil somewhere else if you thought about taking the channel to the US yeah I've thought about that yeah but I mean illegally and in the system there it's not gonna be eligible but well the problem - I mean the oils available and me dispensaries and things in the US now but but the quality to see that there's no quality control there's no standards in place yet you know we need the freedom to do this simple research in no time we can you know bring this a little too much better levels but I would I definitely would if this is my child I would definitely try that and I think and you know I mean I can't make guarantees but I think you're gonna have good results with this oh yeah yeah I've seen well I mean any like epilepsy or any of these other diseases that you know that it's very similar because you're into seizures yeah and it's great anti-seizure medication even you all's that I produce you know like Sanjay Gupta did that piece on CNN you know and it showed the epileptic children and it was reducing it reduced the number of seizures no question but it didn't stop them they still had seizures here and there even when they were taking off but as soon as I watched that I said if there was some THC and more can't seeing that oh I bet you the seizures would cease completely okay so he's very important yeah that's that's another question I had for you because many people are supporting the use of CBD or an or THC free oil yeah well that's a stupid I mean it's it is it's a synergetic effect of all those well over a hundred different cannabinoids working together that creates these effects these healing effects so the two eleven eight th seeds mean that's stupid I'm just plain stupid so you would recommend a THC high I tried I would try something like a 50-50 yeah CBD THC about the same strength and just small tiny doses we're child up over a few days but I'd be willing to bet that it would have quite a dramatic effect on a child like this okay yeah but norm so the dosage what what would you do a drop or no not even a drop when you're starting and even when I start an adult off in this oil it's really I tell people to start with it's just like a little tiny speck like 1/4 of a drop not much bigger than that okay nothing you know and then over every eight hours and then after four days try to double the dose because that gives us the body time to adjust to it this is a very strong if you got the clear oil it's a very strong medication but again no her almost could have caused the child do is sleep so just keep just doubling the doses every four days and then just watch the child and see what happens and I'm willing to bet after you start doubling dose a couple times I think you'd start seeing some pretty dramatic results I would definitely do this and so you would continue this throughout well not necessarily because I mean the oil might be able to correct the illness you know I think it's a good idea that every child well everybody should be taking you all to protect themselves anyway but you know in case like this if we can bring that loss like y'all to autistic children once you get their body detoxify get these toxins gone they're no longer autistic well they don't have to keep taking you if they don't want it but I really believe in the near future I mean everything I'm seeing now the whole future of medicine is going to be in cannabinoids and you know I so I think it's a good idea to continue taking it but I would you know even if you just got a small quantity of oil like 2 3 grams or four grams not very much just because you know it's gonna take quite a while you're only giving us a tiny little doses like that it takes quite a while you use that much oil up yeah but just keep doing and I can't imagine it not I can't imagine it not helping and everything I firmly believe it would help yeah I think it gives you the best and safest option possible look I'm all I can do for your brother yeah thank you completed yeah I presented a message do some research look into it look what's going on in the internet go on YouTube look at all these children and everything people that are using this now this is no damn joke you'll get this marijuana nonsense out of your head says this this is a medicine and it's a wonderful medicine and it's safe non-addictive what else is are out there like this well PubMed they have hundreds and hundreds of peer-reviewed studies and all types of different things you know they're like well even now they're coming up with evidence now and I knew this years ago because we were treating schizophrenia experice that very effectively now they're admitting finally it's a very attractive treatment for schizophrenia yes but the thing is it's a safety of it no you're not giving your child something that's going to harm it and there's a good possibility that it could save the child's life and free the parents I mean the same thing with this if you have up to an autistic child or you have a child like this you're going to have to take care of that child for the rest it's like it'll never have a life at least with the oil it offers them an opportunity you know it gives them a chance what have you got to lose", "-7ITP9pHhPU":

pretty well you know there's times you've got to do so you got to do some other stuff but we got a lot of we got a lot of different jobs just so I can get around both sides hey Dad the southern cinema classroom that's I hated it for the first couple months then I just got over the fact that I wasn't coming home I still come home like every weekend I pretty much know with my life once they get done anyway if you always want to do farming oh yeah drove a tractor now by yourself and a little bit it have been 40 20 I'm probably driving around the feedlot while dad's great pens eight years old I ran a forklift into our shop wall at home sit didn't have any brakes I was probably 13 or 14 at that point I had a day where I had a bearing go out of the feed wagon which you off sometimes but then that night all we had left was the other feed leg and I ripped the spout right off it so he he was calling me I was reached out my reach my phone out of my pocket and I turned and all of a sudden I drilled the bunk with it right off he started I had him run the green cart when he was probably seven I had him I was calm binding and then I needed a different end of the field I was trying to open up and it was a power shift so you don't have to push clutch in so then here I told him just put it in gear and and drive alongside real slow and he was he can do that he was pretty little but he could pull the lever back to neutral met it would stop so but he wasn't he wasn't big enough to push the clutch in yet so that was he's always wanted to farm too he he used to ride with me when I would plant and I used to have to fill with beans I would make five rounds with the planner and then I'd have to fill and he knew exactly when it was time to fill he counted all the rounds when he was little really yep he'd say up one more round then we got to fill him so that was always on top of me up yeah that was a lot of fun working with RJ's been that that's a that's what you could say is the pleasure of being able to farm when you can work with your grandson it's a yeah it's probably I can't explain it but it's just really really enjoyable when I got out of high school I worked for my grandpa my uncle Joel for about a year and a half and then I started farming with dad we farmed with dads brothers everybody farmed together for probably seven or eight years when I was out of high school and then we started going on her owns our operation for growing and all the uncles had a son that also was gonna farm so he kind of kind of did their own thing yep that was kind of neat how we all got along you know four brothers and their kids yeah I started when I was 19 I had to go to the service come back I suppose probably about 50 years it's owned he kept for 49 in 1974 to 44 years on that I have my family started Rosie's family he started in 1938 kevlars well it was the Schmidt her grand her grandfather I heard your uncle they're dead yeah would have been her uncle started 1938 and for two years and he he grew seed also and I guess in for that two years later he got four he had eleven townships when he started well then my father-in-law Rosie's mom and dad in 1940 they they helped him first for two years and then they took over because he wanted to go to strictly growing seeds it's been in the family for 80 years yes staples came down and did a big promotional deal on it just last month ii think he's one of the oldest I think they started the calop started in like 35 and they started sewing like 38 not only three years that somebody could have been longer than them it's been in the family for over 80 it started with my mom's side Kevlar and then my mom's mom was a Schmitz and they actually started it west of town where Palmieri Eve's mom daddy's live over there so yeah they just did a article on them for staples where my wife Deb works because Monsanto is one of their merchandisers are they further one of their vendors so they've been in business over 80 years and that might we might be one of the longest you know running decal dealers family that's been the family that long staples is doing an article on us just a little insect for their magazine and they'll kick that off at their big meeting when they have their rep meeting or all their accountants down in Texas wherever they're at this year so yeah I'd say we're one of the oldest it's another thing with her she's been part of this deal since the start she run every piece of equipment we had except the planner she's done everything else too so it's kind of like without her things that things would kind of get juggled up a little bit she's a she's a pretty main cog in our situation to us but it takes takes everybody you know that's he pretty well takes care of everything so I just gotta go and I got Ryan freaking the fancied business he he take manages all this the business end of it so all the grandkids they did they get involved every so often picking up rocks or whatever else we got to do [Music] you their part about farming is probably the field work or working with cattle you like feeding every day oh yeah does it get old oh no maybe when they're Phatak it slow cuz they're not as excited is when they yeah when they get a couple more months they won't be able to jump around anymore I get pretty big when we're delivering seed we're doing seed I pretty well most every day's here I got a couple fields ready for him this year but that was it they got we got a hired man and Christopher luge helps us and then RJ and Nick it's been a it's a family deal sauce and it works well been working well he's almost he's in there on time I'd rather be running my planners where's something in the field yeah I ran it a little I ran for like 200 acres last year but we're spraying accurate hunting once so that's the only thing you spray so it screw it up or mrs. spot you know back in the spread I really like to run the square yesterday I like doing that those right now like I like plan Beeler touch new on this he loves it too much well then we all it's all one deal so right now we're firmed about 2500 acres so that's about 36 hundred head of cattle up there and I think he said seed ways were selling between nine and ten thousand bags of corn and eighteen nineteen thousand it takes everybody I mean like Ryan and Jesse in Mike Mark was out here helping yesterday and he's more than some now so he gets involved in it when he can you only feed a lot of cattle you know between all three of us three operations I want to say seven thousand head of cattle Wow yeah maybe eight probably because we've we feed 3300 Jerry oh it looks feeds about 1,500 so you're under close to 5,000 I'm Pat feeds 3 to 4,000 it's eight to nine thousand [Music] for that for a family-owned you know we don't feed for anybody they're all family on cattle it's pretty big yeah yeah this isn't brand new monitor yeah it's a newer deer monitor all my other ones have the next size older so this is all new for me trying to get used to it yeah all the setup of it and it's a few different a little bit different it just keeps getting more advanced you know this one here can turn on the ends if you want it yeah I think it's another 500 bucks a year on your subscription it's capable to turn on the ends the better accuracy you want cost more and then it's sf3 which is almost down within two inches accuracy where my other ones are about six inch they go like SF 1 SF - this one's SF 3 now they never used out 3 these to go to our TK which is right on SF 3 kind of takes the place of it's close to our TK and the new ones ok my other ones have like for just disc and SF 1 that's close enough for Diskin and that's the basic general package you get that when you have your you know for planting oh I want a more accurate for plan right and then another addition is your section control it's called that shuts me off on the end no I gotta lift it it just shuts it whatever whatever I have done here is painted on this screen and then and then when I run into what I painted what's blue that shuts the planner off as it shows that that has already been planted over Labs yep yep and that's called your section control and that's you know you got to pay more for to have that 2 also yep and if all the feeding end of it up there with the feed yard - I help wherever they need me when we're working cattle or whatever calves but I like I like the feeding end of it - I like it all you know the smell is a dirt and the spring and and the new calves coming in in the fall and when you got the seed going out it's all it's all nice when it works with the seed here now for the last month or so between treating and going out it it's an everyday job I think last night when they pulled it up and got back RJ and Brian went up it was 11:30 when they got back here last night and we had a guy in the yard this morning at 6 o'clock so he put a lot hours in you know for what you're doing now but it and when everybody when you get everybody taken care of and everybody satisfied that's the name of the game just like everything else should do satisfaction [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] you",

this Tuesday we see that Montana continues to lead the nation in industrial hemp production with more than 40,000 acres planted here in 2019 but there are still hurdles that hinder farmers in Montana and across the nation Senator John tester has penned a letter to the Financial Crimes enforcement network on updating its hemp related guidance testers demanding that they comply with federal law and cease prohibiting local banks from accepting funds related to hemp farming and businesses FinCEN is among the last regulators to implement year old laws allowing farmers to produce hemp their delay has prevented many financial institutions from banking hemp due to fear of enforcement action from that organization tester is urging the entity to cut red tape barriers for the nation's hemp farmers and businesses so they can succeed financially here today and in the future looking to other headlines now the explosion at Cargill's Dodge City Kansas processing facility that occurred last week has only temporarily shuttered operations at the plant the explosion was at a building that processes blood into blood meal a feed additive and not at the main facility two workers were injured in the blast but the company expects their cattle receiving aspects to be fully back up and running here starting today since the explosion cattle ready for harvest are being sent to Cargill facilities this does come as USDA continues its investigation into possible market manipulation after the Tyson beef plant fire in Kansas occurred this past September don't go too far a lot more news after these messages a Luna why was the jack-o'-lantern afraid to cross the road I don't know jack why because it had no guts whoa did you see the Yokohama tires on that SUV yeah I've been seeing a lot of those lately that's because there's a big sale at tire Rama until October 31st get up to $80 back on any set of qualifying yo Kharma tires even when two tires speaking of winter what's black white orange

because our owners know this land and know how to make the most of this modern farming world CHS is viewer quaver CHS creating connections to empower agriculture returning back this morning the animal AG Alliance reported last week that there have been several incidents in different states with individuals posing and claiming to be affiliated with the Census Bureau and asking to enter livestock and poultry barns illegally while census workers are currently out gathering information the animal Agra Lions wants producers to be wary real census workers should be willing to provide proper identification and should not be entering barns or other bio secure areas the census.gov website lists how to identify a rail census worker to further verify the visitors identity use the staff directory to find contact information for individuals supervisors or contact the regional office if the workers seem to be legitimate but asked to go into livestock facilities that's a red flag and contact the Census Bureau right away you can email them at rumors at census gov or find their contact information on line and finally this morning don't forget that coming up this Friday the 25th and Saturday the 26th the Montana Farmers Union will hold their one hundred and third annual convention at the Heritage in in Great Falls the convention gives farmers union members the opportunity to vote on organizational policy work and again educational workshops on farming practices along with staying up-to-date on agricultural trends and learning about the future of the Montana Farmers Union and issues out in washington d-c Russell Nimitz and I will be reporting from the event in Great Falls here later this week and we look forward to seeing our friends attending the event in the Electric City friends that's all the time we have on this Tuesday morning have a great day", "9TTNmmepojA": "hello everybody welcome to another episode of legal weed review today we're going to be doing strain from scored it's called Strawberry Fields a little throwback to the Beatles the strawberry field from scored this is the third scored strain that we have done and let's run over the analysis here real quick something I did notice in this one though it's got three buds in it but the seal is there so that's good but we're going to go ahead and weigh this one also because it looks a little a little light so we'll see anyways tht analysis is as follows right there strain Strawberry Fields total THC fourteen point seven three THC a 16.5 CBD 0 C what is less than point one eight total Zebedee's point one six this is two grams we paid $25 for the two grams we picked this up at green collar cannabis which I don't recommend unless you're looking specifically for scored okay so let's crack it open but I do want to do this on camera because the other score brand that God had looked like it was twice as many buds so we're gonna weigh this one and as you can see we got just those three buds in there two one three big buds the seal is still on and this seal unlike the other seal the other one I weighed because the seal wasn't actually stuck on this one you do actually have to rip open well that's definitely not 4.2 what the hell happened one seven tear - on the dot 200 ah good stuff that's an interesting sweet smell it's got there let's get a closer look on the buzzer for ya Strawberry Fields so upon first glance on these buds they look marvelous marvelous oh wow and getting up close on and they look even better let's get this macro and in effect here you can see there's some beautiful looking nugs man beautiful looking nice tons of red hairs lots of yummy crystals wow those are beautiful look at that look at that prettiness man okay let's crack it open and see what it smells like but these feel beautiful they're super dense they're extremely pretty oh my goodness and that smells almost like strawberries and look at those big buds with almost no stem in them that's just a man this killer strain this is second beautiful-looking weaning from stored that we tried let's go ahead and take a little pup here set these up see y'all can take a look at him well that's something I wasn't expecting all right we don't want that one should be able to see these birds because they are pretty man incredibly beautiful just like my wife incredibly beautiful Wow and it smells so sweet it smells just like strawberries it's very rare anything actually smells or tastes like it's named and this all I get is a beautiful strawberries thing and this was 2 grams we paid 1250 per gram so 12 50 gram for this stuff so far anyways is a steel same with the last up we got the last stuff from scored that we really liked was a nightmare cookies it was a beautiful looking cookie straying off kinds of color running through it and then we also got a CBDs from score which we'll check out that video that was a it'll not be what you expect holy buckets never said holy buckets we bore the taste also tastes very sweet like it smells it's so rare and then not only have a strain called strawberry to smell like strawberry and then it tastes a little bit like it like you never get that all the way through at least I don't and I've tried a bunch of strains so that's highly impressive it's also extremely smooth and this is supposed to be a hybrid although the sativa I've smoked man that thing was kicking my ass yesterday I felt like it was more of an indica than a hybrid technical difficulties so have you like sweet buds yeah it's a decent one for you I'm especially if you like like a partisans Dutch berry I know that's like the cream of the crop when it comes to berry buds at least that I've tried and this strawberry is really really nice so if you like artisans Dutch you're gonna love this alright we about 20-25 minutes we'll see in a bit welcome back everybody we're wrapping up this strawberry fields by scored and as you can see it's beautiful looking knives we're gonna go ahead and throw them back in the jar now but oh my goodness is just so pretty and it smelled like strawberries tastes like strawberries very nice super smooth and the high is like zero body and in the head I just I'm like extremely tired like it is some energy zap and stuff but I don't necessarily feel traditionally high or stoned which is kind of strange but not super because it is a low THC yes so one thing about these scores is they look like some of the best weed have ever seen two strains actually the nightmare cookies that we did recently you should if you look it's gone unfortunately I can't show you right here but look at check out this video because that is one of the prettiest strains I've ever seen and then the Strawberry Fields also I mean like just beautiful stuff man but what I noticed is they have low THC content pretty much across the board so the scored I mean the the no-name CBD bud we got here was obviously seven percent THC it's a CBD bud which my about 10 or never but that's a different story and this was what 17% 14% 14.7 3% and then the other one was 17% so they had 14 17% two of the prettiest buds I've ever seen but that really low THC content so this one specifically the Strawberry Fields is like I said zero body hi I am like sooo retired and very mild head high so it doesn't really get you stoned so if you're looking for killer weed in the sense of fantastic look smell flavor and you don't want to get super stoned this is your jam right here and not only that you're paying two grams for 25 bucks that's a killer deal 1250 grand for this stuff is incredibly awesome I don't know scored like specializes in low THC content and killer buds but if not they should because there is a population of people out there who don't want to get ripped out of their mind so if you just want to enjoy your smoke enjoy your smoking process and the flavor and the smell and the look of it but you want a really mellow mellow mellow stone this switch you're looking at like I really almost don't feel stun at all I'm just really tired so this is great for those people who just like to smoke but don't want a couch lock and that'll wrap up strawberry fields by scored so if you liked the video please like subscribe and share and we will see you next time on legal weed review first", "rOD3CDMTvD4": "laundering.

another so we traveled to Huntington Oregon that's the closest place to Boise where pot is being legally grown and sold to get an inside look at this expanding industry not many people knew much about pot jim Spiker man grew his first pot plant more than 50 years ago fast-forward quite a few years and pot became illegal I was all of a sudden not a criminal I was in demand now doing it legally 68 year old Spiker man has a lifetime of experience growing pot during the sixties a lot of people smoke pot and I had it in my mind why not grow pot so a few of my friends and I started in an old Orange Grove in the back of a Tustin California from surfers painter to family man the marijuana business has always been a constant in Spiker man's life everybody has different cloning techniques it's his unique experience that helped land him the job of head grower at burnt river farms in Huntington we're a completely organic operation around here just an hour-and-a-half drive from Idaho's capital city business is booming at this farm in Eastern Oregon it's really full circle here from the beginning of the crop to the finished retail ready product at the end Shawn McKay is the CEO of burnt river farms we plant several thousand plants by hand we tend to those plants all year by him manicuring them trimming and pruning them after Oregon legalized recreational marijuana Shawn McKay left his cushy government job as a rangeland ecologist and crop scientists to launch this operation I saw this as once-in-a-lifetime opportunity I figured government work would always be there for me McKay's crop gets its start here as seedlings in the greenhouse nursery here's a Salmon River we grow that for our locals here's some Samoa cookies a bubba kush while some of the plants thrive indoors other strains are moved outdoors into this field which is bare now but lush during the summer this massive fence protects the crop from Huntington's hungry to your population there's many pests everything loves it so you have to really learn to combat the things that are after it besides the general public to keep those other pests away Burt River farms has a state-of-the-art security system above and beyond what's required by Oregon law I think they're somewhere around 50 cameras here that are all fiber-optic cameras motion sensor night-vision that's more security than a traditional farm but McKay says his growing operation is guided as much by agricultural principles as any other farm we try to take those common agricultural practices of irrigation and soil management and pest management and apply that to cannabis production it's just a process of learning trial and error over the years it's been keenly developed into a highly technical trade as soon as the plants are about eight inches tall they receive metric ID tag and that tag will follow that plant all the way through retail ready product once this crop leaves the soil the process is far from over burnt River farm produces marijuana gummies oil hash and shatter all here on site very little of what we produce here makes it to the market as a raw cannabis product the finished product is distributed all throughout Oregon and right down the street in Huntington quad is big business in the tiny town of Huntington where there's always a steady stream of cars heading into town many with Idaho plates marijuana that crosses the border into Idaho is a criminal offense but Idaho State Police says there's been no increase in marijuana citations since pot shops opened in Oregon in fact there's been a decrease of people getting pulled over and caught by ISP with pot and ADA Canyon and peut counties regardless of where the plant is going marijuana money has been a boon for the sleepy town we go back and forth between the the two dispensaries in the school as the largest employer here in town Berndt River farms employs a minimum of 25 people year-round and brings in dozens more for harvest season this is one of the most labor-intensive crops that you will ever come across it's very hands-on there's very little machinery that's designed to accommodate our crop well it's big business in Huntington residents have been divided over pots since the dispensaries first popped up it's wrong it's wrong what they've done they've come and destroyed our town destroyed of a lot of people's feelings there's been a lot of hard feelings between people that have been born here and raised here it's still somewhat divided but based on the growing acceptance of marijuana the growers at burnt river farms are willing to bet it's only a matter of time before the rest of the nation relaxes its pot laws I think it's on its way the cats out of the bag and it'll be legal in every state eventually in eastern

legal marijuana market the go legal campaign underscores the importance of marijuana consumers and the industry choosing to participate in the regulated market while working together to eliminate the illegal market and its criminal activity producers plant cultivate grow harvest and dry marihuana here we introduce some of our licensees and learn how being a part of Oh LC C's regulated market has impacted their business focus a lot of our energy on on trying to make sure that our plants are growing as naturally as I can being a part of the newest and best and brightest making sure that our growers have the right information to be successful making sure that every time our plants go to market they've been treated with the with the the best love and kindness that we can give them what cannabis has done for the state of Oregon in terms of bringing job opportunities has been tremendous we've hired a couple of people in the last year and we're looking at hiring probably another tendance 214 people in the next year giving people opportunities that never existed before without this industry you know there's ten or twelve thousand people that wouldn't be employed in the state of Oregon right now we are committed to paying a living wage here and health benefits and I think that people are really starting to see this industry this regulated industry as a boon for education and knowledge and breaking that stigma that has been long pervasive in this industry folks that have been working for decades in the cannabis industry now have a level of protection that they didn't before Oregon has a long history of supporting small companies and helping them retain their flavor if you will their identity and I feel this has been reflected in the OLC C's approach to regulation of upstart cannabis companies Oregonians are revolutionary it's one of the reasons we moved here 25 years ago we like the fact that cottage industries were respected people could do things from their own property and make things or grow something and have it be accepted Oregon is doing a great job of rolling out the industry one of the aspects that I appreciate is the rigorous pesticide testing I think that that's going to set Oregon apart as the cannabis industry develops nationwide Oregon is going to develop a reputation for purity and integrity because of our rigorous pesticide testing exactly like why we want to eat organic and grow organic and have an organic orchard here and grow our own foods and work with locals here the same reason we want people to be doing it with cannabis and I think it's it's it's a it's something that people can understand see to sale is one of the best things that happen to the cannabis industry because it allows you to track where your plants came from these great little blue plant tags right here that tracks the plant all the way from when it was a seed that was propagated and that goes all the way through to the bottom the shelf or the oil that was produced by it or the edible that was produced by it that increases the level of transparency and accountability of growers to know that it all comes back to the soil - to where the plant came from and to grew it with what practices in ten years I see the Oregon cannabis industry being a nationwide leader cannabis may be Oregon's number one cash crop and I certainly believe that it's

"[Music] okay guys I went out and dug up my can of all out of the ground to show you guys I already cut already cut the tops off you want to all you mind about that high but you can see the big this is all achiever room you just want to try as well as you can to get as much soil off as you can and as it continues to dry you can get more of the soil off easier but I don't worry too much about it this is I had a couple days that's actually been drying out so but I wanted you guys to see the tubers and the roots of the canopies but you can kind of see out what it looks like we get some more of the soil off much as I can this one was growing in a pot and but now the ones the ones that I have buried in the ground in my yard those I leave those out until the first light frost that we have and you can tell they've been touched by the frost and then I won't go out and dig them sometimes I wait sometimes they don't this year we've had such odd weather that I'm just going to go ahead and leave them out there until after the first frost again but you can see all the roots and if they break don't worry about it as long as it's drying out and then you want to cut your roots off just like your caladiums and your gladiolas and lay them somewhere to dry now all I'm gonna do is get some of this dirt off I'm going to go through and cut all these are it soft somewhere else all off comes off a little easier once you get those roots chucking care of and then you do these just think the same way slam out on some newspaper in a box or something you wanted to have good airflow I just lay mine right on newspaper let the fall and stay out completely and then this was a really big fall cheaper it took off and just made a whole bunch of babies so what I'm gonna do I'm gonna snap her snapper in half like that why though sure didn't have a lot of roots on earth that one grew well the ones on the ground ought to be really crazy they got a lot more room to roam you know try to take off this much sheathing as you can you want to keep it as clean as you can so you got well like I said you'll have to get more dirt off but else they dry it's not a big deal they get a little easier to work with when the dirt gets drier as the dirt gets drier but this is pretty cool though because it gave me a lot more caladiums for next year you can store them in a in a basement if your basement don't get real cold anywhere the cooler and dark now not not cold and you don't want damp cuz if you put them in a damp basement they will rot I've been there and done that my basement is very down so I can't store anything so there we go there is and I'm just gonna leave the tops on like this let them continue to dry out and then they will be easier to cut back after they're a little drier but I still I'm gonna leave my channel is about that high couple inches so in the next year when I when I go to plant them the soil level will be about right here you can see where I have up to about right here but I like to leave it a little higher that way I can see them in the ground and I know what they are so then just once again Williams let them dry I'll come out here every couple days and flip them if it starts getting really cold I will take them out and put them on my back porch to finish drying or in the house somewhere so that's all there is to it guys and then you want to store them the same way and newspaper or in a paper sack you know whatever you want you don't have to go out buy anything special the most important thing to remember is when you're storing any kind of all whether it's a collodion a gladiola an elephant ear you want to just make sure that they are dried out really really good before you store them and that will be your success along with keeping them in a cool dry dark place so that they can rest for the winter so alright guys that is it if you have any questions please ask me and I won't answer as best as I can thanks you guys have a good day bye",

between us starting our sewing our seeds and when we can plant them in the fields we've selected this space right here that's about a 15 by 60 well we are planning on building something that's going to be about 14 at the base and run about 40 feet long I'm going to take some clips today of the process hopefully do like little 30-second clips of different segments and time together and show you at the end okay we got to cut the PVC pieces down in 5 foot seconds we have all of our pieces right here and our fittings T's bass pieces and brackets work on that later okay we're joining pieces that we just cut these have a tee which will be our end loops all of the middle loops in between will have the other cross pieces it's important that we're doing this on a flat surface so that all of our pieces line up as you can see we're paying close attention to that okay we're pre assembling the top to our first 5 foot section piece which will have another piece from here going down to the ground so we just decided to pre make this first section again this is the first time we've built one of these so there's going to be trial and error for sure ok we started this project at about 8:30 tip when you're put assembling the PVC very good idea to do it on a hard surface we use these wood slats at each increment where we were gluing the connecting pieces and now we're out finishing up with the end pieces to make the full hoop section that's about three and a half feet wide so basically we're going to just connect these together with our pieces in here that we cut 42 inches here and this thing will be up today okay we just pulled out the two by eight he's got some 24 feet long we're going to use as the base he has recyclables he's a consummate recycler everything gets picked through and has had some wood for probably the last 15 years that we're going to be using for okay we're rolling we're mocking up the end piece and seeing what our head height is this is at a 14 foot base which is maybe a little bit too low so we set up another mark here at 12 and we can show what that looks like when you set it up to that next rung we have the rebar 9 inches up that seems to be holding it nicely and I just added about probably 16 more inches above his head so we're going to consider this height or split the difference and have a 13 foot base okay we are setting the base of the greenhouse we're looking for 43 3 doing the crisscross to get it square what are you off by off two feet so hey this isn't for TV this is real okay we're given the bottom side rails in this is what's going to work we're going to anchor the poly to these boards to give us a firm bottom and hope this doesn't blow away because we're in an open area here and any wind's coming out of the west or north it could easily blow this way okay now we're setting our pieces of rebar we've got our board set as you can see they're screwed in from the backside and that's creating our height with our string line we're at about eight inches above grade and that's what we're driving our pieces of rebar down flush to this point and that's one stick PVC right on top okay we have one of the sides ready to go you see all of the rebar and the supporting one by three pieces of wood to support the framing this side is expecting it to be about 42 feet long and we will duplicate it again on the stopper here you're right we're fixing the other side of the base here it's going in much faster than the first side turned out that we set of transit up and have a five inch pitch from from this side to the south side and we're running a six inch pitch over 40 feet okay we're going to start building this sucker we got our first section here ready to go in the slots I'm going to drive these down eight inches or they need to be take a peek here and that's our first one okay now all the PVC pieces are affixed to our two by tens and we are gluing in between sections where did you put the pilot holes but on these on this side we pre-drill we're going to screw in so that we can take this out in sections if we want to in what is it three foot pieces or six foot pieces this is all glued you're going to be yeah so it would be a six six and a half foot panel okay okay we have five hours into the structure and most of the PVC is up as you can see over my shoulder we just have to make some connections with some screws so we can take this piece of this greenhouse apart in pieces I would say that's going to be another hour the ends should take us a poly a couple hours each we're going to put three foot doors on both ends and then wrap this with our poly and it's done this it's going to be tight if we're going to make this in one day and we have one end or a portion of one and left for tomorrow but the second one you know or another one if we build will certainly go go by quicker okay we're at the point where we're constructing the sides we've marked the board's three-quarter inch treated plywood we had leftover and we're making the ends we're going to just duplicate each so the one that he's cutting right now we're just going to use that as a template pick up another sheet and make another one we'll have both sides okay we have about three hours of sunlight left this is some rough-sawn cedar right here and again this is a recycled product we're going to be using to fasten and secure the ends of this greenhouse along these seams right here both sides and around the doors so the only materials that were really purchased are the PVC 10-foot pieces and the connectors and the poly everything else we're recycling okay we got a door in here it's it's pretty darn close just got a maybe trim the top a little bit or something but we got a good close there and we're getting aside ready it's been probably three and a half hours since we had the frame up so it's been taking some time to work the sides but you know some customization with the windows is nice a little extra airflow certainly a storm door you know he just had that laying around so again recycling there keep it going okay we have the second door in about 10:00 to 8:00 we've had about an hour and a half a break since 8:30 we have a trim piece to go up on top and then we are pretty much ready to skin this with our six mil poly we're going to put braces on it tonight just to keep okay it's the next morning Friday morning we're making our wood rails to wrap our plastic siding around Frank is firming these up with steel clips Easter Sunday we finally got a little calm break in the action with about six minor wins getting the plastic up on top what we've done is wrapped it around the bottoms of a one by three on the bottoms we have it sucked tight and we're screwing it down what'll be left is to trim the ends and create boards going along the sides here to wrap the plastic upon the ends and then we're all done okay this will be the last clip here we finished up getting the poly on top of the greenhouse have it all stretched out inside you're done we have just some minimal pieces left to do like those corners of the greenhouse like I said before but as you can see it's it's going to be 99.9% finished at this point it's all graded on the outside the inside is noticeably warmer noticeably warmer inside here already and we are pretty much ready to plant we can set set down on anything tuberous wise onion sets or cabbage if we need to we can throw a heater in here he does have a temperature gauge hanging from the ceiling so nice old school on it showing 70 degrees right now that's probably accurate so with about $300 and some wood laying around we have this structure up probably in about 14 man-hours and what a great project economical wise to grow your own food and

Ohio growing it in order to help people with seizures chronic pain or cancer treatments requires knowledge of horticulture and lab testing and a new school is educating on all that and more here to talk about it is Kevin green VP of Admissions with the Cleveland School of cannabis here to talk about this new cannabis school here in Ohio welcome glad to be here all right tell us about the Cleveland School of cannabis this is all new to us I know right so the Cleveland School of cannabis is a education company focused on the workforce development specifically here right now in the state of Ohio we are a second state approved school for cannabis actually in the country and actually the only one east of Colorado and we offer four state approved programs which are in horticultural cannabis business medical application of cannabis and then our executive program which is a combination of all three if anyone's watching and saying I hard to get on board with this this is a very serious industry because it creates a number of jobs not to mention all the health benefits that these patients are going to get from being able to take advantage of medicinal marijuana yes you know the biggest thing that I think is great about this industry is that it is a new industry so that means there's so many ways to be a part of it you can be directly working with the plant you can be directly working with patients you can be an ancillary business that's supporting the industry like HVAC security the testing that's going to go on all the different things from lawyers say insurance because again it's a new industry and when new industries pop up it's new opportunities I always love to tell people in the gold rush the people that made the good money and long money were the people that were selling shovels and denom not the people that we're digging for gold so we're looking forward to all the opportunities that's going to be available for all the people in Ohio alright let's talk about the educate education the education is required in order to get this up and running in order to get these industries involved with the cannabis business and I think that's one of the biggest keys is that most people think hey you know you can just jump right into this but education will be key to the due to the fact that we need cultivators they're able to produce the best product cuz we're talking about servicing patients in the medication that they need and also when you think about a dispensary that's going to be the one-on-one consulting that's going to be happening so our dispensaries need to be educated not only on what's going on with the qualified conditions but how to best place patients with the medication they need to help their illnesses and that's the whole key with education we want to make sure that we're able to service patients properly and do this the right way so education will always be key in the industry and again new industry and we're finally coming to the light there's so many more things that has to be that will be learned about cannabis and what this plant will do from not only a textile but also a medication standpoint something I found interesting when I got on to the Cleveland School of cannabis is website you guys are not just providing education on how to grow the plant how to maintain the plan or how to lab test the plant it's also educating on the attorney your guys are educating attorneys and lawyers and patients who will be receiving the medicinal marijuana yes we come from a real holistic approach we know that there's so many different avenues that affected people's life when it comes to marijuana and a history of marijuana especially within the United States so we want to make sure that people are educated in all different levels because they're coming with so much misinformation so we want to make sure people understand what's going on legally here in Ohio and how to go ahead and make sure that they are up to par and abiding by all the laws we want to make sure that especially our lawyers that will be supporting direct marijuana businesses but also could be supporting patients as well understand how to be able to be able to do so we know we've even had doctors that have come into our school and been a part of it because the endocannabinoid system is not something that has been in the general medical book so doctors that have been practicing for 40 years are now getting re-educating and re-energized a part of something that they can go ahead and help new patients I want to touch on you guys are hoping to expand into Columbus how is that yes so we're gonna be looking to expand the Columbus multiple different ways the first way is going to be community engagement we feel it's very important to build a relationship so we'll be doing an open house every every month here in Columbus at the Blackwell hotel we'll also be hosting our MCC course which we call our medical comprehensive course which is a nice weekend course so it gives you a good overview of the cannabis industry so you'll touch on everything from history of cannabis to patient navigation to cannabis law and then we'll also be launching our online program starting this August so we want to be able to provide Columbus but not only the state Ohio multiple different ways to be able to get involved get educated for their needs how can students sign up for classes it is now the time to do that yes you'll be able to sign up for classes right away by going to CSC education com there we always urge everyone please download our course catalog go through all the information understand exactly what we provide and what you're getting into you can please sign up for one of our events so you can go ahead and meet with us and so your questions we want to make sure that we help you through the process as good as possible so CSC education comm is the best place to get that information excellent we've got the

information trickles up there may be a little bit slower so any chance I can have to bring growers down to see what you know cool things people are doing all around the state the you know great opportunity I hope that growers are you know excited to learn I know that some of our growers are putting in high-density apples we have two girls on the bus that have high density sweet cherries and so I think from a innovation standpoint but also from an economic standpoint it makes sense to be moving towards these more modern systems and I think that you know more we can get our guys on board with had the better I grew up on a cheering apple farm in the Williamsburg area my grandparents and uncle had a farm and I left the farm and went did my college thing and came back and well first I said it was in farming again I was done picking rocks up but got into it with my wife here a couple years ago we bought 35 acres and have 10 acres now high density plantings so I did my research and you know up north we do not have near the technology or you know we don't see what we see down here this is eye opening and some of the things that they're doing and we're the leg I mean you're seeing a lot more of it guys are understanding that to be profitable and apples this is what we're going to have to do we like to have people come in and part of it is well it's a reciprocal thing it seems like no matter where you go in the world fruit growers are opening and they're willing to share and you know if they got a new idea instead of hiding it under a basket there they're quick to tell you about and explain why they're doing what they're doing and how it's worked on that sort of thing and I think that's just one of the great things about this this grower community is everybody shares with everybody else how they do things and why they do things so we like to have people come because while you're explaining why what you're doing you're getting stimulated with ideas that their put their questions so it all I think it's part of a community thing I just think it's great for the group from North West Michigan to get out and tour and it's an many of us are farmers and producers ourselves and you know it's good for the industry and hopefully we can bring back and share knowledge with the other growers", "HEpqUh2cURw": "amp that industry it'd be booming here in Southern Oregon

in Louisiana Agriculture's Melanie ohms takes us to Covington to find out why the Blues are making one farmer see lots of green was it sweet blueberry season has just wrapped up here at blue harvest farms in Covington and by all accounts one of Louisiana's newest crops was met with a warm welcome we were just picked out this year that's why our season didn't extend into August is because we had a lot of people hit the field in the first two weekends of July the farm spans almost seven acres and on that land you'll find 41 rows with nearly 5,000 blueberry bushes but you might have a tough time finding ripe blueberries patrons pick most of them clean and owner Chris Pinto couldn't be more pleased I was initially going to be a commercial farm and decided that after last season when we invited friends and family to come pull blueberries out of our young field with people that had so much fun doing it the kids loved it the adults absolutely loved it and after picking about 4,000 pounds out of this very young field we decided that probably the thing to do would be to have a you pick farm Chris's original plan was to grow a pecan orchard he quickly changed that plan when he realized the pecan trees wouldn't be mature until he was ready to retire so here he is about seven acres later pleasantly situated in one of Louisiana's largest blueberry patches blueberries are easy to grow and we have a unique opportunity in south Louisiana and south Mississippi to capture the blueberry market for about a month before the national market actually comes on board we ripen here a month earlier than the biggest States the biggest blueberry production states in the country do because blueberries cross pollinate you need at least two varieties in your field to produce a deliciously sweet fruit blue harvest farm has three different varieties premier powder blue and bright way and it doesn't take long to tell that Chris has a preference how I describe it to people is naturally what do you think of taste wise when you think of a blueberry that's what a premier tastes like and you don't know it until you actually put one in your mouth and say wow that's what I would dream of a blueberry tasting like is premiere now how could I pass up an invitation like that Chris plans to one day look out over his fields and see long thick hedge like rows filled with these sweet plump berries blueberries will mature after six years so we're only in year two so every year they put on a lot of new growth and also increase production tremendously they could add 25 percent more berries next season than this so my hopes are that you know we continue to meet the demand the growing demand for business with the with you know the increased production that these bushes will give me in year six then our near four I'll start to think about whether I want to add more and I'd be glad to come back and help him taste test the new crop from blue harvest farms in Covington I'm Melanie ohm's for this week in Louisiana agriculture and if you noticed folks Melanie ate blueberries throughout that entire story blue harvest farms is committed to the natural approach for pest and weed controls the farm doesn't use any chemicals to control insects which makes the berries safe to eat right off the bush if you'd like to get more information on blue harvest farms you can visit our website and click

little over 4,000 apple and peach trees and our orchard we have agritourism market that we've opened up as well and then new educational school tours during the fall September and October through the orchard as well as the pumpkin patch will happen a season we'll have a little over 2,000 this year I think we've got close to 2,500 kids that come in each morning and we do educational school tours we love being able to highlight the farm and them to be able to see where their food really comes from we hear so much in the media these days and a lot of people are scared of their food and how it grows so we like bringing them to a farm and showing them cattle and showing them corn and soybeans growing and even just the pumpkins growing in the field and the blooms we planted the trees in 2010 they have kind of grown it from there we added more trees each year in a little bit to our market each year as well we farmed conventional farming so we have corn and soybeans grow crops Burley tobacco with the uncertainty of the Burley tobacco market we decided to that for our family we wanted to develop a different niche market as well so we planted the trees and it's really just kind of grown and taken off from there and developed each year as well just talk to them a little bit about apples and farming and kind of get them thinking about it and then from there we kind of read a story to them to again get them thinking a little bit more in depth about that they get to see behind the scenes on how we washed in soy the apples and then they get to pick apples for the sorting table for themselves to eat and then they go through the cooler I'll walk in cooler to see all our different variety of apples that we picked and then we go on a hay ride back through the orchard we stop and talk about the beef cattle we see along the way we stop and talk about honeybees and then of course we stop in the orchard to talk about the trees and then we go into the pumpkin patch and they get to see the the blooms that they have and again we talk about the importance of pollination and bees and then they get to get off it of course have fun picking pumpkins our kids have grown up in an urban setting and so being able to bring them out here and give them the real-life experience of seeing a working farm and to be able to see real examples of how plants grow and where our food comes from is really important for them before we came here this past week we've been talking about pumpkin lifecycles and reading books about pumpkins and how they grow and all of that and then we go back we'll be able to turn this into a real life writing piece for them oh my gosh everything just being able to see open fields like this and see the cows and the animals and this is just something that our students have never experienced before I think the kids enjoy and the teachers as well enjoy coming out to a farm and not just here pick a pumpkin to have fun while you're here they really enjoy that educational component as well and getting to learn you know little snippets there young kids show the you know we're not talking about a full day of education but little you know five minutes here and there where we can teach him a little bit hopefully they'll take some of that back and even tell their parents about it and teach those things as well so that part of the yeah my passion is an agriculture I've grown it up in it and love what we do been very blessed and lucky to be able to come back to the farm to be able to do that so sharing that with other people has just been very rewarding a rewarding piece of what were able to do on well that's it for this week's Kentucky farm girls bluegrass and backroads if you'd like information on anything you saw today visit our website at bluegrass and backroads calm and follow us on Facebook and Twitter we'll see you next time you", "qweCgzAcBcE": "[Music] this one is sponsored by the ontario federation of agriculture so we certainly thank the ofa for their support on the subject of off farm income strategies uh we all know that farming can have its ups and downs and size matters and all that kind of stuff so to be able to have a conversation about what some of these off-farm strategies might look like is certainly one that i think you'll find interesting we've got jodie aldridge from jody aldridge photography as well as jonathan gerais from elite ag resolutions both joining us this afternoon so welcome to the two of you maybe first off uh jody i'll give you the floor for the next 10 or so minutes to talk a little bit about your story yeah of course i'll pull up my slideshow here and we'll take it from there you guys see that there all right so i will share a little bit about my path to becoming a photographer and the um lessons that i've learned along the way as well so hopefully there's some generic lessons and some interesting things that you can learn about my specific path so before i became a photographer um i grew up on our family's cash crop and beef cattle farm um i was a high school student with three career aspirations which were a vet nurse or agronomist i love animals crops and the idea of helping others was something that appealed to me as well the main goal at the end of the day was that i'd have a career that accompanied the hopes of one day farming as i think we all know it's um to become a full-time farmer right out of right out of high school or college is definitely a hard thing to do so that led me to a journey i had no idea it was on so in high school i was asked what the definition of success was in our own opinion um at the time i put a lot of time and thought into that and i'd come up with a career that i enjoy that would also support a lifestyle i choose to live again i had no idea the hurdles it would take to achieve that so starting my own business i there was a time i definitely felt like i was a pro at quitting um i had tried many different jobs and every single time i went to the job i thought maybe this one's for me this uh this might be my dream job and every time i would get into the job and i felt unfulfilled at the end of the day so there was times i don't even think i myself knew what my next move was i thought i have no idea what i'm going to do but the biggest hurdle of that was pushing past what society had defined what success was there was many people that called me crazy for leaving a nine-to-five job that had benefits a company vehicle everything that in many cases can work for people and if that's something you enjoy and you get fulfillment out of your job at the end of the day that's great but i myself did not um i think growing up on a farm with parents that were self-employed there was always a part of me that seeked to do the same sort of career so fast forward to when i left the employed world and i decided to start photography i told myself that things may not work out but i had to be okay with the chance that it might not and i was not going to regret my decisions so i went ahead with photography there is a term tossed around that i know i've been guilty of saying myself at times where you look at someone's situation and you say that must be nice and i think this definitely happens in farming a lot however that is probably one of the most frustrating things for anyone to hear when that's spoken to them because you forget or you may not even be aware of the work or the patience that it takes to get to that point um and i think you can see in this photo here like everything everything takes time and i myself don't even realize um how much i've grown in the past year but these photos were taken a year apart and the one on the right i would say is an image i probably would have looked at before and compared myself to and thought that i wasn't good enough or that i couldn't get there um so one thing i've definitely learned is you can't ever compare yourself to someone else's path because all our pasts look different um you have to want it i've heard a quote once where it said you have to be willing to work 100 hour work week so that you don't have to work a 40 hour work week and i think every self-employed person can tell you that this is true um not only does it take a lot of time getting started but it takes a lot of time to then keep that momentum moving um the unfortunate part or fortunate is you can put as many hours into the job as you want when you're self-employed um i myself have missed a lot of family event events social events a lot to create this business and you have to find the balance because it can easily consume your life it is a lifestyle and i think no matter what you choose to do in life there's going to be portions that you don't like i have written down here book work i absolutely hate book work the reason i love what i do is i'm outdoors a lot i get to be out on farms but at the end of the day if sitting down to do my book work means that i can have the life i have that is one small downfall i can take um ask for help so this is one thing i've really struggled with is although it's great that photography and agriculture is i would say a niche in ontario it's also a downfall because there's not many people to ask specific questions on how to go about being a photographer in the agricultural world um but i have gained a lot of help from many people whether it be even just going on to people's farms to get stock gallery and building my business that way so people are always always willing to help the best they can quite often um network so view every encounter or crummy phase of life as a chance to network as i think we can all probably agree that there are many times that someone came across your life and they served much bigger purpose than you ever thought they would um and people will surprise you so there's a lot of times that the people i thought would support me maybe are not the biggest supporters or the people you had no ideas no idea would be your biggest supporter will cheer you on immensely so this photo i particularly love because this was a job i did on the side of one of my last nine to five jobs i like i said did not feel fulfilled in what i was doing so i would milk on the side in addition to what i was doing there are many times i sat in this or when i was milking in this parlor that i would run through my head should i quit should i not what am i going to do with my life um and this photo was actually taken on one of the very first articles that i had written and photographed so that's just one example of how the little things that you don't even realize will contribute to your life down the road and then these other two images are from one of the final places i've been employed and they have been huge supporters in my path um not only in photography but in also allowing me to come and hop in a tractor whenever i can on their farm just to allow that balance in my life failure there are many versions of it i have failed many times and i will fail many more times this is a very minor failure of crashing my drone but every single time i've failed it's been an opportunity for growth and there's always some pretty good laughs out of it in the end um so you have to be ready that you're going to fail strategy so incorporating workflows or efficiencies wherever you can i think any business owner will tell you to do that as soon as you can it allows you to better have have better control of your business and for example this past fall i was able to hire someone part-time to go through wedding galleries so that it allowed me more time to photograph and focus on what i strive at um another question i know that's been asked is how has the evolving industry opened up a door um in my business and i would say that the industry is really focusing on the importance that photography brings to our business and there's amazing farmers out there so it does not take much to be able to photograph that and highlight our industry well so investment you are going to have to invest a lot of time and money into your business and i strongly encourage you to be reminded that not all skill sets are learned in the classroom i know i've learned a lot from many other people and research that has not necessarily ended in a certificate or a diploma or anything in the end there's constant ways to always be learning so tips you are always going to improve there's always learn to there's always room to grow i know when i started my instagram page three years ago i thought people are going to think i am so silly i am just sharing images from our farm and i know it's not a big deal in the instagram world but the fact that there's 3 400 people that i know and some that are complete strangers that support my path is pretty cool um so you have to do what makes you happiest and follow your gut i know if i listen to what everyone had told me i would be miserable in a nine-to-five job but i would have benefits at the end of the day so those are all things that i'm willing to compromise to be happy at the end of the day and my path has definitely changed a lot over the time i'm happy to say that i have reached what i once considered success and still do even though that's my definition is going to change many times probably i'm able to work with animals crops and at the end of the day i believe there's times where i capture a moment that lasts much beyond that moment so these three pictures here just show how i get to be in the fields or working with people all the time and i definitely love it so in conclusion it won't be easy but it'll be worth it and i am happy to say that my role within the industry is narrating today's great passion for tomorrow's legacy so that is my advice for you on the path that i have so far traveled wonderful thank you very much for that jody um and it's been fun to follow along your journey since you did start so um next up we've got jonathan gerais as i mentioned before from elite agri solutions jonathan the floor is yours for the next 10 or so minutes wonderful so i'm going to talk about my process and how i got to where i am today so where i started i grew up on a small bee farm i worked for free until i was 15 and at that point i got a job on another dairy farm and i think that's where i developed a lot of my work ethic but i was always sort of doing side jobs and trying to find side income one of the first of those was oil undercoating on the farm it was a great job because it was paid by the job uh and minimal investment so for a couple grand i had a hoist and a barn painter and i could uh oil undercoat vehicles quite uh quite efficiently uh if i had everything properly scheduled and enough customers so you can make a couple grand a day doing oil undercoating drebros trucking was my brother's brainchild uh we did this all throughout my high school and then to the start of university so at one point we had both our one tons on the road that gmc there and then another transport uh but in 2008 the recession sort of drove down the trucking prices and a lot of guys were bidding jobs just keep trucks rolling so we sort of stepped out of that industry i ended up getting an environmental management degree i didn't think i could get into farming so i figured this would be the next best thing i could sort of work outside i get a good job is what i was told i remember when i graduated i applied to clean harbors and they called and wanted me to come around tanker for him and i was really confused because i didn't apply to be a truck driver for them and they informed me that they were going to pay me 10 bucks for an hour to use my azad as opposed to using my degree so i figured if i was going to drive truck might as well go to alberta so i ended up out there back in 20 probably within 2014 uh working in the oil field i hit my life goal as far as what i was going to make in a year i'd sort of set that goal is i want to make this before i retire and i hit that at 26 and it sort of shattered my ideologies obviously i wasn't aiming high enough uh one thing i really liked about the oil field was i was surrounded by bad role models if i want to know what not to do there's plenty of examples and at this point i started looking at self-employment options and work-life balance so this is a picture for my health card from the year that i broke my uh sort of salary goals and that's well is the result of 100 hour weeks and sort of living out of convenience stores but i i had a good good salary and a good income so my more notable failed businesses uh finishing burns before i got into broilers i looked at putting up a finishing bar and the bank wouldn't back me an abattoir happened and i think it would have been 2015. i actually got approved for the loan on that property went to the bank sat down to sign the paperwork and decided it was probably a bad idea the owner had pulled the training off the table so i was just a brand guy with no food experience or processing experience looking at buying an avatar so i walked away from that last year i ran a test on peat moss so i've got organic broilers organic manure and i figured i could sell that buy the bag off the farm i was terribly wrong at the end of the test i had sold 10 bags to my mother and thankfully i didn't deposit the check because it ended up killing all their plants big john enterprises is a job for a company i started when i was at west the company shifted us to it uh 20 on 10 off rotation so i figured out my days off i drive back to ontario with the load with my pickup grab something here and bring it back did one run the guy ended up not paying me so the claim to fame on that company was one job uh one lawsuit the only reason i made any money is i was able to double out on the purchase price of the trailer i bought bookkeeping with elite back when we were first getting going and i was trying to bring on full-time employees uh this was one avenue that we thought would even at workflow had an employee with that experience she was on board offered her substantial raise and sort of launched into the public uh she ended up finding a different career path so that quickly failed uh bee farming uh i've tried a few different avenues on that and so far i've not had success and i've had hundreds of other ideas over the years so what are we doing now or a quick overview of myself so i have a bachelor of bioresource from the university of guelph i'm a nationally certified safety officer i'm certified to complete nutrient management plans i've been a poultry producer since 2016. so if we look at that track record that degree was essentially useless with that experience uh becoming an ncso was rather cheap it was only about 1500 bucks in courses and it sort of made my degree and my work experience look on purpose and when i came home i became certified for nutrient management and that sort of started me on my path of consulting with an ag so elite agree solutions is a company that i started back in 2017 our services are nutrient management plans grant writing and business support so the grant writing we just find farmers that are trying to take on projects do all the paperwork and then if they do get approved for cost share funding we take small percentage business support we are establishing a niche in the professional level uh business plans for farmers and we've taken on quite a bit more than i ever knew were needed in the industry safety training and consulting uh so that's my oil field background i'm bringing that to egg and constantly trying to find ways to make it easier on farm to implement and then since 2019 we've been a dealer for thunderstruck so this is a picture that jody took of our team back in august since then we've actually taken on three more employees so the question is why be self-employed so if we ask google it says that it gives you the freedom to decide when and where you will work and to set a schedule that allows you to work at times that best fit your needs i would say that's a lie i consider entrepreneurship a little bit more like a 100 meter spin except it's got hurdles at the length of a marathon and then once you finish you start again with higher stakes so what i could say as uh suggestions or advice is learn to love the process learn to love the problem solving in the daily fight learn to be comfortable in the uncomfortable and as an entrepreneur you're moving into a storm in the middle of a storm or just coming out of the storm at all times so if things are going good don't coast it'll get worse one thing that's definitely helped me over the years is uh i'm an avid reader so i'm always trying to constantly learn quicker than the business allows so what can i learn through a book or through somebody else or through reading their study that will help the company what has changed in agriculture that has really impacted my business i'm gonna say paperwork and legislation so i myself have to undergo a number of audits every year uh and i've got processes in place i've read the regulations i review them and almost every year an auditor says i have a non-compliance for something that they passed me for last year and it's incredibly frustrating so i can't imagine how the average farmer uh as far as organization is able to get through those or how frustrated they must be throughout the process and legislation every time we turn around it seems the government is adding another level of bureaucracy to what we're doing so challenges and successes i think one of the biggest things is being raised on a farm i heard a quote where it says farm kids average 10 years of work experience by the time they get their first full-time job going big enough that you can't save yourself with a day job so i remember the day when i was building my barn that i realized i couldn't service my dad was just my day job i'd written three checks that were bigger than my annual salary and i realized if i didn't get that barn going didn't get producing that i would lose the farm and now with elite we're busy enough that i'm completely dependent on other employees now a small filing task changing the way some of our information is stored can take hundreds of hours to change over so the question is now that we're dependent on employees and i'm getting better at managing larger projects what can we take on i definitely say living frugally is definitely key and quite cheap by nature and when i moved back from alberta i had no debt other than the farms that i own and we're competing in a world where people measure wheats in 40 hour chunks so if you're working substantially more than 40 hours and taking on different tasks and learning aggressively how much quicker you can learn and grow and the other thing is reframing risk as far as what the risk you're actually taking are and what the implications are tips and advice for a new business or supplementing farm income don't romanticize entrepreneurship i feel like there's a lot of people getting into starting your own company because i think it's going to be fun definitely not for the first few years it doesn't have to be your higher purpose it doesn't have to be something to dream about i just sort of find stuff that i can take pride in and take pride in the process i do ask what uh what are strategic advantages as far as people come to me and sort of say oh it's difficult or i don't know how to do this and very quickly almost everybody has an advantage over their neighbor you just have to dive in and figure out what it is and my niche my whole life has just been to find jobs other people dislike and take pride in them to get paid well to do it this is just the first job that i happen to be able to stay clean at but the biggest thing is being optimistic i see opportunity everywhere i go maybe to a fault i now need to make my plans in a year in advance so i don't get distracted by other opportunities there's such a fine line between appropriate diversification and shiny object syndrome but some big questions that we should maybe ask is whether you should be self-employed uh there's a large percentage of society that maybe shouldn't take that into their own hands and if you have a trade or you're high paid at your day job maybe you should just work some more hours or work at advancing off the chain uh and that might be a good way to make extra income easiest ways to grow a farm definitely start with inheriting one if you have that option can't do that marrying into one is definitely the next easiest way and then if you absolutely have to make income off firm and then invest in the farm as it allows uh i think that's the easiest way to grow your land base how to start a side company start yesterday there's never going to be a right time or a perfect time bootstrap it you don't need to buy anything to start i started this company off the offices on off the back my house and then ended up in the chicken burn for a couple years we've now just in the fifth year invested in an office space i test the market just like my peat moss situation i thought that would be a home run tested the market it wasn't so i stopped and then being open to changes being willing to fail and move on if it doesn't work and perfection is the enemy of success your first few jobs aren't going to be perfect just get them done so our next steps at elite we've launched a complete online health and safety portal and training system for our farmers so we can now support farmers completely digitally and remotely uh which is gonna really allow us to take on a lot more work and a lot more training in the coming year this new program that we're unrolling all will also help us support farmers with hr and many other items so our goal over the next 12 months is to build the most in-depth most in-depth training resource in the world available for farmers any questions all right maybe what we can do is jump in i know um in the chat box we've got a few uh questions coming through right now so by all means if you do have one uh add it to the chat box there's also a poll up right now at the bottom of the screen that do you currently have an off farm income which um you know certainly is just kind of a curious question i i will say because i know uh jody and jonathan you don't see the same chat box i do that very real awesome was coming from dan ferguson and if you know dan that is top marks from a guy like that um both very impressive individuals congrats on your success so far says steve the questions come in too and maybe i'll start with you jody and then flip to jonathan is has covid changed anything for your business growth yes i would say volvid has definitely i would say there's a point within my business when you say that you're a photographer that opens the floodgates to any kind of photography um and as much as i love photographing families and weddings during covid farming was one of the few essential things that we were able to complete so i would say it definitely helped me focus my page and my business on what i love at the end of the day anyways um so that has been one thing and another portion that google has kind of pushed is it allowed me some time to play around some different things and this past year i launched an online shop which was just a fun way to put some images that i take on the farm and allow some people to be able to buy items like that jonathan how has it impacted you at all absolutely so one of the biggest things is not having the trade shows which is where we met a lot of our customers and then with health and safety uh when kovitz sort of started last month or april uh all the work that we had booked and the vast majority of our training is before spring uh it all got cancelled so we essentially uh didn't have that same safety training sales that we had the year before the nice thing is now that we've sort of survived we've launched the online option which should really help and now that training that we missed out on last year we're getting it all booked and getting it all in place before this spring all right and then just because we're running short on time i'm going to combine a couple of these questions here is um you know certainly uh you know one came through that was talking about you know how do you make that decision to quit that nine to five job knowing that you know you've got bills to pay or a mortgage or a farm or whatever it is how do you take that leap is it worth um you know just kind of starting it on the side first or would you recommend jumping in um you know both feet and then from that moment when you first started them to today what's growth look like for you going forward jonathan do you want to kick things off uh i definitely think don't quit your day job until you have sales if you're only working 40 50 hours a week you should be able to do another 40 to 50 hours until you get your company off the ground and if you can't get to the point that you're most the way they are covering all your bills i wouldn't quit your day job um as far as growth uh so i guess the question is about growth rate now yeah just growth what how do you see things going obviously you know starting 40 hours kind of evenings and weekends um you know to where you're you've obviously you know you've piled on the work now what do things look like going forward for you in the company uh so i think the biggest thing is building until you're overwhelmed and then finding an employee that can take on that task very very well uh not sort of what we've done over and over at the beginning it was just an administrator now we have a nutrient management person now we have multiple health and safety people and now we've just added somebody else just to sort of take the overflow in the office but it's sort of pushing it until everybody's overwhelmed and then bringing out somebody else to specialize jody um yeah i would say uh to johnny's point um i worked a lot of hours on the weekend to the point that it was constant sales and it got to the point that um as much as i loved being in the field and on the farm that was something i couldn't necessarily juggle anymore i had to make a decision of what was going to take priority so that was the point that and i will admit that i am a younger individual within the industry and i was in a very good position at the time to be young not have a mortgage not have those things and that was where the portion of regret came in i didn't want to when i was i didn't want to walk past this opportunity and in another 20 years wish i would have tried it at this point in my life so i had enough business that i could foresee being able to make it work and i had told myself i will do it as long as it works and so far three years later it's still working so i think definitely what johnny said you can put a lot of hours into a business on the side to know whether it's going to take off or not thanks very much jonathan thanks very much jody we very much appreciate the time this afternoon um on this session again sponsored by the ontario federation of agriculture coming up next we've got the top 10 agronomy insights leicester roast beef dinner sponsored by maizex seeds that's coming up right now", "GWfymtruGxo": "alright Rick Simpson stories coming on about the raid next supposed to be on Brunswick this morning well the medical marijuana debate is igniting across North America and believe it or not one of the key battlegrounds is in the tiny community of mechanic Nova Scotia a man there has been giving away a marijuana extract local residents and some others around the world believe it's a cure for cancer and many other diseases but now Rick Stinson is hiding out in Amsterdam fearing if he returns home he will be arrested on the spot here's Global's Devens people if I go back to Canada they will write down charge me an L put me in jail it all surrounds this thick black hemp oil Rick Simpson has been making it from marijuana buds for years but while in Amsterdam last week RCMP raided his property and I know they won't give me bail because I'm not like a three-time loser and if I go to jail with no bail and no medicine it'll probably kill me I'm not willing to commit suicide for mr. Harper [Music] you [Music] and I was a young boy growing up I was proud to be a Canadian we were beloved around the world for our efforts World War two and our reputation as being generous compassionate [Music] Canada was a world leader showing the strength of our ancestor and our innovative nature uniting a country through all its different terrains and all its different people [Music] in this fast beautiful [Music] but was it all an illusion over time the Canada that I knew began to change it seems that policy began taking precedence over people [Music] I heard stories of a man in on the Nova Scotia who claimed to have killed people of cancer using cannabis [Music] have the government suppress cure for cancer and had it been discovered right here in Eastern Canada I'm not sure if I believed it at first but I did have the opportunity to meet miss Pam coming up the Rick Simpsons house it's been gone for quite a while it's a great thing that he's back and we get a chance to talk to him here it's always a hard drive way to kid he'd almost died right by it never know it we're when this driveway used to be just full of cars every time I come hey there big guy just so I'll be leaving again another day or two the story really begins in 1969 when my 22 year old cousin was diagnosed with cancer they did an operation and then afterwards I believe they give him chemo and he dropped from 200 pounds down to 120 pounds then three years later in 1972 well that actually the doctors had said at the time they thought they got it all but three years later in 1972 he came home on vacation and we were talking one day and he collapsed right in front of me and I suspected it was probably the cancer back but I was hoping it wasn't and of course he went back to Ontario and as soon as he wouldn't seen the doctors they just said you've got three or six months to live so he came back to Spring Hill and within three months he was dead and I watched him grate down to about 55 pounds it was just horrible my cousin was more like a brother to me we grew up together in the country we knew each other intimately so it really affected me quite badly and then about three years later I was leaving work one day I worked at All Saints Hospital in Spring Hill I just got in the car and I turned on the radio and the local radio station in Amherst CK th-they were reading a report on the radio station of the THC the active ingredient in marijuana killing cancer cells and of course the announcer was laughing like a fool when he was making these statements so I didn't know whether to take it seriously or not but you know time went on and I never heard nothing more about THC killing cancer cells or anything so I thought it was just some type of hoax in 1997 I had a severe head injury at work I wound up with what they call a post concussion syndrome my head rings 24 hours a day then that in turn that brings your blood pressure up I had a lot of balance issues from the injury and things like that so I mean I went through the medical system I took their pills for five years I took every chemical he threw at me but they did nothing but make me worse and then in 1998 well 1998 about a year after I was injured I've seen an episode of the nature of things with dr. David Suzuki called reefer madness - and it showed all these people on there smoking pot for their medical problems and they were being helped that was you know quite desperate so I'm a note and I got some pot from the friends I you know nearby and I smoked it and it did more for me than anything the doctors are giving me so I went to back to the doctor's every doctor I seen I asked them for prescriptions for him but not one doctor would give me a prescription then in 1999 I was in my doctor's office and when I was talking to him I course I was always asking for a prescription and again he refused me but I asked the doctor that day when I was in there I said you know what would you think if I in you know as opposed to smoking the plant material what would you think if I made the essential oil of the plant and ingested it and the doctor said that that would be a much more medicinal way to use the substance but he still wouldn't give me a prescription this is all grown in now this was all this was all plans then in 2001 they called me into his office they told me that they'd give me everything that they had to offer and nothing was helping me so I was on my own and again I asked the doctor for a prescription for him again I was refused and I mean the doctor knew that this was the only thing that was helping me and he also knew that if I was caught with with hemp that I would be charged as a criminal because he didn't give me a prescription so you know I was kind of left between the devil and the deep blue sea I mean what am I supposed to do so much happening all these other countries there's nothing going to happen here unless forced now I didn't know anything about what the oil would do I was very afraid of this substance in the beginning you know I mean I knew smoking pot was wasn't harmful but but this oil is really it's a concentrate you know it's a very powerful concentrate I just you know started taking ul on a steady basis and I started getting more sleep so you but the condition I have the ringing in the head 24 hours it stops you from sleeping and all the pills they gave me they couldn't give me they never gave me one pill that would put me to sleep so the oil really was working miracles for me in that way and what happened it started I started losing all this weight and it was scary in the beginning because I thought you know like it was hurting me but my weight dropped from about 185 190 down to 160 and then it just leveled off and my arthritis in my knees that disappeared like in 2002 I went to see the doctor about this in cancer I had I had three areas I had one here in my cheek and one of my chest and one right there by my eye and I always I had these things from the night since the 1990s and I always suspected that they were probably skin cancer so when the doctor looked at them I mean he told me he said I can't be sure until I get the pathology report back but he said it does look like skin cancer and they were really concerned with that one next to my eye so that you know because the proximity to the eye could cause a lot of problems so they scheduled me to go in have that when removed first and then I was to go in at a later date and have the other two removed so I went in I think was around the end of January 2003 and they operate it right here on the eye and it was about a week after the operation I was sitting home and I got this magnified mirror and I was looking at you know where they had done the operation and of course it was infected I was sitting there looking at the area where they had operated and that's when that report I'd heard on the radio popped back into my head about THC you know killing cancer cells and I'd heard that back in the 70s well by that time I had been taking you out for about a year you know and it helped me in many ways like my thinking processes had cleared up you know I was pretty well back to normal but I really didn't think you know where I'd been taking the oil for so long I thought well THC killed cancer well I didn't acure my cancer well you know why do I still have this and I hate to say it but I almost didn't do it I almost didn't apply the oil I thought you know if the medical system if there was a cure for cancer surely the medical system would be using it that that was my assumption at the time I had the oil right there anyway because I was ingesting it to help me sleep so I just took a little bit of oil and I put a little bit on bandages two bandages and I put one on the cheek and one on my chest I never felt a thing you know before that I was getting these sensations like I had splinters in my face and as soon as I put the oil on that sensation went away but there was there was no feeling that anything was happening so four days later I had the I left the bandages in place for four days and then I went down to the bathroom and when I took the bandages off I was just shocked because it was all healed it was just pink skin on both most places and of course then I started telling my friends you know like I cured my cancer with marijuana her oil made from the cannabis plant plant and people just laughed at me you know like you're crazy after a few weeks of people laughing at me they turned this one that they had surgically removed it came right back and I watched it develop and that same swelling in the bleeding in the the splitter a feeling in the face so I just put a little dab oil to bandage put it on there left it on for four days when I removed it was all healed just pink skin now that's this is 2012 that was back in 2003 when I did the early early 2003 when I did this I've never retreated these spots so once I I seen this one heal up then I went down to my doctor's office because they had taken a sample when they when they done the operation so I went down to get the pathology report when I went in and I asked the doctor's wife she was the receptionist the doctor's wife so I asked her for a copy of the report and I looked at it and it said write on the report basal cell carcinoma that's skin cancer so I told her that day I said that you know the that cancer had returned and so I explained to her that I had cured that cancer and the other two using hemp oil and the minute I said hemp oil the woman just went ballistic I mean I was in my doctor's waiting room there was five or six other patients there and as soon as I said hemp oil you could just see her like she hunched she was like that and the doctor will not go there the doctor will not prescribe this you know and she was doing it very loudly and matter-of-fact I for a little while there I thought the woman was some kind of in that case so I got in my truck that day and I on the way home I was it was a really strange feeling trying to figure you know what are these people doing I mean if I was a doctor and a patient of mine came in and said that they had cured their cancer I would be interested in it but this doctor and his wife had no interest in it so it smelled kind of fishy to me I didn't really know what to do at that point you know I had no choice I had to stay on the oil because it's the only medication that worked for me and right after I visited my doctor's office I went down and seen my mother and she had weeping psoriasis on her foot and lower leg and so we used the oil to heal that I started supplying oil you know like the different people I knew was skin condition I started offering the oil to people I knew and it it was working on everything and then more people like their friends would come so it was building and building all the time I started a campaign in 2003 to alert the government I mean I went to all the political parties I went to the Cancer Society we even went to the United Nations we went everywhere about this you know nobody would lift a finger how long to take the plan all that Oh we worked two or three days you know actually longer than that because I built up some of the beds and raised them up a bit so the plants would grow better but there was a lot of work went into it and some of my patients come over and they help me plant it so I didn't do it just alone but it was quite an effort more like a community effort than anything else right wow that's pretty incredible well when the patient's seen what the medicine would do they backed it 2005 I came in contact with Rick Dwyer over here at the Legion in Mac and I had treated a lady with cancer and she had told Rick about you know how she was cancer-free and what had cured her so Rick Dwyer wanted to meet me so when I went over Rick and I we had a good talk and then he went with me because at that time I was actually treating people in their homes so when Rick Dwyer seen what the oil was doing himself and he knew some of the patients also so when Rick seen it himself we decided that it you know that the Legion should do something about this so Rick get in touch with George decline at maritime command in Halifax and he told them about this and matter of fact he contacted and I believe three times you know to do something about this because all the membership of the branch 134 over here in Matt can they were behind this even even the executive they had put a letter out in the paper that you know we wanted to do an honest and open review of this medicine and we invited the police the the doctors the Cumberland Health Authority all of them you know come to the meeting and I was gonna bring patients but that first that never happened you have to watch yourself because some of this was built up here in that where I was planning so how long it's been almost two years since you've been here 2009 was the last crop that was there was only about a hundred and fifty plants in 2009 in the back yard once I put 250 in but I had to take out the mail so that only left about about 150 and before that like I said 2006 there was 1100 2005 there was 1600 and then in 2003 I had I think it was about 135 down by the river you know down off my land but it was down by the river and that was that's the year they did the first rate well I never hit anything I openly stated rate in the video that we shot in 2005 that I was going to grow the plant straight in my backyard I made no secret of it and I told everyone what it was for it was fermented medicinal use for whoever needed it I put 1620 plants in my backyard in 2005 I sent the RCMP a videotape may 6 2005 I took the videotape in as a matter of fact Rick Dwyer came with me and videoed me giving it to the RCMP because I didn't want them saying that they never received it and I also gave them some paperwork asking that local politicians be charged with criminal negligence causing death so three months later on August 3rd 2005 the police came in and raided me I really thought that you know the government would take an interest and within a matter of six months I figured this medicine would be becoming available but instead they did just the opposite they they persecuted me and it was just horrifying when I when I realized you know what they were all about oh they put on quite a show here you know one of them you actually stayed here on the deck with me a female officer stayed here on the deck with me while her fellow officers were down there cutting the the cannabis down and she told me right there on the deck that day she said I believe everything you're saying and I just looked at her and I said you know this cures cancer I said you know what are you doing where are your morals you know your friends are down there cutting down the cure for cancer for God's sakes know what's wrong with you people then she just clammed up she wouldn't talk anymore how many treatments did you lose like do you figure oh well Dave you just take the numbers alone I mean when you look at the 1,620 plants in 2005 another 1,100 planes in 2006 well you're talking hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of treatments you know that people didn't get and I was giving it away for nothing and people were waiting for that did you oh yes yes a lot of people are waiting in 2006 when the RCMP came in again and did just the second rate year third grade then actually the community was outraged you know that's when we decided to call the meeting and invite you know the health of the Health Authority everyone in the police the doctors all of them bring them in here's the patients now let's have an open conversation about this but the day that was to take place the Royal Canadian Legion maritime command with the aid of the RCMP they came in and they shut our local Legion branch down so it just blew my mind you know when you look at the the Legion zone handbook it says you know they're there to represent the interests of veterans and their families you know so they should have done something about this but instead they got right in bed with the government and went along with shutting the Legion down and everything and that's the reason I've stated that as far as I'm concerned the Royal Canadian Legion is a total fraud it should be disbanded and the same goes for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police because there was only one word for them and that's pathetic I know we need police but we need policemen that you can respect I have no respect for these people anybody that's out there raiding medicinal users and taking their medicine how can you respect them in mccann Nova Scotia this oil is gaining a reputation as a miracle drug extracted from marijuana plants Rick Simpson has been making it and giving it to friends and neighbors he calls it hemp oil others know it as we dial in small doses he says it makes you well without getting you high well you can't deny your own eyes Kenya no here's somebody dying from cancer they're not dying anymore here's somebody that had something else well they're cured and this is what's doing it the McCann branch of the Royal Canadian Legion was impressed - so impressed it hosted meetings like this one aimed at spreading the word about hemp oil but when they planned a big public meeting higher-ups at the Legion shut them down provincial kind man came here the day of the meeting and they come in they lock the doors and then I come into the air and I had to our CMP officers here that told me I was not allowed on the property they're using royal the Royal Canadian Legion it's named its instincts and insignias and the buildings - as a platform to promote the use of hemp oil as a medicinal drug I don't care if these medicine comes from a tomato plant a potato plant or a hemp plant if the medicine safe and helps and works why not use it for Rick Dwyer it's an emotional issue one of the Testaments to heavens healing power is his father the military veteran suffering from lung cancer last time I didn't know but they said I was going to die in 24 hours what I didn't so I took - but the Legion isn't budging they've suspended the entire executive of this branch along with any activities planned for the building until they install a new management team there is no provincial or federal regulation which states that this marijuana can be grown and produced into hemp oil for medicinal purposes and therefore it's illegal as far as the province is concerned and the Royal Canadian Legion does not back illegal operations Simpson has had trouble with the law the RCMP confiscated 1,600 marijuana plants from his backyard last year plants he claims were grown for medicinal purposes a court case is unresolved and so are questions within the Legion about whether hemp oil is medicine or menace that goes against the general bylaws of the Royal Canadian Legion what I did I'm proud of what I did I'm proud of it and for now since the Legion is the town's only meeting place getting the word out about hemp oil will prove to be more difficult in mccann Nova Scotia this is Global Nationals Ross Lord reporting this is all covered in and Wharf pictures of our pictures of our veterans and everything in here was this office we used to some of us would come down here and this whole office and and figure out you know what he's gonna do fundraisers and stuff we had a lot of fundraisers here for the community like for sick people and and stuff like that we would put a lot on further and he said how long you were in illusion loves 20 years I had my 20 year panic in 1995 I became president and I was secretary for a short term past president for 10 years I also was Pingo chairman at one time entertainment chairman so pretty well yeah I'm very proud to be one at that time I guess we did really did a lot here at this Legion for the help the community and we accomplished a lot of things here we I like what you said there about being the government watchdog because this is where it was really put to the test and that's where failed yeah well we are the government watchdog the Royal Canadian Legion is here to protect everything that the soldiers fought and died for and continue to do today and that's our Charter of Rights in their constitution our freedom of speech and and our right to question our government and to actually call them in and say hey you know what's going on here like you know these we got a problem here has to look Royal Canadian Legion members here want to know why why that you people haven't answered mr. Simpson back like way I mean why does this ever after I have to come to the Legion like why did this have to come to us you know this man this man had discovered something there can be no question about that we want to know why you folks haven't checked this out something that's important you know I mean people's health you know and I'm you'd have to be a complete imbecile to to think that that this man if he's some kind of criminal I really don't want to try to make him out to be would be going all over Cumberland County contacting politicians and contacting medical people on everything across the country he didn't hide anything and this is what amazed me at first when when he first came to us and I looked at the amount of people that he had contacted in the country I thought wow you know these people not one of them I mean he wrote letters they answered him back but nobody ever came to check out to see if there was any validity to what he would say but when he came here you know I was talking to the executive and I said you know this guy's discovered something I can tell you that because I talked to a number of his patients and and he's showing me like the Guzman studies and the Virginia studies and and all these other studies and so I mean I think basically what they were all thinking at that time is he had a great he had to create nine education because I know I thought of that at the time I said well how do you know all this stuff like you know you're not a doctor and he he said he had cancer you know on us here and over here and there and Who am I to say he wasn't telling he had his pathology reports that said he had basis all carcinoma mr. Cecil hike was the same way and others so he come here told us basically what what he was going through and basically his father was a veteran and I felt an obligation and so did the rest of us here at the time but then you turn around and and you say hey you know we have a right to send these people letter and ask them to come in let's check this out let's see if there's anything to this but then events seemed to get out of hand like you know he was trying to keep this thing you know in hand here by corresponding and you know being as polite as we could but I come to the point where it's starting to get frustrating and and so I just kind of said to the executive there you know like come on now guys for God's sakes you know if this is this is all true which it appears to be you know how many Canadians are you know suffering here with these these problems that this that's again it amazed me is like I said to my family doctor I said look I'm no doctor but I'm not blind I can see cancer on somebody's face disappearing you don't have to be a doctor to see that and say hey was it this oil that that cured I died and then he put the oil on somebody else's cancer and it would do the same well you got a logically you got to start thinking well it was either that or like cured it up or this man's got some kind of godlike powers that heal these people up you know and basically I said no it's the oil is the oil doing this it wasn't unusual to see you know four or five six pairs in my yard that was quite quite normal for around here I had a I had a very large clientele yeah like I said it wasn't about the money I mean if I had the medicine and I if I could grow the plants and produce the medicine I was giving it away but the man got so great and with the police you know taking my crops the only other thing you could do then was to go out and buy the the material needed from local growers so a lot of the time I acted like more like the middleman between the patients and you know and the growers I was arrested I was charged with trafficking possession and cultivation you know I mean well I had to I had to cultivate the medicine or the plants to make the medicine and to give it to people I had to possess the medicine and as for trafficking well if you look at the dictionary definition of trafficking it says the exchange of goods for monetary gain I didn't gain anything there was so it really wasn't trafficking I mean I was giving the medicine away but of course the legal system they have a different definition for trafficking so this law went on I mean I started then down the road through the court through that or through the legal system in Canada and that's a horrifying experience believe me [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] baby babe [Music] [Applause] [Music] I hope travel to pray I have step [Music]"}
