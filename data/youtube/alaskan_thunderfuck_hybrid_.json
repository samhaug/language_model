nuts what's a comma he's the only thing I don't do and I'm stoned has come the only thing I don't do when I am stoned see it again the only thing I don't only thing guys do are you smoking something I don't you saying you're always coming when you're when I'm sober I can't stop coming indica or sativa sativa indica sativa indica 60 million Americans suffer from insomnia and indica helps reduce that what are you gonna say to those Americans life is short why the would you sleep through any of it maybe if we had fewer lazy people in this country they can actually enjoy a decent strain I think sativa is for the productive mind I don't believe that you smoke weed oh I I do very much smoke weed but I don't smoke that it would in the couch  no in the car no no that's how you remember in the car you're in the car become the couch in it why are you defending this so you guys smoke that young Republican sativa weed I smoke this stuff that keeps me awake and paranoid and paranoia is a survival trick you you guys need to calm down you need to perk up well that's kind of sexist no it is sexist so you guys smoke weed to keep you prepared for a win they say whenever someone's behind you and that's often the case no one was there ok back to basics if you ask me do I want to chill out or do I want my brain to be running running running through a field I'm gonna say I want to chill out and I think most of us probably late to chill if we get a choice what's the point of school then school tells us to think sativa does the job for us the construction of a school day is crazy year you have to do your homework well I think we all agree school sucks that's not what's on the table right now school doesn't suck it sucks when you're not on sativa so you were high throughout school how are you not how did you make it through school sativa and if I smoked indica I would be in on the floor like a stupid jackass in the floor you smoke weed and then you think about every relationship that you ever had in your life and all the people that you've touched and all the people that you've heard and also how all everyone doesn't really like you that much and that you're a burden and then you work on that and you journal about that and it sounds like your problems are um are a little bigger than wheat and it's a downward spiral sure you think real dark thoughts it's a piece of time to go through but at least you're thinking smoke in the cut you go in in the prison see there's also just a sexier word sativa you get into I don't know if you want to do that what were you doing touching my nipples and by the way I'm only wearing a shirt on this show because I have to do the again now don't do it for Jordan Jordan loves this he loves nipples he wants you to love sativa you don't have to he will have to do the things that he says name another thing the two of you agree on is this it is that all you have we love you both rock a small pause oh yeah that's neither here nor there we enjoy we have big joints and that's the point you think a penis is a joint wait no no we have big joints your big elbows and a small dick you have an elbow on him it isn't a joint it has a joint your penis has been and yours doesn't like a Bionicle yeah like a Bionicle so your dick is like a bent leg oh wait okay do you worry that maybe there's been so much sativa in your life that your dicks are now right angles my penis doesn't necessarily have bad posture it's just like always in downward dog don't word Bulldog give yourself some credit our Bulldog that's a smaller they're smaller but they're thick he's got like a can of Pepsi down there the dimensions on this are honestly a nightmare and I think we should move but am I the only High one here yeah you're not with a comma Jay's the only thing I don't do when I'm stoned has come the only thing I don't do when I'm stoned say it again the only thing I don't only thing I do I thing I don't know you smoke a lot thing I don't do it scum what does that mean I come when I was you saying you're always coming when you're not stoned but just always coming no it's just that the only thing he doesn't do when these fires come when I'm sober I can't stop coming and why you're high you can't start that's why I had the confidence to wear shorts today cuz you know you're not gonna come dry as a whistle the shape of the sativa leaf finger like leaves yeah I think we can all agree that's creepy as fingers are terrifying so if you have to choose between a freaky finger II kind of spooky warming leaf and sort of a cool not gonna freak you out leave I think you're gonna go for the one that's not spidering gonna wake you up in it what's wrong with spooky woman okay listen to this you wake up in the middle of the night Jordan okay it's dark it's darkest and it's earring there's no sound usually there's a car outside your house yeah what's you wish you can't see anything and behind your head Oh God you feel like a tinkling tinkling spindle II finger come behind your ear and trace the outline of your ear with her spindle II finger mom where why are you here are you scared it's a woman spooky or is she fine where are you scared that she's gonna grab your neck so the idea is that that spooky finger is more like sativa and indica sort of like someone just kissing your cheek and falling asleep next to you like a soft hug mom why are you in the couch now that has nothing to do with marijuana I'm touching your nipples here I'm touching a lot more touching the nipple stop it like how was your shirt loose but your nipples so prominent well because I had the sound guy on me putting the wire through here you can't not get excited if you got soft nipples then you're all soulless people just how long are they do you know much whatever bullies and the internet will judge them essa like guys sound off in the comments if you guys think that these guys are bullies I think we're very nice why do you like him because so much what is so great about being a lazy ass sometimes being lazy is nice you get to be on the bottom during sex you don't have to do anything you get to sit there and barely move a muscle and you don't care because you're lazy that doesn't sound like like your partner is probably mad that they're into screwing dead people lazy I would like to be chilled out kind of days not the weeds notice what's the smoke why is this smooth Snoop Dogg's what is indica Snoop Dogg what is this you know the rapper Snoop Dogg rolling down the streets smokin dipping on gin and juice yeah

from outside but I can tell a piece of a nut broke off here and I can see crystals all the trichomes pretty sure my Springs rxe a large chocolate see now I can see that the try comes in their blue however I don't think that this has been cured long enough perhaps because I think it can develop a lot more dry clothes it looks like you can its they're hard notes kinda not as far as the softer not to get out say the density ratio when at five these are like so now it smells sweet just get to try this in our home eight ball cage brought to you by smart water and any broken bond by Google pipes calm collar now some such customers I say so myself they're cheap you want to check them out I got like the last two rebounds me because I would say first one was very good less than you a long time fell three stories from my old apartment all the way down onto a bush though in a bit of break that's pretty nuts actually and then I took a sharp stone stone you guys what I've noticed when trichomes don't fully develop what I think what I think is not fully - it is attorney just like that super Silver Haze I anyways what are you guys smoking on guys for you guys that how much you guys getting the Apes Lords I picked up this age that's nice you can tell usually with their dance when you get like a little bit when you used to see the nape like lots of legs but now these are you get a little bit since they're dense they weight about more this is quite sticky action actually this one you know I haven't noticed stickiness on the other ones maybe because I don't like this one even when I was splitting it like it's time to check this out again you can stick with that dirty screen in the end of meeting uncertain times it's kind of a lesson I've learned and now guess what happened this weekend guys I think this is home just just just a down stand on the full seven make my little song bonfire and while I was trapped it in I search we have the top part of class anyway footworks appears every video take it out smoothly choke it out this is also a sativa I haven't gotten any indica strings I'm usually get in because since I don't like to speak tastes awesome great a still taste it's not it's not bad let's take some she's kind of on I would expect the grandeur [ __ ] my mind yeah so far I feel ahead high signal taste 5-star taste this one kind of gets a little slower and more settled then the granddaddy perk did and it purpose man so let's see how long this lasts granddaddy perfect I lasted longer than I believe no not longer that purple as long as this one the bank granddaddy person followed by but I was anyways guys check it out signing out like comment and subscribe let me know what's up buddy guys indie guys though just let me know talk to me communicate I'll be coming back peace", "twhHSgpSxnk": "all right [Music] you", "eU1Vp97f9pM": "welcome to another episode of the highway everyone I'm Fred and today we are checking out some Alaskan Thunder [ __ ] from skunk skunk masters that I ordered a couple days ago alaskan thunder [ __ ] ATF also known as Matanuska Tundra Magnus Cavalli Thunder [ __ ] Thunder all kinds of names it's named that obviously because it's grown in it comes from the men let's go Valley uh in the Alaskan Northlands well that's what they say but there's also that from sega master seeds and it comes from in holland in 94 and that it's a original haze crossed with Northern Lights cross what's gone cross with Highland Oaxacan so there's also those saying that it is Russian ruderalis cross with I forgot what it is and Afghani so I'm not exactly sure but you can see it has a nice dark green color to it some purple hues it has that more conical sativa shape to it but there's a chunkiness to it that does kind of fly possibly some afghan or some indicate genetics but and I just dropped the bud but you could see I has some purple leaves on there but definitely time to got like a pungent earthy sweet smell some might I'd almost want to cook with honestly but I've already got so ground up here so why don't we go ahead and have a bowl I got the za burger with me assisting me today like it's pretty much become my regular piece since I got it so cheers everyone it was almost minty taste at first but then it gave way to like kind of like a white earth with maybe a pungent or like a white punch and sweet note I mean that was really interesting I'm gonna go ahead and have another bowl of that but this is a strain that um it is known to onset pretty quickly but it's also known to creep and intensify the onset for me is usually kind of euphoric um but they're just kind of building from there and then going down my body into a nice kind of relaxed mm-hmm you know just a relaxed body still not really your body still no but not quite a melt it's just a flow and it take mmm it's more like a warm vibrancy and it uh it definitely takes the pain out but cheers everyone it was a bigger hit so he kinda tickled the back of my throat more on the top of my my pep my palate with the kind like a tingle but it was more of a earthy pungent with a sweet note taste um didn't really detect like it's definitely good though and I am feeling it I mean this is strain we're in smaller doses you know moderate doses uh it can be very social very relaxing and can lead to a productive day but higher doses it's gonna kind of be incapacitating um it can get you a bit selected kind and it can space you out and if you're talking it can lead a discussion into rambling and your thoughts can kind of just kind of flow on you pretty quickly it it does release the creative juices if you will but cheers everyone sorry about that folks I had a pack that one a little bit bigger than I expected and well it got me hmm so I just had to pause for a second there and huh all right so yeah smaller doses can lead to a really awesome productive day and a very relaxed day too because it's a very chill mellow body stone it's not like one of those crazy get up and go ones its relaxed um but too much and it can just lead to rambling and just you know distraction but that's all the time I've got here on the highway thank you for joining me and I'll see you next time", "b_FNcQQJt6Y": "what's going on guys how the hell you dealing out there you're taking good care of yourself you're doing a good job of that I hope so back with another first listen every sunday sunday sunday yes i put up the first listens this is the first of a few or a couple of requests this is from the dear boy Sean and he had one for a band that I've a glee know the name but I've never heard anything from they are called the atomic [ __ ] wax and that sounds like a surf product to me some kind of a surfing product but alas no it is not it is a band the atomic [ __ ] wax so we're going to learn about the ban and he wanted to do Alaskan thunder [ __ ] so this should be very interesting whatever we're in for here I'll absolutely love that image there of the space Eve whatever it is space naked space lady with out in outer space I think it's fantastic but we'll learn about the atomic [ __ ] wax we listen to the song we see what we think does that sound like a fun idea for you it sounds fun to me so let's learn about them the atomic [ __ ] wax have sixty one thousand four hundred and twenty six monthly listeners to the Spotify account the top five songs so come on has 2 point 1 million place then the song we're doing today alaskan thunder podcast five hundred and sixty five thousand and thirty five plays number three is ice age hey baby and that's got three three hundred eighty seven thousand then you got this executioner and that has four hundred and seventy eight thousand place then you've got hippie speedball so these guys probably have a sense of humor I almost kind of want to say that they're going to be kind of a a slaw jerk or doom or stoner metal of some sort yeah because I just get this vibe that image there gives me the vibe that they they smoke a doob or two and have it have a have a gay old time with it let's look into albums from the atomic [ __ ] wax and see what they have done over the years and it looks like the song we're doing today comes album call force field and that came out in 2017 but they started with the album three it looks like in 2005 then they got Box riff 2006 you got tab for 2009 graviton 2015 so they're really slow with the foot in the album's out and then of course you've got force field let's see when that album came out 2017 and it came out December 2017 12 songs 34 minutes long so relatively quick play time maybe they're not stoner stoner gloom gloom doom let's look into relate an artist that gives us a hint to what they're all about you have nebula yeah you have hermano you got cowboys and Aliens yeah you got Foo Manchu and I know who fu-manchu's dozer that sounds like a band I've heard of before the truck fighters Alabama [ __ ] I've heard that name before fatso Jetson sounds vaguely familiar to me karma de burns spiritual beggars masters of reality they couldn't have named herself after Black Sabbath good day and a mondo generator and I have heard a mondo generator because I do believe the Olivera or the the the the base plan fella that that was in Queens of the Stone Age I believe that's his band mondo generator so let's look into the bio and see what these guys are all about and you have three gents here a perfect amount of people to be in some kind of a stoner sludge stone rock band you've got one day he's got the kinky curly hair the black t-shirt he's going what's up man and then you've got the guy probably the drummer short hair blonde in the middle and he's going yeah I'm gonna look straight into the camera and then you've got the other guy over on the side he's got kind of a he's got a bob haircut and a red t-shirt it looks like it's got a skull on it and it's and he's saying hey I'm here brother the atomic [ __ ] wax originated as a side project of Monster Magnet lead guitarist Edmund L okay that's that's interesting X Godspeed basis vocalist Chris cosmic and drummer Keith Ackerman all all three of them were by then veterans of the thriving New Jersey stoner rock scene and after almost seven years of jamming in their spare time the trio finally found time to record and release their self-titled debut album in the summer of 1999 specializing in the high-octane 70s bass hardrock confused with stabs of space rock and psychedelia characterized by Mundel explosive Tommy Bolin inspired guitar heroics yeah so there you go so I think that answered the question didn't it I think they're going to be stoner rock so without further ado Shawn time to get the nipple time to give you a taste of the old magic milk the the mother's milk the tasty good stuff I give you guys a taste I take a bigger taste we listen to Alaskan Thunder [ __ ] by atomic [ __ ] wack so I'm gonna make sure this volume is up so I don't do anything goofy here and I think I found the microphone on this on this camera here so it's time to get a taste of Alaska Thunder [ __ ] and here we go I'll put it under [Music] I thought it would be a slower beat then that base [Music] well they've got some dust Oprah sandstone rockers huh [Music] anyway [Music] yeah it's got a groove to it love that face [Music] devil a hot team [Music] wanna think it's everything I need yeah he's got some pretty good [Music] [Music] this up Thanks [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] definitely not slow and [ __ ] like I thought it was gonna be maybe this is one of the quicker up-tempo jams on the south [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] they just slow it down now [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] yeah you got the double bass going now [Music] kind of a double bass pedal this guy plays a four piece kit I bet my life on it I love that get more of that I love that give the drummer some [ __ ] [Music] I love the high logic give the jumper gonna face [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] boy that was that was up-tempo high-energy good times clapping song we got to start over what Ice Age hey baby just clapping hey boo that's not bad that ain't bad at all yeah that was fun that's a good jam I'm gonna go listen to that whole album what was it called force field I'm gonna go listen to that whole thing I like me some doom some glooms some stoner rocks and some stoner metal and stuff like I think the swords one of them and Foo Manchu and and stuff like that I thought that was pretty good what did you think of a good great fantastic yeah yeah I want some more of that please Shane thank you not a fan don't want it don't need it don't like it not don't not a big fan of the stoner kind of 70s Groo style hard rock and metal stuff I thought it was good Sean's always delivering up the goodies I'll tell you that it's always a pish-posh of different kinds of things you know he's brought in some some art Speier that was bizarre and chaotic and crazy and and you know some of that I don't even know what you call it hardcore rap core kind of stuff with the with the King 810 and this stuff I mean and what were they called the R&B sex metal band I'm blanking on him but anyways great job Sean that's a thumb Z up C's for you there's two of them right there looking at you

review on these guys I've had a couple of them here strictly made in so yeah and here's nothing this you know sweater bit or anything I think we should probably go in on one it's a kind of waxy slash shatter II really pixel off hard like it but it doesn't I don't know it's soft but it's still kind of you know hard you know pick off but anyways this one's Alaskan Thunder [ __ ] so anyways Cheers I don't know I'm kind of getting okay piny kind like I don't know a piney like spicy kind of thing but I don't know it's weird it's good another one into us absolutely don't coughing or any harshness collector's item just [Music] Lake I'm not gonna lie I've already been into these these tabs right here so so we got a puppy if that's what you can hear in the background I don't do like humongous tabs they do big enough ones that you know gonna get the full effect but anyways Cheers that was a hot one and a little harsher because it was alright what I think going on one more and see what happens you know I don't take these humongous [ __ ] dabs okay I just I can't do it stupid like what point are you trying to prove you know just do it anyways it was still oh [ __ ] I forgot it was a review anyways so back to the review definitely feeling the effects definitely those two dabs but I had already been to probably two or three already in of a different kind we'll wait for this one to cool down a little bit I don't know if you guys can hear that but there's it's pretty windy Oh sitting here in my mom's basement case you're wondering there was some idiots on here earlier that we're saying that you know that's what's going on but clearly yeah awesome so I'm gonna leave that I give this thumbs up really good love that kind anyways piece of Froyo full effects peace", "RREF-etjeiI": "you see that sleep inducement part that's why it's nighttime right now i've done the right thing i weighed it upon getting an examination myself i've got some differing opinions i don't really get a fruity note at all from giving this a sniff however i didn't get to sniff it right when the container got opened there's certainly almost a hyper burst of terpenes when you're the one to get the true first sniff um we'll see once we grind that up what i get but god damn it's still summertime outside but there's some [ __ ] christmas trees in here man uh the bottoms of a few of these nuggets are seriously seriously frosty um i'm really really excited not only to see if maybe a higher testing thc percentage flower can yield really any difference in potency than some of the other ones we've tried but this lineage come on man alaskan thunder [ __ ] with a strain name like that i'm looking to get messed up son come on that's that's that's what i'm here to do i'm here to get [ __ ] up man so honestly i'm really hoping that sleep inducement come on i don't think we've seen that on a revolution uh strain properties before so kind of looking for that narcotic just zombie feeling as i'm getting ready to go to bed it's difficult to describe so i had to just go get my camera but man there's just these like these hairs that protrude from such a bulbous flower like it's it's really something to look at it's intimidating allah just gotta point out some of the finer details on these guys [ __ ] man hairy protruding just overall exotic is all hell man wow look at that nice man revolution as always with the [ __ ] gas a completely different nose upon breaking down this thunder cookies a a stinky just a stinky sharpness has absolutely emerged from this that was nowhere close to being in that first or secondary sniff that i got great news the buds weren't dry at all in fact they felt very very fresh and i just had to there we go really when this much keefe is already left behind at the tops of those it's really just the intro signs that we just have an absolute trichome dump occurring god damn that's exactly the shot i was hoping to get look at this y'all we've really got almost an entirely different color emerging from these and it's literally because of the trichomes i damn near say come on look at that snow baby sounds like a horror movie the last trains coming into town oh wow there's a wonderful aftertaste that is i'm sorry the only way i could describe it right now is like watermelon candy i i literally i know that sounds kind of outlandish it's the only thing that can come to mind it was so smooth like almost unnaturally so that was a very very voluminous cloud and i must say the effects are very fast acting my face feels uh actually a lot of me feels pretty fuzzy and numb so really really great first impression like the first thing we did when we came in was like literally not saying anything and just munch out dude like i ate some ice cream i might get the pretzels back out i had some chocolate earlier holy [ __ ] dude make no mistake about it thunder cookies is bringing the appetite to the table i just got back home from work and you know it's really something to realize about last night every one of those stream properties listed on the container really came through i cannot tell you how intense my munchies were last night now i gotta point something specifically out i consume cannabis like 24 7. man that ain't no [ __ ] flex it's a [ __ ] reality of my life but i say that to say like i don't really get the munchies man obviously i smoke and i am motivated to consume food but it is rare for me to get hit with that like that just i need it like spongebob meme like i'm on the snacks you know what i'm saying that absolutely happened last night me and kate ate every [ __ ] ice cream treat we had i ate the majority of the pretzels i had and i'm pretty sure i'd already brushed my teeth literally the munchies were so strong that i didn't give a [ __ ] so that's uh that's my initial impression of these thunder cookies holy [ __ ] man you better have ubereats bro d look at that keith on top of this bowl of thunder cookies now i just got told we are going to dinner bro we have not been to a dinner really since all this [ __ ] happened so we going to a patio to get a bite to eat and um [Music] come on now you know i got to put that munchies to the test the wind always picks up the wind always picks up [Music] ah [Music] [Music] [Music] uh so the majority of revolution strains i smoke they really grab a hold of me smoking them generally isn't something um to multi-task about this thunder cookies is no different man it just straight changes me it simply medicates me the onset of like the need to sit down to eat to relax like let's be real man i really need to be doing more of that in my own life outside of cannabis i just find it hard to damn near impossible so to have medicine like this it's some [ __ ] bro i feel myself becoming stoned i'll make it short and sweet man i'm so [ __ ] high off this thunder cookies like i know i probably look sick but i feel anything but dude seriously seriously intoxicating holy [ __ ] because i got the last three i got those last three nuggets of thunder cookies y'all holy [ __ ] man i got alaskan thunder [ __ ] i can't even lie man these smacked me up in ways that i didn't think i could before i've really never had something so what's the word so representative of an indica before like just i'm so hungry so tired so [ __ ] up when i smoke this it's simply something special y'all it's simply something special probably gonna smoke about half of this tonight and we'll see where the rest of it takes us oh man probably looks like [ __ ] [ __ ] uh that cookies made that sounded good man hell no hell no bro this [ __ ] i think i'm [ __ ] dead i'm not playing i haven't come sit down i'm so high dude look at my eyelids they're so swollen [Music] dude thunder cookies man i was praying i was hoping and praying actual thunder actual rain for the last rip of thunder cookies cheer i said cheer i'm so excited cheers [Music] oh oh my god i'm soaked yo let's talk about that thunder cookies real quick really i've got one big takeaway it's been several months since those video clips my god i don't know if since that time i've smoked a rev strain or really any cultivator strain that's had the intoxicating power that that thunder cookies had y'all saw me laying down there i look drugged look like i'm on pills i love that i think the alaskan thunder [ __ ] in that lineage i don't know if i gave it enough credit we've never seen it before but i do hope to see it again because i think it just added this [ __ ] you to the [ __ ] thunder cookies that i felt that i felt every single pull so needless to say i'm sad i haven't come across thunder cookies uh since recording those clips and you can bet your ass the next time it's available at my dispensary and i'm really trying to get plastered yeah yeah thunder cookies by rev is the answer uh thank you guys so much for all the comments and hitting me up i really appreciate it

yeah it's one of those one of those things but there is a delay I apologize I had to I had to reconfigure this to go to a different page again it's all about analytics and statistics do my friends I mean - I apologize and I hope that they got what I like about YouTube is a chance really been lighting up underneath this phone Keith if you are watching I can't see if you are but if you are watching please feel free to admin accordingly as with any other show if you see something like half the time I can't see what's being said in the chat so but that being said we are looking for questions and alike to be honest I don't see myself broadcasting stills that holder channel yes don't Vicky all right listen to you okay in my on my public channel [Music] [Music] where is it going to the other line all right at this point I'm not gonna stop the show twice you know guys you just get out sir yeah can you please show it over to my public page oh there's no way to notify everybody I haven't figured I'd oh yeah but either way so be it it's frustrating as hell because that restarted the show but it's not letting me don't let me pick what I want to do should go even on the fly this is professional broadcasting software and he literally on the fly I should literally be able to yeah I literally should be able to set it to what I wanted to go but profile is not what it's on right now and that's really weird so anyway I was gonna keep chatting as we go through this and and with confusion I'm just going to create a new line for Facebook so to my friends on YouTube just enjoy we are going to be harvesting these ladies we got to go five different strains and and or six different strains and five different plots and they're all just test strange so you can see if they're not being grown very big for a reason um really it's just testing and seeing what their general yield is and by the formation etc and of course phenotype smell whole stuff that matters to to the grower when you're looking for a strain that you might want to use there no it's good huh all right well you know what I'm just gonna keep going where we're going here guys I'm just gonna simply go over to the other one I apologize but it is really as I thought I can't excited on a school that I was able to actually shut it off and turn it back on on the fly that's kind of neat with the no it's gonna it's gonna shut off and it's gonna turn back on here in a sec for you physically because they can't get off this profile page for some reason [Applause] yeah okay so we're about anyway to my friends on Facebook please please if there was ever a time share this around and if you have any questions after only no I'm gonna finish stirring this out on various platforms such as Google and other places it's interesting what the Internet can do with the right software and it's just you know for the for the poor man it takes a little longer to try to get the right equipment but once you get and get a hang of it then it's work pretty good most important is getting out the information I think and right now there's a lot of people that want to know how do I grow how do I harvest what do I need to know and this is where there's no right or wrong answer I always say this because I don't want anybody thinking I think on some big king master grower I'm not there's no right or wrong answer sometimes interpretations or things get lost in interpretation so we need to remember that as well as police runs into chat or a lot of us are growers the more people realize that we start harvesting plants that we're talking about this the more people might want to join into that conversation back in the day when we did nothing but grow shows here on campus in Canada that would be the one thing that I'd be worried about was growers arguing with each other and starting to drop the f-bomb on each other over over really interpretation oh really they were both saying the same thing it's just there it was an interpretation thing anyway here or there the one stream that I have out here this is as you can see this is sativa hybrid I wish the camera focuses in it's either going forward Mira's gonna focus on the plants all right now it's focusing on the on the planet not much I can do about that most importantly this is for patients a lot of this testing I like dragon got part really for me and I'd love to grow the plant in this case my daughter gluten this particular crop you know again realization on horizon I want to make sure that no matter what if anything she always had a skill to be able to grow a really good cannabis but because there's always going to be somebody that wants to buy a conscience or that old cannabis by the Bursar's a real corporation cannabis buddy just saying just the way it is who doesn't love the neighborhood grower so on also on today's show most wordly on today's show what was cutting these down and and if there's any questions that anybody has they were growing under a 600 in a tent and 600 full-spectrum so both in veg and flour the light number not changed oh so it wasn't a full HPS and or was it a full mhm it was a combination of the two and got most places that way now and you can turn them off or turn them down I didn't crank it up most people do this is simply people might have wildly talked at once down here and why I didn't manipulate it further every plant was equally talked one time and it was so I can see how they grow and I can get their expression while maximizing they'll put in the tent so this is important to understand the methodology and why why we use them if you choose you want to do a bonsai plant you have to understand those drastic tripping can take a long time take a lot of work in order to get that stuff done and in my case I can see like prisons in a big room there would be enough air movement and wind I think that I won't have as much problem with would mean to stake these down I mean honestly having to put stakes and knees to hold their weight you see them be just kind of drifting over and this is how they would look anyway it does the the outdoor boroughs I understand the same thing and my pride is in my daughter on learning pH keeping it balanced you can see the tips of the leaves aren't burnt this is again when you see somebody that is attentive to detail I can see a big grower from the back door just by going in the room it's not it's not hard to uh not so much good core from vibrato but more either they they may not know or they're just they're taking a shortcut or a lazier rope to doing it and yeah basically over these would be hung for four days and this one made me a bit longer because it's a little chunkier than the other ones but basically four days this will be hung and and then you don't win to the curing process and I'll show you guys going to come back after break in a mason jar what I mean how you can just put a small fewest at this big down inside and it will tell you what community is inside that airtight jar at all times so if you want to know if your broken your jar and if you're getting ready we'll get into that curing it one of the really the one with the topic separate from harvesting but also indicative and part of detail and of person so we'll touch on do everybody who's been invited to please enjoy yeah I don't want people partisan why they just sat there and talk about it but I'm open to talk I'm just going to make sure I can see the chart here now on youtube there so anybody on you - how many questions feel free to chime oh I'm almost positive that this strange alarm until I matched it up if it's not easy out then it's gonna be the one that I've learned actually for my way and it's it's there's two strangers very far the ones West Coast Wilcox what you guys will see it's an auto flower that finishes on its own head above this height so it's great for outdoors baseline it's on its own on the way that it cycles it's just it's a great outdoor short planet it hasn't been tested yet cuz again it just farmed it this year so what your fun I find to strange meaning for CP and this might be one of them but also the end of the day when you take your plants down usually will take live streams now and I can tell you all that the same day usually it'll take them down systematically for a reason and that'll be usually because they're finished one strain might finish on day 67 the other straining might finish on day 70 for 90% of Grover's cut their plants on day 60 to 65 because they don't know any better they don't wait too little spinal burst and they all wait for that final part and it's it's younger than with a sativa I've made this mistake a few times I'm wondering if I'm eating it right now this one I'm harvesting is just not giving time to finish its final swell but at the same time when your buds I guess it should that that one and your buds start to finish today's can't really see that it doesn't doesn't focus in but when your buds start to spiral out on the very tip getting a little spirals your plants die then you have to make sure that again go like this when you're done watering collect some water under your cup take your ppm Reader electro conductivity meter and measure the water if the measuring now John Barry fellow said 200 was good to harvest I know you know I've always said aim for 100 unless you're using long water no city water is 100 coming out of the top it's always around 50 in that area 60 just depends on which city you live in which municipality supplies the water so keeping that in mind it's also why I highly suggest if you can investigating a reverse osmosis machine get a reverse osmosis machine that would be that would be what works best for this jeez we're getting killed on this on this UTP anyway um I'm gonna chop this one down here again tying them upside down if you're wondering what I'm gonna do with this normally I will go through this and I will once it's up and hanging and leaves like this they don't need to be on some people will say they fall down and they cover the bud and they protect the bud you know the tricolor yeah I know please keep off youtube soon find its Facebook for some reason we went live to a wrong platform we're not on my public page so they don't get that notification and I have no way to notify them so which is the only hope for the best but anyway these families here again if you want to take the time to draw a family whose thing and just I mean drawing time so people may not talk about this some guys will say that they take them off during flowering I don't suggest that the other thing I wanted to know it again I only taught these one time and I let it grow all natural because I wanted to see its phenotypes I want to see how to grow and each string you'll see they all grow different and that's all I'll be able to tell them is this a keeper do I want to keep this do I want to make me farm this in the future and make it ten thousand seeds so the whole world can try them that's a choice for me to make that's what's good about being a countess breeder and brewery so you know when you start breeding strains and again this one here I don't know what to do with yet till a small good but harvesting is harvesting it doesn't matter what strain is and because this is all going to be hand trimmed I'm just getting rid of the bigger leaves that I don't need I don't believe that they're gonna a lot of people say they come down they protect the trichomes so your trichomes don't get banged around and I'm thinking to myself nothing should be banging the plant around to begin with if the plasters hanging there perfectly still and there's minor air maybe you don't need a lot you know you just need a little bit and proper RH you'll end up getting a proper grog and you're looking at just dry in the first four days it's not part of the cure but getting water sources such as families is something you can do I'm not gonna waste your time on the whole show doing this of course I'm also going to try and keep up with your comments check or tricone Oh keep going smoke there good that I'm in the school I just wanted to kind of show it what we're talking about because that we do scope and and these happen scope so these are definitely uh they're definitely done again they're milky they're done I'd say they're ten percent Ambler versus the 20 percent a little thank you the 20 percent number that most of them would do but a senator and scale or scope for just basic tracking would be like this for the four-year two-year program and any game just going and just check right in tight and take a look and you can see it in there milkiness I mean for me I can take a picture of this with my camera and show you guys you know can I see the picture that we post you know recently on Instagram someone you can just see the trek on the ball with us Sarah for me it's trying not to touch it too much so I don't get trifle they stay all over my on my computer here that's the main thing and yeah so I'm just going to finish and then best editors in the world I wish I knew the company I'll talk my head but this is awesome you know this is one more thing so yeah Keith summer 3 again this would be honest I would even give a day so when you cut them and just chopping my best it's really not like there's a wrong expense to cut and technically you hang it upside down you let it dry at this point and Vickie and I I didn't do it but I think you might do it after with with one of the string it actually makes some fresh juice in our in our blender and show you guys how you can make canvas juice and it's really a very fast yes yeah it's very high in fiber where am I do that Oh future great for treating arthritis or not if disorders not as much difference I know I wanted to do it was that finding difference keys what you tell people three dark second just before harvest or you're talking about doing a black note oh man you definitely read someone's little bro books they're key things so you've been around no I'm with you brother actually I've tested all these theories I think the most important thing and the best thing that I've learned and is most importantly Stokely trichome and then also your temperature if you can drop the temperature in their room 221 during the last two weeks of harvest there is a lot of benefits to doing so and I'm not gonna continue or I didn't how I I'm talking to really debate it but it's something that people who used to do I often ran my very much money you know the whole way through respecting very cool 25 it is optimal for plants they really just need and the temperature basically room temperature of an average average home is 25 a bit so this will be hung and again all the way doctor and pick off a bunch of leaders and shows done this is game on optic nerve and I gotta find anyway but it hung up in there and then I don't you see you go out at least this is giving my wife of ok it's like okay yeah and then I just gotta get my my wife is okay but no you can give your wife a bouquet - but then you're doing good they're officially no yeah it's all cut that's wrong over there I'm gonna grab another punch but seriously a bouquet of flowers I wish I was out with I should have cut that down for a moment instead of big basket of flowers oh my god there she's gonna count down and show you guys [ __ ] forever me over top of roses fall over roses are not cheap on Valentine's Day those guys man we on the eyes of cannabis grower I'm considering becoming a a Rose grower at certain times in their make big money big [Music] they do is just sent it the triple from price on the Hawks a 100% anyway but again another thing that's important to look at is the color of your leaves and the Ottoman off like in this plant you'll see a little more lightening of it there's two different plants in here but in this case this is the one that has I believe with the same yeah they're the same so again the planets short planet you know I'm happy with genetics well worth it oh you know I didn't know I forgot to do that one thing I was good to you ok this was also there's another bigger cooler yeah you know none of these be done we had the stickiest [ __ ] this particular what string was this because again my daughter I give her credit this is my daughter grew this I'm not gonna let credit to something that I did she is my apprentice but she definitely did this on her own and when you look at some of the raging on these leaves and stuff you can see I wish you can we do the believe justice no it's just the cameras trying to focus on my face I've seen this is better than [ __ ] numb what saying that to John the other day we're having issues with the studies but anyway you can see how healthy these these are and you know we should be getting a lot of different pictures of stuff but again we go this particular one it grew a little weird you can see what I mean by the spiraling out these little Christmas tree pose they're done you can tell it's done just but you need to pick off the top there that's a finished planet so and the same thing because it's all in this case I thought there was two plants in here there's actually only one but same thing I'm gonna go through and I'm gonna go pick up my leaves and everything else I'm sure you guys would be doing the same but this one here is another CBD strain it's a subpoena but you can tell by the leaf it's another hybrid that's a dominant so this is why these have actually 167 days so or sorry 72 days these are all being cut on the same big day but it's been 72 days to get them to this point so a flower so from the day they put them in Flour on December 7 till today correct and please of Aram online but from December 7th till today I believe is so yeah and this is an end when you're thinking about a ten a lot of people ask me is it worth growing in the tent and and again this is just one plant the very little attention not a lot of work you know you got a couple tops bottom mr elections go all natural how do i and i let this grow all natural and just allow the natural terminal body how'd you know how big that would be because then you gotta cookies all together and that's that gives you an idea what the terminal but little look like how do i not manipulate it but again this is all why we why we do the testing that we do and then get a sticky [ __ ] from all this BAM okay then I'll pull ups over here now you can really see the purpling off you guys can't really see the top of the plant but Vicki's gonna get some pictures anyway before we Harbor eyes but you can definitely see the Ottoman off this is what I talked about you know you think of the autumn time anyway any questions at all guys i I'm gonna revenge a couple of them I should have revenged that one that was really girthy and I read I went and cut because I got busy tied up in this show and I made a mistake but oh well keep dryer Bell and after I'll cook another core or in this case this is the pro mix one the new one I used to make my own mix but the pro mates now has cocoa in it and you can get that combination and I want Tessa and so far this has been the results again I often say the results are in the plant and these are examples and this is done in the tent under a 600 these aren't thoughts on what but these are 600 watt lights so you just keep that in mind your average LED is this six hundred to a thousand watts so I've got an LED a kind LED and the King on TV sitting right over there actually so hopefully this is not boring you guys do too much with a little grub on YouTube here this is where I got my birth YouTube now 11 years really have been doing this teaching people growing we're talking about growing stuff like this for a while that's why I thought it can I've never done wide so I wanted to back in the day because we stopped such I mean I used to get 20,000 years in the weekend it was different back then there wasn't 200 shows up there and a bunch of people buying buying views and buying hits and and and quite frankly replicating what was what was already help there but at the same time the math of information is important I just hope that it's accurate the people giving you the information as long as it's accurate we did the growth show for free there's people out there charging consulting fees you know I've been doing this since 2007 never charged a single person for helping them with their plans just because I believe in sharing that well that's a wealth of kindness and compassion I think that's something that needs to be say so while I've walked to do a DAB here please share this around guys we got a few giveaways we want to do we're not sure if we're going to do if you have any questions on any of the strains yeah that's just for that of that other you know I can't wait to meet you guys right yeah that's why that purple off and why it's sister didn't this is an example where there is two planets when I pull it over I'll show you guys there is two plants actually in the soil or in the one geo pot and they feel pods to air pruning if you guys know who I am you see fabric pots I don't want you guys to think of the best farmers in the world easily coffee bean farmers and stuff guys to be doing this for millennia you know what are they used they use fabric pots because it air prints so just like when you talk and you get two heads because you cut the top instead it's the same thing when the crook or the root grows out the bag the route starts to come out through the geo pot hits the air guys and splits in two so you get a bigger badder ruger mass you get bigger badder but remember these are 600 watt not dozen what butts and that's important I say that because some people are saying oh yeah that's just a thousand wallets you know and under a tent that's no big deal in it well it could be it could be a big deal could not be hopefully I'm hoping I'd like a distraction to my coffee do my job wait for these numbers to climb up to our friends on YouTube thank you please share this around to your girlfriends let them know that we are back and we'll continue with different photo shows on we had missed it I apologize for the background noise again we did this from our living room so it's extremely hard Vicky and I it really is a mom and pop operation at this point but to any investors or anybody out there interested in joining us please let us know because the one thing we do need is a studio having a studio in your living room is kind of cool and it's kind of fun but at the same time it's not the same as as what we'd like to do because then we can bring more guests and more people to you Vicky and I just can't invite you know everybody to our house so what I'm showing you here I guess what you're looking at in the cloud and all start to pull same thing pull stakes out and let the natural compliance weather just pull the weight up or not we'll see but this one here the Ottoman office didn't I talked about why you guys think about your husband time renowned film Ontario in Ontario in the autumn norm square a drive down the road and that was to cool the [ __ ] you can go for a drive and do all these cool colors and unless you're [ __ ] I know I'm a naturalist nature lover an animal lover so when I see trees I've got changed and I never thought one day idea cannabis grower as a result but auditing off is exactly anything that's what you're seeing right up here just purpley that's not just when the me that was a stock that actually couldn't hold its weight fell over you know but anyway you can see there it's autumn right off so just like a tree that's gonna express its different female soul this most importantly when you harvest if you are down low by 100 ppm so I'm gonna say all your leaves are gonna be like green like you see here you're gonna see the light green leaves and you're gonna see the the different you hear this you guys be here down when I'm sure it's the rusty sound of a finished cross and you're not important so again I would like to right away me I'm thinking to myself I don't need these leaves covering my trichomes but most importantly they're just more water and if there's more water to dry out then the plants going to take if you go to a class River system so it's going to pull water from the leaves to try and survive it's an actual it's gonna be its natural instincts that's not broke that was the whole stock that broke so there's a little example of a golf-ball treatments so this one of those free but actually because this also for the future so they have each one has its own distinct Turkey and this is actually let's toast Wilcox yes we're different yeah two different strings so what I just cut off here was the less those will cause even though they look the same this is here a different planet altogether this is the auto fire in West Coast Wilcox they've got lots of seeds I farm this this year now outdoors you can see why this would be good if you can lay down all your seeds go through after 30 days call out your males go back after a week double-check you've called out on your males use your one male to get loose in your garden but this is going to be the height you know literally that's not a very big planet that's an auto flower so this is the genotype does this I didn't make it flower and make it look like this this is its natural look all I give is to top it down here just like every other plant all them the top one time that's why this two two splits otherwise it would just be a straight up hole so it's quite an interesting little little crossbreed and a shout-out to resin seeds because some of their genetics are actually in here inadvertently so yeah questions questions share share remember to like the public page these guys I'm only home only a few pages okay or a few likes away from the sweet house [Applause] all right so all right any questions at all please spit them out I can just start chopping the [ __ ] down you know when you're really comfortable running a class so you're going to get top-heavy like this and occasionally like this here as soon as this fell over I knew to stick it up and there's nothing wrong with it it's just falling over permits it's on some weight and again when I talk about the light color beads you want to know that you're one that's auditing off and this big family for instance which would be hard enough to but it's also there's no nitrogen in these leaves which means you're not going to have a black burn in here but nomads you didn't in the least means no nitrogen but it's how the system works it pulls it up through there and a lot of your area your offs you think you're at least but it's still fundamentally when you're looking at your flush and a beautiful beautiful deep this is why I'm kind of leaving this maybe I'm home do you get pictures of Asia dick you got pictures do you want if there's any other pictures I could stick it back up picture call I get some after its kind of be like well if that's the thing is broken so he ends up thinking but you can take a picture like that if you want it's your fault and it's just disarming but you guys hopefully you guys yeah you guys to see that arcing off I'm not really dying that's the awning off so if you think about going down in the winter time and you start to see the changing color that that's exactly what what is is it a pure line I'll make adjusting some pictures for Instagram URIs oh yeah sent back up not mistaken understand I always stood in my mistake I didn't actually reach take it Oh beautiful so we that work great so harvesting around your computer not wise if you don't mind yet and sticky stuff on there and that's okay too to each their own anyway I'm going to switch off with a quick commercial break here please share around we know where to remember to like and share and ensure that you care and and again more questions to better I will try and get it I'm going to scroll back through the comments here on this break and catch up grasper what on this particular part this particular distant acquitted of you guys did you want bring on this particular my wet wait I already know you know he's going to convert to about 1.4 that's it but I only get five plants and I only need them really short and I did them from seed so that's not about it's not a bad pole for a camp a lot of people out they were saying how you know we can't do my one leg off one I can pull up to three pounds with the red string and the red grower and the braid optimal climate control and right you know all enhancers and hormones and anything else you might use to make that happen I've seen plants that big you guys have seen me with plants that big but I am looking for any feedback guys so as we go over these can polish and our brakes first one I'm going to play is going to be the coalition it's basically a pass to present this is all done we want then with the government of you guys those that know the story and know it but we're working on documentary Silver's we're still trying to bring up the appropriate height that we go with with and hopefully you guys can appreciate that because if it weren't for the aller case nobody would be growing in Canada and nobody would be looking at it around the world and that's something we need to remember because if you look at what the other constitutional what sort of what the other opponent of all countries are doing you know home growing know why because you're a danger even though here in Canada we proved in federal law federal court that there's no danger to throwing and no danger keys and cannabis other countries are using the exact same narrative so that they can monopolize their people's to buy license produce your cannabis this has been going on for five years it's nothing new six years stuff that we can look out I care about teaching people how to continue to grow plants like we have so this year will just give you an idea of what we did in the past to raise one point while we raised three hundred twenty thousand and the judge awarded us seven hundred and forty years thirty thousand I can't really excited number but we were awarded a large amount of money leaving only about eighty thousand left and our legal team just let go of what they owe so and that was important to us so to us it's a fully paid fully funded and that's why we're doing the documentary challenge that changed the course in the history of this country how do they remove those gardens and the MMPR came in the marijuana for medical purposes regulations there would have been no home growing and that legalization proposal I would note and remind everybody Justin Trudeau never once in any of his speeches mentioned home growing was going to be allowed under his legalization plan it was forced on them by the chorus on that night when you have to break and he was a little touch to the people that made it possible for us all to enjoy what I'm doing here today which is growing again his plan [Music] the Canadian government's getting out of the marijuana business Canada's health minister announced changes to medicinal marijuana access they're aimed at reducing crime but many people think it will do the exact opposite he's one of 26,000 Canadians with a licence to grow medical marijuana starting to feel anxious again since the community and government announced the system is about to change soon there will be no more medical marijuana produced and distributed by the government and no more growing regulated marijuana from home [Music] Jason Wilcox has been organizing the coalition against the repeal of the medical marijuana access regulations particularly the personal production licenses and designated production licenses leaving the patient options you should be able to go and house somebody going for you if they have places around the ability or ordering a pharmacy or big business whatever you want to call the program is model and you should all saw the right fundamentally especially because to what we are online just like when you smoking you should have the right to grow Health Canada will if successful only licensed large-scale commercial operators who produce our medicine at up to four times the current cost government is simply hi Jackie because she was getting up 26,000 222 legal Brewers trying to get as many of them as possible to understand immunity and get on this file so that we can actually be prepared its own health Ken they choose us to make their move we're all prepared to take it on take it on a federal judge has approved an injunction allowing current licensed medical marijuana users to continue growing their own pot past April 1st of Corvinus Columbia ruled users can continue growing their own pot for now this decision comes less than two weeks before new laws for medical pot take effect in Canada this is huge it is you know and then if some of the patient's right now they're not suffering today so I think they're gonna get to sleep it's very hard to get angry and frustrated as I think about the 500-plus in fact save is a write up people paranoid and not just paranoid god-given fear of walking back on the pharmaceuticals because of what the government's doing out to medical patients it's unconstitutional it's not Canadian it's not right take my MRIs we wouldn't send my and the mayor our form and the three other things like that was really really having a tough time but it seems that that one major stressor removing that threat of losing my card and by the government even having the threat of armed guards coming into my home did it to make sure that it had shut down when we really hurt and injured my feeling they're not was the beginning I'm aware of people who by who don't have a medicinal license who buy vert marijuana for medicinal growers hybrid use the analogy though to that would love you definitely drunk drivers and people on pills are in are going out driving drunk and killing people we police the drunk drivers we don't throw all the cars off the road and that's what they were trying to do with the patients and I'm glad that justice stepped in and interfere and allowed the Constitution our chance to put the LMP are under constitutional scrutiny I just really hope that we all get what I think we deserve which is freedom and that's what this is all about the coordination of what's going on these are people that want to stand up to the government with their endless amounts of money in pockets and you know where we can get the streets if the boat canvas talk to people you know it's got their promote to one person at a time change perception and views by I mean articulating truth and you know I'm proud to be part of that movement now we're out 180,000 dollars raised what are we looking at over and above the quarter million now that we originally set out I have to estimate hi I'd have to say look let's shoot for a million bucks because who knows you've seen the attitude of the federal government they recently are putting ads on paid for by the taxpayers about the dangers of intimacy it's just another there's gonna be a lot going on in the next year it's our one big in-store coq10 either we make it happen if we don't it doesn't matter who you are or what you are if you have a belief in ensuring that people's rights should be taken care of you should be donating it's it's for the people we the people who want this and you know it's coming people need access to these products because it helped prolong and saved a lot of suffering this is going to end with a standpoint of whether we will or will not win our garden we will so yeah he likes these producers you better be worried I'm not going anywhere this is part of over I'm pretty confident you're gonna win I feel mean you can't guarantee yeah but I feel like that's gonna be a preserved thing they were the right to grow your own cannabis for medical purposes as it should be I think that we got a super strong case I'm really looking forward to what John can do in the court and I hope it's heard fairly and with an open mind I hope we legalized but again I hope we legalized with Gardens so that there isn't this fight that I worry about between the underground these growers that exist and I know them on the BC economy is almost run by these growers you know if that starts a gas war then security is going to go up because the gangs get involved or real organised crime gets involved I say one isn't the top down first recognize it as medicine take it out of the CDSA [Music] I love the fight against Canada with Jason Wilcox as a brief break we had there and we've got her from the we have a name yet but friendly gorilla dancing around pops often times time and from commercial to commercial the yeah what else was I'm talking about Europe may be true making the adaptation again if we go back through the entire Arctic we can do that and again my biggest concern is they have basically admitted everything medical everything that we see as medical they've emitted from from the Canada when it comes to medical distribution medical education medical libraries where patients can go to get this information aside from Health Canada this is stuff that we haven't seen in the cannabis out so it's like you're almost pushing the medical patients great completely aside aside from putting in Bac a a seein sort a CMP our into the cannabis act so when I think about this here to me I'll never worry about this because I'm happy I was growing illegally long before I was growing really so it's not going to change the difference in whether I'm going to continue to in my own good faith feel that I'm helping people and healing people I'm far from the dealer I'm far from a bad person I don't think my wife by people if we're able to help people I think that if your due diligence into is is where the the balance of convenience needs to be and the courts look at the balance of you need so you know it's unfortunate that the courts keep ruling in our favor and it's why we're doing what we're doing you know it's because of court people in our favor saying yes we have ready to do this but here we are our patients not getting their licenses anybody here not get their license and get that crap about they want pictures of the inside of your location to prove it's an individual structure or any pictures of the outside to prove that you're you have unit number or anything there's been a couple reports of these sorts of letters going out and my friend at the island I'm a very different his wife she was told that she was potentially under investigation for where they're growing so these are things that are very concerning because you start thinking to yourself or medical patients why did helmet how in hell did they first search investigators you know is there is a reward is there validation to what's being said or was it just an officer of Health Canada being held managed with their language and saying you're being investigated your the investigators do finishing finishing up your file it used to be the officers finishing up your file I think it's another fear mongering tactic language is very powerful it can scare people so a minute you say investigator it can scare you even if you doesn't matter nobody wants to be investigated you know especially I'm not doing anything wrong so in this case it's something where I'd like to know if this is happening on a larger scale please let you know I can't help John Conroy can halt lawyers can halt God knows John Connor and he's semi-retired already not getting around much longer to keep helping those guys they say don't joke I'm keeping it real my wife can tell ya I how do they keep this client I'll gonna keep his nasally love me I'm no drug doing everything I can not to curse not to swear no I'm sure to share this [ __ ] around trying to get some [ __ ] people I don't hear that actually give a [ __ ] about crony catus plan to go [ __ ] a book but you kicked the government sauce give a [ __ ] about [ __ ] Michael back to war with it again I'm kind of just feeling the waters in the water the kind of home right now towards a sort of option is it wouldn't make much sense to me to continue in any in any aspect looking at fundraising or anything else and and it's not just means it's like I said and I have friends who are dealing with problems and in almost to a degree I almost say that is because some of the coalition leadership it seems to me most are being messed with people that served in the coalition in the government knows who they are people think I'm joking about this [ __ ] but I'm not okay I did for instance I followed the Brad Smith master lawsuit multi-million dollar lawsuit for breaching our privacy with before me 41,000 letters that were sent out to medical patients across Canada 42,000 story that case has been certified the Privacy Commissioner of Canada has already said it's a great a gross gross violation of medical patients rights so I keep talking about this because I know soon we're gonna have our soon we're gonna have everything back the story of our I just lost track see this is probably trying to run a broadcast see I actually run the broadcast here when you see that gorilla dancing or things changed on the screen I'm actually doing that while trying to try to hold this conversation and losing it sometimes because it gets frustrating I wish the lawyers would take this a little more serious at this juncture I wish we could do a little bit more but I think they smart they hired Curt you saw the guys who saw basically getting away are our people when you start taking away our best lawyers how can we fight our social justice lawyers how many fight John Calipari was ready to come out of retirement I hosted online I'm those who've seen it I posted John's letter that he said to me to have posted publicly I had to do with the again real actually federal constitutional challenge for practical compassion clubs in Canada not the phony ones not to pretend Hawaiians not go fund me accounts no the one with the giant palm where a trust account and the realtor working on the case that would that charter challenge and I know I'm sounding a little facetious and a little cocky when I say that it's because I don't like people after being accused of so much stuff in the coalition it's really hard when you actually see somebody doing what you were accused to do and and just standing by idly and saying nothing so again you know if you're out there trying to defend yourself and you're trying to raise money then call it your defense fund unless your lawyer has filed a constitutional challenge then quotes the statement of claim and let people know and more people get behind it the difference is like with me Iraq my visa I can get charged like charged Canada I didn't need to wait to get charged so for me if I can go to court stick up for patients I get it because it was the right thing to do unlike the other people out there saying they got charter challenges that they don't have trying to collect money which is fraud off giving supporters because we actually care and we all have good hearts I'm just on that big bear in the room that's willing to [ __ ] call a spade a spade you know and that's just the facts so it's unfortunate that there's people out there just call yourself a defense fund because it's all you are and for those that are getting involved with John Connor a case thank God there is somebody because I believe the British Columbia compassion love society might be the lead plaintiff and they're the oldest of the first club here in British Columbia it's important to know as we talk about the future for us here with compassion post I care about the patients so Loeb I have my own access here this is one thing but as an activist and a social justice activist I got a lot of time on my hand to think where do I want to place my my skills how do I want to help patients I can help them at the hospital I can help them deal with the doctor so I can help them to throw a lieutenant cigar or I can help them learn how to grow cannabis we use it so I got to find where do I want to apply these skills and at one time I knew that the coalition was the place to apply it now I'm seeing there's so much more going on that Canada and we need to wake up as a country all these cries for unity and people talking about bringing groups together that keep failing is only serving to hurt the lawyers and people out there lying about the money you're raising and saying that it's for a constitutional challenge it's only gonna hurt more when people try to actually raise money for a real constitutional challenge followed by John W Connor a QC you know if he files that case he already has a trust fund for it so any money being raised and the only constitutional charter challenge for kakashi loves is being held and done and preceded by mr. John W Connor a QC along the committee mr. Jack Lew is my understanding we'll be working with him on the case and last starting changes and that could change easily money things could change that's why people out there online maybe I recognized Canada before legalized we're sort of in a quasi war between the underground between crisis patients are being screwed patients don't have access patients have to spend their whole disability check for Millhouse weed but they can't even if they wonder why they can't make butter with it I can tell you why it's because it's been radiated and then I'll ask you another question I'll beg anybody watching me here YouTube Facebook anybody please pull up the study that shows gamma radiation gamma processing use on a triponin now what does it do to the tracfone because if you look at what it does to certain fruits there's a reason they don't gamma process certain fruits that are available just like the other gamma process vegetables on the road at the grocery store not a word of a lie look this stuff up because I can never find that study I can never find a study that's supported and what it did to the trichome all I knew is that way back in the day you can you can google this [ __ ] I was in front of the Globe and Mail so we're gonna join saying that I will not pay the federal government just as I'm sitting here now saying I'm not gonna pay you and your son Ellen you've given up trying to make me paid because I was not gonna pay for a bunch of Millhouse radiated [ __ ] that I was told is gonna be my medicine I couldn't press it into hash I tried to make butter with it but a friggin weakest fire and the day if Ellen you got ripped off and it felt like the country Canada ripped off and this is happening again right now we're getting ripped off so if we choose to just say look at the scraps are giving us a week but microbreweries blue we got microbreweries I hear this all so much and I'm like yeah we got microbreweries great good thing you know big deal got Michael birdies but $25,000 to do the paperwork I don't know if the microbreweries are that important again I'm looking at this from a realistic I mean I'm keeping it real here microbreweries I remember when the licensed producers service consultants there was people that same thing 25,000 they'll process your paperwork and you were guaranteed a license because Health Canada guaranteed everybody was gonna get licensed I remember the whole [ __ ] just a lottery here in Vancouver for getting a dispensary that I'm sure all 90 plus remember because none of the marks in existence now or maybe one or two are still in existence from the 19th we originally had thought we'd go down memory lane all day long with with this particular issue because he's one that really sticks with me but yeah back to start harvesting the plants out oh I gotta see what's going on here on YouTube I would agree again to our friends line on YouTube like why should there be a limit on how much one can heal let me give you these silly limits here in this country right for me I again as a medical patient so I'm actually doubled down on I'm under a federal injunction which protects me it's a restraining order on the federal government Canada I put it on I'm licking my lawyer John gummy conrick you see along with 15,000 on my friends the coalition then we proceeded to kick its ass so bad that they had to throw the program and rewrite a constitutional program that included patients being able to grow the plant at home that's why I can grow very large lower plants my wife I'll give her numbers on my wife go 200 plants you know to herself no as a medical patient it should be between you and your doctor Paul Kevin as a processing center they didn't be getting involved in doses nor should the CMA this is all stuff that's between us now do I believe that all that's necessary there's a lot to be said about truth and there's a lot to be said about tolerance and what I mean by that is you're gonna build tolerance like me I probably fart 15:25 Kaname today you know every time I had a fire God knows I failed yes this is just it's ridiculous how much real estate I mean if we have to go piss in the door and get drug tested how much can I'm going to show up on my piss I mean how much I I consume them in a day it's insane absolutely insane when you put two of us together we were equally consuming exactly and that's important that's important to know and they are they already consuming oh that's on YouTube again you guys out there because you know what's beautiful YouTube is that we reached around the world when I did my grow show before I was able to reach around the world because also and to teach and uh I'm sorry now I can't eat fly now we can come to you live it's not about a pre-recording events and pre-recording how to do certain things now you can come get alive and we can discuss it in our open chance we've got to chat yes I'm sure they can I'm sure they heard of it on YouTube there - what the little bell rings notification ever even though she's saying and hit the bell there's a little notification option but again we still have a lot more reliably guy well not a lot more I'm gonna harvest a couple more here on the show as we talk about it but right now again this is all about tent like I want patients to understand you can grow with a tent and relatively easily supply yourself with cannabis at a reasonable price ten cents a gram to a dollar fifty grand depending your your your capabilities and what you're using either way the investment in the reason I suggest tense is because you do not want to alter your suite if you alter punch a hole in your wall you know for venting or whatever or punch out your window and put a board up and you can punch a hole in it you're still altering the suite and that's breaching your tenancy agreement it can get you evicted there's a fungus growing on your soil I would suggest using the rock side you can get a high end peroxide that you're actually at your local grocer or you can get high end peroxide and I would highly suggest looking at what you dyed them with water with that and run that down through and flush your soil and purge and sterilize your soil and then start all over with a new fresh beat again this is why I go back to I'm a high supporter of RO water or using reverse osmosis water because you don't get that chlorine and for mine in there that messes with the nutrients all this is growing my Green Planet nutrients as always they're my I've been promoting him for 11 years for free just to let you know that's how I do it you know that's this isn't a money thing it's because I love their product thing and I love what they did and it's because it was purchased this is done with many one I've done many one for now I've done about 300 show those counting them was crazy I've done 300 shows where I used a 1 this is many one and resen being used on this intent and a basic cheetah pod with your basic Chrome it's a new protocol and I'm really keeping it simple and and my daughter did this great she I'm very proud of her so this is once again another good planet I'm gonna growl that girl's a green thumb she doesn't love it she's like me either one of us are brothers she's good at it I don't think this is in the yard this isn't the Alaska part of the ATF on this ETF is basket on your phone it's a classic down there again hats off to resin seeds I can't remember that's hammer head or hammer sure every chart but the other thing that I would say is again I stand by this because year after year keep going another clamp and pull you in there they're not they shouldn't eat that heavy you know what I pull my back leave the windows last weekend's this one's the smallest one who probably although this is yeah this definitely the smallest one of all them and I guess this is I probably cut this one pretty quick because this is also a scab alone so this is by itself let's just get these over here this is again you know I gotta use it again my nose I gotta actually combine which strains are wage because adult my daughter did this crop she messed up on the market when we had to redo some reefs taking she forgot to change the flags so we didn't know what strain was what and because I haven't grown them before I can't really recognize and less than my home and and as I showed earlier the show West Coast Wilcox train now that all of our works great and it'd be great but I'd rather get rid of this planet I remember I'm different hurry brother from went down murder you're absolutely break I'm completely true making the Recreational in the act first is protected and politician spins when getting arrested I can't see the rest your comment but I'm assuming that's what it is I agree by placing the medicinal aspects of the program sliding that into you know the cannabis we use we use resin want resin and maybe not believes I totally kicks ass big-time I'm listening to myself right right yeah oh my god I can't get the second by second Cameron I'm out in the hell it didn't discourse with uh no I'm having a good day about anything look at my planets this is ATF this hasn't been seen since 1973 these are one of genetics you call yourself a grower or whatever or have access to genetics I love the bud structure this one won't be coming down right now but you can see the bud structure goes all the way down like you're try sticks but this is lasting Thunder [ __ ] look at the wiggle on that actually you know what you might be down to there's two of them in here I want to pin them down I'm just looking at them now I could bring them down just because I've seen how they they do no I don't forget popping the ATF for future reference for those out there that plan to grow it but these seeds these beans were from 1973 so if you can imagine or sorry nineteen eighty-something yeah but I had been popped so I had put you know that's number of seeds down but I only got like a sixty percent success rate so I'd barely buy any of it to come back to life so these are so these are genetics that are definitely not alter absolutely Mangiamo I can guarantee planet and care in Canada that happen [ __ ] in genetically modified or those beautiful seeds right there absolutely and again green eyeshadow degree plan you can spend a lot of people they get they contact me and they ask me about the nutrients I remind them that you know I'd love to get my own and tree company off the ground and going and we are working on West Coast Wilcox grows but that's a it's a lot of projects going on at one time most importantly is getting back to basics for me I got twenty five thousand subscribers on YouTube here because I taught people how to grow no because I was an activist not because they took on the government not because nobody cares about that they just care whether we come up with you you know we parties like number one on YouTube like you know what I agree I haven't seen ATF's is like ninety eight exactly none of us have seen the ship for like thirty years we had twenty thirty years but these are truly 1970-1980 genetics like this is a gift these are a gift and a blessing ya know my friend on the island here I want from what you see these better I'm trying to climb this a cat lady because it's it's a way they grow analogy there's only four of them that I ended up ended up keeping for the testing purposes anyway you know we got more decent stuff but for these four I was happy with and what I want to point out again these are now a weekend of flush and they got seven days left to go but you can see here that's why I considered doing want to cut it down you know I know that my electric conductivity about 150 with this point right now the last time I checked it that's why I said it watch for this one I'm not worried about it because ETS gonna go a little bit longer but now I'm looking at a I looked at the trikes there darling out that everybody would say yeah it's usable let it go and at same time I'm thinking this might just do its final burst I really want to study this one because this one is the one that we're going to farm because I've got balance and I've got females of this one I've got more seeds and most importantly when you save your males because you know a gorilla jumps on the screen I think he enjoys it as well so there you go gorilla says it's on we have to give this gorilla name anybody want to help us with a name no we haven't named yet but he pops on him from time to time and he will do is a CNC dance and you were saying and I wanted to bring the ATF over now the one that we showed you guys earlier with the big popcorn button stops really interesting but the reason this is interesting is again because it had such a low survival rate I'm proud of my ability to germinate seeds you know I've had to you for the past 25 years as a medical patient but to learn how to do it and do it right and and the optic and optimize it is important and when you're dealing with strings like this like I really use my best methodology and my closest intended this and I still only got 60 percent success rate so this is truly and unfeathered and if you look at the nice ridges in the leaves and stuff I mean just beautiful beautiful healthy strong dirty plant and it reminds me of why I love to grow and why I believe that there's land races and and there needs to be land races this has to happen we need to make this happen I always check John Denver our developer online yes I've taught this now again you can google this [ __ ] scope you go by Jason Wilcox there's nobody else don't they were talking before me I got a hundred videos on YouTube here if you go to youtube you can definitely see it there I'm not going to take the time out to go find it but if you google that [ __ ] you'll find it um we've done everything from Road treaties to you know there's 800 videos there's everything unfortunately a lot of them have been lately live so you don't have to go back to before they're before I have to funky monkeys a friggin gorilla Hoshi if anybody's looking a little bit what Bokashi is but apparently saying it like they teach you from my master controller does that's me DVD dad so Chris booming but you know what apparently you can find the products online and I'm going to look them up after the show and definitely will consider an ex-cop and the biggest thing to remember guys is while it gets you going to see that the gorillas des in there but also also guys it's important because patient after patient has contact to be understanding what my name is telling me I can't grow I'm reminding them that are you a medical patient with an AC MVR permit yes okay then it doesn't apply to you you're under the jurisdiction of the federal government Canada you are not under the jurisdiction of the provincial government nor your municipality your privacy rights and so forth we lost solely in the jurisdiction of the federal government and federal law what's your favorite flavor fruity floral or feet gassy covered it all I guess again you're asking a question I just you know I get that no essential central oils is what Terps are in they reside outside the drive motor so the essential oils of the plants so when I touch this and it gets sticky everybody says oh that's a trichomes it's not always just a tricone melting into your hand it's actually the oils it's the essential oils for me I'd be drawn to again or I would go to not necessarily any one strain I'm looking for everything okay there are lots of phenotype for instance the way the terpene development is the genotype has very similar thing sorry the Bloods predisposed in this any seed is what it's going to put out there so the by mice I might like the aroma and I might say oh man this is awesome or it might be all know and this is gonna stink the house up so bad you know we're gonna get in trouble like this mysteries like that my point is is that until you smoke it you just don't know it yeah true and I'm gonna keep it real root the fruit farmer Flay and it's all the same but you need to smoke it and once you smoke it you can then truly give a fair judgement that's just my opinion you know I mean everybody has a right to their own opinion but it's I've been tricked before with strains and I think that's the reason I'm saying it I've tricked myself before with strains and I don't wanna keep that that's not fun I'm switching up my sponsor board here these gentlemen please that are watching and a shout out to ATF as well honestly guys please not now I mean not ETF I mean planning yeah anyway I think it's very important but I think sure but we need to remember that there was one time where were England and everybody else was watching what was going on and though they thought that I lost my mind when I said that we were gonna restrain the government put them on trial I started sounding like I was going crazy I don't blame home for dropping off because people don't care to hear about politics and law and the boring stuff they want hear about how to smoke dad what do you have it on one side voltage made I won't tell you right now this high voltage is made of chaos my crumble if nice and you need to be an expert to smoke one yeah you do and one you're an expert you can smoke one I'm sweet sweet dab a lot daily Dobber that [ __ ] if your music and I could not bring someone you know no [ __ ] and then I mean that would rebel like you know the best of the best of the country it's a grumble - it's like it's a cover it's like honestly it reminds me of what I just I'm gonna be honest back in the day before there was closed loop systems any of this [ __ ] and I was growing 15 lights in my basement we were using crumble and crumble is nothing more than open blastin and left to sit until the point that powers and combo it becomes okay this is different Travis Finnegan is watching a brother I love you we got to get out for dinner I haven't seen you in a while and I want to definitely say ho you don't tune in that often a bro I'm back doing what I do best man and and I feel comfortable doing it I wanted to be able to helping more people and doing more but I'm kind of feeling handcuffed right now so I figured I just keep doing what we're doing and we're and today we're talking about this particular strain is is Alaskan Thunder far from the 1980s and and the clock father gave it to me so he he hooked me up its train and I raised it and I only had a 60 percent success rate first time ever my you know since I'm really in many years of mastering the cloning in the germination aspect of cannabis I was shocked that that I had such a low success rate however we managed again to pop Kelly wasn't sure if they would even pop because he has such old genetics he has original land races that everybody wants like he actually hasn't and yeah I can't say enough about that this is a good example I think you seeing a bud structure and everything else I kind of let it grow all natural again only one kind you can see the be breaking in here and you'll see one in this plant is getting ready here and not burn up sure you can see I wanted to fill out this area I didn't want a straight line coming up in wasting space in my tent I want my intent maximized so what we're going to be teaching in upcoming shows and now that we got the tent cam going the tent camps gonna allow us to be able to switch over and show you guys live and we've done that before show you guys live what's going on in the tent and what we're doing the deep water culture was a good example of one we had a lot of fun with because putting it down and setting it up it was a lot of work to make sure everything was done right but interesting in in its results and there's a lot of other things still to come and I've been contacted by numerous companies my problem is when you get 8 different like that it's saying you pass my life what company do you go it to test their might because they all were they're all one they're all want me to test it you know but it's a pretty light but at the same time it could cost me and in time and in effort trying to test that but you know if you guys are out there again and then the only words of encouragement I can give people ask me well how do you get sponsors and how did you go about that I quite frankly approached them and said look it I can reach but in the day you know I said I didn't 20,000 people I get hit in the weekend and that's because I was fundamentally focused just on growing and that's what I'm going to get back to because again you got to go back to what worked and for me clearly talking about law and politics has only served to hurt camps Canada versus um better even though it didn't save home growing in the country of Canada it's it's ironic that that I'm sitting here at same time saying it was uh was unfortunate but it is what it is and I also wanted to know got guerrilla tents now the reason I say this I had an experience to I'm not gonna name the other company because I'm not into brand bashing but the one tent that I grew it it stunk and it basically got busted I mean my landlord when I first of the Vancouver before I got into this place my first landlord this guy says to me hey you can't grow no and I kind of said to him I wasn't even though my tent was in my living room he was just like why I know what's going on man can be new in this year and and I was bad because I thought to myself man if I only had the gorilla tent that I have right now thanks to Pacific Northwest arts like here in British Columbia another longtime supporter of cannabis in Canada hooked me up with a nice ten and and you could sit in my living room and there's no how to smell the weed except for times like now when I bring a plant out but when it's in there I've got the little four-foot carbon filter or two and a half or whatever there's at least four foot carbon filter and then a big hyper fan and then a muffler on top of the fan so when I talk about being a good grower god it's just like it's a series I really need it be a grower cure your smell kill yourself be a good girl and you can really have a lot of fun like today after the show's down I'm probably gonna do a live Instagram video with Vicky just doing juicing because people don't always see that you can also just if you don't want to get haunting you just want to get your your fly myself into you people don't realize Vicky and I do a lot of R&D it but it's because we're not in this for the money as much as we're in this for sharing the world of the healing I'm now 25 years ninja my illness and I lost a lot of friends over the years I've seen a lot of turmoil and cannabis has opened my eyes worldwide to the and the potential benefits we had to be yielded from this plan just because we've shown CBD does certain things in THC does certain things and I've shown how they do different things for different patients there's 100 plus vital cannabinoids that haven't been fully explored let alone the entourage effect what happens when only these cannabinoids are put together what happens when these are it is a locking key for cancer in there I'm going to throw that out there because I want people to think about this I talked about the World Health Organization reclassifying cannabis I said this in 2013 it's on my show this digitally backed up predicted what in Roja or what did the little Health Organization recently do we've lost the light cannabis you know why because we legalized it around the world all they did was get rid of the treaties by Justin Trudeau bro oh the life the life the THC is kinda long it's Pleasant smoking experience um I don't see seeds to put it i don't send seeds to Brazil yeah if there's any seed companies out there are two guys if you're interested in talking and you want us to profile your genetics on our show Leslie that's something that we can make happen we have been approached by by several companies and and most recently it's been it's been presidencies and it's taken us a while grow no madman seeds of grovel paradise gardens or not Paris garden sort of paradise seeds if we can keep this going because sharing genetics with one another and and again this is where for me if you come to Vancouver come see me that's all I can say because I'm really is one of those things where I want to get as many if we can get seeds and we can get and we can get clones out to people and allow people to start growing and they can just recognize the difference before they close this loophole before they close the medical program we don't do something if you don't get your licenses if we don't flood that program called the ACM PR regardless of all their arbitrary barriers to access regardless of all their letters of denial and others of confirmation that they want we need to flood that program the medical program alive and if we allow the medical program to die you'll all be non-medical users and I'll go back to what you guys are going to see this in the newspapers and you're saying oh god yeah you're right it was they can't tax medical it's illegal to talk to me right now it's only because cannabis doesn't have a DIN number as soon as it has a drug identification number we're all hooked during your non-medical remember to read the cameras on I hate it because the fact that they want to classify you as non-medical just because they could touch you you're like a cow no you're a bigger County or this farm and you patients you go over there because we can't tax you and we can't tax your home Brooklyn when you tax upon your supplies but we can't tax you on your home growing so the government loses and loses and loses so it was never about compassion if we look at what the government saw what the government's weren't done it went past the point of compassion to the point of bringing down literally our today look what we are now where were to the point of a form of distraction and the only thing that I look forward to is I myself and our friends in the least ones working in our reduction are looking at how are we going to do this regardless because we already know in our hearts we already know that this planet can be miraculous things we have a few doctors that are working with us we have different people that are working with us I think it's important for Canada to recognize what's going on and to recognize that these changes these changes can happen real quick like next year and it's what Kelly and I have talked about he's a vice president at coalition we've talked about what if they do this what if they knock out all growing plant counts I walked and said if the doctor doesn't put down a plant count or put down a gram number then you don't have a plant count and platform relations based on your your plant counts based on your doctor's prescription or authorization not prescription so it's important to understand that and then understand the difference I gave you Dennis I want to say what happened with the LPS is you're getting they love doing they're going to stay we honored our in you're getting our mill tell us the oh crap we only said we were going to give compassion to pricing we didn't say we were going to give a concert we there's a big difference between that but I can tell you all help you with comps are we absolutely yes I'll give you two reasons to get a medical license versus stay recreational if your recreational you can go for class you can have three plant or 30 grams on you in public remember that's just over an ounce in public that's it and for travel so I want to think about that for class 30 grams get a medical license for only 5 grams which is what a start side sleeping cough reviews yet one of those gonna start out by midday obvious prescriptions 5 grams doctors given all all day long for free here in Vancouver so you get a 5 gram license now what do you get with a 5 gram license from the ACP are you get to carry a hundred and fifty grams in public I know it's not much but it's all he'll walk more than 30 and you know what the biggest kicker is you could to store an unlimited amount of cannabis in your home you have no story general but the recreational user I believe is is restricted to a thing is 150 or 175 for what they're allowed to store so should you become a medical user it's worth the 6 months [ __ ] that they're going to put you through they're gonna put you through this [ __ ] and they're gonna make you once you just [ __ ] you and go and go grow anyway that's what health care is very good at they're very good at creating barriers and creating barriers to access basically by virtue of making sending back you license say hey you missed a date they need fixed a date and you send your license back then they send it back to you again well we need more information and it's like they want to build now so since when did they need a bill the promis'd investigating so they want a bill for some reason to verify that your landlord signature wasn't good enough this time so basically Health Canada saying this guy is not good enough he must be a fraud so you got to go with this guy and this is this is this is what's wrong with the system right now is a health care law seemingly one has investigator officers and two wants to investigate patients who have large licenses and I think that in itself needs to be investigated and stopped if there's a crime being committed and then in this palette II it's the police's job to start that investigation and finish it there's some of the federal government's job to start trying to entrap patients by asking them to send pictures and I've got a piece of paper here so I know the answer I thought we were allowed eliminated yes that's what they said your love I'm going to wait like right now I'm sitting here without a care in the world about how much DVD there's a bunch of see video there I've got about friggin eight liters of oil over there highly infused oil this is what's sitting around my house at any given time because I love weed it's just like if you love plants you know thirty plants in your house all kinds of different plants maybe if you love pictures you have pictures all over your walls if you love posters maybe you got posters all over your walls with me I got plants to [ __ ] all over my walls I love that you like parties is so goddamn sticky you give it me the sticky but keeping it real that's just the way it is and my friends Canada is nothing more than a footprint and I've called this down the pipeline anybody want to come on the show challenge me I am open to debate I am open to discussion and I'm open to retraction if I'm wrong but I tell you now I predicted the monopoly from 2012 even while Reuters didn't want me calling them a monopoly because it looked bad in court I ain't give a [ __ ] so monopoly now a monopoly over sales and distribution both here in Canada and globally and we're all just sheep the only reason we get to grow this plant is because myself and John Connon soir\u00e9e and then 15,000 supporters took the federal government basically took them to trial put them under a restraining order beat their ass and made them Institute home growing now my concern is what comes next yes yes who'd you recommend something else somebody say you know what they're looking for a doctor the only doctor they willing to sign up somewhere it's a pretty see anyways because a small town who would you recommend oh the old freezer proudly the only doctor much time to shut down who do you recommend I'm in the Fraser Valley I would say home typing on CRC I do they do Skype I do yes I believe and contact NCRC i if you wish they might do Skype there are some people that do Skype but I tell you now if you came here on a day that the clinic is open I can take you to a clinic with a doctor anyway the the doctor the doctor that works at this clinic is part of the can of clinics of Canada when the CMA came out with the one two three gram I'm trying to watch my language bullcrap suggestion that doctors only prescribe one two three grams are only authorized one two three grams it was based on what will be Israelis oh [ __ ] what both did you to read these words their testimony got thrown out of court what the [ __ ] we listened to the Israelis for this is Canada none of the free [ __ ] and now this went back to this we talked to the question this goes back to a question that I want to point to you guys now and ask you what do you believe yeah should this plant be a health product for sure to be a drug of all i'm often asked myself what's the difference between a drug and what's the difference between a health product sometimes they cross lines and I get that but I couldn't understand what defines our drug then what put takes it away from the natural category because to me and this is still natural when it doesn't hurt anybody I can see where if it hurts somebody could get pulled over here if they've had an overdose rate it could be over here if it actually had a fatality rate it could be over here and you can say it's a drug but until then it's ten magic mushrooms I guess turned drug to and I question whether they really are abroad where are they are they more just a mushroom and that becomes a question of really for the courts to look at in the future to me this is still plant that should be in herbology and begin be given a proper a proper view I'm going to go as far as I I haven't got much time left here ago I actually did that little any time left but I got one other phone I know I've actually been doing fresh frozen for the first time so it's going to be interesting - for the first time ever freeze one of my plants fresh and then how they get forgive me okay it's important information for medical patients because if you don't if you don't understand how wrong if you don't understand how important it is that these clinics what they did is when the family did that they branched off a bunch of doctors 30% of the CMA or whatever said screw you we've seen we've seen patients get better in our in our care so screw you type thing and and we were surprised to be quite honest but anyway they're called the canna clinics of Canada and these doctors will prescribe for you or they'll authorize you if they understand they're only they're not prescribing anything because there's nothing in their books yet but there right now so here immediately we can get you authorized if you contact the MCR SBI they can get you authorized five grams I believe is free anything else um you have to work out with them I'm not sure how it works with working with their particular facility but I thought I would give a shout out to the person that runs that facility Terry where Croft because he's like one of our our coalition national representatives for a couple of years let's quickly change this up just in closing in the last little bit to CBD CBD CBD CBD CBD cos east for these strains aside from ETF which was again an 80s inaudible flower so it's another one where you need to look at and why don't you see it was supposed to auto flower and I'm not going to get into too much discussion about that but with any out with any auto flower it's one thing to remember camels control the licensing that regulation status maximum possession I couldn't like exactly and now would be sets of maximum position that's the regulation and that's not under medical that's recreational in BC under cannabis Control Act what I just said was that we don't apply to BC rules nor do we apply to Vancouver rules because we fall under the jurisdiction of Health Canada's regulations and those regulations alone they're family that's federal regulation federal jurisdiction understanding jurisdictional are just jurisdictional law and understanding what the powers and what's overreaching and what we have to actually answer to is very important and medical or recreational user if you think a thousand grams is a lot to store I would remind you that if you just take that time to get that a CMP our license you can store an unlimited amount I'll repeat an unlimited amount call John W comma Q C's office and say Jason Wilcox is we can store a pollutant tomorrow's I true you'll get pissed off at me for tonguing do so but you'll see for yourself that I'm telling you the truth now why they wrote this law I don't know it makes me question why they did it but hey do you want me to storage my head that makes me relax a little more Mike as much lead as I want part of me wants to make my whole will frigging my whole place into it but then I don't want to be a bad neighbor you don't want to stink up anything that's where tents and again shout out to gorilla tents because they truly kill the smell you scrub the air they actually you popping up in a bedroom and in a small room in a basement without ever punching any holes in anything and still be able to get an optimal growth and that's what I've been able to demonstrate to you guys just with here I'm sitting here in my condo right now demonstrating to you how it can be done at home and that's what Myers this is what it was all about and then also for the medical patients grow bigger Travis if you're still watching is example how larger licenses because they need them they have high high tolerance like Vicky and I this isn't my main location for my garden and so I just test my plants here you know I'm allowed to throw four plants on top of my license if you didn't know that legally speaking on top of your license of say 25 plants you can add another four because you're also legal I know it's [ __ ] up right well welcome to the separation of jurisdictional powers from the federal government the provincial just get it lends credence to what I was just saying we're losing viewers like crazy on Maurice freakeating a favor broke you just said it's shared this around some of your groups I know you could get a few people watching on Facebook let's light this up for the last half hour I'm going to cut off the commercial break so I can do and uh we're gonna grab the other plant that we're gonna cut we're here to talk about it was the smallest yielding of all the plants and I don't know why but we're going to talk about it and it's its own string so of course it could be just it's a really good strain so uh most importantly if everybody wants to know my guesstimate for my driveway is going to be about 1.4 and that was just all straight around with some plants and really not putting a lot of work and that's a 600 that's not a thousand if it was a thousand it would be more like 2.4 but it is what it is it just depends on how things go I'm going to switch off the commercial this is lift 2019 in Vancouver and sharp-eyed none other than my own daughter mr. or miss twin Adair Wilcox and she also did the editing for this particular one costing me a lot in your kid when your kid is 19 and realizes what money's worth and what trying to work it's like you don't want it you don't want to teach them for that reason but anyway here's the footage from left and maybe I'll play a little beard brother stuff hang on to your socks get with it I might even get Vicky guys over here to talk about because that is a CBD strain and it's gonna get straight little for her for her again I only make oils for her I don't really make CBD nothing for me I'm a guy I make it for her and I've read these strains for her and if that's not love I don't what is its love for my plan I'm combining the two I know my woman of my pointer so that's uh that's just straight goods that's what I did addressed the seeds I noticed was it was a lot of auto flowers and a lot of high CBD strains and had once of cups so that's why I wanted to serve with little strains so we're going to be talking about what you put for instance if you want to make a homemade batch how much CBD do you need how much THC should give me how do you make your base oils do you make base oils how do you use CBD how do you test CBD and I'm actually going to show it I show actually I posted on Instagram it's a test on how you can tell if your CBD is just Chinese buff crap but I'll sink to the bottom enough not do nothing or if it separates the molecules and floats like a bunch of nice little crystals on top of the glass like a film then you know you got 99 something percent pure see me need crystalline I was proud to bring that to you guys it's important but please on Facebook share this around if you can guys I want to see a few more people on if they have any questions especially when we bring over the next planet before we start harvesting again I started out to green plant nutrients Pacific Northwest garden supply beer Brothers concentrate home genius who else we got we got a gorilla tents tmv naturals for the enhancer you want co2 at 1200 parts per million calls only all you have to do is follow the instructions and be attentive to the enhancer and you will obtain your 1200 parts per million inside your tent and that's what these plants were grown with as well so that's important understand so with shout out to TBD naturals and any sponsors that we're not we're not mentioning right now there might be reason for that or it's just because of to stone you know I forgot but you know that we're there and you are on our spinning wheel and making sure that you're in our credits accordingly now we will be putting up our schedule and starting our show what we haven't decided on yet is because of the documentary the documentary is now up to nine terabytes of recording information so any others out there that are interested in working on the coalition documentary if you live in the Lower Mainland and you're interested in trying to help me finish what has been a very adventurous journey and filming people that would be awesome to help with the documentary part because it's really sitting down going over the footage I'll be narrating it but really going over the footage and just stitching it together what goes where and and turning it into an actual documentary versus a bunch of recorded footage so and remember that's open to anybody so it's very important and if what I'm gliding is a lot of people are asking well Jason we have no schedule for you and I'm sorry to all my subscribers I love you and I I love this plan as much as I love my subscribers because talking to people was how I learned when I made mistakes when I didn't I learned through the internet and through social activity and learning to empower other people to live better lives there's no better feeling in the world and when other people empower me to live a better life there's no better feeling than that either it works both ways so you know when I go out and I doing this show I feel good sometimes I go over like today whether there's 8 people on Facebook that's not a lot of people watching but on YouTube I've got almost 30 people children and and and kicking it in the child that's what I'm talking about one time we need to get around the world I wanted to do live shows when we are in the big you know 15 line show is where we should be we should be doing live shows from proper grows where we just show you big trees to show you all the methodologies to teach you different things you know what this is think we will be doing the Vicky was just saying on the barter so let's get into the CBD now again the CBD stuff I'm not going to do that the glass test here because to the camera's not going to prove it but you can check that on Instagram or on Facebook it is probably to scroll down my page a bit you know and you'll find it but it will show you that on the glass at the diner if it's purified water or easy just put a little touch of CBD it will float along the top because remember every single cannabinoid is made of oil in this water repellent so it will not sink now anything that sinks to the bottom has either gel stabilizers for the stabilizers or puffs or all the above that's the problem with CBD in Canada now the reason I talk about this with my wife when I met her people don't know this but when I met Vicky she was in a walker something listen don't I don't have maybe I'll pull her video down here actually and show you guys for a video that really sets forth how CBD changed her life if I do I do with my clipper there we go all right so I also I'll pull that down for you guys to see in a sec here but when I ordered when I go to break and the reason I say that is because this particular video there's this one on the Justin Lewis video too at the top grab you videos if you have it um you know really really touch your heart and make you understand it cannabis can really impact people's lives and quality of life is everything I often preach it empowerment empowerment empowerment empower each other to live a better life don't punch down always punch out shoot for the stars but don't punch down don't knock somebody when they're already down help them get back up it's the difference and I guess how we how we do how we treat people do you remember what I call that oh my god okay once I care down hold it I'm gonna load this into my broadcaster and then you guys will be able to see it and I'm going to grab the other plans in the meantime do a job and then when we come back we can go ahead and and continue actually sorry there's going to be a lift and then Vicky's video and then I'll come back with the last one that we're going to harvest as the smaller buds but they're tighter buds and we'll talk about that particular one and why it may or may not have turned out the way it has and right now this is the video that Vicky did just so you know for some reason they felt the need to age restrictive on YouTube they flagged it and then not allowing it in certain countries I want you to think about this when you watch this video I want you to see where she in any way suggest criminality and then for them to flag this video it's out 1496 years I if you feel this video hits you share it around share it with your family share with your friends because it's really what makes the difference oh there's even a dab off here and drone footage I got a couple of good ones I can play you guys since I'm killing time I got to let this finish now hmm alleged that malted milk that's definitely interesting that's right one just bear with me friends as I get into this because this will actually go back a little bit of ways to when Vicki and I first got together and as we saved this again I'm not quite sure why there we go okay so I've got to lift video first I'll do the kicking morphine one because this one is again we talk about kicking morphine stopping opiates addressing the opioid crisis and addressed in the fentanyl crisis if we were the one addresses let's address it head-on unless it dress it for real because there's people out there who have already done it including myself and I've watched Vicki do it if we remember this is filmed just prior to us traveling for her first time she didn't think she could travel for 120 minutes in a car when I first met her and we drove across the country together but lord knows she suffered in those first couple of days you know in first couple of I'd say first first four or five days she really she went through her ups and downs but you know what if it wasn't for this product and I'll give it to him the natural remedies again thank you for introducing us to CBD and thank you for helping to save my wife's life um you know her quality of life because I've been able to show her the world which if it wasn't for discovering CBD I don't think she would have she would have been able to see because she wouldn't believed it was possible and that that's a lot of credence to to CBE as we continue to talk so we'll see you guys in about about ten minutes we're gonna see you later guy here on my own 150 oh yeah we'll see you guys about five minutes welcome on cascara j-smoove us the real cameras in Canada we're celebrating a win in our hi this is a Vicki O'Brien medical we don't want a medical cannabis patient I would like to share a little bit about the journey that I am about to take with my partner Jason Wilcox as we travel coast-to-coast on some of you know we've been in Ontario for the month of June visiting family and prior to my leaving to come to British sorry to come to Ontario I had recently been put on morphine due to my hepatitis I had come off of all of pharmaceuticals a couple of years ago with cannabis oil and recently my liver acted up and I was first off can of oil my body couldn't process on high doses of oil anymore so I was forced back onto pharmaceuticals unfortunately that pharmaceutical was morphine because it's the only drug that does it it bypasses the liver I was in the hospital for a short stint anyways the long the short of it is I was put back on morphine and for anybody that's been a patient a cannabis patient and suffered withdrawals and done that to be put back on it was horrendous to say the least so that basically didn't allow me to take the journey back to British Columbia with Jason as some of you know Jay and Daniel made the trip out from BC on to Ontario in the car when I we all decided to make this trip I went to my doctor you know we talked about you know my you know I didn't want to be on the morphine forever but you know it was this was a situation that I was placed in anyways my doctor at that point decided that he wanted to taper me back off the morphine because my liver was doing better in his eyes I guess I'm not sure but unfortunately I still have a lot of chronic pain to deal with and he didn't want to deal with my chronic pain he only wanted to deal with the symptoms of my liver I'm assuming so he forced a taper on me and he also forced a taper on me when I was supposed to be on a vacation with my family so this has not really been the best vacation because the entire time I've been I've been withdrawals since the day an hour I got on the plane you know doctors play God in your life you know and for all that you know the Rona Ambrose's of the world think there's no value to marijuana well you know what I didn't feel very valued in my doctor's office when you decided to do a morphine tamper when it was supposed to be on vacation you know that's not our medical system you know so anyways the long and the short of it is I wanted to get off of the opiates anyway I didn't want to go back on them I just didn't have any other cannabis options I'd run out of oils um like I said I couldn't take them because my body couldn't process coconut oil anymore grapeseed oil or any oil um so I really was out of options and I don't know like a miracle of God Jason I got in some RSO and so thank God he shared one of the syringes with me last week and it was like a miracle you know it was relief came it was it was truly felt miraculous you know I wasn't run into the bathroom I wasn't not just I wasn't sick you know it alleviated the withdrawal symptoms the pain of withdrawal is so much a soul that I said to him if I can get my hands in this oil Jason not only do I feel that I can talk through withdrawals I truly believe in my heart I can make this trip home with you so I'm supposed to be on a plane tomorrow on a son winged flight and I've given up my flight I don't get my money back I believe in this oil so much that I gave up my $300 flight for no good reason other than to say you know what I believe this oil will get me off of morphine and it will get me home so you know what Rona Ambrose for this moment there's no there's no medical value you're insane you're insane woman you know any doctor that would send you home for four weeks on a taper first of all you're you how the hell is that health care you know that there's no caring in that you know I've suffered my family suffered it's been a heck of a month but anyways that oil last week I got my hands on this oil and I also did a tea with it and it was like life-changing and you know it brought me back to how I did my withdrawals the first time around and I did my withdrawals with our so this time is different because I'm not only doing withdrawals I'm taking a trip across the country so I'm taking you know probably the worst times of my life and extending it because I have serious back pain but I truly believe it's possible with this oil so I was able immuno and this stuff is very expensive and it shouldn't be this stuff should be the same damn price as my opiates you know it shouldn't cost hundreds of dollars for me to be in like no pain you know this is crazy this is hundreds of dollars and then go to the pharmaceutical I go up to shoppers Drug Mart and it only cost me twenty six dollars so there's like thirty six dollars for like a hundred morphine how can I even be right you know what I mean how can that even be right how can it cost so little for something that's killing me and so much for something that's saving me you know this is all on purpose man so you know this prohibition this reefer madness it has to end it has to end there you know they did I believe I firmly believe that if this were in the hands of every detox every withdrawal management Center and again I was an addictions counselor before I became sick I firmly believe it as a worker if I had this in my hands and I wasn't in detox nobody would suffer again no heroin or opiate addict would ever suffer again the pains of withdrawal would be a thing of the past they're running to the bathroom and it just taking over your life that would be a thing of the past and I don't think any human I should have to suffer that's my thing right I don't think suffering especially when we have access to medicine that allows us not to suffer and for me this has allowed me not to suffer so um today is my last day of I watch the last last night was my last morphine and today thank God is my first day of freedom so we're gonna open this up I have a day one and a night one from the natural remedy don't CA they're amazing people they have they're the only place that I've been able to locate um actually like high CBD and high THC the last time I did this I got a one oil it was a one purpose one thing did one you know and it didn't do everything there's no one thing for all people these guys are amazing they have it so much so that they have different oils for different issues like different strains for different pains like Jayla says and it only makes sense right it only makes sense to me so I have a high CBD one for the day which is going to allow me to stay in the car with Jay and get home but it's gonna keep my inflammation down my pain down not only does it do that the owners of the company explain to me what it does for your brain when you're in withdrawal isn't anybody that knows the withdrawals you are in a state of crisis your brain is in a state of crisis it doesn't matter what you do it is so stressed out and you're frustrated just not being there all the things that you don't want to be this oil here this one the CBD oil actually helps swelling almost that stress of the brain on swelling but it's stress it actually alleviates the stress of the brain CBD is an amazing an amazing medicine you know so this will not only you know assist the inflammation in my body and my back my hips but I'll also keep the inflammation in my brain which is where all those crazy withdrawals are happening it's gonna keep that at a calming state - and for anybody that's been wearing that right now you know that there's nothing common about withdrawals so anything that can keep the shakes and all that [ __ ] down at bay I mean it's it's this is a miracle this is a miracle I am an addictions counselor if I could have given this to one of my patients just one client you know what I mean they didn't have to suffer I mean it's amazing what we could do no addict needs suffer everich and if they don't want to you know I don't think that withdrawals anybody should ever have to suffer again so we are going to making this trip with this like I said the inflammation one and then for anybody that knows me knows I also suffer terribly with insomnia so I have this crazy THC one that's for nighttime so it's a 75% THC and 5% CBD I don't understand the science enough but I do know that the THC one kales me and it's amazing for pain and the CBD one I haven't tried so I'm pretty excited to see really how I'm gonna feel because really the only one I've ever had was like this the standard high THC oils right this is a whole new world for me and I'm really excited to see how I'm gonna be feeling physically and mentally because your mental your mental picture is a big part of who you are in and your day right so we're getting ready for this trip it's pretty exciting sorry about all the tears on its you know it is what it is and as much as I hate where I'm at I'm actually glad to be here because I didn't want to go back on morphine and without having access to these kind of oils my only other option was being forced back on coconut oil and they can't consume it so I'd run out of options and thank God for the natural remedy because they've given me options that I didn't think I had any more and this is this is a blessing right a huge blessing because I didn't want to be back home like a normal pizza anyway so anyways enough of that but boring stuff let's move on to the happy good stuff we are getting ready for this awesome trip I don't open up the tri-fold cuz these are for people's dispensaries and there lounges we're all set up Kelly Kay from the West Coast got us all ready out we got trifles here we got stickers I'm not going to put everything out but I would like to pull it out some of these t-shirts because they're pretty awesome I don't even

PMS and hopefully we can stop sesh educate and share information and you know the more cannabis the more of us get together the better we need we need power numbers at this point folks August is right

eight industry having a great time once he Gateway Scotty we love Vancouver love this show love cannabis in Canada we're having a good time just hanging out and thrown out packs to everyone Cheers all right welcome ice Canada I am going through and I just sent out a bunch of invites I just learned this um my tech very kind of not only in I couldn't figure out how to how to invite people if you don't want to be invited I'm pretty sure there's an option to to not be invited to participate if you chose this more of a private you know yeah we're proud of doing that you have a public viewing but it's interesting to do this private one because you can actually literally invite here but that works there anyway uh wall I'll break I didn't get to it really get a chance now they're all scrapping this other straggling pond this is the lowest yielding flat out of all of them and we've all had a pot sorry wrong like this it doesn't matter you know who you are if you're growing from seed anyway it's you yet one subclass are just lowly guilders because their third genotype was weak to begin with no different some will turn hermaphrodite if they were properly stabilized to be away so will not be said this is certainly not a strength that I want to grow twice I might smoke them they still I don't know but want to see it has the books a little small tight popcorn that's like up here this is when this is dry this is maybe a wonder I'm not at best and you know maybe it wasn't one one or two long hair so it's it's not you're looking at a total of maybe [ __ ] maybe only announced on that off the plan in total you know by the time you remember it's 50% of experienced rink so it takes you know what weight by weight conversion that being said I don't know why I did that it's the same age just the same as the other ones and they all yield in much bigger but this is just a low yielding strain that being said it also might be one of the most potent strains I've ever smoked I don't know that's what I love about new strains that I have before so but once again if you're if you're going to be drying them and hanging them there's no need for the extra water in the leaves so you're just kind of killing your time you want some time just get rid of the get rid of the families just pick them off and and then hang your plants and of course what that'll be as long as there's nothing as long as if they're not they shouldn't be swinging around or moving or banging enough and your trichomes aren't going to get all knocked off or Nothing onto the floor now if you want you some people in their tent if they're gonna hang your plants that are tender then we'll put Polly basically a plastic cup not really called the plastic film they'll put that down to catch any trichomes that during the drying process some will naturally fall to the ground and they'll catch those for the purpose of making hash later or screening it later and we've taught that it's no different than scoping your trichomes all like all these pipes have been scope of course before we started picking or doing any of this I said the only ones that I want to keep going is that ATF I believe that it has more time left in it so not much more time but still has more time so again picking off the water is a long doing right now is to continue to just go on a little bit and water is some vegetarian pizza I'm proud of myself I'm now too much vegetarian and I don't let me sound funny to some people like [ __ ] souls no - seriously - my other car boyfriends in my the beer or drink beer and [ __ ] bar are working man I get it like if I go out and hunt with you I'd be down probably for eating not me but when it comes to eating after it some of the [ __ ] that I see into it this as a social justice activist you need to ask yourself some if you see that common sense logic and reason you know always have to meet and you try to look for that and then you think yourself ok there's all these people we're already overpopulated so then a lot of artists like that one we need are overpopulated our land is already overpopulated by human feces and by human emissions so then there's our cars there's all the [ __ ] that we're dealing with that in our construction and our warehouses and our other destructive behavior but then we got all these cows and we forget that there are also producing carbon emissions now that's the one thing I never thought about some people ask me like why would you stop eating meat I said for one reason is because there's going to be a hole in the ozone layer and if there is we're all dead and we're gonna burn and I don't want to I don't want that for my kids and some people are going to say well you know they sprayed the vegetables they crop dust and then you know I get it I get where everybody's going it was more about just my own choice it looking at that and saying you know if we're making just as much emissions only because of population and choice of food but we don't actually need me to live you know that we can actually live on on on regular plant-based proteins then it made a choice for me to not be part of the problem any longer what until they find a solution you know until I know what that solution is you know but I go it's a I'm gonna become some beginning and and destroy all my freaking food no I mean [ __ ] Jim Vicki see me a few times especially after a couple drinks it's extremely hard not to just want to order a rack of ribs you know it's just that's just mean I've always been that way but I am proud to say that when you if you're gonna try something at least do the persons around you that are doing it give them the honor and the respect of giving it an honest try and that's what I wanted to do would be being a vegetarian what I learned was that my blood pressure came down because I was on my mind a heart was going at over a hundred beats a minute and if I have had a few heart attacks before because of treatments I have to take the standpipe but anyway the well sort of my blood pressure came down from get from doing over 100 beats a minute down to what was reasonable which was the DA meats or or even better under slightly beat some people say well I Slover a blood pressure you don't want that it's late you know that's actually what I want I prefer to know that I'm in the 70 to 80 range 100 to 200 10 range which is like I would I would see the doctor and I would tell them go I didn't take it it's gonna be 110 they wouldn't believe me because that's normally and exercising full-blown exercise I hear you're a full load on the treadmill your gear your heart rank it up to 130 but that's it it's not getting gold like mine up to a hundred and fifty-five where the machine actually turns off and says your heart you know it's a concern that the Machine actually tells you if you're hooked up to them these new ones they have limits that the only match part I can over 55 or 65 but my heart hit a certain living told me beep-beep stop you gotta you gotta slow down and I guess your heart will explode at a certain level and if your training I'm taking that so serious is something to think about yeah is there any questions at all are there any questions at all because now we've got our private show going and we've got our own viewing in our own track it's only my friends it's only the people that I had known I trust that are in this room and they can talk cannabis we can talk whatever we talk dad's a most important thing we can talk about the stuff that normally we don't do I have to jump off soon I want to give at least a half hour and try this new thing out it's a new feature that Facebook has I didn't know how to use it so it's my first time just kind of playing with it unfortunately this is the end of a very long show the hottest part is some really big heavy yielding plants and people are able to see that and if you wonder what I'm doing now I'm simply getting rid of one or weight that I don't feel any you know it's just something that dries a little faster it's is having any uh any potential mold or anything else develop you know if you allow the levels needs to sit over top you know you better have the right air circulation in your room which I'm really not worried about this is just more about timing if you if you've harvested enough times you'll know it was leaves you want to keep in which ones you don't when it comes to making mole hash and you know whatever there's gonna be trim that I want to keep and then there's gonna be stuff that I don't in this case for this particular plant it's actually low yield er that I'm probably gonna oil this was just straight oil take it and once it's done if we might I think we're gonna try will I've always wanted to try the I've got the butane here and I know it's bad but I've got a friend down the street that's got a nice closed-loop system in his house and I think I can go stick this plant into his pipe and once I freeze it it should stay frozen because it's only a block away and we run it through that pipe and we'll hollow fresh frozen extraction and that I hadn't done before and apparently it's different you know we do you really pull the turf that way I don't know I'm not again I I left doing blasting and stuff so you asked Negro questions I can probably help you with growing I can't help you with a lot of others problem solving you know if you ask me about a fungus doing due to the fact that there's over a hundred thousand different funguses in the world why would I even attempt to diagnose that fungus instead just peroxide got shake and kill it it's that simple you can go buy peroxide in high concentrations at your hydroponics store and they'll tell you to go ahead and run it through a certain dilation to sterilize your soil and kill any microbes or anything living in there now if you're an organic grower it's like no because for me I rely on all those living microbes that are in there right now and this was all or anything wrong with many one you know there's live microbes living in here I don't want to kill them but if there was some fungus growing on top of my my soil I wouldn't be concerned and the only way that I thought for sure to kill a fungus is to go ahead with peroxide so that's the solution in that particular band-aid situation the other thing is to make sure you find out what was the source of of that fungus when I say is so easy to get rid of this is true I don't no just because I can't see that one black shirt with gold chains I know it's not you what you mean I'm sorry James I guess yesterday and one wearing my change today and for our friends on Facebook it's good to see they've got a few more people on here I like this private time I like this guys because we're able to actually be in here and there's not necessarily it's different because I don't know if this is still streaming to the regular channels is still streaming to the regular channel as well or is it just went into private I like this [Music] actually I think it's a neat thing to do because it makes it more personable and I'd like to be able to invite people I'm trying to learn this and most importantly people just need to understand that if you look up campus in Canada you'll see that the incorporation is owned by myself Jason Wilcox which is I keep saying this and it sounds funny because I had to I have to look you a lot to to keep the company and to to keep on those that are more wealthy away from my my own stuff my intellectual property what they do is they take the property and then they remind you a whole but you're the founder and it's like well thanks I'm the founder but you're the owner so the owner makes the money the founder is just the founder so it sucks that there's people out there taking each other's intellectual property and that's just the world we live in I've learned that that's part of business and I'm glad for those that have come to join the show that we can talk about that there's a lot of people out there oh people Barry Sean so he's not some reliable source I'm known buried way back in the days when I see the atmosphere please long before I did the coalition and long before today anything else Barry and I did a lot of advocacy work within the city of Oxford mostly this time off addiction to be quite frank we knew cannabis would help but we knew there is no way they don't don't hate appreciated [ __ ] let's sit there a [ __ ] hate [ __ ] boot your ass off this channel no in all seriousness yeah no I know and I at the same time I usually don't wear I usually don't wear in garden or or element level I was at a friend's Whitney and with a couple people that I'd like to borrow logs over so I put my and that's kind of how I got caught in this situation Kollek Alexander Morrison holy [ __ ] is awesome so look [ __ ] you better call me nose seriously call me man we got a we got a few over doing here I got it Carlo SS goes well we're gonna plot a crazy stuff I sent out the invites guys because this is now a private chat I guess I'm able to do this I'm not sure how this works on my shirt like it's a hundred percent private hey kiera here we'll just a long long - this is Brandon yeah because I sent you an invite but [ __ ] yo haters are gonna hate online is that normally we don't know we don't really wear our jewelry oh let's not see in this day and age it's not really you know was my ego no joke call 20 like our jewelleries come back round like 90s like circa 1990 music sir commander like a Snuggies I'm gonna say that we were the people we are with were much much younger than us and they chose to wear a lot of gold someone might call Alexandra Morrison it makes her wear a lot of gold but no in all seriousness just um that's the only reason you see me with any more than my my usual ring on but no you know what it is what it is and people can hate if they want to hate I really don't care it's a nice what it is I have friends are millionaires and I don't hate on now I'm happy for them and I've got friends that are extremely poor and I wish I could see them do better I see them trying to find that door to to happiness to do to aspect you area where they don't have to fear police yeah I don't want on YouTube but it's it's almost funny just to let it keep rolling at this point you should I play bigger though we're not having vegan pizza you [ __ ] you do all your vegan pizza that I mean something else they can't see you let me go boys you look beautiful as always now you do so whatever but anyway I wanna see how does it help you Jason back to see me back to see me DVD sure let's go to get sent out anyway we got a little bit here of the herbal passion CBD and this is the stuff that I was doing that they're testing with not showing you guys very heavy molecule something that very poor very proud like you're gonna see in here a lot more giving this even the smell and yet when you do it but you can see this is a very heavy molecule you'd be surprised that there's yeah you'd be surprised at the way that's here there's almost half ounce there and you wouldn't ever believe that you know if people you wouldn't believe it it's a very heavy molecule but this CBD will be able to keep one person going for again if I we haven't figured out is the intellectual property or should we actually do shows and teach people how to make their own city cops because that is it's so important that you're not wasted that you not undercut yourself either and in its we thought a lot about that about how best to do it and and realistically I mean if you go on studies on the air now anecdotal research will point always that there's only uh that there's only um sort of an angle that I'm losing my mind and a long show there's no you're trying to get off this book control alright seriously also in this in CPD crystalline I wanted to talk about the food great my friends if you take something like this and I've done this it's on Instagram it's on me it's on my Facebook page and you can check that out if you want you'll see where I put some in water and then let you guys see for yourselves that nothing falls through because it's 99.9% pure so there's nothing falling down to the bottom of the glass most importantly when I zoomed in with my camera I got nest 9 so it's got a nice little camera on it I can zoom in and show you guys to crystals and you can see all the CBD crystalline and that there was no byproducts or anything that shouldn't either it all looked like a bunch of little snow floating in water and that's this stuff so at the end of the day what I wanted to talk about was obviously about the getting real crystalline so check out with the herbal passion I believe it's Dodge net Nikki very herbal posh about that I'm pretty sure sorry no I'm just I'm going to ask you to pick if you do that's right or is it I was sure if we wanted I can go either way [Music] no I don't know I can't seem to get it up but our verbal question yeah okay I've done it yeah okay so I'm here will pass you're done oh gee I'm DMX 4:20 I totally agree on I like toxin CVD but into my daily so you went you know what I totally agree I'm not been on a lie no smoking on a flower you know well I'm not feeling well I will definitely Jason can attest to this proud son I could recruit us an amazing CBD dogs and you know see those dogs can take me from like plus ten to the runner for five really quick CP it's amazing when they're flower Iceland extracts whatever way you find in manage anxiety and if you're you know dealing with health issues most of us are dealing with anxiety you know health issues give you anxiety on and some people with my sister just deals with anxiety and she's doing with all that she's taking CV of all as a standalone product but she's a really loving so I totally agree wonderful CBD for anxiety is a wonderful product that's a great point you know we've talked a lot about health and health care and you know ailments pain this and that you know sometimes we don't focus enough on Nietzsche Cerner's and maternal health and you're absolutely right CVD is a wonderful thing for loops or anxiety depression it's a brilliant even and you know what they're finding out now through research that CBE is a neural protectant which means it actually protects our brain so like you know if you have an if a brain injury Parkinson's on alternate if you have been a brain disorder of n tight I would be taking CPP every day in fact I think we should take CP every day just because it's a little protected and it's actually our brains that's just working for the day at the same time with CBD we always suggest people not just CBD but th see the full entourage all hundred plus vital contaminants I believe we have an endogenous system for a reason and I believe it needs to be fed and feeding it however you do it is the best thing you can take like right now I chopped this throw it in the blender get my fiber get my omega-3 six and nine and get all my final cut and cannabinoids without getting high welcome it's mine you're curious can Minister it's your first time checking out the show there's a first time trigger the show welcomed so much of the show no no no this is joy and you've got some stuff from it and you know what hopefully we will see you back playing it yeah we've been on for a couple hours here so we're like at the end of a thing we'd almost do better to play pretty boring stuff than to keep just battling but honestly we wanted to do i to just stop in and we're still testing again for me i'm doing some testing so figure out what i have to apply has been going to this year and and at the same time to let people know that we're getting ready I mean we got we got four 22 start coming up but most important is this is this documentary it's good when you got three hours of John Cochran talking about this legal case because you've got you got so much history and so much information that I almost want to release the comma right Connor Chronicles I've talked about this and I think I might even do this separate from you know they what in essence is is the polish and documentary so it's something that I've definitely thought about this John Conroy story is quite the quick story of social justice but today's show is about the plants you guys have seen the various plants this is the lowest yielding these are the products that we actually use what is a good soil to use with many one when we get off I would always go on the pro mix or more sunshine mix any of the with the the promoted the one thing to remember and this is very very important please listen to what I'm saying about this part I love green plant a new trance but I'll always have the freedom to speak my mind about different products now I believe many one burning spot so there's two things to remember that if you're going to use chromates or sunshine mix like I'm suggesting understand they're preloaded with micronutrients and macronutrients that will last for the first two weeks so there's no need to add many one to your plant or you might burn in Friday roots and show your pot and then wonder what you did well and it wasn't anything you did wrong it was just that the things where I explained properly that's the biggest thing biggest mistake grower to make and and often it doesn't kill the plant it just burns the leaves but it makes the plants look ugly and it's the biggest mistake people make is remembering when you first transpired or when you first got transplant of a sore then you don't need to feed again you've got two weeks basically of food there and you can wait until the plants live the children that need food or into the pure comfortable with the food level but that's important and and then now on the issue of many one burning hot I have all aluminum ice sink right now but anyone burning hard the reason I say burning hot remember it's a one part organic so you don't have to worry about three parts you don't worry about all this measuring and all those chops and also they crop it's just one jug but that one jug can make or break a crop it's organic it's gonna make you killer terpenes even this goes killer terpenes it's nice thick sticky bugs I mean they're small but they're they're tight but anyway it's a it's a one part organic that work old strings great you know the way the migrating say I use the exam spoon every one of those strings and they all produce as they did my most important thing what they want is when input is hot you're not fleet is thi you gotta bring you up to six one six two whatever you're comfortable with I'm comfortable with six six one or six to buy anything other than that know if it's burning even harder than that which it will right out at the model just test it that'll probably burn in hydroponics range and and the problem with burning in the hydroponics writing decide you can't eat as many one in height opponents because it's it's organic and it'll plug up the emitters so you can't use it that way so it's important to understand i when i'm talking about burning hot it's solely about understanding they're going to need in or left you get organic pH are up credit your choice you can use a page up like any sort it's just it speaks your own idea up anyone just because I've got the best control the way we're supposed to get over the island are coming the island and we're supposed to go over there and foaming we're just waiting for a coffin on a couple things I'm not sure who's still watching and this thing's completely changed now that it's went to UM it's why I got all who's watching the news not watching that's that's what makes half are difficult but for for our friends on YouTube it's it's great I tried something new on Facebook so it's just kind of screwed look here right now I can't tell who's there who's not there but it's good to have them on it's at the end of a very long show and once they show that I'm liking I'm probably deleting because these shows want to say that you it's good it's more doing a live harvesting of any sort whether it's crappy little ones like this or like the ones we started with and at the beginning of the show that were the size of my coffee can you know when you're able to but when you're able to get a nice big thick but again of your plants so yeah I think about size plants I ain't healed this is a good example of something that I would not I would not do again however I'm so interested in smoking units are often some of the ones here just like Yammer which is a high-yield no more mass quantity they want to do it but yeah I got a lot of people in the chat without a lot of people talking you just ran into the oven but yeah that's all right what we'll probably do with this one here is that this one will get cut I'm just gonna finish picking off you know whatever families I can get kinda thrown into the freezer and and and basically once frozen when as fresh frozen extraction just to see what the difference is it'll be carboxylate one side butane you know in the system once that buting's or stuck back Oh dong goo Shane's gone it's going to be at that point yeah it's going to maintain the the turkeys I'm hoping but I haven't done it before so if there's any comments everybody has on fresh frozen please let me know if you have any suggestions but that's something that's definitely I haven't tried it understood but this makes you a good experimental plant to try it with I can see a plant good music there's some reason have no trace and after honestly 67 days these it should be these days undone so yeah it's kind of an interesting day and other people hope that some people might be happy with this for this or yield if you have five plants with it with this kind of yield and squeeze it together and understand it as I put it then you can look at a sort of like this because you can see how much blood you gosh yeah and it's gonna be about a half ounce three quarters of an ounce versus we also many other ones I had maybe an ounce again because they're so good buzzer so tight I think they're gonna be a little bit heavier but that's a big important thing I definitely gave a heaven at God 100% gaming you're right bubble hash is what I was thinking about but then I was thinking about the fresh frozen haven't done I haven't had syrup from fresh frozen and then tried died which is best basically a form of I present so at that point if you want to make diamonds that's supposed to be the best syrup to use to start to make diamonds so that's what I want to see if I can do and I figure it's it's nothing to waste the planet on Rd if that's going to help me make better diamonds faster then what anything else we do and that's what I'm trying to experiment already know I'm trying to catch up with the culture the culture is actually gardening got a little bit ahead of me I am with respect to extractions but with everything else you know I can pretty much like a pretty much to hold my own in conversation and and in practice but when it comes to extractions I'm still learning so I'm definitely open to any comment I'm watching bubble hash is one thing but I honestly think this planet I'm just going to trim off whatever I see that doesn't really have much much of anything trichomes and the rest of it I'm just going to stick in my freezer and until it can get lasted in a closed-loop system and and that's what I'm thinking further in there with the syrup from that I was gonna stick in a mason jar and put the lid on it and let it do its thing and see what happens based on what I've been taught and seen that but if I'm on the right track I would love somebody say Jason you're on the right track or no don't waste your time you're gonna you're gonna you're wasting it - bubble - I like that Kyle how's that working you freeze it you freeze it in the freezer like this here how long it taking this you've already been to my 10 using my 10 collar on this is gonna be frozen once it's okay and these lilies are picked off it's going to be stuck in the freezer frozen and then it's going to be blasted and with the syrup rather than letting it go into the oven to become shatter I want the syrup to go into a mason jar and be sealed tight and start to make diamonds my understanding is that's the process to making live resin and then diamonds in the most optimal way and I don't know where the decarboxylation happens because butanes frozen it's gonna be coming out of my freezer frozen it's going into the freezer fresh so it doesn't have time to decarboxylate at all if this doesn't dry so I don't know at what point in decarboxylase except for maybe when you got it I don't know I'm scientifically talking here I guess that's too old-school making bubble - way too easy I could do that I've actually got mark gave me a bunch of bytes years ago and I'm sitting in my back there and I could certainly make an Indian bubble higher so it wouldn't be a problem and it's so sticky I know we make a really good wash but I'm more interested in advancing my skills with with extractions so you know a friend of mine I get said down the street has an actual closed-loop system so I can get this stuff run Walt's frozen and with that syrup put that into a mason jar and seal it and allow it to do its thing and burping it occasionally you know we are at two hours of 47 minutes is lady freaking marathons total today and he's been a lot of use I also switched it over to the private thing two people have signed on in checked out game right thank you I want to see how that works so that as we program our shows we're going to now know how to better reach out to our audience I'm just waiting on a final help with streamlining streamlining so that everybody on Twitter everybody on a guy 8,000 contacts on Lincoln they're going to be doing my streams now so expect to see us war on Lincoln expect to see us more Instagram and at the same time here oh right now we're just we got somebody building us the script in the in in the program that's possible to funnel all these together so that when we make one policy that was to all the networks if we want it to and that's optimal so I hope everybody else has a wonderful wonderful day my wife and I are gonna shower on some food geez already looking at me like why the hell you got all this I still gotta go I say go hang plants and sick this in the freezer I guess is anybody else doing anything else able to say no problem Anthony thank you for supporting Canosa Canada honestly we always learn from each other I can tell you now there's people that are making posts on YouTube that I'm learning self and I'm also seeing stuff that I learned on Facebook and we learned together there's no one person you know and that's why that's what makes this show valuable my wife doesn't understand why get up and do it and the only reason I get up and do it is because when people say thank you because you learned something they're not made it all worth it yes that's exactly what made it all worth it you know my ROI is never money but it's definitely all about sharing that information ensuring that wealth and and that wealth is your health and remember that there's nothing more nothing more important than your health and then nothing more wealthy than your health and once you understand that you'll protect it cannabis protects it like a like wearing armor I think it's like you're wearing a shield we're done with it nothing nothing to protect you - you got cannabinoid all through you you know I just wish that the government can it wasn't restricting like for instance here in our country though I can grow weed and I can make oils that are extremely potent you know I can make you know how friends make 99 percent distillate we're still not allowed to sell it they're licensed producers they dull there's 90 corporations in this country none of them are allowed to selling anything stronger than ten milligrams of THC in a unit so I don't have a change to blow here what city this was a unit that I learned from them they wouldn't be allowed to have or depend on about for 30 milligrams OCD which is one dose for me was this is 99.9 I've read 99.5% I'm a 26 percent Sunni everybody does especially the Jason I researched a lot and so you know the average is with the average is why don't the cockroaches I usually start I do 25 to 30 milligrams three times a day and that keeps me off that's what I need and CBD I don't know what anybody else needs so I'm saying you know selling for 50 or 30 milligram bottles I would have to consume three of those a day my liver and my kidneys could withstand that good after watching that video you know I mean my liver disease is still here why just function better because I diet I'm a vegan or super [ __ ] the neurotic you know that about everything that consume now but if I went back to a normal person's diet I'd be hospitalized probably pretty quick collaborate and consuming three bottles of oil a day I assume who would about music pretty quick Wow is terribly when I think about that like you know I can't imagine being stuck on both sides you're never gonna go nope it is what it is I want to thank everybody does not dry out that today and I don't know how the Facebook thing's working but we're dying off slowly and that's to be expected but at the end of a show you can see there's a lot of leaves here for a reason is because we we've harvested a lot you know some nice purple ones and stuff and he never we talked about the autumn o'clock we've talked everything that that is canopy knees that is important today anyway hopefully everybody goes home with a little more our dictionary because the more we share that together the more we'll learn together and we'll look better the planet together failure to do so will allow all these aristocrats and all these the these real sharks these little gangsters if you have it that's why I see them anyway when you put a price tag on personal cancer then your debts are basically your not being your own right you know in the way that you're approaching making your money your ethical boundaries are our normal voice where those guys out there that working in the hundred I might have ten times the ethics that so many business sharks have coming in and say there's 90 companies or sort of over 100 companies now and under those hundred companies I'm hoping that the ones that are smaller they start to recognize how important a conduit to the community is and how important it is that you have somebody that can just pop up and get your information out there but at the same time make sure that their company is doing what was necessary for most importantly their medical patients first you know and to each their own different activists have different I mean there there's a lot of recreational activists and employed knowledge they've already they've already done their thing and you know they've been picked up and dropped down you know some are still working to who with big corporations again we medical patients are the ones that bought so we'll watch you're talking about medical so they want us coming it's quiet quiet that's why there's no compassion no she was just dispensaries and everybody's treated same and that's wrong I believe medical patients have to be treated different and if we don't if we don't do this together and we have to tell them but enough is enough you know anymore they tried during my third there's a province in our country one province yeah that word I wall - but cubics always been screwy they have their own medical system the last two different provinces that are that are just sites that in the cannabis Act so federal federal regulations that somehow you know a province can emit and only one province under the entire country emits and except for Quebec that's a problem you know I think that's something we have to look at and we have to look at what is a long term goal with this land or tenancy act and all the people also that they're doing there's people doing so all across this country from Clean Air Act's - no smoking in your in your building acts - you can be evicted if you grow a plant act that I don't know if they're constitutionally sound and I don't know if they're if they're necessarily evil I just know that they're there being imposed on people and maybe that's something that's better Sara same for another day but I'm gonna be jumping off here it's been a long straw I've had a good stability test and and that's really what matters to me for this show thank you carried away that tune game and the last one that we need to cut is this one here get into the freezer yeah see there it's just you know again you get these little ones out of the tent it's where I talk to they talk to I talk to you well what they want to grow in if that's the lowest yielding one you know out of the tent and that's just one planet and you can put well again what they're saying you killing people for it there but if you're medically you can put 25 in there so really these size pots geo pods you're gonna fit about 11 of them in there so if you want to grow appliance that baby Rove 11 up a minute in a five by five foot 10 and and and again it's not necessarily the number of clients that's gonna determine your yield it's also your the amount weight that you use and you have fun control factors that are a part of it anyway for everybody that came and joined out for the invite thank you and that was a test have a great weekend smoke them if you got a gun I know we're still around even though it's like 426 is like oh [ __ ] yeah anyway yeah happy hour 420 and it's Dillion 420 but what else is new with Karen lately would be gainfully however it is it is and it um come forward we got 420 coming up and and I think that's kind of kind of the next big event aside from these these these events that we're starting to see pop up at these clubs and there isn't they're good craft cannabis of events and other ones are not yeah that really it really does comes down to to that when I look at the island what's going on on the on Vancouver Island versus what's going on in Vancouver it's crazy the Vancouver Island's really late in ain't I born all right now and yeah well they're coming together as an island Iceman and United and if we can do that in every problems once again we can really make change but people are you ready for that but you need to be willing to plant your beat put your face in front of a camera and and ensure that information I mean you have to you have to literally do what I'm doing here I'm more talking about just in the general context of sharing the information make it table talk make it so that when you're at the table none of what you make it a point of educating someone new to the laws in this country and the global legalization efforts going on around the world that and it's being done in a compact in a fashion that monopolizing people and when you monopolize people it's one step from enslaving them well I know it's Jason Wilcox and thank you all for tuning in and with a to the next show", "e6xC0jzbJC8": "what up everybody Chris Brown with 420 central power buy cannabis capital trying the cherry cake today the cross is cherry thunder [ __ ] with NorCal glue amazing strand they come to try a couple hits let's break it up and see how it tastes all right everybody now that I've got this loaded I think I'm gonna take a rib and see if it is as good as I hope the flavor is rich with a cream like finish a little tangy at the very end as well amazing much better than anticipated I was hoping that the pie was gonna have me you know ready to go out and get some work done it's beyond that I'm actually ready to go out and finish the rest of my afternoon the the flavor actually created a little bit of a little bit of a unique taste in my mouth and created a little bit of

through how to grow I thought it was difficult first but it's not that weed it's a weed that's why they call it a weed it wants to grow honestly start off with the northern lies of wine light then as you shall stay strong indica strains start you off easy very easy very hard they I've nearly killed my friends before and brought them back and cropped hard you'd also caught up to 18 ounce in a one by one meter squared tent I actually copped fourteen and a half ounce when I squat here's some pictures of what you can achieve you can achieve this if you follow my method and I'll see you on the other side great people [Music] [Music] [Music] okay sobs Oh viewers UK mainly perhaps to piers prices and stuff can be uk-based right you seen those images I'm no expert trust me weed wants to grow if you're a beginner it's easy especially go for a strain both for Northern Lights it's so easy to grow it's a strong smoke it doesn't stretch much you get nice close-up bad so if you've seen the micros I mean you can crop up to 18 ounces in a one by one ten that the one that I've got is they're not quite 9 is 3 foot by 3 foot my second well the second grow images the images on there the one plan was about for in our fans so all right you've initial layout in England and this is buying from shops I my initial layout was about 300 pounds but that's buying it all from a shop online I'm sure you'll get it all for 200 good thing about Northern Lights don't need a carbon filter because it hardly smells and what it does smell of why this growing is almost why sweaty sweaty sort of socks and then you got a bit of a smile for the two-week period but you don't smoke tent very honestly you've got no worries on that respect and there's ways around it anyway so sad 250 pound payout and you're gonna be gonna cop if you follow up after you've got at least an ounce at least and if you use the market value what's that 2200 pounds and you've got all your care popery consumables go again you said top so I'd advise anyone to do it Norvin luck lies or as you'll see as a series progresses there's also a Hawaiian genetics from the grasshopper which is also indica dominant and very easy to grow I'm good and there's a bit of a surprise at the end but anyone who's starting up a Grove in the UK or Europe or anywhere actually it's about actual full beginner or beginner when they buy the care say let's set that ready set up I'll send you out some [ __ ] awesome Hawaiian genetics who's got a wine genetics in UK easy to grow I'll take you throw it with agro my friends got going on another place and yes so Northern Lights and Hawaiian light in a very easy to grow the hard years how I mean during my first boys I mistreated them you know forgetting to water I'm a limp and anyone that pops right back up honestly those things could survive a nuclear nuclear winter so that's why I suggest don't go for your hay strains and all right when you first start growing a yeast Gong Kenichi because they stretched too much they stretch too much you you won't get much yield the harder to grow the more disease prone so I'd go through an Endicott and I would go for Northern Lights or Hawaiian lightning yeah so what you're gonna need is you were you only die small but get yourself one by 1/10 in this shop I bought it from it with 70 pounds got a little nest here yeah you need a light reflector bulb which comes with you and what power by Lester should bake everything that sits next to ten and doesn't blow yeah electrics gets formed with what going up against 240 so yeah so you got that and it also comes with a three light and that was six three bulb bulb and that was sixty pounds some lamps have chained very important and Caribbean eclipses just how you gonna have it is clipped up to the top top bar of you ten you can have on long chains they'll board up so you can move it up and down the Caribbean Eclipse to wherever you want it exactly in that tent and you can move it across that way that way a little bit that way so yeah chains and carabiner Clips you can never have enough to times clip funds have got some over there for inside you turn this time here is the best time best time because you're not going to get any heat issues at all it's been perfect twenty three twenty five degrees in there now here mine new new method is one part in a one me to attend a big massive five or six gallon pot and train it old down and stuff but see you an absolute and I'd suggest three parts three free gallon pots by for pot five seeds hopefully you'll be popping Hawaiian lightning pop pop pop all five yeah plant floor and check which what you you will know pretty so much one's going to be once and then get rid of that and that be free in their make room for um yeah I'm go ahead of myself well you need to two times scorpion I use scorpion seven-inch extractor slash intake funds they're about 45 pound each so that's 90 you can have one blow in our end with duct in I do in an adapter so I'll carry it just just smiley on my window so it's sucking in fresher and then the extractor I also out going out the window well head and you know you don't need a carbon filter as well to know for life that's a good thing it doesn't stink like that doesn't stink like that I have to make those Northern Light yes I gonna didn't need a bag of Kanna because you don't use soil for it my this is my advice on you first go use canner kind of cocoa it's a lot easy easier in my opinion so you'll need a medium bag which is cheapness small bag of perlite perlite is absolutely crucial because those roots when they're going through they want the one air pockets one little pockets Italy and things and the perlite I can grip round and grow through so it sort of so there's a soilless so the cocoa is aerated really well drains well I mean without I said the difference of parallel without peril I looking at houses I use fake Sun I'll put a bit of little in tip a bit perlite and mix it up watch the clavicle yes come on do it again to get set up yeah you're gonna need just one five metre aluminium duct and I'll go to the other ammonium stuff pick it just pulls out 5 metres long now so you'll need that's all you'll need some duct tape obviously and adapters as well because you read that you a 7 inch adapter won't fit your ducting quite right so you need that you can get them in any DIY store Norwood adapt to the it even comes out even thinner that I put out show or window cord of a t-shirt soaking in the pressure all right and then your nutrients cannot go for cannot a it's kind of a and B same size bottles there last year couple of guavas you know same size bottles we'll get to the feeding measure in a minute video but same size bottles and a PK 14/15 booster that that won't be used until um flower so that that altogether cost you about 20 pounds all the things you'll need is a jerrican timers good quality timers clips you can never have enough clips yon duct tape and some sharp thermos all right so yeah get it set up get your [ __ ] seeds [ __ ] poppin get everything first voice I don't they see if I can get it all set up make is good you can and then yeah literally you'll be [ __ ] you've been one away if anyone but if any beginner that now wants to start grow I'll happily in the next few weeks three four weeks what again together the kit I'll happily send them some Hawaiian wine in Hawaiian genetic cross between Alaskan Thunder [ __ ] Thunder [ __ ] Alaskan from the book and the strong city but that's in the class that's about 50/50 good for the first time for our they have any views and show me great setup Verde boom I hope your hope you up my is you get mad missiles you've seen that I'm gonna leave you now I'll show you a few clips on the way out of what you need peace up big love to you New Glarus and UK keep it looking fresh honestly follow my series and you will [ __ ] you will crop what I've got cuz I'm no expert peace

Matanuska Valley area of Alaska according to the legend it was originally in northern california sativa crossed with a russian ruderal but sometime in the late 70s it was crossed with Afghani genetics to make it a little more Hardy ATF usually presents itself large beautifully frosted buds with incredibly strong odors of pine lemon menthol and spunk known for possessing a relaxing yet intensely euphoric eye it is also described as having a creeper effect as well as a pronounced appetite enhancement okay now under the cherry bomb cherry bombs a popular strain thanks to its reputation as a great hybrid that provides mild to moderate effects that are appropriate for daytime consumption the bright green flowers do take off fast giving many consumers that telltale pressure behind the eyes that it's usually the indicator of strong sativa buds to come the immediate effects are active and mentally alert bucking border on for some antsy the feeling tends to smooth into a more focused state that allows for a normal activity and may even help you to tackle that to-do list or the next creative project the genetics of the strain are dependent on which version you get but a popular variance is a cross between a California indica most likely with some stomp colony \u00e4j-- and a Hawaiian sativa that was created by breeders at Berry Farms cherry bonds flowers will have a musky berry aroma and a mild but similar flavor all right let's get into the breakdown for this particular product as I did say total THC of this product is eighty seven point five percent so it's nice THC content is

we have yet another strain you know the doctor travels to many places different times and experiences different types of strains that comes up every now and then today we have a strain called the fiery they say they mixed the fire og with tangerine so this is a hybrid we don't really have too many statistics I didn't lift that great I mean it looked like tangerine but it didn't look like tangerine nuggets that one would you know become accustomed to seeing and as far as the og element I mean it definitely didn't look like fire og I you know I really really don't know what to say by the looks but looks are deceiving as we all know it was it was kind of dry a little brittle not that bad but you know the breakup was easy I don't recommend a grinder because it might be a little bit too aligned and if you're rolling with one of our funky field tips then you know if it's too dry troop too brittle it might get clogged but I mean it was okay that it smelled okay it didn't really have necessarily that the the the og smell it had a little bit of tangerine but it was okay you know I don't know what to say too much that I'm a little skeptical on it but the doctor is always willing to give it a shot no pun intended so I'm just gonna light this [ __ ] up right here one more thing was it the Nuggets you know they weren't full not that too many City bizarre but this is a hybrid it's probably looked more sativa you know heavy because you know these nuggets were you know they were they were not up to par but like I said sometimes looks are deceiving smaller Nuggets can be more flavorful so we'll see right now doctor is disappointed firing I'll tell you what I had this moonshine shot to celebrate made in America [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] no matter maybe this fiery fire tangerine hybrid here was gonna be great but you know what here look I'll just do this because this is all this strain has worked well like that [ __ ] up on fire do it that way

I'll be leaving that down in the description below and it is 90 point 55 percent THC I hope you can zoom in and look at this all right it's a Graham pretty nice box I like that they put the little train with a pineapple in it always open it from the bottom easiest way stop struggling with the boxes and that's a seal at the bottom as a plastic tip at the top if it doesn't look like this it's not a ding vape and because I have to seal at the bottom has already been used that means you buying a used env always has C cell at the bottom okay and also a serial number if it doesn't have none of that or all of it at all and he's not a big big I'll be on the lookout for the fakes and if it's date dates official ordained its official account they're all real although if there are none of that than your faith let's try yourself all right it doesn't really have a pineapple taste to me it has a light pineapple taste with like a mango taste inside of it so it's like a pineapple mango flavor it's not just pineapple express it also does Ceylon the fact that it is a combination of pineapple in a mango flavor with apples and don't taste the apples in it but I do taste those other two the taste is really good if you like fruity if you like fruity flavors it's really good if you like more of a natural herb flavor then I would recommend like an Alaskan Thunderfoot or White Widow and all those other flavors that don't have a fruity name in the front let's try this out again for the high all right the high I give it like a six out of ten it's not that strong the Alaskan Thunderfoot was literally 90 point 79 percent I think and it was way stronger than this it was him so if y'all want something is like these packing a punch yeah I'm gonna get something else besides this I know

have for today is a lime sherbert and show you what we got right here this is like the very last about to fall out the very last of what we got I picked up a browser stuff yesterday and we're ready at the end of our dabs this is like the last of it so this stuff went by really quick anyhow um lime sherbert wonderful string it's an indica dominant hybrid and from what I found out the THC nose on this can get twenty-five percent and that's what a flower it's not for this sugar accent about the dab on but this is a really wonderful strain it's a cross between key lime pie and sunset sherbert and although i haven't had key lime pie before I have had sunshine server and it's a it's a nice straight on this this is another good strain as well really wonderful one of their stuff like anxiety and depression and stress pain relief was ass it was ok wasn't like the greatest thing but I found myself constantly medicating quite often for pain relief but as far as like the anxiety and the stress absolutely wonderful I think this is probably more for that than it would be for the pain relief I medicated with this throughout the whole entire day from wake and bake all the way to the evening time and for me I have to say probably evening time it would be the best in fact the the best I would think for this train is for like probably right after work especially if you're working a really stressful job you come home he sees your traffic you irritated agitated or frustrated you know if you if you're like just totally stressed out this is a good strain is kind of wash away everything settle the nerves you know round you out and just kind of wipe the slate clean and get you to kind of be able to enjoy what's in front of you without dwelling on stuff that's been stressing you out and dwelling on things that just there are little bring you down you know this is good for kind of boosting the mood kind of label yep it's often just kind of you know just forget about all that stuff that's that's bringing you down and he's got that's how it was for me and that's kind of what this string kind of seemed good for for me it didn't really seem like it was more for pain or anything but probably more for just kind of you know distressing and chilling out you know because it definitely did settle the nerves it kind of puts you a nice mellow mood you know the only thing is if he's solo strolling with this if you're hitting this hard it can make you lazy I Medicaid with a sort of day and I did take some big dabs and I had a very unproductive day this the kind of stuff is good for just whatever you can sit down whether it's watching movies and talking story hanging out you're playing games i kind of got kind of bored with you know i wasn't really into its kind of want to chill and relax if you want to put much effort into anything but you know being entertained by the TV the movies it's good for this kind of stuff I can't think of anything else other than like there I didn't experience any munchies the only thing that that still have to be watched the crash you know about lethargic that got lazy Kottonmouth was there but nothing too serious overall really wonderful strain but i don't think i would medicate with this throughout the day because just because it made me lazy this is a nice after work type of strain something to have on hand for like those stressful days maybe days you feeling kind of lean oh you're not having a good day this is a good string for that kind of stuff so we'll take us a nice dad I can't believe how fast this thing ran out then usually a gram of shatter can last like two three days it's the first time I've brown eye shadow just like one day it's a fastest disappearing shatter our head Lac does it say huh anyhow here's for the lime sherbert nice anyhow this is a nice train well I probably just keep this more for the evening time you know i medicate ways to of the day and I was just like even though it is a good date I me a good strength to medicate with if you've got stuff to do if you got responsibilities you might want to save this for after you're done with those things because at least for me it made me laugh RG kit made me lazy and and very unproductive and can't have that during a day time and I got way too much stuff to do so but the benefits for me I think that the store is the strongest was definitely for anxiety stress stuff like that if you just had it with the day you today I'm so done with today rattling of this strain it'll help you out but it's a good string man and I don't know if i buy it again because I probably wouldn't use it for anything other than like probably late at night you know most of my medicating comes in the daytime so i don't i pick this up again but i don't know if i would be good shrink they have on hand just for the just for like that getting rid of all the frustration and kind of wiping away your emotions you know clean you know fresh start kind of you know get you just not dwell on negative negative things you know I wouldn't say sometimes like you get into an argument or sometimes you see something that's kind of just kind of triggers you you know and it just kind of stays with you and it's in your mind or back of your mind this is the kind of stuff that kinda makes you forget about that and sometimes that's really needed man because negative thoughts they can bring you down they can take you from having a good day to having a bad day so it's good to keep those thoughts in check man and stay positive and this is a good string for that kind of stuff so overall it's a nice train but gotta use them wisely out pushing the evening time so anyhow wonderful strain it'll probably get this again uh if I need it", "AYHHFocrjcg": "[Music] welcome to wheat entertainment and there's been a lot of requests to try mojave cannabis or mojave reserve and i was able to buy it at two different dispensaries and today we're going to talk about something called mojave kush and you know it's i love trying new cultivators and i love trying new flowers and mojave reserve really has some as a cultivator some followers that really like them and people asking me all the time try it try it try it i haven't really got the fire strange yet i'm not sure about this string well i i am sure but i'm going to tell you in a little bit and uh but today we're going to check it out out of vapor cup so let me load my two little scoopers excuse me my one more scooper in here i've got two in there already mix three it's the same amount as a bong hit we're gonna tamper and we're gonna stick this down into the cup we're gonna talk about this flower so mojave kush comes in this jar and i got this at the excellence down in sun valley and i ran down there because they had cryptochronic by alien labs and i wanted to try that flower so a lot of times what i'll do is they'll have one flower that i really want to go for so i really pick dispensaries because of the strains they have and then when i go down there depending on if i have time that week i might buy a whole week's worth of flour so i have my picks and then i get blood tender picks and this was one of those flowers i just bought the two mojave reserve strains that they had so we're all excited to try it today um so we're gonna use it out of vapor cup i don't really see too much vapor in there yet i don't really know why you see that i don't see anything right but we're gonna check it out anyway we'll see what happens so here we go mojave kush by mojave reserve at a vapor cup at 330 degrees now this flower was very dry in the jar and it's crazy because it is still really smooth this flower has a really standard weedy og taste and it's crazy because you would think that these people that spend the money on this beautiful flower would put a boveda in these things even something maybe someone has to come up with a cheaper lovita pack because we want to keep our stash buds it's so important and i hope some of the cultivators that are watching the show realize that stash buds bring people back meaning you always got to keep your favorite stash buds and also this year i'm going to spend some time showing people how to make the salad you can take your stash buds and your not so good flour and mix them up to make flour better than the stash buds it's crazy i'm really good at mixing up flowers i have so many flowers i can mix them up and also your body can get used to one strain so mixing things up gives a little bit maybe more coverage of whatever's working because they don't really don't know why sunflowers are better than others they don't know but what did we think about mojave kush this flower was a totally enjoyable vape and as you can see i'm rambling this flower was strong enough it has focus and actually i like this flower i'm giving this flower a range i'm going to give it a 8.65 heavyweight and an 8.75 lightweight this is actually a strong flower with focus i liked it it's just so smooth and i want to try more uh flowers from mojave reserve they're doing a good job good job guys so if you can imagine if you're smoking a joint right over using vapor cup and you go the same time you're gonna see you use i don't know 10 times the flour and you're no more stone than you are from vapor cup with that just a little bit which is crazy i love this thing and you can get a vapor cup on vaporcup.com it is awesome telling you i'm so stunned right now i love this thing and you can get one on vaporcup.com i'm telling you there's no disappointment from the doctor i don't have any games man i'm a serious dude and i love this thing if you want to see my favorite picks you can see them on weedentertainment.com those are all my favorites i did a lot of work to make those lists enjoy them they have the heaviest the sweetest thanks for joining in if you have a tip for me leave it below the video i'm the doctor i'm back every day but sunday come join in leave me a tip party on my friends [Music] you", "Fh8yjfWA910": "[Music] sup guys sigh birthday 420 I've just gotten a daily hi clothes box it's a membership that I had myself and you get a glass piece every month for $29.99 a month it's supposed to give you your supplies for a41 right in this box this month's box is supposed to be pretty good I've been having some pretty good stuff but you know not very exciting let's see how this one is look at the front cover you should already give you an idea what the glass piece is gonna be glass pieces right here make that last the little bowl just to package it in to give you a little wax Mack never had one of these before this is brand new they're upgrading little by little they die cuts doing their thing they give you a blunt splitter from kingpin a raw clipper later bears where I've been getting all my clipper ladies look at this this is for Halloween this one's free this month is not really like anything new anything but it's wrong then we have a little doobie tube which a little sticker inside I have like six of these already and then we also have a pack of herbal wraps tobacco free xx pedal brushing cream like I said supply you for a month I don't think they'll last but they also give you a pack of raw papers brand new and maybe I can see in the jar it's a glass tip that says DHC we're gonna open it up they gave me one not that long ago it was Tommy Chong's but I lost it so this replaces my last one did it like I said guys it's $30 a month they give you a little card to see if you want a raffle to win a mega box which is like a huge box that gives you more than one glass piece and a whole bunch of supplies and then they give you two stickers and then if you like the stickers let me know I can give them out now let's see the glass piece all right you guys y'all ready look at this look at this that's a rocket bubbler he's a little Bowl in his little packaging to this bad boy right there I'm supposed to make you lift off then hey so since we already have it I have a little bit of some gelato right there kind of sprite this up a little bit let's see how this rocket hits not sharing this hole looks pretty small to put some water in but I'm not sure I want to put it - yeah I think I'm gonna put it through you all right perfect gelato breaks them down real quick got to do this the old-fashioned way always like it old-fashioned don't like it broken down too much turns into dust all righty see this is a straight hit you feel this view you milk this up I'll have you feeling pretty good but that finishes off the daily high clubs unboxing like I said I appreciate it daily I clubs good look out like it every time is upgrading every month is getting better but like my usual videos we're going into pain tapes alright usually I'm vaping my thanks on a vision spinner but sadly about a week ago from my last video I accidentally lost the battery and I stepped on it so I bent the tip of where the paint goes and I can't use it no more so I went into a lookout went on the website and I ordered this from whose is a twist slim pin preheat mode because with the charger already with it and suppose II the charger that is in here it automatically knows when to turn off when your battery is fully charged so it won't overcharge it so if you don't use this charger you're gonna gonna break your warranty guys save the charger don't use those cheap find all these charges from some friends little gas stations this ISO package pop it off in here because of this charge already screwed on you can mess with the temperature at the bottom you can spin it all the way to through 4.8 volts and the charger all righty the battery the battery looks pretty nice a little all at the bottom with the whole symbol has it on the little button as well and guys I got to think thanks today to ding beats today listening I have this one which is blue dream it was a request one 24/7 vape life thanks for the request my god I was able to get my hands on it here it is blue dream from Dean babes like always I think Bates official all organic no propylene glycol it also has a little story on the back I'll leave that down in the description and it's eighty nine point ninety nine percent THC this is an indica with a sativa so it's a crossing of an indica with a sativa and then I also have Jack Herer when dink Bates as well look at this that beautiful oil besides always out of a pink pigs official all organic no propylene glycol strolling on the back as well I'll leave Bolton down the description if you're interested and this one is ninety six point twelve percent THC this is a sativa dominant eye I messed with it because but you know for today I think I'm okay with uh sativa and they cuz make me want to go to sleep so we'll start off with the jack herer like always comes with a little seal at the bottom and I've always said guys if it's not a C cell it's not a dink vape also it's supposed to be a kosher tank has a little K at the bottom guys should be looking for these things and it comes with a clear plastic tip I guess is not glass is plastic and a good thing about these tanks is if you drop them they don't break as easy I've had a brass knuckles it broke after a job to like twice these I dropped them a couple times they just pick them back up on they're burning like like new let's see how this goes yeah let's taste it without hitting it without actually burning it how's that go and I can't say it's not piney it's like grassy like earthy herbal kind of teas I'm sure but it's it's not sweet at all like it's not anything I'm used to vaping but see how the highest all right off the bat the hits pretty strong it's really potent but it doesn't taste anywhere sweet it has a grassy horrible taste you wouldn't need much to be feeling lit on something like this it's 96 percent is about the highest I've ever had I am I've had a king Louie it's like 95% but this one to me it was the highest egg I've got my hands on it's 96 let's try one more thing all right I ain't joking you ain't smoking but if you can get your hands on it I would recommend it so me I'll give it a 9 out of 10 cuz I'm I'm already feeling pretty good I'm not even sure if I'm gonna make it through the blue dream after this but let's go on to the next one like I said guys I've been getting database a lot I got one brass knuckles I probably won't even go back after these kids done the blue dream like I said it was a requested video so I'm combining them both right here this is oil here's a seal so Cecil as well like I said all of them are the same this battery is way better too it's like the perfect battery to be burning the soil the hits bigger this this one it was good it lasted longer this one doesn't last as long but the hit when you burn it is way better than the vision spinner all right let's see how's that go a blue blueberry taste but then it has like a date taste as well like you actually taste it in there see how it is all right this one as well it's pretty good I would say if you can get your hands on it as well it does have a sweeter taste in a Jack Herer which is this one and it's even less potent than a Jack Herer but it's I think it would be one of my favorites I'll give it an 8 out of 10 as well flavor a 9 out of 10 has a blueberry type of flavor not sure what other flavor has inside it but it's pretty good like I said guys stay tuned this will be in my next video don't forget to Like and subscribe [Music]", "5MYARvEm3pU": "this episode is brought to you by blitz bongs calm go to their website and use promo code you do 5 hey everybody welcome to another episode of YouTube thank you for joining me 9 my name is Bud so today we have a strain review pretty excited about this one this one is called della haze from San Rafael the total THC is twenty point three zero percent a percent THC that is huge and then CBD is zero point zero one so this is very much a high THC version also it is a sativa as you know other sativas and indicas and then there's hybrids I'm sure this is mainly like a hybrid because a lot of a lot of sativas aren't true sativas anymore because then the growing phase for an indica is shorter and so it's just easier produced so they do hybrid versions anyway so again delle haze I'm going to show you kind of what this bottle looks like there you go I really think maybe I should rank later but no I'll rant first these big plastic containers that are the government approved versions and there's like like okay how much is in this not very much like what a waste of space what a waste of container in plastic I think some stores even the like not all of them are still illegal in in British Columbia there's a lot that have popped up illegally still but they are trying to do it right by paying their taxes and stuff but some places are starting to create these drop-offs where you can go to the store and send your empty containers and they will ship it back the company for you so they can reuse them which i think is a good idea your roadside recycling pickup they'll take it to but you know a lot of that stuff just gets thrown in the landfill so I think really they got a look at better packaging for these things it's a natural plant put it in something a little bit more matte natural I mean you could make hemp packaging and that would be pretty cool okay anyways let's get to it whoa this one is very very citrusy almost bubblegum like in a way like that juicy fruit style bubblegum nice okay really small buds like look at these things really small buds again that could just be the producer I'm sure a lot of growers can grow nice big juicy buds of this stuff but you never know anyways I'm gonna put it into this nice grinder here it's magnetic which I really like and let you know what I think about this stuff it's already got a beautiful nose without being ground up so let's try try getting some of these oils out from some of those sorts of things here we go Brian's really smoothly and easily okay there you go well kind of turns in to a powder though it's like look at that it's pretty much just like a powder because kind of dry not gonna lie dry okay maybe I shall grind a little bit more up just so it's not such a powder yeah we'll see okay there we go zigzag whites those are my fav the nose really breaks up some of the oils it's really a little bit more like lemon need - all kind of a smell but not chemically by any means nice and oily and citrusy I like that okay here we go and you guys you viewers out there I know that uh hopefully you're starting to buy from some legal places and get your your marijuana from legitimate sources but I want to hear people's opinions on this because you know a lot of the time there's been shortages across Canada there's been kind of not amazing actually you know I suspect in British Columbia to have one of the higher rates of sales you know lots of sales happening in British Columbia but I think a lot of people are still just kind of going to the person that they originally got it from because like or just you know black market dealers or what happened whatever you want to call them they saying that always makes it sound like they're just such evil people but half of the time that people have like one guy that's their best friend or a good friend that they get it from all the time and they don't really sell any other drugs and they're just into man-up marijuana cause it's like it's it's a culture it's a part of our culture it's been a part of our culture for hundreds of years but of course you know in the last 100 ish years it's been frowned upon which is the total total misconception of what it can do for you anyway let's go for this we're gonna put that later okay let's try this out I like to kind of just burn the tip without sucking it in first just let it kind of light naturally because sometimes if you suck it in too hard at canoes and goes all one down one side so that's nice here we go oh yeah mmm beautiful flavors Wow it kind of comes out a little bit more floral on my taste here we go mmm this tastes really really nice for being so powdery and fine I thought you know it just burned really quickly or just light up and just go but if you roll them tight enough like this is tight you can get them to burn for a little bit longer especially when they're really dry and powdery but the flavor on this some of that citrusy oiliness is coming through it's a little bit more earthy earthy tones on the flavor the nose is quite potent really nice I'm instantly you know a couple minutes into this feeling good already it's a sativa it gets me motivated it gets me moving along I'm going on a big trip coming up soon so I'm going to probably pack after this but and again this is a huge amount of THC in here what did I say third twenty point three zero percent that's a nice high number I'm gonna have one more okay beautiful okay I'm ready um so far really like this stuff complaining about the packaging but that's not that cannabis this fall as a strain itself I'd highly suggest go out and find it if you can go on to whatever your provinces website is ours is the beast basically the BC liquor distribution branch is teamed up and is now the cannabis distribution branch as well but check out their products on their website they have a lot of really great information they have a lot of good information on kind of flavors and feelings and prices and how to go slow with it and if you're a beginner with smoking cannabis kind of what to expect it's it's so well put together website so if you have one in your province please check it out or if it's legal in your state I'm sure you have something along the same lines um anyways my name is bud thank you for joining me click like subscribe and I'll comment back when I can and we'll see you next time peace [Music]", "r5C6HtI9iSo": "yo wassup she

to steady it up so we have some cheese hash right hey we'll just get right into it it's a sativa dominant hash it's 60/40 as it says on the label this hash is really really in small little chunks so there's not really like a big kind of piece to look at but there's um a lot of lighter colors in this I know the Lighting's not too great earlier but um it's a mostly like a light brown kind of a color when it's compressed together it gets this a lot darker looking I don't want to like you can't really see the lightness of it but it's really not as dark cuz it's coming out on the screen but the smell from this is incredible the cheese on the smell is so strong I've never smelled the hash that smells so much like the strain when it's already been turned into hash so I'm really excited to get into smokin this so I'm gonna be holding the camera ever got guests blowtorch and going on torch that [ __ ] Charlie doing work on the toy like what the [ __ ] is that go first sonic go hell yeah

the foreseeable future so this week on perfect androgyny our theme and subject are the seven deadly sins now can you guess which one I am go ahead now guess so I decided to pick a wrath from my deadly sin and today I'm gonna be discussing how that plays a part in my everyday life I mean you [ __ ] can probably tell I'm pretty [ __ ] laid-back but I actually do struggle with wrath quite a bit and the wrath of scarlet starlet no doubt manifested itself in the form of my perfectionism I'm a very dedicated worker I always have been once I do something I'm committed like 110 percent also always pushing myself to do better and that kind of like degree and level of perfectionism can be really hard to put up with it proves problematic in group settings you know I'm an artist [ __ ] and artists work better alone it's just how it is you know I'm really lucky because working with perfect and Raj we're like all perfectionist so luckily my wrath has not been an issue up in here at all yeah that's kind of really the only way I can think to tie rats to my everyday life because I mean you [ __ ] see me I'm really chilled and laid-back and I like to be fun and just have a good time but when

so get a bit for me to eat normally I'm not I don't do that but uh this stuff stuff just that good I couldn't I couldn't pass it up so here we go ahead and check it out it's four grams looks like more than four grams right look at that just one big [ __ ] up bunch of nuts huh check down and look at that thing I beauty min looks [ __ ] chunk let me give you guys something to compare that to kick that dude out i'll put some exit i'll post pictures today i'll post more pictures on the old twitter so for those of you that have been been enjoying knows whatever keep keep an eye out later on Pied i would say probably maybe like 10 minutes or so after i load the video i would say check to check the twitter and awesome posters some posters some [ __ ] pictures posted um I'll do his headband pulling on the Martian mean green i posted i actually did I went to a different collective earlier this week I'll get to them said let's do this mmm love that Martian mean green smell man smells almost like melons and a little bit of a like a little bit of a green crack to it as well look at that four grams right there man bang stuff pretty nice dent give you guys another comparison here so the bug girl is almost similar to the headband but the smell is definitely not man it's got a great smell to it this vote for just thought what's what we're gonna review today do the Martian mean green so check this dude out Thank perfect little nub set up for us right there so without further ado Oh before I forget I went to the sea and sand collected in Sunset Beach played spin the wheel and want a free lighter it was cool collected I picked up some I picked up three grams well there deal with for the first time patience but you get a free gram as long as you spent 20 bucks from yeah twenty bucks with it and so I spent they have this their special older what two grams for 35 bucks which is normally a little bit more than I like to pay but after looking at the selection I you know I was I didn't really have the K that's a really good [ __ ] for those of you that live in huntington beach Seal Beach oh do this [ __ ] drop test here I've been neglecting it for a while wait for those you that are in Sunset Beach seal beach huntington beach i'm sure you guys but I already know about this place so I'm not going to bore you with it but uh for those of you don't check out the weedmaps they don't they don't post their menu which is rather strange but I read enough the reviews that I was comfortable enough with going there to very small place is literally right on the beach it's right on the corner of I think if there's like a jacket I beach and PCH I think there's a there's a jack in the box right on the corner as well so but yeah check them out 15 255 cap all their 55s are pretty [ __ ] pretty [ __ ] strong can you find them cheaper yeah you can find that [ __ ] a little bit cheaper i picked up grandma some short bus bubba a grandmas and larry OG and i got free grandmother blue dream and i must say that their blue dream is [ __ ] the blue dream is probably better than the short bus and the larry and and the blue dream was the free one the blue dream is what i got for going in so i think they said that was up either 50 or 40 58 or you know if you wanted an 82 the blue dream so said for those of you arm around there check out the sea and sand collective so uh alright without further ado we're gonna do some this Martian this long beach mean green so without further is a heady sativa I'm supposed to be so it's good trying to catch my ship here okay the taste comes out just let the smell it's got like a spicy this angle Gina said no dankness I don't say like a like a spice me with a tinge of like a melon of some time oh the melon really doesn't come through in the smoke but the spiciness does kind of like it a jak spicy in my opinion not not quite as Extreme as like the stupider OGE or for that matter just some regular Jack but if you try to know the path on top you know I'm going down here you kind of kind of will kind of get the idea of what this smells like it's a floral e spicy with um you know in the hit comes off real clean and it's got that spice to it and I can feel it it's this is a supposed to be a straight sativa it's supposed to be very little in the ten that's probably like an 8020 or something supposed to be the real deal they were really high on this stuff and this is actually one of the first rains when I got my card that i bought at the high quibble I think it might even Bend up the first training that i ever got from a hike wiggle except it wasn't long beach mean green it was just the regular marsh and lean green so um i'm happy with them i'm stoked with it i'm glad i got some more headband who knows maybe I'll shoot up I'll shoot a review up of the headband i know i've already done some headband before but I said these past couple batches of the headband have been flying out of the door to quibble the guy in fund me today in line with picking up an 8th to the eighth to the headband as well so 445 an eighth and four grams you're not going to find any better headband than this unless you're getting it you know straight from the homie this March means being is partly talking the last long i would imagine it it usually doesn't come around very often it it's a it's not it's not a way Khalid I does it produce a lot from the plant so that there's not a lot of people grow on it because you know you got a gross shitload of plants just to come up you know what you can with one plan of indica or whatever so he said if you're looking for some some really good marks and mean green Pete this is a good sativa and the headband is definitely a good end at us huh towards that man I'm I'm feeling it I'm definitely it's definitely Dominic says first smoke of the day but nice and relaxing feel Goodman so as you can tell and I can even tell him myself have kind of slowed down and I can I can actually feel my eyes dilate a little bit so [ __ ] yeah all right [ __ ] I'm a piece of [ __ ] out oh [ __ ] having happy Memorial Day to everybody and rest in peace march omentum when we Xenia peace

label me which deals with a Syrian refugee and his special relationship to a German where did that story come from for you how did you get where do that story originated from in Germany I work with the LGBT refugees and LGBT youth and that's when I stumbled across the issues that LGBT refugees in Germany have especially in their shelters when it comes to their identity how can the I didn't feel about your film if you want to find something out about the film you can just go to my website koat.com slash label me 2019 and there you can find every information about the film that we have I can't wait to see it and congratulations thank you I think it you know it's really friend event only but you know one of you I hear about it I could be there do weirdly spokesperson I guess cuz up with dried Jordan but news TV is our outlet up Jennifer I grew up in Los Angeles so I know what it afforded legacy circuits and focuses had last and I'm so glad this documentary is out and it's got such great it was that Tribeca and talks a little bit I just wanted everybody to know that doesn't know that's not in LA about circus a book that why it's important well I never thought it was important it was just a business that we ran and we just ran in for a lot of years we didn't start it and the film says a lot of why it's important I mean the film takes what we did and puts it into a context that we never ever considered we were just being good business people for all those years you know what impact it did make on people's lives by the way I love every interview I see of you I think I just I'm watching you like your own little show Rachel Rachel says about me is I have no filter so their journalists but imprint so in French everything can be edited this live stuff is complicated so make me young and thin absolutely how was I'm so glad that your daughter did this by the way and how is that I was working with your daughter though I was I know I like documentary film but the only reason I agreed to do it was because most documentary films are not seen and I assume this one wouldn't be either that this is a big time for documentary film I mean for documentary film in general I wish it was about somebody else which is a nootropic writers very interest it's very complicated to live a long life and figure out what you're doing but I didn't think it was all of this the movies very good by the way I agree with there's no way but I just wish it was about somebody else I think it's a part of Los Angeles history that will touch people universally just a lesson to people to never figure out what their kids are gonna do because [Music] I'm Rica okey I'm one of the writers and stars a transform it I'm Neela woman I'm the writer and director of trans minute writer of one of the seven short films Nova I am blossom C Brown I'm an actress intransitive hi I'm Davey of Spain I'm a writer of two shorts and trans minute and an actor of one you have seven shorts what how did you bring them all together and figure out to do like one that would go together cohesive well the my favorite word to describe this process is organic it was very community-oriented I said once I had the idea to make the film I reached out to my dear dear friend DLO who has been doing the work in the community for over two decades now and all through the West Coast and I was like I need to find six other trans people of color writers once I had the writers fall in place I had a wonderful trans woman of color DP who signed up to the project and a trans man of color stefano gonzalez who signed up immediately there was there was such an enthusiasm to have a platform like this to give to create as part of a team once pieces started falling together it was actually a very smooth sail through the process and bringing making it cohesive it was really i'm a designer and an engineer in my other life yes so I'm like and I want animation and I want visual effects so it's kind of it it just happened hopefully Outfest will help get us distribution distribution yeah yeah that's what we want is like enough visibility here at the screening so that we get picked up for distribution yeah yes was amazing right well I wrote one yeses things in the work for the future but I wrote one and then Neelu asked me to come on and another one so I was more than happy to do that because my experience with the first one was so good that I was ready to write a second one that nobody was like which I'm thinking like which episode was it like no yes I was in nova idea and it was such a great character to play this is actually my first film that i've ever acted in you know coming from like reality TV and stuff like that and making a transition over to this it was really really incredible because i got to be around such great talent i got to learn a lot and so hopefully this will be the door for more great opportunity you know i'm motivated i'm inspired and so you know this is a very important project because people really need to see that but really need to see us in our true selves they need to see the issues that we go through and i think this film laid all that foundation for that and i'm just so grateful to be a part of an amazing cast to be under such great direction from Neelu like I'm just humbled and grateful so humble and grateful Rikka right I remembered Rica my good friends is Rica it's not a common name a good name tell us a little bit about your wrong so my my statement is called Asura and I'd play a come martial arts superhuman grandmother so we they made me they look they made did a beautiful job of making me look older and it was so nice because a lot of times the trans quick we will has to transfer me you don't think of getting old you know a lot of us just die because we do and so the you ask what my superpowers sometimes just being a grandmother and being able to provide wisdom towards towards the next generation and a lot of this a lot of us that's kind of all we want to do too we want to be able to pass things on so you know we were just joking we're 3 trans women of color in the same movie none of us died it was amazing color because we need more of that and I hope this is just the beginning of many things for our all of you which I believe it will hear the good group here group and I'm excited I've already heard a lot from Justin about this project and I've been excited to see oh don't worry hopefully he'll track me down I already I have I told to make my book it says really big on this that's Saturday just remember to go to its heroes no way you've never seen them yet thank you appreciate they were to read I was like this to its head I'm Jennifer this is Breanna guys can you introduce yourself and why you're here this year at Outfest absolutely my name is Rodrigo Bella I'm from Bolivia and I'm here for the world premiere of my thumb to my monk it's a film based on my first novel who became that became the best-selling story because there we have no gay or lesbian or LGBTQ literature there and it's about gay suicide in my country and so it's a it's a book that already changed and touch a lot of lives so we're hoping the movie is going to have the same effect I want to see the movie but read the book as well the movie the book is in Spanish unfortunately so the book is only sold in we actually just got an offer from Amazon to sell it in Spanish but hopefully we are negotiating it's going to be a Broadway show next year so hopefully after that is going to be an English version of the book I'll be at the Broadway show cause my mother is obsessed with Broadway every single show we go do oh yeah I was brought up on it so literally every show we're there that's not amazing and I love that I love just that you did it cuz yeah you don't hear about the LGBT community in Bolivia ever and if there's a suicide epidemic like that something that really touches my heart every country talking about it and that's why I took this big journey at five years and saying okay I'm gonna take something do something right how can we find you on social media if people to know more about we have a you're starting already campaign for the movie it's called pel\u00edcula tu me manques and i'm believe in both so you can find me as bolivia involved on instagram and pel\u00edcula tu me manques on facebook and on

K this is a half gram of it and it's some of the best wax I've had in a couple of months I'll be completely honest you see actually just close it I don't know why I did so let me just get a DAB here I guess I could come in close I'll show you guys what we got going on here focus there we go cool no just a car driver pick a dab so it's hard to like keep this in frame and skew myself a down but I think that's gonna have to do all right cool yeah over here put that lid on there I'm not gonna put it all the way on there but just in case I want anything flawed in there that would not be good so since it's the Claire I'm gonna have to hold it I can't really set it down for too long or it might drip off so I so I'll get right into it I think they were obtaining this torch I hope you guys are

local grown snow cat it is a very very good snow cat but it doesn't vary it trimmed up very well but yeah it isn't trimmed really well I'm gonna be trimming this up and I'm gonna be using the trimmings to make a extraction how-to video but yeah this here is the snow cap you can see the really really light orange hairs really forest green color this is a greenhouse cut of snow cap and you can see the leaves are still really long but I'm gonna show you guys these after I trim him up but I'm just showing you these before so you get an idea so what they look like before inside you could see just a real contrast between the orange and the green there's um I can't really see it there's a lot of frost coming in here actually I think there's this little mode on my camera no no that's gonna work out maybe it's gonna look like [ __ ] actually and I know this stuff by the way I don't know if you guys eat there it's really really smoky I mean smoky frosty the trikes aren't really gigantic and they're not leaping off because you know I got out there but but there's a lot a lot of crystals in here there's really wild formations I can't wait to show you these guys these when I'm done trimming them but they're really really tight nugs it smells and tastes exactly like Jack Herer if anyone knows anyone's had that before this is a good comparison for it it's definitely just a outdoor indica but it's like a Jack's counterpart pretty much like its indica version of Jack and taste and smell are basically exactly the same it's really piney and citrusy smells just like a pine forest like right when you walk into a forest of like pine trees is exactly what it smells like it's really really sweet really outdoorsy really crisp smell smells like like wintertime trees pretty much that nice wood like wet woods smell it's really really nice as you can see the leaves are still falling off under the table you still really leafy they're pretty long I'm gonna be trimming these up and yeah but I've read trim them up I'll take that all the trim and turn it into a how-to video and there'll be something else but I'll recut this video with the notes and they're all trimmed got a good bit here a few ounces of it to trim up so we should get a good bit of concentrate out of these and I can't much shade these legs when they're done because they're gonna look a lot cleaner I said trust me so cut to now okay hey guys it's getting kind of late I'm not playing any music and watch this to me but I have finished trimming the two zips this one's all trimmed up I don't have to get to see it I'm not gonna take it out of the bag these ones are all trimmed up this is my chin that got left over and you'll be seeing this guy I'm gonna be returning this to miss them oil wax butter we'll see what it turns into in another video I'm gonna make right now and offload later oh how to on pho making these are the scissors I use just super they're curved so they can kind of curve away from the plant they don't cut in too deep and they're really short so it takes a little while to cut the plans but it does a really good job as you can see before they were super overgrown now now you can see they're really really tight nice orange hairs coming through yeah I don't know if you see the crystals but it's really sparkling out there deep in there there's a lot of try coverage I didn't even know it until I started cutting these but there's an amazing amount of tri coverage inside there they just Sparkle right up when you shine light on them it's a really really really good snow cap smells really coming out now it's a lot sweeter now it's all the leaves kind of cut off lost a little bit of the paynus a lot more of the sweetness coming through and nice nice example of snow cap don't really know what else to say I kind of said a bit and the other one but we're gonna take a little snap of it right now and this stuff is super head heavy it's just a knockout head dome and just killer indica really good outdoor indica you can see these long the nugs are nice pointy really fat dense rock-hard nugs can't squeeze them at all but yeah just nice son made send me I just love the smell of this stuff you can take a small cabin trying to find a little and nugget that's why I hate about the gas bags this little snap sighs now use nice little baby Doug I left some little smaller Doug a little bit more wild because we start cutting up some more nugs he just fall apart watching a little Chicago code I'm a famous watch dude had a good openness had a great opening show shitty like second third of course show and that kind of started getting better stuff boo boo boo boo makes music it's getting kind of late took me a while to cut those legs up but I was smoking with my friends and [ __ ] a good bit just gonna put a little bit you know bullet hole took this up I'll tell ya about it so I'm really faded now I've just spoken with my friends got nice and baked homegrown snow cap [Applause] you're doing it really nice and sweet on the flavor really sweet on the flavor a lot of the Piney nish goes away in the flavor it's really most of the that's sweet aroma that comes off it that Jack Herer aroma that many very familiar with a lot of people that don't get snowcap lots looks like a California strain and releasing in other places but still caps really popular here we had jig one Jack they all kind of taste and smell the same this is spot-on just a great great snow cap really really heady feel it a lot in the top of my head it's really slows down just so real relax are nice great in the night bud and yeah some good stuff and I hope you guys like the next vid that's coming up I'm gonna making some some butane honey oil turn it and some sexy little or some butter

birthday 420 we're back with a new video today I have Bank Bates watermelon 1.1 gram look at this new box they're all black now every single box they have now is black bother other ones we the other ones I used to have the long ones there those are gone has a shiny paint vapes label in the front at the top at the bottom and also a ding dings official account all organic no propylene glycol it does shine as well and guys you have to be able to feel this bump out from the box as well as the name in the name in the back it has to bump out you can see the C cell has like a laminate shine it is 93 point 43 percent THC still has a story on the back I'll put that down in the description below and also sorry my nose a little bit runny been kind of sick it has like a light watermelon slice like you can just see the little emblem on there you probably can't see it on here get this oil still has this the round plasti tip at the top and to seal at the bottom if it doesn't have a seal already being used it is cease okay percussion a CA 4 7 8 serial number my camera probably won't catch it I'll just put an image burning it on my battery but to me is probably the best concentrate battery out there I also burn it at a 3.3 volts I would recommend it instead of burning your all the two on the high voltage just keep it on the lowest one which is three point three for me but if you can't just three point six is fine I just don't do it because it burns my oil to quit let me prime this bad boy all right off the bat Bing babes literally what you put on the front is what this is tasting like it tastes just like watermelon guys like if you went to the farmers market bought a watermelon came home cut it up and ate a slice it does for some reason have a great flavor a very light grape flavor in it but I don't know why it's there I don't know if they try to get it to the flavor to get it more like spot-on or what but I taste great for some reason okay just like watermelon guys just like the fruit the only thing is that light grape flavor I don't know if it's just me but I taste it like it's there and if you were to go to the store I don't know if you ever seen it it was these little watermelon candies that have like the shape of a slice it literally tastes just like that and it's delicious like spot-on flavor ten out of ten off the rip hi I feel it a little bit not too much I'm up I'm woke I'm happy it's probably a sativa like hybrid sativa I'm not sure I don't think the box says it either let me see oh it's an indica strain well I don't feel tired yet it's probably gonna feel it later when I'm hitting it during the day but let's see let me feel it hi again down strong okay my chest is killing me for right now it killed my chest now I'm really feeling it I feel tired I feel really lazy and tired at the moment like the coffee in the big hit I just took it got me it's an indica first I wasn't feeling it now I am it's really delicious though the hi guys ten out of ten I don't give them ten out of ten down often usually eight seven sometimes this one is a ten out of ten I'm really feeling it like I'm baked this is this is like a high that I get for like pacing like a blender teeth in two hits that's crazy really good if you can if your plug has it or if you can get your hands on it I definitely recommend it ten out of ten on everything the oil has to look right look at this if it's dark and it doesn't look go to guys don't buy it's fake they can probably just be swapping the tanks the real tanks in the box for a fake thing you have to be looking out for that

Alaskan fender [ __ ] man so yeah you got another nugget right here but I had to pick up a quarter guys cuz this is one of our strains you don't know like it's not one of the ones you just gon find all the time so I found it on Leafly you know I was mostly a league match type of guy you know I was just not leading there's looking at this and that but one thing I didn't like about weed maps it's the fact that they didn't show you recreation or medical like so you would just show up to a dispensary I mean obviously you can call them birds they give you their number so I would just call first I showed it to at least one dispensary like ready to order you know Maui wowie pineapple Express all of that and it was a medic alone but yeah anyway let me find take this next hit idea that's like a I don't know man I don't know it's hard to explain they're trying to you know I got a lot of your summer you know take my time trying to analyze the flavor but you got three viewers on YouTube one viewer on Instagram so I appreciate y'all checking in with me seeing what we got going on like I said I don't think I don't know if the chat working you can try to pack something in there but as well now I can't see anything so if you have said something in the chat and I haven't you know ready that's because I can't see but you followed me on his Instagram one two one two I am live on there as

out to my boy Kate please he was there I had to go downstairs and buy a bottle of - yeah along with best I've ever had in my life but yeah it was quite an adventure but I decided that it would be better to just go to Walmart get help pack for like for like a extra other act 31 more bottles of water and yeah we said but only downside about heating it up without that in the herb isn't all Polly you know you're not at the fool the optimal vaporization temperature I guess you could say but she just give it a couple seconds like you as you can see now I start to really pick up all right well

video bang I couldn't leave you guys without the let me know what it tasted like cuz after the last video I kind of uh opened up the jar and it kind of the scent kind of got into my nose and so I said [ __ ] it so this is a little nugge we're gonna row so I'm not gonna puff up or down and I already did that in the fandom video so if you're really jonesing for me to dump it out go to the O go to the fan emoji video and you can see it in all its glory oh okay alright so without further ado San Fernando Valley Oh G and for some of you that are watching this video that are not from California San Fernando Valley is best known for the porn capital of the world so this little arm Long Beach [ __ ] factoid for you cuz I'm gonna do a job test don't let me forget here we go like I said this stuff has got like a Kim dog planetary gonna stick you with them fifty stinky yeah like I said it's it's right up there with the rest of the oh geez that you've been smoking so I can smell it from way over here and feel it on my hands if you can see my hand sorry this is not the same beer the beer number DOS so apologize Stella Artois if you did see the thing like said always I'm gonna picture I posted phantom video first but always watch the previous video just in case there's more likely this one's like a part two so you always want to watch the oldest one first alright with that being said to me as ramble in the [ __ ] on we're gonna do the same Fernando Valley Oh Gina oh by the way I just just kind of throw it out there just tell if you got t-mobile and so many [ __ ] hates on you imma let you know something I was a t-mobile user or whatever the subscriber for almost six years since pretty much since Jump Street from them right and my contract came to an end up two months ago right so I kind of got this wild hair in my ass [ __ ] you know I kind of want to kind of want to go somewhere else change change carriers change kinky did get anything falling out still rocking little flip phone ship so I ended up going with AT&T and I didn't get sucked into the iPhone thing and my main thing with the iPhone is no not the whole stupid deal with not be able to get insurance on it and and just I'm not really big you know Typhon so I really didn't go to 18 T for iPhone I just kind of up to 18 t you know kind of for a change you know they had some really polyfoam so I end up going with the HTC Inspire the phones the [ __ ] the phone is the business the phone is without a doubt the best one I've ever had but the [ __ ] service att's phone service is the worst ever I think in six years of t-mobile I had maybe a dozen drop calls or you know at points where I can hear myself or you know I lost when I lost the car so maybe maybe twice a year that would happen it seems like every other phone call with AT&T is garbage unless you're calling somebody else who has AT&T which is then then you're looking at about an 80% chance of it just rockin on but then there's also still a chance it's gonna [ __ ] up some somewhere down the line or right off the bat so if anybody out there has got t-mobile and you've been hated on I was hated on not remain not really just by some friends and stuff hating on a stick they call it a stripper phone they talk T Mobile stripper phones so to all you guys out there who were rockin the t-mobile cheers [ __ ] this one's for you I wish I was back there but I'm stuck with this [ __ ] for two years so look that said that little rant out of the way here we go is that vog don't a big way more expansive than that then family taste matches the up the smell for sure definitely though that's um it's got a nice little lock to your throat definitely very definitely expensive definitely I'm definitely saying it's right up there what now I'm not gonna be able to really tell you how the high end because I'm still hiding a little bit but in this drink but I'm definitely going to tell you that all right was just at one point and now I feel like this doesn't like I feel like I'm oh this is like a know like a sativa think five minutes ago I saw like I was kind of like leaning a little bit you don't want the indica but right now I feel like this is like a moralistic this is a guy like I said it shot us a tee way you know so props to the hike wiggle we'll shout it out at a 15 and gram 4584 grams on Thursdays so we don't talk out with that three-point talk [ __ ] we wait till Thursday so anybody else's cat [ __ ] throw up and then eat it again my cat does that and it has no problem I mean he eats it all backed up everything am I
